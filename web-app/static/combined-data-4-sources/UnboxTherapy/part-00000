shall we make a movie today so as you're well aware there is a brand new iPhone actually a few of them they're gonna be hitting the streets real soon and you've got a bunch of questions about them I did too so I did a bit of research in order to figure out some things that you should probably know before you get yourself either an iPhone 8 an 8 plus or of course the iPhone 10 the fanciest of the bunch now one of the things that I discovered about those 3 devices is the fact that they will support quick charging hooray this of course is a feature that many of you are familiar with that are on other devices and what it means is you can plug in for a very short period of time and get a large charge large and in charge now Apple went ahead and quoted a 30 minute charge time on the iPhone 10 would yield 50% of overall battery life yes that is the magic of quick charge plug-in and then go but here's the thing it's not so simple if you've had various Android devices you may have gotten used to the idea of receiving the quick charger in the box along with the phone so you could take advantage of that feature straight away that's not gonna be the case with the iPhone 10 eight and eight plus they will ship with the traditional tiny little five watt Apple power brick this guy here so you'll still be charging and ultra slow speeds if you just use what's in the box there is an advantage to this and that happens to be the scale of it it's absolutely tiny now you'll notice that on the table I have a few different products in front of me this here is a MacBook Pro power brick USB type-c connector on it if you connect the new iPhones 8 8 plus or 10 to this power brick you're gonna quick charge you have plenty of juice here to enable quick charging but the brick itself is not enough because you probably know that the iPhone features a lightning port not a USB type-c port like this power brick has all Apple high powered power bricks are now type-c so you're also gonna need this cable right here if he USBC to lightning cable this will take this port this output here and turn it into something that your smartphone that your iPhone can handle in the form of a lightning connector now these two boxes they look relatively simple you might be thinking hey that's not gonna cost me too much well it will of course it's gonna cost you a minimum of $70 to get the correct cable and the correct power brick from Apple just to take advantage of quick charging now you don't need to get the MacBook Pro power brick if you don't already have a MacBook or a MacBook Pro you could get the 29 watt power brick from Apple but that's still 49 bucks thankfully there are some other options on the market like this one right here this just arrived this is a brand new product from a company called energy and this is a USBC laptop adapter with 60 watts of power plenty of power to take advantage of quick charge on the next iPhone now what I like about this one is it's crazy compact so if you look on the back here that's the entire power brick compare that to the 87 watt macbook pro power brick I don't have the 12-inch MacBook power brick here it's a little smaller than this but it's nowhere near as tiny is this and that one supply 60 watts as well this would be perfect for quick charge as well for the iPhone because of how compact it is the knife where's the knife this is not the only high-powered type-c power brick on the market I would likely recommend getting the Apple version though of the cable for compatibility reasons I think when it comes to the brick that's where you can go with a third party to try to save a few bucks look at that that's pretty small for 60 watts they say it can charge up a MacBook in 1.8 hours but of course it'll work with other products 5 volt iPhone 9 volt Android phone 12 volt USB see power bank a gain system this looks like the Nintendo switch a USB type-c laptop or iPad pro another thing I like about this the prongs they fold in what do you think Jack is that genius or what and then they go and then they go down they go out they go in now I'm guessing they probably include a Type C cable it actually looks like - what is this adapt for various types of laptops alright so here's the thing obviously you're stepping up to a bigger charger even in this case then what's going to be included in your box the five volt charger if you compare the two it's about twice as big but here's the thing I think you're really gonna enjoy having quick charge you know I'm a huge fan of wireless charging but we all know wireless charging is not the fastest so having a quick charge option is the perfect companion for wireless charging I personally think it's worth it to upgrade to a quick charge power brick remember out of the box you are not going to be taking advantage of that feature so Chuck this thing to the side get yourself one of these or use one of these if you already have a MacBook so you're charging your iPhone 8 8 + or 10 at the maximum capacity there's one more thing Apple if you're listening to me let's make this whole situation is that much easier it's time to give up the Lightning port alright let's just go to USB type-c it's one power brick to rule them all Tim Cook I'm talking to you alright I know we've had our differences but now is the time to listen to one another in peace and tranquility [Music]

so a couple videos ago I told you not to buy the iPhone 10 that was my conclusion given the price but here's the thing okay the iPhone in general crazy popular far as like a single model of phone is concerned it gets a lot of attention from an accessory perspective so I thought it'd be cool to sit down with a few of the more unique accessories for iPhone first things first I have Olek SAR ex-ranger premium smartphone case they make this one for the iPhone 7 8 7 plus 8 plus even the iPhone 10 this is a 26 in one tool it includes side knife a hex wrench a knife blade a cable bender a letter opener a screwdriver ruler cell phone stand bottle opener screwdriver keyring old cable peel or saw blade peel or can opener butterfly wrench hex wrench that's 26 different things you've probably seen these before but the problem with putting a card tool into your wallet is it's gonna chew it up because of that they designed a case that could house it this is the one for the iPhone 7 and 8 to the version for the 10 here also so there's this little door on the back which flips open your card tool slides in there like that and then this closes down it also acts as a stand if you're the kind of guy you want to have a tool on you at all times they've done it in such a fashion where it just feels like a normal case this will be the top link down below in the description next up we have this year meme now this one they don't just make for iPhone there's an Android version of this as well what this is is a charge cable that actually backs up your device you don't have to have your iCloud turned on or any other type of cloud backup service maybe you have some pictures on your device that should rather keep local you can see all your saved data on the meme app contacts calendar documents photos and videos all your important stuff it's a quick type of backup because it's local let's crack this baby open that's the cable right there this is where all the important storage is gonna be plugs in like that and all your data is right in there this end will then plug into your charger and you're good to go no it's 32 gigs of course which isn't a ton you might have a phone that has more storage than a so you could buy the bigger version okay next up is a similar concept but a little bit different this is called the leaf bridge if 64 gigabytes it does come in other capacities as well and this is just marketed as external storage for your iPhone as you can see here it's this little tiny device on one end lightning connector and the other is a USB connector this will pop into your smartphone or into your computer or other device with a USB port and allow you to quickly transfer information between the two it also comes with this little keychain holder so you can always have it with you you can capture photos and videos directly to the bridge so that's different than the previous cable that I showed you so this one for me is for people who just need some extra storage in the first place aren't necessarily worried about backing up to the cloud or whatever but instead just want another place for multimedia and also who might want to avoid iTunes drop some movies for example onto here quickly and all of a sudden your iPad and your iPhone has all that media accessible to you in the fastest way possible a couple of different solutions storage is an issue for iPhone users whether you have a new one or an old one so there's a way around it alright last up we have something called the stick box this is obviously quite ambitious the original patented mobile phone case with a built-in selfie stick oh my goodness drop protection 20 inch extension panoramic rotation Bluetooth enabled charging cable included cool alright so you can activate the camera from this end of the selfie stick and charge this up in order to do so alright let's check this thing out it's got some weight to it let me tell you so the way this works it seems is you reach here and pull oh you pull out this door like this oh okay [Music] BAM holy rapid-fire selfie extravaganza now how quickly can you let's see here what happens you go oh that's pretty quick here we are we got the iPhone 8 here it has connected to the Bluetooth of the selfie case oh my goodness Hilley do there is you see this moments like this this is what this is for in 382 look at that moment Willy do doesn't that image just say it all there you go a couple of different accessories for your iPhone depending on which version you're using as I said before some of those accessories also available for Android phones pretty unique some of them are cool some more utilitarian whereas others are a little bit more ambitious we got the multi-tool the backup cable we got the extra storage and then don't forget the memory creator the stick box I'm just gonna think about this for a while you know this episode of unboxing has been brought to you by Cano this is the company that allows you to build your very own computer or even a laptop now this thing here is for ages 6 and up believe it or not a child can do it it can be their entry point into the realm of building their own tag check this out it's got all your different components the case the memory card you put the light ring on line it up on the pins we've got the USB ports so there it is you're basically encouraging the inquisitive mind how do things work it's a set of components I can build it I can put together the hardware and I can start to play around with the software as you can see here this is what the interface looks like there's various applications here to get your child started with coding making our simple games like pong you could even have Minecraft on this thing if there's somebody in your life that sort of been showing an interest in the tech space this could be an interesting gift idea you can see we have this kit right here it's been built it's got an HDMI port on it so you can hook up to any display it could be a monitor it could be a television and the coolest part is this little keyboard trackpad combo all ready to go straight out of the box so thanks again to Cannell

so today I've got an interesting one it's called the woo Joos trap moocher Luger I don't even know if I'm pronouncing that properly now this thing is kind of like something I featured here a little while back you feel the bass and then I got a lot of feedback from people specifically music producers that were like man I can replicate what a mix might sound like on a big sound system even though I'm only using headphones and now this company they have their own take beyond the realm of sound where it feel it feel it that's the key part won't born to feel in the box strap audio cable micro USB charging cable user manual and carrying pouch playing video games watching movies and of course VR as an early adopter you're making history straight on your chest it can be around your waist if you like to Rumble down there or you can wear it kind of like a messenger bag intimate contact with the body it's very important here is the strap yes quite portable in fact looks kind of cool as well power up down plus - probably volume the headphone output the audio input so this is how you will attach it I guess you could wear it underneath the jacket or something and then no one even knows you're vibing out micro USB cable and a mini jack connector a very convenient little carrying pouch and the whole thing goes in there Oh baby it does and that was a fairly strong vibration let me grab some headphones you see what this thing can do and then headphones connected to the headphone output what am i doing I got to get the strap on now are we cool wearing like this this to me is the most reasonable because at least then you have your controls here and your headphone output if I wanted to hide it a little bit more I could have it on underneath prepare for liftoff is that it is it just gonna all of a sudden start oh absolutely it's going straight in there whoo [Music] it's like amping up my headphones to weigh more than the phone would be doing on its own and I'm assuming that these controls it lets you control volume but I think also the power of this thing this is worth mentioning it does support bluetooth also I could be on an electric skateboard just flow in through the universe sensation up sensation down so they're calling it sensation I'm calling it vibration tons of volume to play with whoo ah man you know I just I'm feeling it right now you don't really recognize what you're missing when it's just the sound when it's no vibe I mean it's like standing beside a gigantic bass cabinet and a bass guitar they hit you in the chest how much is this well 170 bucks Oh [Music] oh wow oh it's not just like first-person shooters but any of those suspenseful horror type games oh man you know that kind of anxiety where you feel like you're vibrating that is Wow yeah very tense huh imagine I had a giant display here I'm on another planet right all right so the way that the Bluetooth works is it syncs up to the strap and then the strap outputs via the headphone jack this gets a rally having to sync multiple Bluetooth devices and then maybe even just using a basic set of earbuds into this port so I could see people doing this so what we're really checking here is the performance gonna be as good as with a dedicated like a nice headset and the wired connection when we're going over Bluetooth and we have a crappy headset can it improve even these simple Apple earpods let's find out it sounds amazing these are not even good what they're lacking this gives you it does give the effect it makes you feel whoo it's good it's good this thing is good not everybody in the world is gonna own one it's 170 bucks you've got to be an enthusiast if you are into making music producing music gets you to that kind of euphoric place faster at the end of the day it is a vibrating strap and it's not gonna be for everyone because of that reason it really serves this very specific function I would be very surprised if it didn't put a smile on your face and if it didn't put a smile on your face I would also question whether or not you're alive 
now this is one of the coolest smartphones boxes I've seen in a while it's called the armored 2 from this company EULA phone I kind of knew what it was about based on the name water resistance shock resistance and dust resistant baked right in ip68 waterproof Helio p25 octa-core processor 6 gigs of ram 64 gigs of storage it's got a fingerprint reader it's running Android 7 one is 13 megapixels the other 16 5 inch 1080p display 4700 milliamp hour battery so it's going to be quite substantial it's solid it needs to be it's military stuff I'm gonna put that down for a second a little bit of paperwork headphone adapter type c2 mini jack a rather nice type C charge cable they've also included a type C 2 micro USB adapter quick charge power brick and a screwdriver what do I need that for oh that's a man's phone right there alright so fingerprint reader there on the front by the looks of it also a front-facing camera on this side we have the power switch push-to-talk button works with a particular app with walkie talkie like functionality tactical stuff right there this is a dedicated camera button and then on the other side we have volume up and down 2 persons there and even a dedicated SOS button type C port is deeply seated in there fits in there with a gasket so it's all sealed up they just want to make sure that the cover is on the type-c connector and also that this plate on the back is screwed in this is where your SIM card is gonna go I presume wow that's cool also with a gasket on it 2 separate SIM card slots and a micro SD card slot that's kind of cool I'm noticing here that they didn't really do much to Android it's pretty straight up Android 7 here there's a few apps outdoor toolbox Wow look at that sound meter compass flashlight heartrate picture hanging bubble level I mean it's all tool there's an SOS app that's pretty obvious what that's for and then this Zelo app is the one that you will use with that push-to-talk button if you had like a team of guys on a jobsite who all had this device or even other devices who use this app now you just hit that button over over and out you know I'm saying come to the coordinates Willie do what's happening man over we can have walkie-talkies in the office here guys downstairs is kind of far away all right well that's a cool app on its own I could see all kinds of people would be like a park ranger guy who works on a Conservation once you do get me dialing everyone all the time you need quick SOS over and out come in Mayday look at this yes we're wondering about other things what about the speaker what about the camera you got to use those still let's check out some unbox therapy here getting a better idea for the audio here this is not the brightest screen I've ever seen but it does look pretty good I mean this this ain't OLED boys and girls the speaker is not terrible it's not the worst I ever heard but you can cover it up quite easily it's right here bye-bye thing is it fires to the back as well built in circuits that's the part that makes this cooler than your average screen protector an adhesive coating if it's on the table it actually amps it up a little bit more by bouncing off the surface it seems like it's intended to be used that way I'm guessing because you would have it on your desk your dash or something if you were doing like speakerphone on here and you will be able to discern more likely let's play some SoundCloud real quick oh wow I have a really loud cheetah on the dash [Music] I take back what I said about the speaker actually when his maxed out is pretty loud it really benefits from just being on the table the camera oh my goodness single lens on the back this might be the most surprising aspect for me is that the camera is actually decent it's not the fastest shutter I've ever used obviously you can tell just a Conner lurking in the bushes hiding from the mob does he still fight or no if I was to switch over to pro mode Wow a lot of settings there saturation brightness contrast exposure ISO white balance there's a digital zoom function it also looks like there's an HDR mode self timer GPS location you can change the size of the image by default it's the full 16 megapixels there's also a face detection pretty decent but the role of a device like this is absolute ruggedness 4700 milliamp hour battery in it if it's just standby you're looking for that could mean a ton even screen on time I predict would be good on this device it is relatively small by today's standards display at 5 inches and it's 1080p so it's not some crazy high resolution plus you have all these tactile buttons you can access quickly even if you were wearing a glove which you might be doing if you're outdoors military-style fishing camping hiking even if you were to put an otter box kind of case let's say on an iPhone or something like that it's still difficult to access the buttons if you need to be wearing gloves a device like this this could be a really cool idea for somebody who needs something rugged that's built to be out on the job you add in the dedicated walkie-talkie functionality and I think it's actually pretty cool 240 bucks kind of in a gray area there it's not super cheap but not super expensive once again it's the armor 2 from EULA phone I'll link it down in the description so you guys can check it out for yourself but if you're in the market for a rugged device that can go where no man has gone before would it work on the moon jack doesn't even believe we've been to the moon so how about that Flat Earth Society [Music] 
today I've got a phone for you unlike any other phone that I have ever seen which says a lot because I've seen a lot of phones this device right here is a real standout because it isn't just another slab another rectangle no no no no this is the very first dual screen smartphone that I've ever seen and I want to say thank you to ZTE for allowing me to be one of the first people in the world maybe maybe this is even the first unboxing I'm not sure the acts on em whoo TV mode is waiting for you set up TV mode and launch DirecTV on your favorite video app two screens on a phone I have to say we're we're used to seeing these similar devices there's something refreshing about something so unusual two screens one smartphone some earbuds I believe are just gonna use the mini jack connector because yes this thing still has a headphone jack a power brick which it looks to support quick charge oh this is kind of cool they've done the sim tool in a little keychain kind of holder so you've always got it on you spontaneous sim switches and then also an adapter here from USB type-c to micro USB Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back and I think that's kind of important on a device like this because you're gonna be constantly placing it down on glass on the bottom of the device we have our type-c connector a power switch which is also a combination fingerprint reader volume rocker up and down SIM tray and then a configurable Quick Launch button could launch your camera TV mode or other I like a configurable button it doesn't just do one thing it does what you would like it to do a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack that's gonna make a lot of people happy look at that whoo that's a 20 megapixel camera and it's the only camera on the device but that's okay you essentially get this really high resolution selfie camera which then becomes your main camera as well and then this represents the secondary screen the construction here is basically all-metal here we go oh my goodness are you kidding me the gadget Fanning me is rejoicing that something this unusual can still be manufactured by a major phone maker in this day and age that's cool cool hinge contraption in this cutout here to keep everything sturdy satisfying click when it finds the spot listen okay so here's the setup screen it's telling me that TV mode is waiting for you alright let's go ahead and add a fingerprint here on the power switch over here my middle finger here on my right hand there's a dedicated button for changing screen display modes can either mirror work in an extended mode a dual screen mode or single screen with the other one turned off oh wow it's actually pretty quick and just like that we have YouTube open by default my phone just operating as expected on the left hand side so you can have some news going on over here you're doing a little reading and watch some unbox therapy at the same time I can also turn it like this and look what happens it almost starts to feel like a portable game console that's pretty wild in extended mode just double up my display size for one of the functions I can have the video playing above and be scrolling comments on the second display at the same time whose kid new see how I'm both sides of the hinge it's reinforced with metal it's solid this one does a dual whoa you're with somebody at lunch enjoying the same thing and the other person on the other side of the desk can now watch what you're watching one side two sides and same goes for portrait mode this is essentially gonna stretch your display regardless you're gonna have a bezel in the center here so that's something to keep in mind I get it there are other options for multitasking a window within the display but nowhere near the amount of real estate that two displays could provide as a regular smartphone you just flip this back you know hey how's it going what's happening and so on you know now I know you're gonna have questions about the camera I did myself and when you launch it it actually prompts you to switch to the other screen so okay so this is selfie mode here wow I'm getting a 20 megapixel selfie right now what would normally be the rear camera can now be utilized on the front camera so to flip it over I can just hit the button that I would normally hit here just like that I now have a rear camera our wonderful model here with the vibrant green SIM tray microSD capabilities as well so it's coming out of two spots one speaker grille on the bottom and then one forward facing from the earpiece people can't spy on you I've heard of this okay I'm glad it's not just a single spot that it fires from you potentially cover that up a little bit or you're holding it like this you might not be able to discern as much as when you have audio firing at you even if it's only to a certain degree it's got four gigs of RAM 64 gigabytes of internal storage but as I mentioned before that's expandable through the SD card slot Android 7.1.2 but I have been told that ZT is already working on rolling out the latest version of Android for the device I could just be responding back to Jack with all the emojis in the world that took you three minutes to text that back the little monkey guy Jack apparently only takes one emoji at a time see this thing here is it's all about the multitasking it's about the power users you're lying there you're on the couch it's a pop pop pop it's all going off it's it's one app it's another rap it's Instagram it's snapchat it's YouTube and texting at the same time for it's a really big display for one thing the hinge acts as a kickstand I'm gonna be really interested to see where this thing goes because it is so unusual you know I'm gonna use it for a little while and see how it goes and I want to ask you guys something if you had two displays on your phone at all times what would be on each display 
so as you know that cool tech it never slows down and today I wanted to put together a few of the cool ones three cool unique unusual strange amazing gadgets rebel cam by shift cam mini rig mini the gesture robotics aura this one here looks a little bit ambitious but let's get started with the rebel camp CES Innovation Awards that's a good start the multi lens photo revolution for smartphone work on any smartphone a selfie mirror frame it up it all pretty pucker up and whatnot an adjustable ring light to illuminate in dark environments it's all in this one little package from a lens perspective a revolver bowl system I don't think I've ever said that word before evolvable oh my goodness revolver you've never said that word before an interview mister revolver ball you're not alright hey fisheye macro and wide-angle you know I love the wide-angle where are you taped brother oh there we go look at that mirror whoa what do you think Jack can you see yourself in there spins and clicks turn it on turn it off and magnetically look at that right in that location where the mirror was multifunctional a nice little carry pouch so this is what it looks like when it's on and then to switch lenses you just spin this little guy boom boom this must be the macro lens let's bring it up to some text here oh baby crazy detail there it's a pretty wild with the light attached little chips on the coin there's like little chips on the surface of the coin which I couldn't even see with my own eyes pretty amazing right like have you ever even seen a fingertip look like that whoa and you obviously can tell what this one is right away it's crazy wide I mean almost like sort of like music video it's the rear camera right you get all the advantages of using the rear camera wow that is a really cool image and then the last one is just the regular wide-angle wider than the usual lens so that's the wide and there's the regular pixel this is a cool little gadget some extra aspects like the light in the mirror I could get behind this the only thing to mention is it's a little bit pricey 80 bucks this could really mix up your Instagram page so this guy is called mini rig really the claim to fame here the amount of sound the quality of sound a super portable Bluetooth speaker I'm talking like pocket size up to 30 hours of battery life 3.5 millimeter audio input and output so you can daisy chain multiple speakers together user manual right there look at that Hey oh look at that little guy Industrial this is metal feels rugged oh wait a sec a tube style power adapter a mini jack connector as well it looks like when I just plug this in it powered it up yeah that's kind of cool do they name this thing unbox therapy oh I think they did [Music] I like this thing it's not just loud right it's not just about volume it's about the ability to reproduce frequency the frequency into music and there's a surprising amount of low-end represented in something so tiny this thing is cool on its own but they make this for a reason the subwoofer for those that want a little more juice you can tell already you're paying a little bit more money here whoa it just looks like a metal tube oh yeah that's a lot more big there's still another output on the subwoofer it's not quite as convenient I see this more as an at-home type of setup I feel like this is gonna stay at home most of the time all right last up we definitely have the most fun gadget of the bunch you are the controller you have the power we'll see I don't know this thing is super lightweight too and the glove to control the unit works within a range of 6 to 23 feet and it's a removable glove yeah this thing is super lightweight it also seems pretty durable with this huge cage on it you'll have to be too concerned about crashing it which is good for me if you've seen any of the drone videos on this panel extra propellers as well the removable glove yeah you I look right to you guys I'm sort of a cyborg not really at all forward backward left right there's a dedicated button takeoff and landing right there that's a look right there this is our drone expert he'll II do he tells me to calibrate it because the gestures back forward it all starts from the point of level so you hold the takeoff and land button for four seconds and boom calibrated so when I hold that button the same gesture that I would use for back and forward now becomes up and down alright so it hovers we have back forward those are the most basic gestures and then right and left now I'm going to come towards me stop back forward and check this out Bam Bam [Music] boom might have even exceeded my expectations it's obviously a novelty thing is not shooting any video as far as some of the smaller drones I've tried to control in this space I mean it's not destroyed that's got to tell you something it's a little bit pricey for just like a hobby kind of toy ish drone 70 bucks keep that in mind but I mean you get to wear this look at me right now so that's got to be worth something don't you agree [Music] [Music] 
I'm about to introduce you to a strange environment that you might not know about the world of 3b sound now this is something that I've been interested in for a very long time searching up binaural audio and these different sound scapes and experiences that you could have in your headphones if you've ever experienced some of these videos it is incredible how much detail you can get just using your ears I know exactly where this is right now or what this is right now or I feel like I'm there you see most audio recordings that you hear are single channel audio like this microphone right here but you have two ears one and two we hear things in two channels not just one you know you get the little in fact I want you to put on headphones for this video put them on right now from this point forward because some interesting things are gonna happen this is the product it's brand new it's called the ambient from Sennheiser you know Sennheiser obviously been in the game forever now I've got a bunch of them actually look at this very exciting I'm gonna put some details on Twitter I'm gonna give these away to you guys so go follow me there and look out for the tweet a microphone on each earpiece for 3d recording audio converters powered by Apogee I have their products sitting on my desk 3d recordings reproducible on any other headphones so you use these headphones to get the recording and then everyone else gets to experience those soundscapes on regular headphones transparent hearing is a feature that lets you hear what is going on around you to amplify your sound while you're wearing these so they still work as a high quality set of headphones and it's also got a remote control in it there's a picture of the remote control so you can record at any moment and they just look like regular earbud that is the setup I feel like you guys need this type of visual so you can understand but that's what it looks like a nice little carrying bag here what is this this is a very soft I can tell her Eddy silky that's how you know it's a legit equipment they're very soft so this is what they look like this is the microphone on the outside your speaker unit your earphone on the inside the magic happens in here this is your converter apparently this indicator here will identify when the surround microphone is on it'll work in the native video recording app on your device and everything happens over this single lightning connection some extra ear tips depending on the size of your ear canal this guy on the bottom here is for transparent hearing you can have the microphones on the outside set to minimum so you hear no noise no surrounding noise you can have a kind of mix in the center here so you can hear your surroundings a little bit or you can have a maximum effect where your surroundings are amplified and you can kind of have this hyper awareness like a superhero of course I went into video mode on the camera the red light came on to identify that we are in surround sound 3d audio recording territory talk now yeah okay so you know how your own voice is amplified when your ears are plugged all right then I plug it in top that is so weird that man that's wild I hear you a little bit better than when I had them completely out you're able to be more aware of your surrounding that's kind of the effect I'm having here I'm gonna go back into the camera app and begin a recording I need you to put your headphones on right now to truly experience this properly [Applause] [Music] it's almost like a physical experience almost like a visual perception but only using sound that you can place it even with your eyes closed in a way we almost don't appreciate our hearing enough all of a sudden it's like there's so much more nuance to it that brings me to the next part obviously this was a simulation of those sound effects here in the studio these are really meant to be used in environments so in this next part of the video you're gonna go to a few different environments and you're not going to know what those environments are not at first I want you to use just your ears in order to determine where you are roll the environments was it generally known that you are a piano player and they do know how to write songs not until I joined the band don't you think - of being in a band it's way more secure for a performer employed yourself it's not you just out there on the alleged sub that mean why did you leave the band why to keep [Music] [Music] so how about that experience huh what your ears are capable of finally the audio can match the immersion of the video quality that our devices are capable of shooting if you made it through this video without headphones on you did not experience the true capabilities here go back rewatch with your earbuds in and you'll see exactly what i'm talking about this is the kind of product that gets me excited this is actual binaural 3d sound recording that you could put in your bag in your pocket connect to your phone and you're ready to go so don't forget I got three more of these I can't wait to send them out to some lucky people you guys can use and show me how you're using them upload your clips do some crazy 3d audio stuff I'm sure we just scratched the surface but this it's a whole new world [Music]

so it's been a while all right as far as inexpensive products are concerned I hear it a lot Lou $3,000 speaker what's going on here all right we need to value stuff we need something I can afford this is five unique strange unusual gadgets under $10 what do I have in front of you I want to start with the flash band smartphone led fan now it is kind of chilly where I'm located but maybe it's not for you in fact I recently traveled to India and it's surely not chilly there maybe you want something like this a little fan boo you off that plugs into your phone and I guess it looks cool at the same time they make a few models black and white color plug it into your smart phone your smart phone powers it these are a little over 10 gotta be honestly these are like 13 bucks but still okay close enough oh it's a tight fit hit the button Oh oh wow it's more powerful than I expected and the lights I mean you're putting on a show all of a sudden sort of flip it up and this is you that works for thirteen USB type-c also micro and iOS I think that's pretty cool in the same department the USB light I'm gonna open up the black one here plug it into a USB port this product can be used with a power bank laptop and all other USB devices dependable and bendable I don't know if it's dependable yet I have a small power bank over here and let's see what happens boom you see you see that that's I mean it's an LED why is it flashing now if you bend it it's off no is this faulty is this do a let's try another one all right so you plug it in maybe you have a power outage need a real quick flashlight that can last for a really long time and doesn't require removable batteries double-a batteries or something like that a little bendable hopefully dependable USB light okay next up we have something that just arrived today it's called Ella pack these guys they have a pretty basic kind of proposition here which is that everybody's got a charge cable or some headphones sitting around so in your house you might have a bunch of different charge cables one of them's yours your sibling they're stealing your cable who knows what they're up to they all look the same and you can't prove it after the fact comes in a bunch of different colors I mean this is this a basic lightning cable that's actually not so bad and I guess the intention here is that you cut it to size also we're gonna come back to this we're gonna put Bowl to work he's gonna show us the finish product there the next one is probably my favorite of the bunch this is really cool this product here is called life light emergency LED bulbs it's a four to five hour emergency life of course there's all kinds of smart bulbs out there in the world you've seen them in the past and they're cool nothing wrong with those this one kind of takes a different approach there's no app for it nothing too fancy like that and that's part of the reason why it's inexpensive and the key factor with this is when the power goes out it keeps running so it has a built-in rechargeable battery it'll be charging up as it sits in your socket and then when the power goes out this thing still has five hours of battery life now I have one set up in a lamp over here I go ahead I turn it on it works I turn it off continues to function you're like I don't get you what's the big you've got them it's plugged in oh is it is it how about this that is the prong that's juice coming from look that's all the cables right there that's juice coming straight from the bulb and you can see the switch still function in the event of a power outage these babies they just fire on your switch still works I'm not gonna ask questions it just does that's pretty cool especially at the price point these things for 4:30 and then you get for free is well under the $10 price point of the other items in this video and I don't know if that's just genius all bulbs should have that they also give you this little clip adapter so this thing they include in the Box this little clip with a hanger on it this will then act as a switch it doesn't get hot because it's an LED and once again it's durable - that's not glass 10,000 hour lifetime to a loved one in the event of a power outage they're gonna be thinking about you when that light kicks on it man I love that person and I love you you're always thinking about me now it is worth noting they're not the only people who make this type of bulb but there's a few others on Amazon as well but this is the one I tested and it works and it's cool and it's cheap I could say whatever I want please leave so mo is finished with his arts and crafts project eight bucks for two of these I guess it's a little cheaper than just replacing the cable I don't know about the value there when you could just grab another cable look at this I don't know different colors Ella pack it's kind of interesting this is not nylon it's more of a plastic material but nonetheless that's what it ends up looking like and it's definitely cooler than the original cable it's probably not gonna tangle as easily either there you have it all right why don't we have last up maybe the most exciting this was most selection for the day the storm proof sweep fire strike able fire starter windproof waterproof made from renewable biofuel this will burn for seven minutes each ten bucks $9.99 for 20 of these fire starters it's made from sugarcane that's interesting outdoor use only all right we're taking a real don't try this at home maybe we are outdoors you just you just don't know that this is an outdoor studio you would never know all right with the backdrop keep your unused fire starters in this plastic wrap okay so that's what it looks like there a little bit of water here I guess I'll dunk it Oh dunkaroo that's properly wet look at that let's try to strike it when it's wet Oh baby whoa that is that is a serious plate hope suffocation water ain't gonna stop that thing once again this is for outdoor use only don't try this at home I'm a trained professional that's the face of a professional right there yeah anyhow there it is bunch of cool gadgets under or right around ten dollars now you can't possibly say that everything I show and this channel is unattainable you're probably afford some of these and say that you participated in the full extent of the unbox therapy universe by potentially enjoying one of these yourself okay good night 
whatever we should wait for Ryan come back to get me might be funny have them there come on man why are you here when you in town well I need your help take a look man yeah it's uh never end what do you think about this it's like Christmas morning here Willy do on the camera today really doing the camera Taylor's here for Willy doing a camera no no Jack who needs him now I'm just kidding Jack revealed ten million subscribers tell your friends subscribe jack in all of his glory exposing himself to the world I'm gonna stand near you awkwardly as you unbox there it is here we go and he's getting right down to business a little bit of hair and look at this getting right to it that is a lot of product but I'm not sure what brand is from power port solar little thin solar panel twenty thousand power core power drive speed to quick charge 3.0 this is the one I was looking for three the three indication therefore quick charge three so this is gonna juice up your device obviously rapidly oh here this is a monster look at this 26800 milliamp power port plus with Qualcomm quick charge free oh yeah look at this beast right here just think about that for a second 26 over 26 thousand milliamp hours now this one has three ports on it including the quick charge 3 and the input to charge it and I was like this and you can tap this button here in order to indicate how much charge you have left I'm gonna get that guy boost it up very cool what did you get 360 camera so it's called the go extreme action series I'm guessing we're looking at kind of like a budget style GoPro competitor Wow look at the accessories holy kaboom you know I love wide-angle just a wild ride around and he really in his natural habitat he will be packing away many different foods for the offseason there is nuts and berries well this is so easy look at this with the time no it's not oh we love these guys these are cool man this is a company called moment I use their products so I've done some live streams recently the pixel event and the iPhone event before that and the problem is with the phone the phone doesn't have a very wide lens so you're trying to fit a few things into the frame and you can't so we've been using the wide-angle moment adapter now this looks like they sent us the tele lens v2 so that's gonna be a zoom lens 60 millimeter equivalent and these just clip on to their cases oh this is for the pixel - this is some early accessories for the pixel to pixel to XL oh okay I think this is cool but I think this is cool because of this little logo right here I feel like that's a key indicator stuff like that this is their new product yeah it's a simple product but it's called the Caddy Shack caddy sized caddy sack named after Caddyshack but like it looks like a book but then you unzip it and it's got a spot as you can see in the picture here it's got a spot for all your all your dongles and you can see you have all the little compartments elastics silica gel for Jack that's gonna have to go too well because Jack's not here up here I'm doing SD cards you could do a pen in here thinner cables or dongles over here and your big power brick goes on this side I'm assuming Wow you know what it is you there's some prejudice that goes on with a box like you pick it up and you think you know what's in it before your chest generally speaking weight you associate weight with value if it's really light you're like yeah can it be that good over there over there over there no idea came from Hong Kong when you see the orange tape you know it's about to get exciting oh that's right it's a company called elephone maybe you're about to turn to the budget device look at this very slim bezel on that four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of storage USB type-c it's booting up Wow I might do a whole video on that that's wild look what they're doing these days look what they're up to I like how it doesn't have overwhelming branding on it and how the front is mostly screamed what oh I know what this is I got to give a shout out I meet Bonnie he's got a YouTube channel and he featured this and I was like dude you guys tell me one of those cuz cuz you can't get it over here it's lonely in India yes yeah I'm about to blow I'm about to ball your mind I'm gonna blow your mind okay set is this like threatening tell the people what that is that is a bigoted spinner cellphone yes it is oh my goodness here I'm opening this up the spinner phone K 188 it launched in India all right it's it's inexpensive it's obviously a gimmick it's obviously ridiculous in fact it may be a key indication that the world is coming to an end I'm not sure comes in a few different colors as you can see in the back here it is obviously not a smartphone it's just a basic phone what what here we go I have never fidget spun a smartphone before you know what oh we got it we gotta charge this I mean we obviously have to there we go are we gonna get that oh there we go okay if you're gonna be fidget speeding your phone you might as well have Littlejohn they just see it makes sense right settings application alarm calendar calculator sound recorder world's alright it's pretty comprehensive for what it is comes off look at the battery it's all bulgy Wow alright let me throw my sim in here oh wait a second no it's not even a nano sim it's a micro sim rather than a nano sim so it ain't happening there's no phone calls happening right now this is a this is a special day in the world of technology it's when the mean becomes a reality in the form of a product like a lot of people blame me in it to a certain extent for the fidgets spinner thing because I made a video about them before it was like they fully blew up I do deserve some of the blame in that sense but those things like how did it take off how did it get to the level it did as quickly as it's like what happened how did it strike the chord with Humanity in such a way what you're spinning something what what's happening here it's in a cell phone that's a real thing this is a real product this exists in the universe now it's hard to believe it's hard to believe and then you boot it up and it plays Little John it's it's like what universe and my in rate of what is where am I [Music] 
so over the years I've looked at a lot of headphones here on the channel I'm sure you're aware that you've probably seen some of those videos nowadays it's kind of like hey what's it gonna take to get me excited how is somebody gonna do something different today I've got a whole lot of different the product is called Vinci smart headphones you may have seen these guys on Kickstarter they raised close to a million dollars they put an entire display on one of the ear cups these things can operate standalone without a smartphone in fact there's even a SIM card slot on here voice controlled hands-free experience there's sixteen gigabytes of local storage inside the headphones so you can load songs right on to the headphones and leave your smartphone at home it supports Wi-Fi Bluetooth and 3G connections so that's what the SIM card slot is for now you can have a standalone Spotify or SoundCloud player I guess it also has activity tracking 21 days of standby time 26 hours of Bluetooth playback in 10 hours if its standalone it also supports HD voice through LTE so there's a lot going on turns out these are only 149 now they do come in a few different colors have we ever had a box with this kind of coloring on it before that is wild okay I have no name until you name me I have no form until you shake me I don't exist until you make me I am Vinci I am waiting deep inside you touch my spark and let me light you give me life and I'll revive you I am Vinci oh wow that's a change of pace one free month of wireless service with t-mobile ooh okay not as heavy as I expected considering there's a screen on the earcup this is the screen that's the SIM card tray micro USB to charge it up a mini jack connector so you could use it wired if you wanted to that looks to be the heart rate sensor the micro USB charge cable auxiliary cable to use it wired to activate your Vinci please connect to a Wi-Fi okay let's do that now there's also a voice assistant built-in here and since the brains are completely built-in and it's not relying on your phone it's got its own assistant that make any sense what I just said you guys ever listen to what I say one of you now you can have this always-on or only when you're wearing them I guess always-on is fine now there's a couple of different services that you can connect here by default there's Spotify SoundCloud and Amazon Alexa swipe horizontally to change tracks swipe vertically to adjust volume tap once to pause tap twice to save to favorites hold to talk Wi-Fi on and off there's an airplane mode bluetooth on and off it looks like you can use this as a regular Bluetooth headset there's a music visualizer oh look at that oh you can even do your own DIY oh so it's like one music service or the other I guess now what if I just want to search something on Spotify I wonder play Led Zeppelin okay here we go we got a song playing guys [Music] play Daft Punk play wu-tang Clan no these are good guys these are cool I can see one issue being when you're offline right when you're offline then you're stuck with whatever music you have loaded on here these are cool I didn't expect to be saying this these are cool it's not Google assistant maybe maybe it'll get there one day the way she talks super robotic these should be like Spotify branded or something because it's a very unique way of interacting with Spotify without the need for a secondary device I could go for a jog cellphone-free just quickly turn it down quickly turn it up I'm not sure how much attention you want like you could turn that off if you want you're not gonna be bumping into people who've got visualizers on their headphones to record please say start recording start recording this is for like voice memos you have a killer idea you got the best idea ever I need to put it down and either lay it down play recording the sound is okay like it's nothing special stop blowing me away it's kind of what I would expect in this particular price range it does take a SIM card you can use this thing with 3G which should be plenty to stream Spotify so Bluetooth the functions like any other Bluetooth headset you toggle it on or off here the idea of putting a screen on headphones is just not something I thought would ever be necessary but because the capacitive input is so sensitive it's a little more smooth interacting with it when it's on your head when compared with a bunch of buttons and switches I'm gonna go ahead and say you should check these out I'll drop a link down in the description they do come in a couple of different colors and they've got a model coming out on Kickstarter it might be active right now man turn some heads a screen on your ear cup the future [Music] 
so you guys know I've been using the iPhone 10 for a little while I'm gonna reserve some of my feedback for an upcoming video after I've been using it for at least a week but something has been making the headlines this morning I've been on the tech websites and I've learned about this app that aims to get rid of the knotch on the iPhone 10 the controversial notch that everyone's talking about is this interesting is this something you should go and download especially since they're charging money for the app so this is the app right here it's called notch remover get an idea from that image there of what its gonna look like when you get rid of it starts to look kind of like a Galaxy s8 to be honest I'll show you here how it looks with a couple different wallpapers so I'll head over there and open it up you don't mean the other guys we've looked at it and we're like you know it doesn't the iPhone doesn't look that bad with the black bar at the top I could see some people preferring this had Apple just come out with a device like that I don't know though maybe there's some notch lovers maybe you're a notch lover but this app will take your stock wallpaper and throw that notch in there now if you just kind of glance these articles and downloaded the app you might have thought that the notch was gonna be gone everywhere but they've just used the kind of weird little hack here to remove the notch from the phone by attaching it to a wallpaper and also just in general the apps kind of not that good like I'm looking at this I'm like okay that looks good safe and then what did it do it saved it where did it save it what it's actually doing is saving it to the camera roll you can select any image what you can't do is you can't go to your wallpapers download the wallpaper separately but anyway if I go ahead and just select one of these images here and then hit save it now takes this stock iPhone 10 background essentially removes the knotch but of course what it's really doing is filling in the knotch it's creating this black outline on each side of the knotch that's what your stock setup looks like knotch now if I go to my wallpapers here and select the newly created image from the app you can scale it to right where you think it fits in kind of somewhere around there then I'm gonna set it set to both and when I get back out look at that the notch is dead KABOOOM okay so this is you you're happy then not just gone it's what you've always wanted and you think you're off to the races you think you just bought the the greatest app ever if you're a notch hater but then you go and you open an app you open Safari then the knots come screaming back in this app is really it's kind of strange it's strange in the sense that it only does the thing it claims to do from within your main phone area here which is I don't know how frequent you're there the surprising part here is the fact that this app even exists because in Apple's developer terms for the App Store you're not supposed to have an app like this that attempts to hide the knotch but anything like this is supposed to be blocked and somehow this thing made it through one cool aspect though is it kind of does a good job of displaying how great OLED displays are if I hold this up to Jack over here it's hard to distinguish where the screen starts and ends and the knotch actually is just by filling in the display with black look at that but the question is really for you guys what do you think when you see an iPhone like this notch free even though it's not permanently not free but instead just on the background here do you kind of wish that Apple made this device like do you wish this is how it looked instead or do you prefer the knotch do you think that extra little bit of real estate up there is useful to you or or is it aesthetically pleasing so let me know in the comments if this is something you guys are gonna do does the knotch bother you so much you're gonna try to eliminate it with this particular app are you gonna spend the $0.99 if so I'll link the app down in the description but in my opinion I would save the $0.99 get yourself a coffee strike up a conversation with somebody at the coffee shop and get over the knotch you'll learn to live with it I think 
oh my goodness this is bad this is really bad it's a crisis it seriously is worse than I originally thought this very special character a text character that is crashing iMessage it's rendering iMessage useless but I told will to look into it like see what this thing is all about and it turns out it's way worse than that on his MacBook this character is also wreaking havoc oh yeah the Notes app has already been crushed on the laptop his notes are gone because there was one note with this character in it that's all it takes is that one character that's the reason we brought well on because like I mean he's been looking into this all morning we want to test it a few different ways see how bad it is he's got an Android phone here there's an Android phone over here and then of course we have the iPhone 10 I'm gonna paste the character into a text chat Android to Android to make sure that it's iOS and OS 10 specific so here we go my reception is really bad yours oh there we go you see on Android nothing happened it's it's perfectly fine well where things are about to get dicey that simple little character there is probably about to destroy the messaging app on the iPhone 10 this is crazy and who knows what other apps after we discovered show Jack short okay the character is there if he touches that character highlights it dead show them what happens when you try to open notes I mean notes won't even open anymore iPhone 10 on the left your phone is on the right I put my sim card in it this could be a disaster I should warn people don't do this all right this is a disastrous is terrible you could break someone's phone yeah let's just confirm that what's happening is what we've seen reported so here we go I'm gonna paste it in there there it is sim cards in here now let's go ahead and send this over you were telling me earlier this character some sort of foreign language yeah it's a character I think in India Kaluga it's a foreign language character so what's happening right now if you're in that country if you're you if you that's your keyboard everyone's brick yeah so once again little slow on the on the send here why do I feel like as soon as I write test it goes right away I think it just takes a while oh do we get it oh boy this is dangerous whoa it rebooted but if I go in here okay I'm gonna open I'm gonna open it [Music] ready but what I don't understand is it's not killing my messages so the issue is because I wrote the test it's okay if the person that sent you the terrible message to begin with is willing to help you out they can send you a rescue message so that when you launch your messages app it doesn't have to render that character in the subject so before I do it look you'll see boom crash I can't open messages now rescue and then boom I can get into my messages now if I do open up the message from well I'm still gonna be messed dead but if I paste this on its own and if this comes through we're dead new message so it's they're now dead instant messages are completely dead the messages app is crushed it's over the extent of this is more major than I had assumed this is some serious stuff right now Apple we hope you can get some engineers working overtime here this is a that's a problem remember your uncle Lou told you don't go do this makes you realize how much we rely on technology yeah these little bugs can freak you right out one simple character just break everything really dude thanks for your hard work on this and sacrificing your machine yeah I'll just be over here using my pixel 2xl Android devices and I'm gonna text this to Jack though no I'm just kidding don't do it it was a joke that was a joke 
so a little while back I opened a box downstairs and this was in and I asked you in that video if you wanted to see a more comprehensive look at this particular smartphone and you guys came back with a bunch of thumbs the elephone s8 probably never heard of it before which is fun as my good pal ryan would say but before I tell you the price I want to show you the spec list mediatek helio X 25 deca core processor 4 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of storage 8 megapixel front camera 21 megapixel rear a 6 inch 2k screen fingerprint sensor and a 4 thousand milliamp hour battery and one of the most impressive screen to body ratios I've ever seen on a smartphone alright so how much should all that cost around - 39 to 49 in that region so under two hundred and fifty dollars you can get that spec list it's quite shocking and as you can see there is almost no bezel at the top or the sides there's a bit of a chin but that exists to house what is a fingerprint reader and your forward facing camera reflective blue mirrored finish this is the 21 megapixel camera a single 21 megapixel shooter the speaker as well as a USB type-c connector power switch has a texture on it which is a thing I've been talking about for a while put a little color on it as well they were able to fit a couple of sensors up in this slim bezel at the top the construction is glass as well as aluminum so it feels high-quality you've got a little sim tool they've included a case just in case you've got a case that's not such a bad look surprisingly high quality cable metal tip there USB C 2 headphone adapter included no headphone jack on this device bit unfortunate especially considering its scale it's like you could fit it in there dual SIM tray face to screen that's that's nice so you don't put it in backwards I have never seen that before so I have the unit booted up now and you can now appreciate how much of the front of it is display now the displays 1440p which is another thing you probably wouldn't expect in a device that's under $250 close to stock Android and surprisingly snappy feeling this is all stock stuff and you can see here it's running Android seven-11 the home button also operates as your back button so a single tap will take you back and a push and hold will bring up your multitasking I've looked at a lot of displays in this environment and because it's so bright in here some of them get washed out but this one is actually quite decent I mean you look at the beard hairs Jack detail in the beard is always a very good sign and that looks good that's from a previous video which is honestly I mean it was a serious mind blow for me put your headphones on go watch that video it'll be worth your time this is kind of incredible actually that this is only 250 speaker time although my expectations are not super high it kind of lets you turn up the volume to the point where the audio is crackling a little bit so I don't recommend doing that you probably want to be a couple notches down from max I think you're probably gonna have some headphones plugged into this or have some Bluetooth ones or something like that it's really too bad because the display is incredible there's no room up top for the front-facing camera they've had to put it down here it's lower than you would normally have it not such a big deal just hold it up a bit higher not too shabby actually how the monitor here shows the phone with my hand holding it that's artistic jack we can adjust exposure there's various different scene modes everywhere from auto night sunset party and so on adjustments for white balance sharpness hue saturation toggle it in for whatever your taste is it can shoot raw surprisingly this phone at this price can shoot 4k video mmm kind of move in a bit some color so that's a 21 megapixel picture I have just eliminated the shutter delay I turned off anti-shake and face detection and left zero shutter delay on so if you have the other processing turned off you can get that zero shutter also on top we have panorama mode a picture-in-picture mode that's kind of interesting also in HDR mode this fingerprint scanner here so it's pretty quick it's not the fastest I've ever tried but it's nice it gets the job done that's the package right there find it for around 250 bucks you might pay a little bit more you might pay a little bit less but this is good news for customers phones are getting better at lower price points this might be my new favorite phone under 300 bucks I wish the speaker was a little bit better I understand why they went with a single lens system glass on the front glass on the back this might be the coolest smartphone that people have never heard of and I bet if you carry this thing around you're gonna have a lot of people asking you hey man what is that where did you get it and you're telling me you only paid 250 for it [Music] 
so I spent a lot of time looking at the high-profile expensive smartphones that are out there you know you get the iPhone pen you got the galaxy stuff in my pocket right now is the pixel to excel a significant investment to purchase any one of those in reality not everyone has the capability at least not immediately go out and buy one of those in many cases when I end up looking at affordable phones here oftentimes the radio is built into those international devices might not work so well here domestically in North America I wanted to seek out the most inexpensive smartphone on all of Amazon now I had a couple of rules it couldn't be used it couldn't be from a third-party seller pick up fall and that was available via Amazon Prime it had to have LTE which this one does here it had to be a smart phone and presumably it would be running Android as this one is I paid $49.99 for this one it's the Alcatel OneTouch ideal judging from the appearance here on the box it's got some old-school Android on their functional I'm sure but some old-school Android flipping it over to the side 4.5 inch 854 by 480 resolution 4G LTE capable as I said five megapixel rear camera 2 megapixel front camera 1.1 gigahertz quad-core processor Android version is 5.1 we're taking a few steps back in time there this is the important part the various bands which are supported for both W CDMA and GSM 850 900 1800 1900 most people in North America can pop any SIM card into this thing and it's gonna work and it's 49 jump inside and see what we're working with at this price point stop thinking about all those pretty phones that cost 10 times more than this one we get the device first no battery removable battery they have so if it'll mock up on the front so you can see what it is going to look like a micro SD card slot little bit of versatility also a headphone jack couple of features that your flagship might not have how about that micro USB on the bottom no need for symmetry at all they just where do we need to put it we'll put it off to the side nope no quick charge I'm guessing battery is here and it is a 1780 milliamp hour is this even on Amazon here's the backplate so it is AT&amp;T branded what's the rating on Amazon is like three and a half stars yeah three and a half stars I think some people need to adjust their expectations at the price point that's my feeling was being realistic it's all very straightforward and there we go to boot it up no one was cool tip bezel city big bezel on there once upon a time this was no big deal kind of reminds me of the new pixel non Excel I might have been below the belt and write very large capacitive buttons popular amongst the older generation consider me Miles Davis no glass back no wireless charging battery out of the box oh my goodness this screen is so dim not the quickest so far on the keyboard look at the difference here also I'm trying to connect to Wi-Fi and they're telling me you can take up to two minutes well wait what I can tell them tip at the exact same angle the $50 phone has completely vanished please tell me we have some more brightness to what we have lots of brightness to work with that got better guys same comparison I mean it's not OLED 49 I got to keep reminding you 49 I paid 49 for this let me defend this a little bit we've got some bloatware my AT&amp;T Direct TV is on their drive mode it's not quick all right time to check out the camera little nerve this year some shutter lag there as well the photo is terrible I mean there's like no dynamic range either lit or it's completely gone the selfie situation equally horrendous I'm guessing there's like no skin tone there it's just a zombie mode loo but a couple of beard hairs there's a zoom but there's no tap to focus by default I mean that's just that's not a good picture let's test the speaker could be good could be a disaster the latest unbox therapy this is a Facebook ad just come use Facebook like have you heard of it yet have you heard of Facebook yet guys that's full brightness 480p baby volume this is the situation where it's it's firing for the back and you can cover it by accident what do you think Jack can you see the speaker doesn't sound terrible it's not loud he's not the best experience you could watch YouTube you could live sheesh um what can I say what was the model name the OneTouch ideal I mean I know why this phone exists for people who just need a smartphone they just need to get in the game and for those people this might be fine I mean it does the things you need a smartphone to do Lou where is the sweet spot we don't want to have a $49 phone if we don't have to but maybe we're also not in the market for seven eight nine hundred or even 500 at the low-end I think what you start to see you do find a point at which major improvements take place on Amazon in North America it's definitely not 49 it's probably somewhere closer to a hundred and there are some phones that make drastic improvements on this one I'm gonna say avoid this one maybe as a burner phone a backup phone no hate on this device though man to deliver something like that for 49 Jack can barely buy lunch for 49 she would this guy's lunch looks like disgusting today's episode of unbox the repeat has been brought to you by Sherry's berries and ProFlowers the perfectly paired combo

now this is exciting take a look here I mean you all know when you see a briefcase like this it's got to be important it's a type of briefcase you would carry something top-secret this briefcase was sent to me by Huawei that means new smartphone I need much more than intro than that let's do that one more time oh this always brings me back to the briefcase in Pulp Fiction to be honest so no we were watching Pulp Fiction yesterday [Music] [Applause] this my friend is the brand-new Huawei mate 10 Pro and the exclusive limited edition Porsche design may 10 this is the first time I've seen these this is the first time you've seen these of course there's been leaks and rumors but now we have the official units let's jump inside so we're gonna kick it off with the mate 10 Pro but make sure to stick around to the end because I'm gonna unbox that one also alright so there it is you can see that the bezel like some other devices has shrunk down giving you this enhanced screen to body ratio bronze mocha color to it look at this whoa it's got this sort of reflective back to it fingerprint sensor is here in the centre and above that is a dual lens camera system this here is in conjunction with Leica the legendary camera manufacturer summa Lux 11.6 so f 1.6 aperture on both lenses that's a relatively large aperture in fact it's a very large aperture and what that's gonna give you a better low-light performance and it will also create that shallow depth of field that you're used to seeing in high-end smartphone photos there's also a flash on the back here a speaker grille as well as a USB type-c port SIM card tray on this side we have a power switch as well as the volume rocker now they did something here that I'm very happy about add a little bit of texture to the power switch there are fewer missed presses in your pocket when you're reaching for volume this is a six inch OLED display a quick charge power brick alright you got to have quick charge these days this one has it a USB type-c cable you can see there also a headset here a USB type-c headset so it will plug in to the same port that you use to charge they include a case to get you up and running that's kind of nice look at that honestly not bad this device is water resistant it is ip67 certified okay so here's what the device looks like booted up here we go is now like I feel like I need to give you a little bit of background we're down here what's going on this speaker on the bottom the low end and most of the volume is coming out but then there's a little bit of high end in clarity coming out of the earpiece collectively it sounds good look at this hear that that's low-end having this earpiece the higher end the treble and so on it acts as better clarity firing at you for dialogue for watching videos on YouTube and then this bottom one for music enhances the musical aspect by adding back in that low-end that you wouldn't normally have on a phone so I think that's kind of cool I just noticed it alright the cameras so the way this works is there's data captured by both in fact one of the sensors is monochrome the reason for this is to enhance low-light performance essentially what this means for you is you can combine the data from both to create a better overall image that kind of portrait look that out-of-focus that D focused region to draw your eyes to the center of the frame look at will has will ever looked better the background in real life is it was nowhere near that blurry so Jack if I just have my hand over here I want you to look right above there it doesn't assume anything specials going on right my hands no big deal if all of a sudden I frame up this plant here watch that spot you see what happened there that plant logo came up the AI built into this phone is able to distinguish the type of object you're taking a photo of automatically adjust settings to best suit that type of object it enhanced the vibrancy of the plant there of the green now let's say I sub in this power brick here which has some text on it boom immediately it distinguishes that it's text that I want to take a photo up listen we all know what you like to do on your social media scene your Instagram you want to take the picture your fancy food I had Ryan for Perry a gourmet dish does it qualify as food oh right away jack you saw that right comes right up optimized for scenario food you can take send someone take this away let's say you're a bit of a photographer and you like to dive in and manipulate your settings manually you can still do that simply pull up everything from ISO your shutter speed of course your white balance you can set to auto they call it pro mode a wide aperture mode a portrait mode a moving-picture mode and of course video as well Wow look at that AFS AFC and manual focus you can actually manual focus on this phone by default also video stabilization resolution for video UHD 4k sixteen by nine or you can pick a 1080p mode which has a higher frame rate at 60fps Beauty level five let's flip the camera around with the complexion of a princess look at that alright now one of the cool things about this device is it can connect to an external display and when I plug it in it prompts me to switch to desktop mode you can see it will pop up in either of the two modes either as a projection of the phone modes a real time readout go into landscape mode boom or as a complete desktop experience which you can see it's loading here look at that and then you can go ahead and connect a bluetooth keyboard and mouse and interact with it much like a desktop computer or you can use the phone to become a touch control panel kind of like a touchpad and you can see I can move my cursor around with this so let's take a closer look at the specs here we've got six gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage as I mentioned 2160 by 1080p we can see we're running Android 8.0 the CPU this is a new one it's running the karin 970 now that's an 8 core cpu with a 12 core GPU built into it Huawei is stating that there's gonna be some enhanced efficiency as well utilizing the AI capabilities apparently the phone's gonna get to know you and then be able to make adjustments as it sees fit for power consumption needs and so on but all that processing is gonna happen locally on the phone so it doesn't need to be sent to the cloud alright now I did not forget about the Porsche design version of the may 10 I'm excited for this one because it's limited you have a special card in their authentic device designed by Huawei and porsche design porsche design is more than just the vehicle whoa you have a stripe going down as opposed to a cross so there's the mate 10 and there's the mate 10 for SH design the fingerprint sensor is blacked out also the trim around the camera lenses has changed ever so slightly it's a polished black as opposed to the chrome look on the mate 10 Pro so this is the ceramic look here crazy reflective in fact look at that unboxing layout right there we have a black headset to match the Porsche design we have 2 power bricks two cables type-c to type a you're a traveling man you get two cables instead of one with the Porsche version alright so there you have it the porsche design mate 10 from huawei limited edition the mate 10 pro in this mocha color here there it is the latest from Huawei unveiled here on unbox therapy [Music] 
alright guys so if you haven't been on Twitter or following the tech news recently then you might not know that something very serious happened last night I guess so sort of in exploit and it's not even really an exploit because it seems too simple it's a problem essentially on every single Apple computer running the latest software running hi Sierra you can get in to anybody's laptop without the password it's incredibly simple to do anyone could do it you could do it it's not just a local scenario where a person gets in front of your laptop and unlocks it without you knowing this could also be an issue on public Wi-Fi if you might have screen sharing turned on for example and someone can come in and potentially access your device remotely now the reason for making this video isn't strictly to show people how it happens but also to inform you so that hopefully you can make the changes necessary so you're not susceptible but also so you can share it and let anybody in your life with a macbook know that they need to update their system real quick so I'm using wills laptop he updated his to high sierra and let me show you what i'm talking about so i'm logged in right now but if i go to system preferences users and groups you'll see will is the only admin on the system but if i click this little lock in the corner here get rid of wills username and just type root all lowercase and then enter it unlocks the whole system I can do anything now I could change his password I could create new users I have complete access now you might be saying well he's already logged in so is that really such an issue well let me take it a step further for you if I log out of wills account and then just pick a guest user for example as a guest user you should have no authority whatsoever but if I go back up here now to System Preferences users and groups I hit the same lock icon use the username root again no password it unlocks the whole deal so I can select wills user now and reset his password completely I could set it to anything I want all of Wells information is available to me everything he's got in there it's a complete unlock I'm in I got access to all what are you trying to hide well but all joking aside this is serious stuff this is like the highest level type of issue you could ever run into all your passwords anybody out there with a password on a Mac running this version of High Sierra you have no security right now essentially no security now the word is that Apple's aware of this and they're issuing a software update so the main thing here is go and look on your system right now if you're on high sierra and look for a new security patch if it's there it will say in some kind of heading like important update do this right away alternatively you can change the password to the root account of your system which seems like a good idea right now so just add a password to that user that isn't a blank field obviously so there it is a little public service announcement run the update if it's there and as I said let people know all right everybody knows somebody with a MacBook so tell them they've been otherwise they're out there like a sitting duck 
you know the wireless networks might be crowded in here you might get a lot of interference [Music] [Applause] [Music] very good okay so listen I'm at the Sennheiser booth right now checking out their latest headphones Vista HD 820 this is the new headphone I think I won an award did it not it's fun quite a few or HD a twenty this is a sort of the latest incarnation of this headphone this is the 800s but now it's a closed back design so I'm gonna listen to these two and kind of see the differences but I'm gonna start out on the edge alright yeah here we go [Music] this is the the right kind of partner and this is the HDV a 20 this is gonna give you the right kind of juice of speed into a headphone this caliber you know what's crazy about these headphones is how light they are the attention there's like extended at home listening session oh I find these to be more comfortable [Music] I think I'll take this one instead of that one yeah exactly war base maybe it's just to me it's a little more possible they're gonna coexist it's not like this replaces that one one's better yeah you're right your friends right right right it's a different level right this is that the coolest looking headphone you've ever seen in your entire life probably possibly I think so that's Gorilla Glass right there and this is a sealed off closed back version of the legendary HD 800 in this case the 800s this was an open back design I mean that has its attributes to it right gives you that wise town stage an alteration in this case is closed back some thicker type of bass feeling to it I have to say for me from my ears I'll take this over this there's two options here to suit different people's taste in music I find this a little bit more comfortable it's a little bit more shallow and it's a single material there that's a deeper cushion your ear fits in there really nice but they're not heavy that's the craziest part this is probably the most exciting thing I've seen here at CES for now okay so this is a sort of like an impromptu giveaway scenario a bunch of extra headphones here for you guys I guess for whoever's here Webber can get here fast enough we have PXE 550 wireless you want a little bit more styling at the HD one the momentum there's a code word I've tweeted this out and now we're gonna wait to see how quickly people arrive all right we're gonna upgrade some headphones today say that about mr. Koller is PXE 550 or THD one what's work Spencer AC one okay all right what's up [Music] it's easy right yeah cool okay cool but do you know the cold word though Jack okay oh that was quick look at this a lot of people just got nicer headphones they can enjoy music more who knows where this is gonna go alright they're less miserable with their lives now because of the headphones that's what we're doing we're out here helping people alright [Music] this episode of unbox the Epis been brought to you by mass drop and more specifically the new HD 5 8 X from Sennheiser and mass drop in collaboration that's the only place you can get this headphone if you're unfamiliar with this series of headphones you are looking at an open back design so you get that really wide soundstage this one comes in this jet-black sort of colorway you see the Sennheiser on the top right there and the metal grills on the side this is a very lightweight headphone and it's also the most affordable in the range this is only a hundred and fifty bucks through this particular drop now often the trouble with a pair of premium headphones like this is that they're difficult to drive that means you have to plug them into an amplifier or some sort of stationary setup to get the most out of them this particular unit is meant to be easy to drive so you can do so with a device like this with a smartphone got the velour pads completely around the ear because it is an open back design there's not the same sense of isolation for people who are just getting into headphones I always tell them you know you've got to try out some open-back headphones a totally different experience [Music] all right so it's a new look on the classic they sound great it's open back it's audiophile quality without the audiophile price 150 bucks but in limited quantities I believe there's only going to be 5000 of these so if you're interested click the link down in the description thanks to mass drop for sponsoring this episode 
okay we are doing a video baby it's all about special days here at unbox therapy you know it you love it I love doing it and it's all about this this giant wooden crate I love a wooden crate a good wooden crate there's a promise there inside is something sensitive inside is something from Samsung they said hey Moo you've never seen anything like it well if you're gonna send me this I'm gonna do something unprecedented I want to use this thing for a completely outlandish setup all right should I just get inside the box oh this my friend is the CH g90 look at how wide this boxes oh my goodness Hewlett gaming monitor some Robocop looking goos 144 Hertz 32 by 9 ultra wide aspect ratio that's a 49 inch monitor what gaming monitor what HDR what nu-metal quantum dot what curve 144 Hertz refresh rate what Ryan on the couch why that monitor is cool right is 49 inches that's super wide you're like oh my goodness Lou show it to me like plain Universal wanna know what it's about let's step it up a notch now it might look like you're getting ready for some dental work but this here this is all gaming I'm hoping I'm thinking I can mount the monitor up here and get the craziest gaming cockpit ever contrived why the lights turned off on this thing oh and don't forget that it's got to have the LEDs all right so I've got a PC hooked up to this but there's three HDMI cables we could probably hook up some game consoles as well it's motorized look at this what so think about it what better place for this type of monitor than this type of setup to do it justice so let's crack open this box and see if we can get this thing mounted up skull [Music] whoa look at how why it is okay you got it where do you put this we're here haha so I see two HDMI a display for a mini DisplayPort a headphone jack it looks like microphone in and out couple of super speed USB ports a PC in as well [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so I'm in the gaming cockpit now as you can tell and I just downloaded pub G because everybody's talking about it I'm obviously terrible but that doesn't make it any less fun all right oh man I might be dead right away so it's 38 40 this way by 1080 hi all right oh yes I'm sure somebody has some kind of long-range weapon oh is it dude over there oh I didn't kill anyone I'll probably get maybe next time okay so this is obviously crazy wide it's the widest monitor I've ever sat in front of this is 49 inches stretched across a resolution of 3840 by 1080 high so what happens is you kind of focus in on the central portion of the display when you're gaming your peripheral vision is also completely filled with the game screen regardless of the style of game now this monitor does something else that's really cool which is allow for a split screen mode so it does have multiple inputs I can have one HDMI input on the left hand side and a completely separate one on the right hand side watching Netflix on the left and I could be playing PlayStation on the right TV on one side if I wanted or maybe I just want to watch Twitter while I'm gaming or streaming or something along those lines so it's kind of the best of a dual monitor setup in a single monitor without a bezel in the middle obstructing your view this has got to be close to as good as it gets I'm sitting here in this cockpit completely immersed I'm kind of excited to see how this breaks down for different styles of games I'm gonna download a bunch more I could see like some of those aircraft simulators flight simulator type racing you could probably put a steering wheel up in here and have that type of experience as well and who knows maybe even for work these guys were joking around they're like glue are we gonna be able to get you out of that seat the truth is probably not let me know down in the comments which game you would play first if you were sitting where I'm sitting in front of this crazy wide display and also if you want to see more about this entire set up as a whole just leave a like down below and that lets me know and it lets jack know and then we're going make another video that's how it works right [Music] 
back with another video you're noticing right now there's something very strange in front of me it's a tiny little box can they tell how tiny it is with a tiny little phone in fact that is a two point four five inch smartphone and the other thing you notice immediately is the battlefield 3 image on the front well you can see it's chopped off on the side it's obviously not a mobile game and probably not approved by battlefield or the developers to be used on this box though maybe that's why they chopped it off no lawsuit we didn't use the D we got to the L battlefield 3 this phone is crazy okay this is eighty three dollars eighty four dollars I bought it off Amazon it claims to be waterproof ante fall and dust proof as well and it's all in this tiny little package now the brand name as far as the listing on Amazon is hip hip hip hip hip hip ooh keep up on all of us I'm gonna put it in the description what else does it say on it alright the only specks are on the bottom here model j5 + 3g wcdma 2100 megahertz and GSM 850 900 1900 ok cool let's open this up oh I said it was gonna be tiny look at this a little screen protector included and this is the phone oh wow look at that little rugged thing there now it does have a screen cover I'm gonna remove that here you go now the screen is kind of gross looking look at this there look at that filthy is this the power switch up thought that looks like the power switch volume up and down there on the bottom you have this covered portion where your headphones and your micro USB go all right here's some some regular size phones pixel look at that fits right in there 7 plus oh my now this is kind of weird on the back there's like there's a plate with some writing on it can you see this jet it's like this subtle little writing on there but it's mirror ysf I mean that doesn't really you can't even really say that is that what is the significance of that I don't know in the top corner there I see a little tiny camera which I do not expect much of also in the box some paperwork a user manual we built our handset to give user what we believe user really want so they've also included micro USB cable I assume yes there you go you can charge it up a screwdriver you don't see that every time I guess you could open this up maybe we should I didn't expect to be doing this immediately but why not am I gonna break this before I even turn it on well how do you get a SIM card in here the SIM card is insert into the back press the knob and open the battery cover off there's no there's no knob and battery cover off that you have to split the case open to get the SIM card into here check this out so this is just like a little indent there and you'll put your flathead in and kind of like split the casing like that and it'll pop off okay so it's kind of nerve-wracking you don't say to do that but that's essentially what you have to do and then from within there you can remove the battery and you have two SIM card slots look think jam-packed it in there and also a micro SD card slot right now I'm gonna put this part back on cuz I don't need to put a sim card in right now okay it's the ones in the back that are actually the structural screws and the ones on the front are just for show these little tiny ones so it matches the bat and the reason I'm guessing they don't have them installed when you first open the phone is because they know you're gonna have to crack it open to put the SIM card in so save you the time having to remove them all right the phone itself what are we dealing with here what are we working with a let's try to boot it up oh it's booting mediatek processor okay Android that's familiar and comforting it's also kind of strange that there's no set up sequence like who set this up does that make you feel confident seeing it already set up there so the only thing that exists on the main screen here is a phone icon pretty standard Android phone app and then the remaining apps in here what do we have messaging Google settings Maps Play Store pretty straightforward I mean it is Android you can put whatever you want let's test out this camera on a small little screen it looks okay probably not for long probably not when we make it bigger I mean will can can be the judge you can getting close on that what do you say pretty dim not the best look at the fingerprints on there already now I'm gonna go ahead and connect to Wi-Fi ooh not the strongest Wi-Fi it's taking a while and these two things that it sensed already are the lights these are these lights have Wi-Fi built-in they're right here and it's got like two bars for each I see nothing for our actual network Oh No and now drops one of these what are the lights the lights are right here and they brought that there it is one bar is it's gonna work probably not oh look at the typing boldly let's see if it's even gonna connect here so it's the weakest Wi-Fi I've ever seen on any smartphone ever featured here Oh connected holy we are barely connected to Wi-Fi right now oh look at that the default home page has been set up is gmail CPM because the person that input it for this device couldn't do so because as small the keyboard is they put a pin stared at Oh can I even what can I say if they can't get Wi-Fi from we've never had a device you're the kid connect I mean with that level of Wi-Fi this is borderline useless all right let's try a hotspot from this Galaxy s8 right beside it okay mobile hotspot is on if they can't connect to this well well there you go I don't know what to tell you come on Oh Galaxy s8 full bars okay so it's totally arranged thing there we go we're connected now let's try this again I go back to the browser let's do a quick search here I'm gonna try to type out unbox therapy hopefully it'll guess how soon will it guess you and B yes I can do that oh how about the latest video look how much text is shown it's the mo stuff and then that's that's what you get is there's not you can't fit a lot on there okay now we will get a quick speaker demo out of it and subtitles pre enabled that's pretty uh it's pretty hard it's tough to see much about it I yes it's kind of unique don't spend 85 bucks on this you can get an actual decent foam for like 100 bucks like something that's usable that you can connect to Wi-Fi I mean the Wi-Fi range thing that's that's a deal-breaker on its own it's kind of nice that it's different that it's rugged but with the connectivity issue the tiny nosov the typing and so on the way you have to crack it open to get access inside the Wi-Fi thing is the deal breaker you got to be able to connect your impressing no one Oh check out my mini little phone like yeah what can you do wanna bring up some youtube or something no I don't really do that too much save your 83 bucks you know I guess that's the message here it's not often that there's a clear-cut kind of answer but I think today is that day all right don't buy the hip it boo j5 plus you probably already knew that but now it's confirmed it's been confirmed right here on unbox therapy who's bringing you the heat who's bringing you the truth uncle Lou that's who all right so we might as well try to do question time on the device here so let's bring that browser back up and the most recent video is like it's full bars right here right there on the end of the table it's down to two bars now you you can't you cannot press back dot you cannot press that dawn I broke it all right question time let's see what the people of the unbox therapy community are talking about today so here's a question from splash Myers on Twitter what do you think of the new goldish color from the new iPhones now I've seen this I mean I haven't handled it myself but it's this kind of dim brushed faded type of gold I don't know I guess I don't mind it it wouldn't be my choice would not be my first choice I tend to go for the darker color phones but hey options are good you got it working oh it just died it just turned up would you use the Lambo phone as your daily device that comes from Jay Wolf's no and to be honest I don't think it's a terrible device I saw a bunch of people in the comments saying that they thought that it was some kind of rebranded ZTE axon and I think they might be right although maybe a little more than rebranding because they've completely reworked the casing around it but if that's the phone that it is yes it's incredibly overpriced but it's usable objectively speaking which iPhone do you think has more bang for its buck is it the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 10 we've all heard that this iPhone 10 is gonna be $1,000 to start which is a lot of money now some people on Twitter they hit me up they said thousand dollars is not just not that much I love it I'm buying it I don't care that's fine like everybody you decide what you want to spend your cash on but the thing is the smartphone market it hasn't been sitting still there are many great choices out there for half that price now and even less than that can Apple continue to charge these exorbitant figures I'm not forgetting about you either Samsung with the note 8 I'm an equal-opportunity kind of guy here I think they're both quite expensive given the other options on the market so from that standpoint I think you could argue that the iPhone 8 might represent the better values all right so there you have it that wraps up this video thank you very much for watching remember if you want to be included in question time make sure to leave your questions down below in the comments and who knows you may make it into the next episode [Music] 
ah listen this product it was a Kickstarter I had my eye on it for a long time right and recently I'm browsing around Amazon and there it is sitting there it's this thing here it's the amp emove wearable motion charger normally the agenda is to like uncover the coolest stuff that's out there but every so often I bump into a product and I see a terrible rating this is one of those products worst product ever and doesn't do what it says it's supposed to charge your phone and apparently the  the phone goes down in battery life committed 61% of the reviews are one-star 61% you'd have to be training for the Olympics for this to charge your phone any significant amount are you kidding me how's this pure scam of a product legally on sale do not buy this I saw all this and I'm like geez I got a responsibility here warn you about what to stay away from I think you guys respect me and I get the sense that this is one of those moments right now nope I'm gonna reserve my evaluation this guy says he ran a 5k practice and after plugging his iPhone 6 into this he lowered his battery by two percent the title to that review is so sad POS you know what that means Jack P dot o dot s I don't need to say the words I don't think I've ever had a product on this table with such terrible reviews on Amazon let's first see what they're saying we all had the same problem our phones would die before the end of the day so many people have this problem one hour of exercise equals five hours of smartphone battery life this thing claims to be able to generate power for your smartphone based on your own physical movements so you strap this to you you go about your day you exercise you do various activities and that movement translates into electricity for your smartphone sells broken most likely sir create clean energy depends how clean you are no I what am i generate up to five hours of standby smartphone battery life per day with one hour of exercise it stores a full smartphone charge apparently the battery on the inside here is around 1800 milliamp hours meet the world's smallest wearable motion charger hold the button down and shake and you're gonna see that blue LED it lights up is that impressive probably not on its own alright anywhere you put it only extra power source you'll ever need make your own power no your power this is the device it's quite heavy here we go charging it up micro USB port here if you want to charge this up the traditional way by plugging it into the wall oh the indicator is showing a little bit of battery life that's a good thing there we go like that like that depending on how skilled you are at this particular motion your results may vary [Music] geez man this is insane I already know it's insane I haven't even tried to charge anything and I recognize how insane this is how do they expect you to put this on your arm there's an armband we don't have it in this kit here there's an accessory kit that you buy extra to go with this okay look at that charging up so it's functioning right now oh we're already down to one oh now we have none whoa those two bars wink quick it's done already that was two bars of battery what now the real question is are we gonna be able to generate some juice just by the movement of the amp II it's charging okay the charge is gone I stopped moving the amp you come on auntie [Applause] nothing poorly okay there that's a lot of shaking let's see how long before it turns off there it's gone stop charging if this is strapped to your arm or leg maybe like boom boom boom boom you get the charge icon for a few seconds I think the claim that three weeks for an active user to fully charge this thing would only hold true if you're training for the longest marathon in the world and you can dedicate your every waking day and night to running for your life they will say your device is probably faulty and try to send you another one don't bother just get a refund buy a real battery bank not this turd here that Jack it's just not enough juice if you're getting a few seconds of lightning bolt icon in exchange for minutes of shaking this thing rigorously it's just not gonna work it's amazing how in this case concept on its own even in the absence of execution was exciting enough to justify the manufacturing of this product you want to kind of encourage those people to go after that thing but this is not that thing it seems like this is more of a dream than an actual product I have a hard time believing anybody's gonna pick this up and be satisfied with it I think Mosley would be disappointed and wish you saved a few bucks and got yourself the power bank alright it's just ain't cutting it man [Music] 
so this looks like a fancy package right here I have a special smartphone in here it's an LG V 30 the new color the kind of what is it well raspberry rose that sounds appetizing when I was at CES I got my first peek at this particular device and I was like how is it that I have not unboxed an lg me 30 as you can see I've got a nice little card here happy Valentine's Day as well let's get this open what oh my whoa that is kind of cool that's cool be a no play this is one of the last remaining devices that cares about the headphone amplification on the headphone jack so that's really cool see and this is the way a seal is meant to be the last video we did the sticker was just like somewhere over here boom oh baby dual lens system up here this is one of my favorite implementations because one of the lenses is a wide-angle lens landscapes or architecture you have that ability oh cool Bang &amp; Olufsen headset right there that's in the box guys Wow not only does this device keep the headphone jack but it's actually supposedly one of the best headphone jacks on any smartphone they're using an upgraded DAC in there Oh fingerprint scanner this is also a button as well no need for a power switch on the side this one feels immediately a little bit lighter is this thing lighter than 158 grams let's say an iPhone 8 plus 202 grams and this is a hundred and fifty something so it is quite light alright so fingerprint setup time so fingerprint unlocks with or without a click and boom it's fast it's nice actually if I click down on it then that locks the device it makes a lot of sense like why do you have to have a power switch and a separate fingerprint reader pixel to excel right here why do I have this extra button here why wouldn't this on the back just be a button okay now this is a P OLED display what's the resolution well 1440p it actually looks pretty good you'll see if I scroll down here on the settings I can turn the hi-fi quad DAC on or off right from that location now I'll show you what I'm talking about regarding the wide angle the way it's represented over here is with a single tree or three trees it's not a software effect it's not a crop effect actually shifting to the other lens let's say you're trying to take a picture of your friend single tree mode that's a pretty decent image right there I switch to the wide lens and whoa look how much more is in frame it's night and day standard focal range and there's the wide one often I will carry around a moment lens just to have a wide angle shot this should be talked about more I mean it's really cool what you can do with this why not wide I mean it's really truly like having two cameras on you at all times it's unfortunate that the dual camera setup it became this thing that it turns out software can do a good job of replicating but this implementation here this is the real reason it should exist two unique focal opportunities in your pocket at all times average I would say nowhere near the razor phone acceptable let's put it that way be you know earbuds if you're into music audio I can't think off the top of my head if someone who's putting that much focus and certainly not at the flagship level experience high quality sound via hi-fi quad DAC and look at this various sound presets normal enhanced detailed live I'll select bass there's a digital filter here a left-right balance as well I mean this is something guys that you're not seeing out of the box on a lot of phones [Music] I kind of want to compare to the pixel to Excel switching Dax I'm gonna play the same song too it might sound a little bit better but expected that to be louder the volume is almost identical can we get like an over ear style headphone when you pair this with the higher caliber headphones they included in the box there's no doubt it sounds good it's it's very clear but there is something here kind of where it hasn't met my expectation and that's in overall volume you might be expecting a kind of punch you in the face type of sound the volume is comparable to the pixel 2xl it if anything the pixel 2xl might actually be a little bit louder I do wish it gave a little bit more juice there's a little bit of talk online about whether or not this DAC is being limited for some sort of safety reason so that's a possibility as well okay from a display perspective here's a quick comparison pixel to XL to V 30 you've got a galaxy s 8 followed by an iPhone 10 a little bit more blueish this is maybe a little more greenish we're talking about OLED and once you make that move to OLED that's the biggest jump you have the four displays you tell me down in the comments which is the most pleasing to your eyeballs alright so there you have it s the V 30 alright the special color for that special person in your life the thing about the cameras probably speaks to me the most my expectations for the DAC were a little bit higher v 30 are you gonna switch over what about the pixel you're gonna take the SIM card out is the dual lens worth it it's hard for me to imagine that right now but man that wide-angle thing it's kind of compelling for me I believe I would hardly ever put it on the other lens about everybody gathering there we go kablammo nice looking proper optical wide image I might pop my sim in it for a little bit but as of right now I don't think it's gonna be able to displace the pics will choo excel in my pocket there it is keeping it real with you guys alright LG v 30 nonetheless some cool stuff going on today's episode of unbox the repeat as been brought to you by the new 2018 Ford EcoSport let's check it out so the thing that immediately catches my attention here is this large 8 inch display with capacitive touch his features sink 3 and the option for apple carplay and android auto so just like that I have all of my touch controls mapped to this 8 inch display this vehicle has a 10 speaker B&amp;O play audio system check this out take the peak in the cupholder 7 different colors ice blue orange soft blue red green blue and purple so this here to let you set the mood for any occasion which is very helpful if you're a guy like Willie do this has also got a Wi-Fi hotspot in here using 4G LTE connect up to 10 devices now the other thing that that connection allows you to do is to use an app on your smart phone to control some of the car's features and functions you could set up a remote start you could lock and unlock the vehicle all remotely from the app on your phone its covert handle you open it up and check out the cargo space fit one whole Willie do back here plenty of volume you slap those down super easy so there you have it versatility in the 2018 Ford EcoSport you got the cargo space you get the tech to match you guys need to check this [Music] 
so a while back I did a video a does it suck video about an inexpensive SmartWatch 15 not 50 trying to determine if anybody should be buying these things but of course that was two years ago I need to revisit this subject matter and purchase some inexpensive smartwatches from Amazon and see if they're any good this one on the right I believe I paid 1199 for and then this one over here closer to 20 incredibly inexpensive let's find out if these cheapo smartwatches are any good or do they suck let's start with the cheap one 1199 how do they make this Perla even if it even if it's terrible it feels so lit already man it's got like this bronze color there's a button on the front it is a camera up on the top microUSB over here to charge it up that looks like a microphone beside the camera and there's a speaker in it too they put that all in there for 11 bucks charge the watch pair the Bluetooth watch to use some apps on the watch insert a sim my Jack are you seeing that a sim and/or micro SD card what is this a phone as well yeah I see an IMEI number here you're also making phone calls with this thing does this thing have any juice in it something this cheap is gonna have to be charged let's be honest with ourselves here so that one's charging up let's check out the second unit here this one is twice as much money but the question is is it twice as good oh this one is kind of more like the Apple watch I think yeah it looks a little more like an Apple watch different style class also a camera speaker unit over here a digital crown I'm not so certain that this operates the same way likely no but the back of this one comes off also inside it looks almost identical same kind of internal setup something tells me this one's dead too [Music] alright this guy has some juice now this is the cheapest of the cheap let's boot it up let's have some fun who knows this could be the killer do mine yeah yeah that's sound like Radiohead for a second it has a strong vibration to it also look at this touchscreen add some contacts yes it has a dilute because it has a SIM card slot so you could this could be your whole phone right here messaging phone book call log remote capture here's the camera was this is a little calculator in here remember a calculator watch how does that guy get a bring on into the test I know who you were who you are you haven't changed one bit started out with those tests and now now what are you calculating huh camera there's the camera right there oh my goodness it points like pop or is it point no matter what I do look at that angle insert a memory card no storage at all the old premium 8 gig there we go 8 gigs of storage here we go the elegant watch face right there I am I did it it's the worst quality photo I've ever taken in this entire in my entire history little spy cam on there how was it $11 your quote wow sound recorder we try that check check one two hello there welcome to the Dark Side of the Moon population jack that works you get an idea you're out and about you get an idea you know a little brainstorm session pedometer sleep monitor Facebook Twitter whatsapp Friesen sourcing so this thing doesn't have Wi-Fi Bluetooth what happens if I link up to this is it just show up as a Bluetooth speaker should we try that yeah connect oh my phone call from Jack hello I said hello naked noise any noise this thing is so worth 11 or 12 dollars I mean he's ridiculously worth it it means obviously not as good as the premium stuff I'm not saying that not trying to compare it to some Android wear watch I mean it's 11 or 12 bucks as a gift or for a kid or something okay let's check out this other one real quick this one's about 20 bucks like I said this one is more trying to look like an Apple watch why did it go so dim though you can also make phone calls on here you know it takes microSD it has the camera to the interface you interact with this crown oh but you want to have the like little apple watch kind of look to it that's what your that's what you pay for I guess huh so you oh we look at my little bubbles no forget this one get this guy right here you're gonna find this particular product under a bunch of different brand names on Amazon I will link the one that I purchased basically what you're looking for is this form factor the one that has this kind of shell that's a steal for $12 it's not a replacement for an Android wear device or even an Apple watch no it's not on that level is it is 11 or 12 but it's a bit of fun I like it for 11 it doesn't suck how about that not at that price point doesn't suck how well that you thought I was gonna say it sucked spend your 11 skip the Big Mac 
so so so imagine I just glitched out like that just it's like ytp more butter sus sus a brand new company a brand new concept company's called Eve look at the oh that's a poster this will look good in Jax dining room so the computer is called the V and what's special about this is was crowdfunded it was made by a team of eight people working with Scandinavian industrial designers Chinese manufacturers American designers and the rest of the project team there's 6,000 members in the Eve community and somehow with all those Minds I don't know why they say the 6,000 members but only a thousand minds it's not a one-to-one ratio mind to member mmm mmm mmm members first crowd developed computer 1,000 minds voluntarily came together to the eve community and decided each spec one by one look at that resolution 2880 by 1920 48 watt hour battery 0% bloatware they're trying to stick it to the man what are we gonna do we're gonna stick it to them arm up against the surface Pro 1599 core i7 16 gigs of ram they think they got a compelling product here you can pause here if you want to know absolutely everything about it in this little box they've included all of the international adapters so that's kind of cool Jack can update the wallpaper in his dining room BAM developed by 1000 minds with the cult-like symbol please oh they listed all that that's cool they listed all the names of the contributors this is the device whoa brushed aluminum finish on the back very important docking connector we have a headphone jack couple of type-c connectors traditional USB and over on the other side another USB port a lot of connectivity for something so slender and it looks like the speakers fire out of the top one and two ooh Jack you never saw that's that type of suede before you'd love to wear a jacket made out of that Oh Type C power brick C 2 C cable quite long and then also the pen much like the surface pen but of course black BAM fold it down carry them together rub down your sort of suede and boom that's your setup I can have this thing all the way down here tapping away the oops button this is personality never mind backspace we're going with hoops look at that made by them cross that out us whoa one of those type sees is a Thunderbolt 3 in case you were wondering it has a micro SD card reader look at the way they hit it it's in there the power switch that is also a fingerprint reader oh there we go we're in it's kind of like a V for Vendetta thing and our key he's just waiting for your manifesto right now did you know that well touch input kind of nice I want to hear these speakers that's a pretty nice display 2880 by 1920 plenty of pixels to play with here for video what about the sound though the sound is yeah man let's try some music you guys can beat a judge alright moving low closer to you I don't think you're buying this thing for the speakers I got to be honest with you Jack wasn't happy keyboards good actually it's got enough travel in the keys that you know you feel fairly confident typing on it it's not a super bright backlight there it is it is not a super bright backlight all right so God is this how bright it is normally oh so the light doesn't exactly come straight through the key very well it bleeds out to the side a little bit I wish it was a little bit more powerful you could do your sketching you could get creative very precise but I think it's gonna be popular for those type of purposes now obviously this is not a gaming laptop but because it does have a Thunderbolt 3 port you could hook up an external GPU and really boost the performance of it now the main focus here is to give you something in the same neighborhood as the surface product with a similar spec for quite a bit less have they achieved that I kind of think so pick this up and all of a sudden it's a tablet and I'm sitting on the couch and I'm sketching I'm watching Netflix if you're in the market for a surface you definitely need to be aware of this thing's existence because you can get 90% of the way maybe even more than that at quite a bit less with a similar spec the V computer as they call it from new company Eve I think it's probably worth some consideration or you could just buy it to rub the suede it's probably what Jack would end up doing how long can you do this for I'm prepared to sit here smiling for four hours that's a reference for Willy do and any of you that are doing YouTube right you [Music] 
here's the thing guys you tuned into the last episode and you understand just how wild it is now like I feel like I need to give you a little bit of background we're down here what's going on who are these people who is bow like you have no explanation who is mo you know the products they come they come they go it's a whole it's a whole thing and now we're finally getting organized you could thank mo for that okay well what's the coolest thing you saw during this whole process oh I remember this a chessboard where the pieces move on their own it's some kind of magnetic aspect that got Moe's attention as well every so often we go through the old stuff we find a gem something has been sitting around for a little while but you're here for new stuff let's go back to where we left off whatever it is is light merge cube hold Holograms in your hand holographic object you can hold in the palm of your hand and it'll superimpose through your phone onto the block that's my guess launch any cube app and then point your mobile device at the merge cube all right let's let's try it real quick oh it is a foam cube oh look at this little guy this is serious just like minecraft this is so weird Hey wow that's pretty wild now obviously there's various games for this this is not the only one so it's using the tracking point exactly it's pretty fast there cool or not cool is it the future though you heard it here will he do I mean where I mean what did you I mean I mean [Music] 29.99 oh man walmart.com 1497 though i can't find it on amazon anyway extremely urgent please hand deliver what world's first scratch-off Penn Auto lotto scratcher what it automatically scratches scratching win lottery tickets oh he put a few in here too could you imagine the guy sent me these scratch off tickets and like I and I won something significant you'd be like let's see here with the light so you can see what you're doing did I do that wrong I think maybe we go with the side like this I don't know maybe we got a deal way one guys and he's a cool idea but this is the real-life aspect of what happens here this thing I put fresh batteries in and it stopped working almost instantly not that that could have been you auto lotto scratch he was putting his best foot forward and for whatever reason this one has an issue the light works plus he's got the message on front the note of bullying and I mean seems like a decent guy oh I remember this company they sell the cheapest tablets 30 bucks or something this must be their latest well I mean I have to do a dedicated video if this is like the new $30 tablet the world needs to know who knows maybe there's been improvements make full evaluation coming shortly Oh remember this thing might have to hold off on showing you this one like they were trying to imply that it's an expensive milkshake but it's still worth it because milkshakes in general are underrated like if you have a good milkshake it completely changes your outlook or possibly in the universe Jack's off theories on diet oh do sit well with his tongue this is an unusual-looking box so let's do this handwritten no wishing you all the best all right what's up Nathan thank you very much sir yes whoa I'm boxed at pee on the side so modular you can keep clipping them together super modular so you'll be able to get two USB a USB a and C or to type C's yeah look at there's all the modules that will eventually be out a backup battery module which is always gonna be charged I think he's onto something you could imagine that as different connectors come out you don't need to change out your whole power bar you could just add on whatever it is that you need and this could be as long as you need it to be Nathan I think you're officially onto something sir keep going Nathan you get my pass here you're onto something huh the eye ring okay I've seen that before an alternative to that pop socket thing what's on the drive unbox therapy logo we have some unbox therapy branded eye rings right so this sits on the back of the phone you hold it like that I mean essentially like a ring I don't know if you guys want one of these maybe I'll give them away but follow me on Twitter I'll give these away see that you can stick this anywhere and then the ring becomes the dock Star Wars branded lots of them I have a lot of these to give away put a link in the description I'll give a bunch these away I can't possibly use all of these oh this is too cool I've had of course various external hard drives over the years dual Thunderbolt 3 USB 3.1 and it's a docking station it's your all-in-one home for your laptop this one is 20 terabytes it also acts as your docking station so it gives you an extra USB port it gives you an SD card reader which you wouldn't otherwise have so it's got the dual Thunderbolt 3 another USB a DisplayPort so it can be constantly connected to your display yeah you can see the scenario right here it will also charge the laptop over type-c so it has enough power the bolt 3 which might be the fastest drive on the planet it is dual Thunderbolt 3 SSD storage 2.8 gigabytes per second over Thunderbolt 3 but when you hear something like that and your guys like us that are shooting terabytes worth of media worth of video this gets very exciting because it's saving you time the base is magnetic that is select that's a real advancement in hardware the ability to transfer at those speeds is wild I love it all right I remember back to serial connectors and USB one we can't have that the media files are too big for case you're looking at me in 4k what do you think [Music] 
indeed there are two kinds of strength the other strength is up it fades with age and succumbs to singing then there is the chief the inner strength everyone possesses it too but it is indeed much more difficult to develop the inner strength lasts through every heat and every cold through old age and you know listen today is a very special day I know I say that often but I've never felt that way more than this moment right now I got back from lunch I was feeling a little bit sore maybe even under the weather and I took a look over here I took a look at this this box now to you it's just a wooden crate but to me it's a whole new experience inside that box is a massage chair a luxurious high-tech massage chair from true medic it's the MC mm this is something I've wanted since I saw the very basic versions sitting in the mall and I put my coin in and I sat there and I stared up at the universe well or the ceiling of the mall but I'm sore all right maybe I should just let the chair do the talking how much is this thing worth well about five grand it's time to show the world what a five thousand dollar massage chair can do for your life shall we you know when it's in a crate like this it's got to be serious the little hook there yeah and then I think I'm gonna fold this up oh-ho-ho-ho oh man it's like a capsule [Music] there we go oh man I mean your legs they're gonna fit in here this thing elevates your reclining your arms go into here this is squishing down on the arms here's the remote what do we have old a screen on the remote zero gravity mode volume up and down emergency off when the pizza guy shows up oh man is this some next-level situation right here it's not on yet but I can feel the mechanisms in place that are going to rearrange my body and that sounds dangerous but it's exactly what I need are we plugged in oh it's beginning something's happening look at a pinpoint accuracy on there oh I'm moving right now I'm going to zero gravity mode oh man oh this I can push against this whatever my length is you see that okay let's just do a quick relaxation here we go oh oh oh man leave oh boy I want you to intensity right now oh the strength I'm being squeezed oh God [Music] this is real right now this is real life I'm a changed man nothing will ever be the same what it's doing to my legs right now the squeezing of the legs is serious oh the way is gripping the my legs down there it's so powerful I don't understand how it's taken me this long to have this experience but I don't understand and I see it as a failure on my behalf that's the level of experience of having 100 Bluetooth should I try the Bluetooth okay bluetooth is now on oh I just heard a beat there speakers can you see these yo did you show them the USB port there as well throw a podcast on you know MMA our few blocks look at that from where it's in the speaker in ours New York City studio that is located just a few blocks away you can elevate the different aspects independently like the footrest section up and down or you can quickly select the zero gravity position which was the one I started out in I could pick automatic settings for whatever my ailment is recovery pain relief white-collar Shopaholic back yoga athlete mode of course there's also manual it seems to be like inflating at different points with a different intensity level of course there's the heating which you can stop or start timer and then there's a stop button should I try falling tensity or what let's try athlete mode I'm now maximum intensity athlete mode [Music] I was gone for a minute man I was hard to finally speechless like this with the holy relaxation going on here I never been squeezed like that before you know I'm not done yet like leave me alone now I'm going back in Willy dudes gonna help me with question time what's your favorite activity other that'd be my favorite activity I think it might be this now I like to play video games I like to play basketball of course hockey which is something that I do quite frequently as well I like to listen to music eat pizza you know the first day of day of school they're like what do you like to do video games and eat pizza and make music sometimes I haven't done that and way too long the thing is YouTube is like a thing that encompasses a lot of what I do so you know I don't mind that either Yugi from Twitter says how long does it take to edit a box they're people so it really depends right on how comprehensive the video is some longer so much shorter but it's always in the realm of like a couple of hours basically to start to finish making a thumbnail you know Elmer from Twitter says our hot dog sandwiches [Music] are they [Music] [Music] 
would you look at that the Samsung Galaxy S nine plus here on unbox therapy that doesn't make any sense this phone is not out yet it hasn't even been announced yet so what is this box right here then well it's what I think is a high-quality knockoff of the eventual Galaxy S nine this was shipped to me from China it's around a hundred bucks and I have three colors here look it even has this Samsung logo at the top here do not accept if seal is broken but like that's not even sealing anything the font looks a little off the real box for the s9 doesn't exist yet so that phone just turned on in the package I just heard a chime they claim it's an AMOLED display I'm very skeptical of that for $100 dual pixel 12 megapixel cameras they copied what they think the s9 box is gonna look like and it's honestly it's pretty close this wouldn't be dipped in like that Oh in the gold the power brick looks exactly like the Samsung power brick a headset USB type-c whoo reasonably high quality feels heavy enough the thinking at this moment is that the fingerprint scanner is gonna move to this location here there was a lot of criticism about the placement on the SAS 8 plus because it was placed next to the camera and it was the same shape this design here seems much better it also looks like the dual lenses are recessed a little bit more into the body of the device could you grab me an S 8 that's the old location and you can see it was next to the camera lens button layout is identical though USB type-c headphone jack is still there and a speaker you can assume that they've gone in and tried to skin it as closely as possible this is definitely not stock Android it's meant to look like a galaxy s 9 the haptic feedback has a little more buzz to it since it is $100 device there's a little bit of lag there that's perceivable you would not expect this to be at the top performer all things considered can't be though it's obvious now this is definitely not OLED from my angle this display is very dim you see look at you've got quite a bit of a bigger chin there no one expects to see that in the finished product how are you gonna get a bigger bezel now never mind the camera that's worth trying out too crazy slow shutter that's not as bad as I expected the camera app itself that's not what Samsung's app looks like I can't imagine the eventual s9 being this heavy I should try out the fingerprint scanner in that location there though because that is one of the biggest developments believe it or not this one over here got so much criticism and I love that when people complain about a particular decision and then manufacturer goes back and makes the adjustment all right so that's the gold model you would never pull out a brand new Samsung phone and have these smudges on it but I got to say the blue is kind of nice that's the black right there it's pretty close to the regular s8 black look at how much of a fingerprint magnet the real deal even is so these colors here are informed by the history of Samsung's color choices I think they called this one champagne inor but it's also worth noting that if this is the eventual design it's kind of a more iterative one it's not a huge adjustment to the previous version it's not like they went back and tried to reinvent the wheel here of course with glass you also get wireless charging capabilities and it just seems to be the direction that everyone's going in now now keep in mind these are nothing but clones these are this is speculation in a physical form it would be unlikely for a manufacturer to do that unless they were fairly confident that this would be close to the eventual model of course I do not recommend going to buy these things these things are crazy sketchy let's try to play some YouTube here and see what happens to get better battery life we have to have a bigger battery not good I want to play the speaker on the real one might as well it's right here way better night and day I mean you got to give the knockoff artist some credit though ninety-nine bucks they put the package together holy smokes but I'm sticking to my guns here you're gonna want to avoid this one and wait for the real thing it has kind of piqued my interest a little bit more in the eventual s9 now I use the SA for an extended period of time the cameras really good of course to display all signs are pointing to an improvement on the previous version and that's really what you hope to see now granted you can always be out there wishing and hoping that the next version of each phone is like a completely new and shocking thing but that's just not realistic once you have something that's good it just makes more sense to build on top of it but who knows the actual s 9 or s 9 plus it might be my favorite we'll see can it knock off the pixel to excel if Samsung's implementation of the dual system is finally the kill or implementation that everyone's always wanted this phone could crush I hope it's not a thousand bucks to start but of course time will tell as I said don't buy the clone kind of cool nonetheless [Music] 
the minute you get your hands on this wonderful portable you find yourself with an urge to express yourself now that can be mighty important not only in school but in later life too so I've made videos on many unusual crazy keyboards computer keyboards Bluetooth keyboards wireless keyboards wired keyboards touch keyboards laser keyboards if there's a keyboard I'm probably gonna look at it it's very surprising how diverse the world of keyboards is it to me seems to indicate that people have a very particular taste when it comes to their choice in keyboard what I'm gonna show you today possibly the craziest keyboard that I have ever featured it also might be the most expensive I can't remember well it's 300 bucks this thing is expensive and I have to tell you that it's called the quirky writer s a typewriter inspired mechanical keyboard this embraces a different mindset a different time period the click in the clack the war in the piece to kill a mockingbird brave new world Lord of the Flies the company is called quirky toys there's a picture of what it looks like us an attention-grabbing thing you put that in the den a glass of cognac next to it fine wood grain and the smell of leather let's take a closer look at this thing [Music] does look cool feel like I'm about to crack the code this thing is heavy hole boy look it's a real typewriter field now the switches are cherry MX blue that little plaque to it BAM this tray is if you want to use iPad or a phone this apparently is programmable but that's a throwback that's some clear steps and front makes indenting easier - typewriter days as well same with these knobs on the side LEDs along the top that I can see another button USB connector to use it in a wired fashion a traditional-style power switch on this side braided style USB cable but that's micro USB though oh it isn't micro USB connector so it's more secure look at that that's in there this will be cool like a volume knob maybe it is so this thing will work on PC Mac Android and iOS got it connected to this macbook pro over here my intuition was to test this knob for volume that's exactly what it does that is cool what does this side supposed to do I don't know maybe nothing you know this what does this do no it's enter it acts as enter a test - wow I kind of like it the quick brown fox jump over Jack what vertical scroll let's just fill this up he's right that's kind of nice so you do a little webpage scroll in there now you probably have a scroll wheel on your mouse but they're trying to market the idea of using this with your iPad you'll want to reach up and it's annoying because you're busy how about that well you're sitting over there yelling yelling and screaming and the truth of the matter is you do your research I wanted to be Tom Cruise against Matt Lauer I'm not out here trying to prescribe ritalin I am NOT gonna go out and say get your kids on ritalin it's the cure-all Matt in the end don't have but here's the point Matt don't be glee with glitter can you explain to me will what this 10 M 20 M 30 M situation is this is mapped to brightness oh they're macros are we talking macros are we talking macaroni I saw a channel the other day on trending which is a guy who specializes in living like it's 200 or 300 years ago have you seen this guy welcome to 18th century cooking I'm John Townsend and we're doing macaroni or we might call today macaroni and all right so listen there's obviously a massive novelty factor here there is spectacle here but they didn't skimp on the functionality you've got cherry MX blue switches the thing is made out of metal it compared a three separate Bluetooth devices you can use it wired if you choose to so fear about this style if you look at this and you feel inspired it could be the next Harry Potter and I think she's doing all right for himself how many books did she sell Willy do four hundred and fifty million half a billion Harry Potter books and she owes it all to the QWERTY writer s you need to know about it kaboom 
his name is Ryan and he's getting things done if you have a problem then Ryan is the warning to what level can it evolve into madness [Music] [Laughter] back in the house that's your sound effect brother what do we have Hong Kong one of my favorite places all right never been there some of the craziest stuff arrives from there so much love to Hong Kong lot whoa what is it it's all unmarked what is going on here this is so cryptic oh that's a tattoo machine as a needle right that is crazy cryptic look at that two four six zero look out Luis Hilson tagger for the good death are we putting this we're not putting this we're not putting this on are we putting this in the video Ryan that is a plain black t-shirt number two stitched here what kind of a game is this two zero four six it's a movie from Hong Kong is this a promotion for it underpants for the good death it's gonna be a tight fit [Applause] why are you backing up this is black soap this is some crazy marketing going on right now you know what well done you had me going lot is a subscription-based service which distributes a basic set of clothing footwear essential self care products accessories and media content the clothes are dispensable they can be bundled and returned eliminating clutter you know what well done to them it's one of the most creative examples that I've ever interacted with out of all the boxes that have ever shown up cool though well done next up oh I can't show them in cubes mood and utility light their little mood lights color lighting hundred lumens Wow batteries already inside whoa blind color check that out it'll slowly cycle between the different colors [Music] Germany hi Lois we are hoping you're doing well we send you is a prototype of the nano pad stick your phone to almost any surface Ryan needs your brother the nano pad suction being applied to Ryan's phone now okay good okay let's see what he can stick it to Ryan welcome to our new segment stick your phone to anything you can with Ryan and Jack it's not super sticky to your touch doing their hair with this thing stuck to the mirror for fitness like people with the form you have any form Ryan well let's just can we I what is he doing what is that oh yeah there's a form by every Sun I think this is over oh I ordered these a really long time ago these are absolutely insane are you kidding me you have a different setting for run and walk look at lower right now like a bow [Music] you know it's spring-loaded here they included extra pads here when these ones run out I suppose the tension depending on weight these running shoes aim to protect runners joints Casey in his recent video you guys are obviously gonna go gonna go let him know now people love running the body it breaks down they fully absorb the impact of each stride they are made for road and path running not designed for trail running sharp rocks can bust them up they can run up to 2,000 kilometers apparently I am pumped that these showed up [Music] like whoo good fit okay lots of padding in the tongue first of all let's just do walk mode I am NOT an avid runner I know how to run I can tell you these feel like no shoes I've ever worn before they feel heavier so in walk mode it seems like the springs are law so I think I got to switch it over ah there we go haha Wow so I push down and my weight pushes it flat but as I begin to lift my foot boom look at that makes you feel super springy too [Music] I love when you take an idea and you just reimagine maybe your problem happens to be the fact that your needs are giving out but you have a love for running play the shoe did this or that very rare that one comes in comes across the table it's a completely mind-boggling thing this is one of those things and I appreciate that goodbye [Music] 
oh hey so the list of unique smartphones continues to grow today I have one of the most unique ones I think that I've ever seen I was like I need to look at that I need to handle it it's a Chinese smartphone maker one of the biggest there is meizu and the phone is called the pro 7 plus it features two displays that display on the front and a display on the back personally I haven't seen anything like that before it's LTE 64 gigabytes of storage and 6 gigabytes of RAM for jacks purposes that's right jack is back these are the bands that are supported and they see that they can very serious seal breaking here there you go just open void all right so did they just know you you know maybe if you buy one of these if it's ever been open but then again how would you know because it's not like you don't see that on there that's a very confusing sticker the two-tone whoo bit of an experience that slides out of there you can put that on your desk and put pens in it get your pens in there brother so the phone comes out from the side like so little sim tool Oh they've given you a case with a cutout for where that extra display will be [Music] hello because you are a valued customer my staff and I would personally like to thank you for visiting our store and for your business that's why we hope you'll accept a beautiful two-piece stainless steel carving set as our gift to you just for attending our VIP event this Saturday September night a USB table type C on this end old-school usb on that end the European power brick this is something that has been the case for many meizu phones this home button also acts as your back button you tap it to go back instead of having the three button system you hold this as well for other functions it is clickable and it's also your fingerprint sensors so it's one button it does everything front-facing camera as well as a speaker the whole thing actually feels nice and well made well built the luminol around the outside here cold to the touch that's what I'm looking for I can't feel my fingers anymore I know this is where your displays gonna be right underneath the dual lens system we have USB type-c a headphone jack and a speaker you have two slots now both of these slots are for SIM cards neither one is for expandable storage unfortunately okay so the unit is booted up now as you can see AMOLED display on here it sort of slips in somewhere around the galaxy s price you can fight on Amazon I think for around 500 550 I'll link it down in the description just so you're aware what you'll ask my camera icon has an odd one I have a fairly lightweight skin on it compared to some of what I've seen online but of course this is Android you can configure it however you want once you pull down this tray here you notice it's a little bit different with the quick settings and so on so you tap it it gives you haptic feedback when it's being used as a back button what if I want to go all the way back to the home page like a home button I just click it do you swipe up over there multitaskers see that there you end up with a little bit less clutter down here because it's a single button scenario I'm going to kill you you want to see this secondary display this real differentiating factor it's also AMOLED look at that very bright very vibrant and when you flip the device over it triggers this display to turn on cuz it assumes you're looking at this side now you can program this secondary display on the back to also show incoming calls notifications and phone status whether it's playing music charging and so on oh there you go some new text messages I don't think I can open them though jack has sent me a little what is that Jack and I just turned on double tap to wake it comes back on alright so having this little bit of information I guess is kind of nice you have the steps the time the weather and so on but like the real killer function here the thing people are excited about is the ability to use your rear camera while still be able to frame up a shot because inevitably you see people out there they want to use the better camera that's on the back of their phone so they're out there kind of like this but they don't nail it so with this secondary display you just pull down from the top and it launches no rear camera that kind of behaves like a back camera can you see that look I'm gonna come in there see my face in there you guys can see yourself in there and there's a few different modes as well so there's a blur mode which uses the two lenses to kind of attempt to blur the background and then if I swipe one more time as a beauty mode to keep you looking pretty as you know I'm gonna use the original mode and I can just kind of line myself up here reach up tap it three two one and boom I have a super high quality selfie there that's from the rear camera the selfie enthusiasts out there are gonna be amped up at this particular development right here two lenses three different shooting modes going further jet look at the beard hairs Lee moly look at the detail on that that's a selfie man it's a selfie jet it's unbelievable I don't know that you want that much detail I don't know that I want that much detail but you got the detail considering the fact that you're probably offended by the level of detail I can go back here and toggle on that beauty mode beautiful Lu in three two oh my oh yes have I been softened to touch is the skin just a little more attractive you can go down here and hit this button and get even more beautiful after the fact like that's did you see what just happened there oh no the dual lens blur effect that I mentioned before first of all dual lens off big will now we turn on the blur effect I mean it's like it's a very severe type of blurring to the background there I'm personally not a huge fan of this feature in the first place because I prefer the natural big aperture when available if you want to dabble a little bit with depth of field you're playing with it now now Wi-Fi is about as good if not a little better than a lot of devices tested here so almost 34 down and almost 50 up let's go ahead and get straight into it alright the video looks good so for a basic type of installation you can have all the ambience of a colorful light without the expenditure of a Wi-Fi connected one let's try it against an SI real quick we're back to gadgets under $10 let's go ahead and get straight into it I did a video on the lot very interesting you can charge you can lamp you can do it all a little bit more clear and full than the s 8 speakers so it's worth noting so as you can see here this device comes in a couple of different colors I have the black version here but you can see a kind of reddish one that's also available there now you should be aware there's two sizes of this device this is the plus model with the 5.7 inch display there's a smaller unit with a 5.2 inch display that isn't called plus so if you're looking for something smaller with this rear screen that's the one you're looking for this unit has a 3500 milliamp hour battery 64 gigabytes of internal storage in the unit that I've got here but you can spec this up to 128 there's another model you can buy the cameras on the back are made by Sony and they're both 12 megapixel F 2.0 lenses no Bluetooth 500 instead 4.2 I don't know all right so there you have it a unique phone that's what I aim to do here this is something I haven't seen before so I absolutely had to check it out of course you are going with a brand that at least North American customers are a lot less familiar with I think for most people at this particular price point you're still gonna end up with an essay or some other product from a more recognizable brand but if you want to be a little bit avant-garde if you want to be a a trendsetter blazed a trail one thing I can say if you pull this out of your pocket people will be surprised you're probably gonna get a selfie together question time how much will could we'll do do if will do could we'll do that sounds like a question for will dude what's the answer well well do does a lot is it true that you originally created this channel to have an excuse for your wife to buy all these gadgets no comment it does help not gonna lie imagine without this channel what kind of gadget habit I might have it could be destructive why don't you bring up random celebs at your place to unbox things with you and make vids about it who would you like to see on unbox therapy let me know in the comments or tag those people on Twitter harass them tell them they need to get on to unbox therapy those celebrities like I want a list alright maybe B C is fine hey Lou do you things the move by Google to also ditch the headphone jack will be enough to push everyone into USB C headphones some days I have days where I'm like I don't miss the headphone jack at all it's no big deal adapt there's Wireless blah blah blah and then other days I'm like I go to plugs up and I'm just like oh it can be a nuisance it can be a headache you might not have the right adapter and you might not have Bluetooth headphones it still does happen for the space that it takes up maybe just throw a headphone jack in there just like they did on the SI so Google will ya probably do it but I think there will still be some manufacturers that understand we want that versatility and they'll keep the headphone jack around a little bit longer I think possibly even the next generation of Samsung devices might hold on to it and I think it would be a good move if they did why not [Music] 
recently there's been a push up completely wireless earphones earbuds headphones and so on you have seen the mini Jack connector vanished we are now living in a wireless reality now one of the issues with that wireless headphones are expensive but today I've got some good news for you or maybe it's good news I don't really know for a set of wireless earbuds that wait for it are available for $9.99 Evan t5 to be more specific now yes that is a promotional price but that is why I am bringing you this video wireless Bluetooth and for a while as it goes are like a hundred bucks are we really living in a reality now where $9.75 can get you decent wireless earbuds I'm gonna find them these are from Aliexpress and it's really the only place you could get the deals that I'm referencing it's only for a day so I've coordinated this video around this incredible price quantities are limited at that $9.75 so go check that out I buy a lot of stuff over there I do it frequently if you just check the shipping it's surprising some of the stuff is actually warehouse in the u.s. now so you get it quicker than you might expect now these ones are from a company called blue do I've featured their products in the past it's the turbine te standard verse inside you've got an ear hook ear tip user manual case and a charge cable and then on the back here there's also a microphone built-in so you can answer and end phone calls I'm having a moment here of trying to figure out how you manufacture a wireless earbuds this packaging you put it all together free shipping you do it for nine seventy five what's going on here how is this possible it's incredible it seems magical maybe it is here's a little travel case a flat micro USB cable to charge up the headset so this headset comes in a few different colors like a silver and black but it also comes in yellow blue red green oh my goodness I should make you aware of another deal if you're not a fan of earbuds style bluetooth headphones this one is also on sale but I believe there's even fewer quantities of this in China there's a special happening right now at this time that you're watching this it's kind of like Black Friday but they call it singles day and as this crazy deals on products it's a huge sales day a link of both in the description but this one here goes from like a hundred bucks down to thirty I'm just letting you know some interchangeable ear tips as well as ear hooks so this is a style that goes around the neck you've got the inline controls and microphone charge port up at the top teehee oh okay straight into pairing mode connected just like that $9.75 a phone it's really incredible alright let's see what we're working with you that's ridiculous I'm happy that we made this video because this is ridiculous nine dollars and seventy five cents right now when you're watching this video for these that's a steal that's ridiculous that doesn't make any sense there's got to be a loss happening for this particular promotion walk into a store and see what you get for nine seventy five then I get it giving you nothing they give you a boot out the door you did nothing for nine seventy five it's not the best headphones I've ever heard obviously alright you don't expect that I didn't expect that I got to reevaluate the way I'm looking at a lot of different things in nine seventy five seriously these ones are surprisingly loud also I didn't know what to expect opening these up I thought they might be a good deal but it turns out they're a better deal than I thought so go check them out cuz it's a temporary promotion over on Aliexpress for this singles day promotion there's like all kinds of things that are on sale it's like thousands of products so make sure after you click the link in if you add these to your cart take another peek around also I'm sure there's plenty of deals to be had just make sure to select the country you want it to ship from from the drop-down menu and you'll see different ship times it's like Black Friday before Black Friday and you can get earbuds like this for nine seventy five can you get a happy meal what's a happy meal can you get a combo at McDonald's these days I'm telling you it's close you

all right so you guys know that I've been raving about the speakers on the razor phone it's the best speaker I've ever heard of smartphone but unfortunately a reaction it doesn't give you the experience that I had so I got an idea let's try somewhat scientifically to figure out how much better how much louder the speakers on the razor phone are compared to some other flagships I've got the razor phone the no dates the pixel to Excel and the new iPhone 10 I'll be testing all four of these devices using this little guy over here a checkmate SPL meter and it can measure the sound pressure produced by these various devices so this will give us a numerical readout for each of these smartphones scientific perspective on the performance of these various speakers so what do you say Jack should we boot this guy up and get her going of course we should I mean you're not gonna stop me at this point I have a little stand here because with a smart phone you sit in front of it you hold it right here so the measurement should come from your location okay so let's kick it off the pixel to excel so I'm gonna use a tone generator to keep it as static as possible so that the reading will be accurate across all of them this guarantees that we'll be able to track back the GB readout on this device across various spectrum it's gonna go from 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz which is the human audio spectrum now I do want to give you a warning this thing here it can get pretty loud turn down your headphones if you need to don't go blowing your eardrums out all right I don't want to be held responsible so fair warning if you need to turn the headphones down do it all right so here's test number one this is the pixel 2 XL [Music] [Laughter] [Music] pixal to excel it peaked around 93 DBA okay next up I have the note eight and the exact same position here we go [Music] [Laughter] [Music] around 90 91 on this so something to keep in mind with the note obviously the speaker fires to the side it's not as loud either way I also noticed a greater fluctuation in volume across the frequency range on this particular device if you're listening to music the drums and so on it's all down in the lower register and then other things like voice are up in the higher register so what you're really looking for is volume available across the human frequency range I have the iPhone the iPhone 10 so this has a similar speaker layout to the note but you also get a little bit of audio coming out of the earpiece here we go [Music] the iPhone made it as high as 96 which kind of surprises me it also spent more time above 80 DBA then the note series did it was registering louder across a much wider range of frequency but what I think is happening here is that the earpiece section is contributing to some of the higher frequency stuff and adding volume back there impressive figures here from the iPhone 10 all right last up is the razor phone each of these speakers has its own app and I'm speculating that this should beat those devices based on my ears but let's go ahead and see what the science says [Music] here's the cool thing about this particular phone not only do you see it crack 100db a few times but you also see it live in the 90 Plus range and the high 90s across a wider spectrum so when it comes to our perception of quality audio what our ears are really looking for is volume and punch in all those places so the fact that it could have performance registering in frequency ranges that the other ones couldn't implies the quality of speaker and the quality of amplifier the surprising finding here is how good the iPhone 10 is as well gets pretty loud and sounds pretty good of course none of the other flagships are in the same neighborhood as the razer phone not like i expected them to be if you want the ultimate audio experience in a smart phone you're probably looking at the razer phone so there you have it for high-profile flagship smartphones tested using my handy little SPL meter if you guys enjoyed this type of test let me know by leaving a thumb down below subscribe for more videos like this and i'll catch you on the next one 
it's a big day it's a big day what you guys have to know about me at this point is that I've been a fan of this lineup of devices since the very first one I've said it many times here on the channel we're talking about the pixel more importantly the pixel - with this early look I've got a bunch of them in front of me in fact I've got all but one the pixel two over here and the pixel two exhale on the far left slightly blue probably my favorite color of the bunch although the Panda set up over here with the black and white not bad either now the regular pixel on the left here a familiar set up if you've used the previous version of pixel this is gonna be super comfy for you when you pick that up on the excel things change up just a little bit the display which you'll notice here it kind of curves around a little bit now one thing that's different about both these devices compared to other flagships is these forward facing speakers which are an immediate standout for me because I'm always asking for it with this rush for devices to become bezel lists speakers kind of take a hit they gotta find another place to go with the stereo setup look at this I'm sitting here like this we now have the search bar down at the bottom of the screen as opposed to the top so the smaller of the two the standard pixel it's got a 1080p display and then stepping up to the excel you have a 1440p display they're both OLED tech there's really no excuse now to not have an OLED display there's a new feature now we now have the squeeze functionality so I can just grab onto this here and launch assistant let's listen it to me already no Bixby no Bixby on here I just squeezed this and it launched it I'm squeezing the frame of the device and it's launching assistant we've got the fancy wallpaper with the waves coming in beautifully and if you look very closely you can see Jack vacationing right over here there is what is towel sunscreen this orange buttons look at this a little flare now something they did is they put the colorful button on certain models so here you have this kind of bluish green but if you don't want that you could just pick up the black version and this is the executive look no fancy stuff with the buttons now the fingerprint sensor it's where you expect it to be on the back here kind of matte finish where you might expect to get a bunch of fingerprints it's not happening so much on these ones now if you're completely against the idea of fingerprints you could go for one of these two colors over here even up on the lighter section of the glass you can see they don't really pick up so much now all these devices feature USB type-c as you can see here and quick charge giving you potentially seven hours of battery life in a fifteen minute chart [Applause] what you end up with is just a little bit more clarity a little bit more resolution in the voice is this the first pixel or Nexus device with stereo speakers facing forward I believe so isn't it I've been using these things for a while you can correct me if I'm wrong but it's what I've always wanted it seems pretty obvious you want them firing at you this is I can't think of another device off the top of my head right now that's still doing this to this degree to large grills and they're coming at your ears now obviously with the bigger boy you're gonna get a bigger battery as well so that's something to consider let's go ahead and test out this fingerprint scanner real quick where is the perfect spot what is the perfect unlock scenario this is pretty close having it on the back we all want these giant displays there's no room on the front anymore okay fine truly this is where your finger falls anyways this is where you hold it you you don't even really think about it to be honest there's really no mistaking that location so you just land on it I know Apple they're reluctant to put this scanner on the back they got the Big Apple logo there this is really where it should be that was actually very quick now something I like to do to make it even more seamless is sometimes I'll just register the same finger twice now let's Lock this guy and let's see what happens oh my goodness okay it's very quick it's a very fast one sensor on the back get used to it the face thing trust me it's not gonna be what you expect think about paying for something what is all this about there's some what the cashiers standing over there here and then no no no kaboom no what about the camera you're wondering about the camera cameras very important this one here has a bigger aperture than the last which should allow for even better performance in low light three-two-one kaboom that's our image whoa we equip peek around and of course there's you guys in the lens there and there's me looking at you looking at me okay let's try this again whoa okay by default check this out look at this see how there's motion to it so if it detects motion within the frame or movement within the frame you can actually toggle motion on and see a few frames of movement prior to the snap now there's also a portrait functionality which will simulate this very shallow depth of field that you've seen on certain phones certain cameras this one is capable of emulating that effect from a single lens system so okay you know what I got a good idea look at that she's ready for portrait mode so through machine learning it's capable of distinguishing the edge a portrait essentially and it can distinguish what's important in the frame and what you might want to blur bye-bye bye-bye time Jack why don't you keep this thing around anyway all right guys so there's this feature called now playing in which assistant can pick up a song that's playing in the background and tell you what it is on your notification pain like on the lockscreen but it's doing it locally on the device it's not it's not like sending that data anywhere in fact it'll work on airplane mode oh it got it like you got it like it I don't know if they can see it cuz it's in these look at that it just grabbed it now playing so I can remember the song that came on maybe in a public space at a bar or something like that oh this is good and boom going to the notifications and it's sitting I can download it or do whatever I want it doesn't end there with assistant there's another cool thing which is new the ability to trigger device level modifications right from within assistant so for example on the old pixel if I launched into assistant and said start my hotspot I would just get some instructions from Google on how to do so but on a new one here I'll launch it was squeezed start my hotspot [Music] turning Wi-Fi hotspot' on BAM do you like that stop my hotspot what more do I need to say all right we're living in the future okay so both of these models are gonna be available in 64 gigs or 128 gigs of storage and unlike the previous one this one has I P 67 certification for water resistance and whatnot alright so there you have it the pixel 2 and the pixel XL 2 showcased in various colors and let me know down in the comments which one would you go for which color do you like the best gonna be the Panda it's gonna be the all-white is gonna be the black words are gonna be the sorta kind of slightly blue remember though this was just the hands-on a quick hands-on on the day of announcement but I'm gonna have a more extensive video I'm gonna I'm gonna use one of these exclusively for a while do an unboxing and a review so make sure to subscribe to that also hit the notification button so you don't miss it it's gonna happen here first on unbox therapy that's where [Music] 
so this is one of the most requested devices from you guys - you know today they've been hitting me up you've been hitting me up Lou where's the love for Xiaomi we saw you did every other mix but what about the og what about the originator of this style that you claim to like so much that is the Xiaomi mimics and this is the new one the two 256 gigs of storage little personalized message I can't exactly understand it but I assume it's something nice somebody down in the comments can translate that for me whoa all right we are inside the package I am surprised to find out it is the North American power prong that's kind of cool Type C on one end and the classic on the other nice weight to it a promising feel in the hand as they like to say in the business oh and a case there's also an adapter cable type c2 mini jack sim card tool we have a black one and it still says something on it here mix designed by xiaomi would you look at that holy that is a fancy looking device this is about as elegant as it gets these days maximum clasp you can see the camera in this location here mix designed by Xiaomi power switch as well as the volume rocker above that the dual SIM card tray right there on the bottom you've simply got your type C port as well as your speaker that is where your speaker will live okay here we go the almost bezel is smartphone and the front-facing camera is hidden down there as well I'm gonna do the fingerprint though let's do this part lift it a few times so it prompts you to pick a theme right out of the gate I'm not sure that I mind that I think that's a good start so the display here is 2160 by 1080 it goes brighter there we go that is max brightness right there quick toggle settings are quite a bit different than what they would be in stock android they've got a white backdrop here so the reason that this back is so I mean because that's a ceramic back Gorilla Glass 4 on the front Android 7.1 out of the box it's got a snapdragon 835 and the primary camera has a 12 megapixel sensor with an F 2.0 lens the battery is 34 hundred mill amp hours and it does feature quick charge 3.0 now like other 18 by 9 devices you end up with black bars on each side it is a pretty nice looking IPS and of course IPS tech has some great off-axis viewing angles what about the speaker though okay for dialogue in YouTube that's actually louder than I expected I do want to check it with music of course oh okay you know what is pretty clean and it's pretty loud got a bit of a speaker on it let's see what we're working with here oh wow very quick response to tapping the shutter not a half-bad image either now generally speaking when you have a lower megapixel count it means greater sensitivity at least hopefully and you get a little bit more light in there so that might be more useful for some people as opposed to just having more pixels Conor McGregor as well let's try to frame him up real quick and check that one out there's Jack as well tilt shift effect a straighten effect a quick snap mode gridlines if you like there's even an option here to enhance low-light photos automatically fingerprint shutter use the fingerprint reader as your shutter button and you didn't even make adjustments to the contrast saturation and sharpness and I can go in and not just change the color temperature from warm to standard and cool also go in and change contrast from automatic I can increase it or I can go to a more standard more subdued mode in video you can trigger time-lapse or slow motion and then within the settings here you see I can go all the way up to 4k also so let's do that now so we are now recording some 4k video on the mix too so I move around here through the jungle hey grab focus whoo it does and of course I take a look at you guys horse Jack as well the friendly Jack when you trigger the selfie mode so you simply flip your phone around like this it'll frame you up just like as if the camera was a long top that's a bit of a sell feature I try the fingerprint I feel like I haven't tried it yet fingerprint oh it is the second I touch it it's I don't know it might be the fastest this the fastest I've ever tried holy it's the second you touch it that is so satisfying it's the fastest that I've ever tried the build quality is is very high-end the speaker better than I expected soft we're not close to stock I'm not too happy about that of course you could always alter that the fingerprint situation is a bit out of hand you pop the case on say good night to finger prints this is kind of soft I don't she don't mind this case there is something about this particular design here is a rectangle it's mostly screen no weirdness going on so I hope manufacturers continue to go forward with this it is worth mentioning though that this device is converted price is a little bit expensive it's over 500 bucks so that's something worth considering but I have to say my initial findings are pretty positive this type of build in the past was something you really only expected from Samsung and possibly Apple and now here it is in the me mix 2 and other phones as well but it's definitely here 
all right new phone flagship from Samsung the market leaders its s9 time and s 9 plus the larger brother with the dual land set up what's the name of this color what I have in front of me here titanium gray is never just great now I know it also comes in a kind of lavender color is it midnight black and then there's a blue as well right coral blue I actually kind of like this one I was trying to put fingerprints on it be like they show up a little less than on the black color but at this point you probably saw a couple videos on these but you are like you know what I got a sea loons video I want to see what he's saying I want to see how he feels obviously this device it's a bit of an iteration on the last one there's no overhaul happening here that's ok though I used the s8 for a very long time it's a comfortable hold it's a nice little size well here's the thing in the meantime in the past year or so the competition in this marketplace I mean it's kind of changed to compel you to spend your extra dollars no price increase here in fact depending on how you purchase these and which carrier you purchase them from you might actually see a price reduction I take that as a response to what's happening in the marketplace and the quality you can get at lower price point a couple things about this device that I like straight away the movement of the fingerprint sensor underneath the camera lens something I complained about on the last one what ends up happening you end up putting your finger in many cases on the camera lens and smudging it up sometimes manufacturers listen you can see the evidence right here other than this you'd be hard-pressed place and s8 beside this s9 and really tell it actually we have an s8 well could you grab they're very similar in appearance now that could be a good thing that could be a bad thing and from the back the movement of the fingerprints got better spot easier to reach the speaker grille which looks different now the single channel opening there on the old one the grille looked a bit different the reasoning for this is an improvement in the audio performance of the speaker so Samsung acquires Harman Kardon and the thinking there and improve in an audio performance from the speaker unit firing audio from this location as well as on the bottom all the rest of the stuff that you love is here the headphone jack is here USB type-c it's here the SIM tray with expandable SD card storage who doesn't like expandable storage who doesn't like options display OLED very pleasing to the eye is curved edge I'm still a little bit undecided on whether or not I'm completely sold on that idea because when you're watching content you lose a little bit of it right it wraps around the edge which it looks cool but does it do you enjoy content more or is it just a novelty factor I'm not a hundred percent decided on that recently I've been using the pixel to excel a lot now everybody knows this is not the greatest display in the world and you can kind of see how the white is represented a little differently I think it's kind of interesting having this phone out compared to this one these are both 850 bucks these things are competing head-to-head one of the main reasons this remains in my pocket is the incredible camera that brings me to the camera on the s9 Plus for the first time ever has a variable aperture F 1.5 or F 2.4 F 1.5 F 2.4 conor mcgregor figurine here this is f 1.5 so the plant in the background is a little bit more blurred out compared to f 2.4 i think for most of you this comes into play just in low-light situations if you need more light it'll trigger the larger aperture the portrait mode as well which i tested earlier this is actually a wide selfie mode there's a front camera wide-angle selfie and it's guessing via software where the edge of the foreground or the subject in the foreground is but as you can see it did a pretty good job there's mo right there let's see here edge recognition around his beard is pretty good as well I think this one it stacks up kind of nicely as of right now against the pixel 2xl it's also got this super slo-mo mode can shoot up to 960 frames per second so you tap the record button to start a recording and the slow motion starts when something moves within this square [Music] 960 fps is pretty wild look at that flame it's not crazy high resolution 720p it's a nice little gimmick you put that on social mediums like what are you doing how'd you do it it looks cool so yeah now what about the speaker in general here see if I try to cover up the audio on the bottom I'm still getting it through the earpiece here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I want to grab the old s8 over here [Music] it does sound better it ain't razor phone territory it's a little more full it's a little more pleasing okay look at the options in video mode it's unbelievable you HD you HD 60fps you go up to 4k 60fps that's pretty cool I mean we might as well so this should be 4k stabilized pick up this guy right here oh it is nice and stable you see the fingerprint nightmare I have a solution for that in a moment of course we pan around we see the squad we see Jack over there you know what's the take what's the take away here I told you earlier I used the essay extensively take away from me is pricing I'm really interested in the pricing component you guys know that if you watch my videos I'm looking for value you go to work you work hard for your money so I'm gonna treat you right do these devices as of right now do they justify the cost you're in the territory of the Google pixel product if you're gonna compete with the pixel then you gotta bring the top-notch camera because that's one of the reasons a lot of people are picking pics you're gonna get the fastest updates if you're on the official Google hardware I mean there's no other way around it the fit and finish here quality the glass back I'm not such a big fan of course you get the wireless charging with it kind of sacrifice appearance once you start to get fingerprints on it look at this so you have some options alright you go with a case or you go with the skin check that out that is the brand new D brand camo skin and you can probably tell no fingerprints plus it like has this cool shifting effect depending on the lighting I mean I don't care which phone you have so if you want the black camel you're gonna have to head over there I don't know maybe they're gonna run out I heard me I hope not but anyhow like look at that that's kind of cool for me personally I don't know what this thing can really displace the pixel in my pocket can the wireless charging get me back the variable aperture maybe I use this a little bit more and I'm just like wow that's gold I can't live without it the audio probably not enough for me right now the improvement there it's tough at the moment I'm a little bit undecided but I'm intrigued I think this phone has a real chance to be a major player in something that I could could really recommend for right now I'm skeptical this episode of unbox the repiy has been brought to you by Dollar Shave Club you're probably wasting time with your shaved goods going to the supermarket looking through the shelf you don't know what you need and then once you finally select it you're probably paying too much

so recently all the hype has been about the new iPhones the iPhone 8 and of course the upcoming iPhone 10 and then various other devices that have launched recently but of course there are many Samsung fans starting to imagine what the s9 might look like in the current landscape of smartphones so I did what I could by teaming up with concept creator to imagine to build a concept of the next s9 and s9 plus from Samsung now I've done this in the past I did this for the iPhone 8 where him and I teamed up previously and we came up with a kind of a radical redesign if you will you should go check out that video if you haven't yet it was kind of like my dream iPhone 8 it was more angular it was just different now he and I came together to do something similar for the galaxy s 9 if that's even what it ends up being called and we really wanted to make sure that it was going to be something different so we decided to go with a modular design the s9 and s9 + modular now of course you've seen modular devices from other manufacturers probably the most popular being Motorola MOTO with the moto mods so the whole goal here was to imagine what an s9 with modular functionality might look like and of course we went ahead and improved the camera the screen to body ratio and various other aspects that you will see in the clip that I'll be showing you in a moment now the key thing to remember here is that this is a concept it is not officially authorized by Samsung in any way the purpose of it is to get your wheels turning about what the ultimate s 9 &amp; s 9 plus might look like so I do want you to get involved as well make sure to leave a comment down below with your perfect specifications the features that are most important to you what you think the next-generation Galaxy S device should look like now one more thing before I unveil this beautiful concept video make sure you go and check out subscribe to concept creator on YouTube and who knows maybe some of the stuff we drum up actually ends up in physical devices so make sure you go support him as well all right that's enough I've blabbered on for too long jack please go ahead and roll the clip [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this episode of unbox the P has been brought to you by honey the browser extension for Chrome Safari and Firefox it helps you save money when you're shopping online now this is a very easy thing to add to your web browser it's really one click and then what it does is scan the websites you're accessing for current coupon codes so you can save money when you never even knew there was a deal happening so let's say for example I'm on bestbuy.com so when I click on the honey extension up here it'll bring up all of the various coupon codes that are available on Best Buy right now but it's not just Best Buy there are plenty of sites supported everything from Gamestop to Target Walmart Kohl's Home Depot Lowe's and probably my favorite functionality is on Amazon and from within here you can see the historical price of an item so you can see if it's actually a deal or not maybe it was cheaper a few days before even though it looks like a sale you know you've seen this before where it's like 100 bucks off but it's like is it always 100 bucks off it'll go a step further where we'll allow you to set up what's called a drop so if you're waiting for a price drop you can add this to your list and you'll get a notification letting you know that it's time to buy alright so there's plenty of people using honey already around five million members so you're missing out by not joining simply you head over to join honey dot-com slash unbox therapy I'll put the link at the top of the description and you'll be surprised you're probably overpaying for some things and just that price drop feature alone on Amazon is worth it to me free extension through the link in the description once again join honey calm slash unbox therapy 
so this is kind of interesting I mean I've never seen something quite like this before I know at first glance right now you're looking at this you're like it looks like some kind of old school watch actually with this little display on it and the boxy design I believe it's the first watch that is also a power bank for your smartphone it's called the Wat actually the company here they manufacture one of those 3d printing pens I did a video on it a while back power bank in a watch is this the future there it is that was a simple unboxing experience like they said it's got a kind of old-school look to it it reminds me of like those calculator watches that were super foxy from Casio that's even boxier look at that thing it also says on the back designed in Belgium made in China Gorilla Glass an aluminum body and an 1800 milliamp hour battery so to put that in perspective that's a similar battery capacity to like an iPhone or something like that also in the box we have a little user manual here a flat micro USB cable to charge this up and then a couple of other universal adapters here this is like a tube style AC lightning for the iPhone also type-c okay so that's the one I use alright let's see what they say here quick charge discharge rate of 2 amps that's decent I should mention the strap looks to be interchangeable by pulling on these pins here let's see if this has any power out of the box here oh it does cool on video you're gonna see this display as sort of refreshing in real life you don't see that it's just a static image to be clear really tight fit in there I feel like I should mention that see how the connector is not exactly lined up with the cutouts a little finesse necessary here to get this in there you've got to kind of angle it I mean it will go in eventually but I can't imagine that that is what the finished product will be like apparently they're shipping mid February I guess I'm one of the first people who has this so once you get it in there now we'll connect the pixel to excel oh wow instantly yeah see that right up there we are now charging I mean that's pretty simple although somehow my battery life on here went to 0 right away it could be since it just ship that needs like a full charge up but not it is currently charging in the pixel to excel right from the watch now it is kind of strange again I'm not sure how much of a prototype this particular unit is but the only way to identify the two ends of the cable and the direction it has to go in is this white sticker is there gonna be some other kind of indicator on the cable hopefully Lix can address that all right so that's what it looks like when you're charging something from the watch like a smartphone if we plug in a power source to the watch then let's check out what happens we see a charge meter here sitting at 25% so you will know when it's fully charged now I might as well try it on well that that is a that's a look I mean it's not crazy you know what it kind of reminds me of like one of those Dick Tracy watches back you know you know Dick Tracy is he's a detective with a bunch of gadgets and he had a watch with a microphone and a speaker on it that he could talk into this is pre cell phone guys this was so cool I'm not so sold on it just yet maybe in future versions of this particular device it can kind of be rounded off a little bit more on these edges just slightly less boxy and listen if you are constantly running out of battery it is kind of amazing to have 1800 milliamp hours sitting there on your wrist I think overall it's a cool idea cool concept it seems kind of beta right now if you look at my G shot here the volume of it is similar but this one is just super comfy because of the way that they've engineered the wristband and so on maybe this is an idea for Casio they're all about these crazy rugged utilitarian watches put a battery in their small one charge up your devices I don't know guys you still gotta carry the cable around it this is a tough one for me to figure out baby one day it's all Wireless and maybe you just I don't know what do you do if you put your phone it's all is this kind of it's a little crazy for me I think I'll be heading back to the trusty old g-shock and probably still carrying the battery bank cuz I got to keep it real with you guys and that's the truth of the matter jack on the other hand I can't speak for him or can I this episode of unbox the era P has been brought to you by nest now you know these guys because you've seen their crazy popular thermostat I recently installed one here at the office thing is unbelievable it learns it knows what you like but today it's all about the nest secure the new product this is an alarm system in a box we have the nest guard main unit to nest detect sensors and to nest tags the guard is a simple keypad with a built in motion sensor and a loud alarm the detect knows when a door or window opens or when someone enters a room and the tag is so that you can arm and disarm the entire system without the need for a code you can just tap on your keychain and boom you've disarmed it or armed it on your way out that's what it looks like nice and simple and of course a keypad on the top look at that little guy right there wireless set-up stick this to the door and boom you have a door and motion sensor and then this little guy goes on your keychain you can see the QR code for easy setup this will now show up in my nest products I have the cameras the thermostat and now the guard so there's three different settings you can have the alarm off completely you can have it set to home and guarding it knows you're inside the house so the motion detection is off but the window or door sensors are on or fully armed so that everything is active I can see that the alarm is currently off and the motion detection is off I can turn it on gives me one minute to exit the space I'm gonna get out of the way and then come back and trigger the motion we'll see this thing go up [Music] in the entryway I see everything that happened there alarm went off and so on and the time associated with it this is cool you can do a cellular backup for some reason there's an issue with the Wi-Fi integrates real nice with the other nest products so if you have nest cameras and that's the thermostat this thing plugs right in it's all in the same app and you end up getting more out of each of those devices when they're combined thanks again to nest for sponsoring this episode if you guys want more information on the nest secure or other nest products you can click the link down in the description [Music] 
so it's probably no surprise to you that I'm a little bit of an enthusiast when it comes to headphones over the years I must have tried hundreds of headphones and I'm always on the lookout what is that next perfect best headphone now there's so many different headphones on the market everything from audiophile at home listening open-back headphones noise-cancelling headphones earbuds fully wireless earbuds air pods in front of me right now is what I think is the new chin every day carry put it in the bag take it on the airplane headphone this is the PXE 550 wireless I mean you can use it wired as well adaptive noise cancelling headphone and that's an important part of the title right here on the front of the box just regular noise cancelling headphones are a little bit annoying to me reason for that is because a lot of them are locked into one form of noise cancellation either on or off these ones they can adapt on their own up to 30 hours of battery life collapsible yes I wanted over the ear headphone but it's got to be portable you're wondering wait how does he know so much why does he have such a strong opinion about this headphone it's in the box though no it's not alright I told you it's over here I've been using it okay I had a strong intuition that this was gonna be the go-to so I was like let me pull it out lose it for a little while and let me confirm that it's the go-to touch panels on the side very intuitive you can even double tap for a talk through function and that's a cool little feature so you can hear people around you without taking the headphones off very intuitive for skipping tracks swipe forward swipe back volume up and down now coming back to the versatility thing you're talking about Wireless you're talking about using it with a cable you're talking about an airline adapter 1/4 inch adapter and a travel case many different ways to listen and the remaining features over here Bluetooth 4 2 NFC pairing tap it to your phone and just forget about it aptX HiFi sound noise guard is actually using four different microphones on this headset of course also a microphone for you to speak into if you're using this to answer phone calls and so on alright so it's out of the box and this is the little travel pouch as you can tell that is a slim little form-factor right there look at that little thing tiny and then there's a pouch with all your adapters in it I tested out the cable as well unfortunately had to use an adapter with the pixel 2 XL inline microphone right here a little control button there as well in case you don't want to reach up and touch any side panel honestly there's something small here that just really it really turned me right on okay because it's how the headphones turn on nevermind a switch you just fold them out and flip them like this like you're gonna wear them and then a little voice comes on power on I mean how genius is that simple you never forget to turn them off we have a hardware control for the amount of noise cancellation from zero all the way to one and then 50 percent in the middle also in effects button depending on what you're listening to you can press this guy here and switch the way that the headphones perform and then lastly this is probably my favorite switch inside of the ear cuff a dedicated Bluetooth switch so you know if bluetooth is on or off no interpretation of that look bluetooth is on great ok now I feel like I need to put this on to explain why this might be the ultimate right here I put this on it's a nice seal around the ear look at the shape of this ear cup ok it's a shape of a human ear you get the most streamlined form factor less material lighter weight these are crazy light weight no purpose is to be able to enjoy either music or movies or saw for extended periods of time if this thing starts to dig into your head what does it matter how good it sounds came in the other day will had his pair on I said well what do you say me yeah I don't even notice it that's what he says ok so it's not just me nice cushioning on the headband nice cushioning on the side good isolation here you can immediately tell the difference from talk through verses noise cancellation so I double tap over here talk through activate I can hear my own voice and I can hear what will singing I could go up I could order the Frappuccino I got the headphones on they still assume I'm relatively anti-social so we don't have to get it to attend any conversation about you know it is sure cold out there you know I mean we could do that to the niceties you got to do it every so often alright then you just tap back turns it off starts playing the music and so on alright now of course you still need to listen to them they've got an app now cap tune so you can tweak these things to your liking you have your noise guard selection right here which is set to 50 at the moment but I can toggle that back to go down to 13 I can go all the way up to 100 right I can do it with this switch or I could do it with the hardware switch I could turn it off completely that's one of the things that always killed me with noise cancellation headphones is what if I'm at home and it's quiet first of all why am i using all this extra battery and then second of all why am I in the fishbowl right now and this is important to just being able to see the battery life remaining but it doesn't end there you can use this as your music player as well select from a number of different sources there's also an EQ built-in with a bunch of different settings hip-hop to rock to flat we do a custom EQ for these things as well so the FX are on top of the EQ that's what that FX button is for on here you can go from club to movie to speech to director so this is really important you want to get the best out of a movie you want to get the best out of your music right you probably want some more low-end a little more thump on the music side but then you go to the movie you want a little bit more speech you want it to be intelligible you got the options built-in alright it's time to listen to some music here I'm gonna throw a couple of different genres at these babies right now we'll start with some hip-hop and the club FX setting now you have the volume settings on the phone but don't forget you can control from here hi there I'd like to order a Frappuccino macchiato by if you listen to hip-hop you're not gonna be disappointed here alright sealed back low end especially with the hip-hop EQ settings and the club setting on the FX is what you want let me go for another genre I mean that's it what are you gonna do you're gonna sit here you're gonna watch me listen you're gonna be happy you got these you'll be like finally I knew what to get because Lou tried all the headphones and then he landed on those ones I mean you talk about you think about the different features that I showed you here you add the Sennheiser sound to that package that's that well thought out I don't you notice it on my head you could catch me like Rip Van Winkle on the with the Greybeard it could be years later don't even look around it's simple just get these 
so I recently got back from Las Vegas I'm sure many of you know that follow me on social media follow lungs over here he's over there in Vegas I filmed one of my favorite videos I got together a bunch of prominent people in the tech community here on YouTube put them on the spot I said what phone is in your pocket what ensued was just a lot of fun it was interesting it got me thinking all of us in that video I mean it really wasn't there wasn't a lot of variants right there were two phones that were selected as the pocket phones for that group of people for three pixel to excel to the iPhone 10 I guess I just spoiled the video but I don't I don't I don't I don't in that space we are not representative of the entire globe and as I've said in past videos we certainly are not representative of the value choices that exist in smartphones because for the most part we get incredible access to this stuff it's hard to fully understand the mindset of different parts of the world or people who are restricted in that sense and simply aren't looking at $1000 phones and so that brings me to today's video it brings me to what is likely my favorite phone at about half the price point of other flagships and that's this one right here the 1 + 5 t world's first the exclusive unboxing video of this color let's take a look from the front looks a lot like any other but when you pop it out of here the vibrance of the very first red phone from oneplus this is called lava red in conjunction with the sandstone white and of course the original black color also in the box you're pretty used to this by this point a case that they include which is great you have the - charge brick and then of course one plus USB type-c cable to charge it up which in this case look at that it's a little it's matching its the red on red action now I know what you're thinking all right you say Lou I don't get it it's just another color what's the big deal and you're right like that's completely fair but because of this new color this new release I thought it'd be an interesting opportunity to sort of recap some of my thoughts on the value smartphone space especially as a follow-up to the last video that we published and yes of course I remember the iPhone video where they came out with a red version and I was like what's the big deal well we doing but because this one is coming out relatively close to the launch of the original I feel like it's a little bit more prominent so it's the lava red it's the sandstone white the dedicated red button and then the other buttons done in black this one is a little bit more grippy whereas this version here a little bit more polished and then don't forget Star Wars version which I made a video one really cool unboxing experience of course if you're powered on you're getting the Star Wars branding you're getting some wallpapers as well as a slightly different interface here to match the color scheme then of course the original midnight black depending on the lighting it kind of turns a little more grey a couple of sandstone and a couple of anodized finishes so that's the 5 T in lava red the latest addition to the 5 T family and as I said earlier in this video I think this is a great opportunity for me to recap some of my feelings about this device going into 2018 so this device here in my last video I mentioned I've been using it it's the pixel 2 XL fantastic camera stock Android experience and so on while this device is not $1,000 it's still relatively expensive at 850 know that the 5 T comes in at $4.99 so a question that should probably be asked more often is which is the value point is this thing worth almost twice as much as this one and just like I did in my iPhone 10 video I had to really think about now granted this one doesn't go all the way to a thousand so it's a slightly different evaluation for me personally I think the takeaway here is that at least with these two devices I'd have no problem recommending either and having switched over and used the pixel to excel for an extensive period now there are actually a few things that I miss from the 5t the face on lock on a 5 T is unbelievable it is rapid it is seamless there's no gesture no swipe like there is on the iPhone 10 now I understand you can't compare those two devices one to one because the technology they're using for face unlock is different but ultimately for me I feel like it comes back to user experience and when technology is seamless and invisible that's when it's at its best so the face unlock is incredible under but if you're not into that guess what options are good you still have the finger sensor here which is incredibly quick as well add on to that and experience is very similar to stop Android and now you can start to understand why even at 499 this is one of my favorite phones out there now the color here with the lava red that really shouldn't be the motivating factor of course choices are good and generally speaking multiple options is something we only see or at least frequently see in the premium space it's actually kind of nice to see options emerging at the $4.99 price point color wise style wise and so on and even limited editions like the Star Wars one another thing I'm missing about the 5c having used the pixel 2 XL now the headphone jack I'm on an airplane sure I got the wireless ones but then you know the adapter remember the adapter you switch the adapter you switch phones frequently and so on I mean I don't need to tell you we've had this conversation about headphone jacks in the past but the 5 T has it that's that's the bottom line pixel to Excel doesn't iPhone 10 doesn't think about it it's there and then the last thing that I missed from this device having switched over is of course this dedicated switch the textured switch on the side to allow you to quickly switch between three different notification modes from do-not-disturb to silent to the audio ring and so on that's convenient it's added functionality in the pixel choo XL doesn't have so as you can tell my love for the 5c has not shifted even though in the last video I said the pixel to excel was the one that's in my pocket I think I'd be a perfectly happy man using either of these 2 devices although for my taste I would probably stick to the midnight black listen no camera on the planet on a smartphone can touch the pixel 2 XL right now all right you heard that from me you've heard that from others but if you're on a budget and you want something close and you want something that actually has some functionality that the pixel 2 XL does it I mean you need to be looking real hard real long and hard at the 5 T now available in some extra colors there it is revisited the 5 T possibly probably the best $500 phone on the planet right now think about it this episode of unbox the P has been brought to you by this chair yes that's right the Novo xt from human touch I don't know is it the world's greatest massage chair probably I'm somewhere in outer space right now have I ever felt this good before this young probably not the lower back the calf muscle you know this unboxing life it takes its toll on something like this well it's a game changer it's certainly around here now if the Novo x key is a little out of your price range you can also check out the I joy massage anywhere or the I joy active 2.0 massage chair these are more affordable options that will still leave you feeling like a new man or woman thanks again a human touch for sponsoring this episode and making me feel at least 10 years younger I might not look it but I feel it I'll have the relevant links down in the description you need to you need to think real serious about this one good luck and so well 
so today I've got four gadgets that I think are pretty cool and a little bit unusual at least a couple of them so that's a quick intro they're all around or under 50 bucks let's start out with what should we start out with let's start out with this one crystal wireless speaker Alley giant tele giant it's a Bluetooth speaker it's actually see through this isn't the first time I've looked at a translucent speaker and it's one of the coolest things I've ever looked at on this desk I don't care ooh it has a texture to it the glass you would have on a shower stall or something like that auxiliary in as well also a base port on it so hopefully the sound is pretty good high-quality auxiliary cable hello there that's me all right yeah that's red now green blue remember it's only 50 bucks [Music] bass port is actually working quite nicely it's not just visual it's actually functional that CV just went off fifty bucks I think it's a bit of a deal for 50 the powerup darked convert your paper airplane into a jet Konnect your powerup dart control it with your smartphone crash through carbon-fiber body we're gonna have to obviously test that 25 km/h this is it right here whoa this piece is the magical part you see the antenna right here and the propeller oh there's multiple models invader model oh wow you can actually fold these up is that landing gear some sort of balancing piece a different cover for the front end Willy do here he's gonna do the construction while we move on to the next product the Browse Buster this thing is wild one of my favorite videos I've ever seen in my entire life this thing claims to keep you awake when you're starting to drowse off when you're driving you get the lean going you put the window down you slap yourself whatever you need to do you have a coffee this thing claims to somehow stimulate you combined with modern technology its uses impulses on the acupoints on your earlobe to maintain your brain's proper fader frequencies in weight through your earlobes so that that can't happen okay this is it this is where the magic happens a carrying pouch this is completely in Chinese so I'm gonna just have oh there we go English the first smart device with CTM acupuncture and moxibustion ever comes to the market it's good for drowsy driver but may not be good for those suffer from narcolepsy all right so if one of these that'll clip on your seatbelt like that that's a bit of a look oh it's a little tingly oh wow I am definitely not sleeping Wow Oh baby I did not expect that oh yeah wow that's probably better than a shot of coffee it's tiny little electrical shocks but consistent like what is this shock therapy uh get over your will you're trying this one the shock King himself Oh oh yes painful dude you couldn't fall asleep with that going on no no no that's busting your drowsiness oh look at the people I might eat that in my car I like this Hannah cool it works it would definitely wake you up yeah button for impulsive volume adjustment I don't know if you're getting how much you choose to get oh oh oh that actually hurt well there's that's the maximum I [Music] want Jack to try and sell Jacky all right thanks well thanks and the last thing I've got here the adventure tape adventure tape was invented so that you're always prepared for the unexpected it is a tape isn't sticky to the it isn't sticky to the touch at all but it is sticky to it self-repairing bicycle parts with it washing it it's completely reusable the thing exploded and the strength of this tape was responsible for it Jack brought me a 25 pound weight that is very heavy wow that's stretchy though this looks like less weight than it is that's 25 pounds folks it doesn't feel like it's gonna be able to lift it up the tables gonna be destroyed I think I'm gonna go back here getting very thin oh can you see that whoa I thought for sure it was gonna smash that's 25 pounds even though it seemed out it goes back exactly how it was boom I didn't overlap it nothing I don't know man it seems like these guys are for real this ain't no electrical tape is some serious stuff so go check out their Kickstarter video I think this is cool Wow look at this little guy the landing gear Willie do with the beautiful construction click that on there's an app that goes with it here we go whoa Oh jack check it out the steering see that all right here we go [Music] that's an outdoor toy Hey [Music] it's not like a quadcopter drone situation where it can hover it needs a runway it needs some speed and even if you mess up your plane you fold up another one you get yourself a Willie new and you fold up another one [Music] [Music] as a little project I I think it's just kind of cool it's kind of fun and you could make an unlimited number of these paper airplanes so that's the powerup dart that's 45 bucks I think it's kind of a cool little experiment a cool gift so there you have it four unique gadgets I thought there was some pretty cool stuff in there if you want to check out anything that was featured in this video check the description once again shout out to Willie dude for his participation a real sensitive spot for anyone but especially for a guy like Willie do you know what I'm saying I don't know what I'm saying 
in our pockets can our phones is an 11 Bionic chip with a built-in neural engine to prosper Madison yeah we're back oles right great the perfect time to talk about unlock now the neural engine is specialized hardware built for a specific set of machine learning algorithms this is another example of the incredible collaboration between the hardware and software teams it's only possible at Apple the neural engine is a state-of-the-art ultra-fast processing system it uses a highest density computing ever it's a dual core design it can perform over 600 billion operations per second and it's used to the real-time processing of base ID recognize what's it but for all of us us it's just super easy and fun to use Omar - when you set it up I think in instructions it tells you how to move your head around in the camera so if si he can recognize your face and that's it you do that once when you set it up and face Aidid learns your face even if you change your hairstyle you decide to put on glasses you're wearing a hat so you do it up any way you do it face ID learns your face it learns who you are and it adapts to you as your face changes over time let's say you start to grow a beard it works in a day it works at night and the teams work hard make sure the face ID can easily be spoofed by things like photograph what's that hey Ethan gone and worked he little mask makers and makeup artists in Hollywood to protect against these attempts to beat face ID these are actual yeah there's no one like the engineering team to train the neural networks to protect against them in face ID says that it's not edible the team's worked hard to protect your face thing guys yes yeah I don't know should be there your face state is protected with the secure Enclave and Al everybody oh you put it is unlisted processing is done on iPhone 10 and not sent to us but I can maybe change it from here we require user attention to unlock that means if your eyes are closed you're looking away it's not going to unlock now how do we compare that to touch ID how secure is it well there's no perfect system not even biometric ones but as we said earlier touch ID is the gold standard for consumer device biometric protection and the data for touch ID has been one in 50,000 for a meaning said the chance that a random person could use their fingerprints online your iPhone you can use been about 1 in 50,000 anything glitters on those days so what are the similar statistics for face ID one in a million [Applause] the chance that a random person in the population could look at your iPhone 10 and unlock it with their face is about one in a million okay of course the statistics are lower if that person shares a close genetic relationship with you so for example if you happen to have an evil twin you really need to protect your passcode where your sensitive data with a passcode hopefully you don't face ID also works with Apple pay so to pay for things you just double tap the button on the side you look at iPhone 10 to authenticate and hold it near the payment terminal to pay it's that easy fast intuitive simple base ID also works with third party apps third party apps already support touch ID and they'll work with face ID so apps like mint one password eat rave all work with face ID so face ID it's faith on face authentication for unlocking your iPhone and protecting your sensitive data it uses the innovative to depth camera system it's trained with neural networks it's easy to set up it learns your face and it adapts to your face over time it's aware of your attention it works with Apple pay and it works with third-party apps this - def camera system is incredible technology and it's gonna enable so many great new user experiences the first one of course is face ID but the team decided to create another great experience with it as well this is a fun one it has to do with emojis and we use emojis to communicate with others and to express emotion but of course you can't customize emojis they only have a limited amount of expressiveness to them so our team created something called an emoji these are animated emojis these are emojis that you control with your face in emojis track more than 50 facial muscle movements they've been meticulously animated to create amazing expressiveness you just watch this can you the way you create and share an emoji are right from within Apple messages you said a little late where are you well you can pick from a dozen different animated emojis to share and express whatever you want Express for family and friends though iPhone 10 is packed with innovative technologies that enable new user experiences I'm really excited to invite out Craig federighi to show you I phone 10 in 1 it's like to use it for the very first time great everybody Wow I'm absolutely thrilled to be able to give all of you your first live look at I phone 10 this is a phone we've been dreaming about for a long time but the reality of it in your hand it's it's really something epic so let's take a look here is iPhone 10 now unlocking it is as easy as looking at it and swiping up and you know let's try that again oh-ho-ho let's uh go to back up here and get right in so here we are and you see this expansive okay guys to be clear for a second stream went down we're back with part two so if you're coming from part one just pick up where we left off all that was really covered was the facial unlock the way that you unlock the new device is gonna be via your face they have some new technology they claim it's incredibly secure and unlikely to be cracked that's what they covered in the amount of time since the stream was down swipe right up let's take a look at web it just looks unbelievable edge to edge on this display and your photos of course are just gorgeous as well let's jump into this one just amazing [Applause] now video of course is unbelievable on the super Retina display it looks great in portrait and in landscape of course this is HDR video just incredible looking now Phil told you a little bit about multitasking on the device let me show you I'm just gonna jump into Matt if I want to move between my applications I can just swipe up and stop my apps all come in I can get out of them with the tab just lift it's just that easy and we have a great shortcut as well you can actually move back with clean apps just by swiping along the bottom like this it's really easy now you may be wondering about control center and worry not right where your status indicators are in the upper right hand corner you can just swipe down and get a control center from anywhere it's that easy now let's take a look again at face ID because unlocking your phone is just amazingly intuitive you just raise it look at it and swipe right up to get started [Applause] but now it's also incredibly fast so I'm just gonna do that again I just raise it look at it swipe I don't have to wait and it's also really really smart so let's say I wake my phone and I'm not looking at it stays locked but once I give it my once I give it my attention well it unlocks and I can get right in it's really cool now base idea is also great for Apple pay so I've been at the register I can just double click on the side button I'm authenticated and I can get in just like that now the true depth camera behind face ID isn't just about authentication in fact we've extended AR kit with some incredible new face tracking capabilities that provide a whole new class of augmented reality experiences now we've been working on one with snapchat and I'd like to show it to you now it's gonna launch in you see it builds a mesh in my face and now I can just select a mask the tracking is just unreal check out this one now look at the detail over the eyes incredible metallic reflections the quality of the tracking it's it's just stunning [Applause] now of course many of us like to communicate with emoji and with an emoji you can now breathe our own personality into our favourites it's available as an app right inside a messages I can just go right in here and it immediately starts tracking me so I can make whatever expression I want like and just pick that up and use it as a sticker drop it on my message like that we also let you manipulate these in full-screen you can audition your favorite so there's some really great ones like the kitty cat is so expressive and ferocious it's a happy puppy check out the physics in the ears the pig if we've got a chicken and the Unicorn mythical creature favorite of the startup and if you were by chance wondering what humanity would do when given access to the most advanced facial tracking technology available you now have your answer now these can be so much fun you're gonna want to share them unfortunately we let you record messages I'm gonna record a message here for Tim hey Tim I'm not sure what the protocol is here but I'd like to call dibs on the box for my favorite emoji which one do you like hey Tim I'm not sure what the protocol is here but I'd like to call dibs on the box for my favorite emoji which one do you like now you can send it with just just a tap and it appears there's a looping video right inside the transcript we're really lucky for our grand finale we might just get a response back from Tim oh here it is let's uh let's take a look take me to your leader wait a minute Craig I am your leader let's wrap this thing up [Applause] so that is your first look at the new iPhone 10 and the amazing experience with the true depth camera and an emoji I think you're gonna love it thank you very much [Applause] Thank You Craig now let's talk about the amazing cameras in iphone 10 iphone 10 has dual well 12 megapixel sensors dual cameras both a faster sensors wider sensor it's just like an iPhone 8 as new color filter these camera leaves been getting used to the nephron 8 aperture on the wide-angle camera and a faster F 2.4 aperture on a telephoto that lets in 36 percent more light to the telephoto camera but the big news on the camera in the iPhone 10 is it as dual optical image stabilization that means is is both the wide-angle in the telephoto ends that's a lot of magnets moving around in a very small space but it helps with compensating for handshake and to take better photos and videos in low-light there's also a better quad led two-tone flash that is twice the uniformity of light on our subjects so let's look at some photos taken from the backside camera an iPhone 10 this is absolutely beautiful great dynamic range detail low noise is a beautiful photo the textures are simply stunning now there's zero shutter lag and that helps to freeze motion so we can get a photo like this look at that blue sky with low noise it's absolutely to die for though is delivers low-light performance so now you can get incredible low-light images like this with the telephoto camera as well as the wide-angle an iPhone 10 is fantastic the portrait mode feature that we all love the iPhone 10 you get great portrait modes especially in lower light an iPhone 10 supports the brand-new portrait lighting feature as well that's again a photo taken right off of iPhone 10 not retouched in any way with a stage lighting effect dropping out the background [Applause] iPhone 10 is great for photos it's amazing for 4k video and like iPhone 8 it's tuned for a our applications as factory calibrated cameras the new gyroscope accelerometer the performance advantage of the a11 Bionic chip cpu GPU and ISP and IARC it is tuned for iPhone 10 now the backside camera that we use so much is not the only camera of course on the iPhone we have our front side cameras well and people love to use those for taking selfie photographs and now with iPhone 10 and it's true depth camera it really delivers a breakthrough in the photos you can take for selfies because now with selfies you can take portrait mode photos as well and it also supports portrait lighting all through the front side to depth camera [Applause] and people gonna be blown away but the selfish you can take with the iPhone 10 this is absolutely beautiful of course everything we've seen is powered and I contend by the amazing new a 11 Bionic chip we talked all about an iPhone 8 but it's worth hitting on the highlights again because there has never been anything like it a 64-bit six core designed 4.3 billion transistors to high-performance course for high efficiency cores our new second-generation performance controller that uses all six cores at once our first Apple design graphics processing unit the brand new ISP that improves autofocus the video encoder that has real-time motion analysis while you're shooting video the knurl engine and of course the secure Enclave to protect our face ID data all this performance absurds you expect does come with the histor battery life so I think it's important to tell you that we've increased it yes it lasts [Applause] gang hardware Socrates worked really hard to deliver two more hours of all-day battery life to us so Wireless just like iPhone 8 iPhone 10 is also built for a wireless world it is cheap charging through the glass back and it will work with the Qi charging devices like the ones that we mention away from Ophion Belkin it also worked with third-party cheap devices that our chief certified there are a lot of great devices they're gonna start to come to market particularly because of iPhone 8 iphone 10 but we also think we can make the wireless charging experience even better our team wants to create something I think all of us we're gonna want to use I might actually help move the entire industry forward but we're gonna give you a sneak peak of this idea right now I'm sure many of you do this I do this have a lot of Apple products I love them and use them all day long I charge them at night you're plugging your cables you plug in your chargers you take those cables and charges with you on the road when you travel well we think we have an idea of how to make this a better experience and here it is it's a mat that you place your iPhone 8 or iPhone 10 down and it just starts to charge and there's a beautiful new interface it doesn't stop there you can place your Series 3 Apple watch down on it and it starts to charge as well while he's charging can place your ear pods for the optional new wireless charging case on it and it starts to charge as well they all charge in the Superman why is charging finally the system has a great interface they intelligently work together and communicate with each other to manage the charging through one more efficient charging system this is not possible with current standards but our team knows how to do this we call it air power [Applause] we hope people love it that encourages others to create or advance solutions based on technology like this we're going to be working with the chief standards team to incorporate these benefits into the future of the standards to make wireless charging better for everyone so look for the air power charger next year so that is iPhone 10 it is the future of the smartphone it is packed with many innovative features huge list we won't go through them all they add up to a new better experience we're so excited about iPhone 10 they created a beautiful video to tell you all about it for more than a decade our intention has been to create an iPhone that is all will display a physical object that disappears into the experience this is iPhone 10 [Music] developing the Forman display together defines a whole new integration making a boundary between the device and the screen hard to discern the custom OLED panel was engineered to fold and seamlessly combined with the external surfaces mechanical buttons give way to touching gestures there's no home button a single swipe takes you to the home screen a more responsive touch system means the gestures in iOS 11 are more fluid the polished stainless steel band reinforces the water-resistant or glass design this new glass formulation their most durable ever in a smartphone enables for the first time wireless charging our new true depth camera system contained within this tiny space uses extraordinary depth sensing technology to let you unlock your phone with a glance we call this base ID it Maps the unique geometry of your face with over 30,000 invisible dots this data is analyzed by the mural engine on the a11 Bionic chip the first of its kind your iPhone now recognizes you even in the dark and will adapt to your physical changes this makes your face your secure password so with just a look you can all enter Kate your phone or use and will pay the true death camera also enables new experiences like bringing emojis to life by mapping more than 50 facial muscles in real time so you can be happy or sad or cross both the front and rear facing cameras now have full train mode and for the first time you can actually define the light in a scene based on fundamental photographic principles portrayed lighting produces the effect of real studio lighting on the back the dual camera system is completely redesigned it's made even smarter by the a11 Bionic chip with machine learning the camera detects elements in the scene to optimize the image before the photo is even taken the camera we use every day mail delivers so much more and as iOS becomes the world's largest platform for augmented reality it will redefine what's possible [Music] this is a fun time they know how to do that maybe they know how to do that part that's for sure throwing money throwing money at the screen works hard to make iPhone 8 an iPhone tendon the most environmentally friendly manner possible arsenic-free display glass mercury-free displays their BFR free PVC free beryllium free but now made with a low carbon process for their aluminum design and they're highly recyclable with their materials really proud of that less so I like to say it every time iPhone 10 also comes in two configurations 64 gigs and 256 gigabytes the price here came tonight all right well Bungie starting on October 27th they begin to ship on November 3rd so this is the future the smartphone shipping this year so this is our lineup for the holidays now every year we say it's a great lineup for the holidays and it is but this year is really special it starts with iPhone se iPhone 6s iphone 7 the new generation iPhone 8 and the futuristic iPhone 10 ten years ago when Steve introduced the world to iPhone he closed with a quote from Wayne Gretzky it said I skate to where the puck is going to be not where it has been Steve said that's what Apple does we skate to where the puck is going to be and that is what iPhone 10 is all about thank you doctor [Applause] I found 10 this really is the future we've made a great fun new ad that I'd love to show it to you [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] that is iPhone 10 thank you thank you poof so what a morning we've had Apple watch series three with cellular which gives you the freedom to go anywhere you want with or without your iPhone Apple TV 4k brings the magic of the cinema straight to your living room with incredible 4k and HDR content iPhone a a beautiful glass design incredible cameras wireless charging a 11 Bionic ship and of course powerful AR capabilities we think you're going to love it an iPhone 10 the most advanced iPhone we've ever made the incredible new design face ID true depth camera system and more powerful technologies than we've ever put in an iPhone before it really is the future of the smartphone and we began this morning with some inspiring words from Steve one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there we work really hard at Apple to create wonderful things and we hope you love what we've introduced today I think Steve would be really proud of them I'd like to thank everyone at Apple who made today possible I'd like everybody an apple to stand up that are here representing their teams from hardware and software and services please stand up in operations are amazing retail employees and everyone that works so hard on this theater and on Apple Park one of the great things about this theater is an unbelievable hands-on area it is the most beautiful hands-on area we've ever had by far and I would encourage all of you to join us there and get your hands on these wonderful products thank you so much for spending the morning with us thank you okay all right there it is folks clapping applause the whole thing that you saw there the whole thing I guess that for the most part they did that that was kind of expected because of the leaks because of the rumors and all the informations available to mock-ups the videos that were made by myself and others but you gotta say like you have to admit when Apple puts on an event like this they just they kind of know how to do it right they very few mishaps a few little stumbles here and there but ultimately a slick presentation in an effort to extract those dollars from your pockets now some people have speculated but that iPhone 10 X 10 however you're gonna reference it they're calling it 10 anniversary and so on they love the Roman numeral stuff it wasn't the $1200 that that people had rumoured it would be for a starting price but you know even at $9.99 it's going to be out of certain people's price range of course Apple has those other products that are available to those individuals who want something for a little bit less but it continues this trend towards these very expensive smartphones you guys saw my video about the no date where I was like listen for 930 bucks you can get a devices 9/10 of the way there maybe nine and a half tenths of the way there in the galaxy Si and the question here like in this particular scenario it feels like there's more of a gap between if the new iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10 because you don't have the screen to body ratio that you get on the more expensive version and there you know there's certain there's certain aesthetic choices there that don't exist you're kind of buying an old piece of hardware at least from a design perspective when you buy the iPhone 8 granted they put glass on the back and it has wireless charging now it's faster and so on but you're still holding on to something that's essentially the same as the old one so they've taken a different approach in order to get that extra money out of you compared to Samsung I still don't think we're in a place where we're a thousand dollar phone is a possibility for everyone that's just that's just the the truth of the matter granted in places like North America where many people have their their devices subsidized by the contract they sign they're not paying a thousand bucks up front but if you if you do want to own your device and buy it outright a thousand bucks is a is a big number you know it's especially when you consider what's happening around the five hundred dollar price point from alternative manufacturers I've got to hold this thing in my hand I've got to evaluate it you know I'm gonna do that and you know I'm gonna break it down for you so as soon as this stuff is available I'll be featuring it here on the channel if you're not a subscriber go ahead and become one right now turn on notifications because I'm gonna give you the lowdown the realness when this stuff actually hits the mailbox and I unbox it for you here on unbox therapy thank you for joining me on this live broadcast this is part 2 if you missed part 1 go check it out we had to split it up there was a little break in the live stream it went down for a moment but I appreciate everybody who joined I appreciate all the super chats that came in the chat that was awesome and now it's up to you let me know down in the comments what do you think about these new devices will you be buying one pre-ordering one and if so why which of those is the perfect iPhone or maybe no iPhone at all maybe you got your eyes set on one of the new Samsung devices I want to hear what you have to say then again and we'll catch you on the next video later guys you 
This is going to be a fun one. Look at this, multiple components on the table. I'm undertaking a little project here today Well, we are This is a thing called the Mantis Experiment with the idea of an external graphics card on your Macbook Pro Anything that supports Thunderbolt 3 Its referred to as an eGPU An external graphics unit The reason you would hook something like this up to a laptop Is to get desktop grade Graphical performance On a system that can be mobile Razer, they have their own unit that you can add to their blade laptops Which kinda operates in a similar fashion But up until this point, they haven't been too many options for people on Mac Laptops There's a wide variance of mac books Some of them more powerful than others Some that can really benefit from a set up like this. This thing is not really meant to go with you anywhere Acts as a hub For not just your graphics But also some other important peripherals This is for the graphics card 3 USB 3's Ethernet cord,  thunderbolt 3 Not just for data connectivity It also can provide the 87 watts of power that your macbook pro wants to charge This is a single cable set-up You simply detach that one cable Don't need to worry about a power brick or anything extra 2 more USB 3 ports So that's a total of 5 x USB ports on this thing So you can keep your peripherals connected to this now you don't have to worry about ports on the laptop itself now you probably noticed this amazing looking box over here Graphics cards always have the coolest looking boxes a VEGA 64 card These are the units that are going to ship in the iMac pro therefore these should work on the latest MAC software without any driver Will how much did I pay for this I think I paid like 600 bucks for maybe I'm going to show you how this thing works this side panel just pops off no screws just like that thee power supply unit that's for mounting either a 2.5 inch hard drive or a SSD And the SATA connector for that drive is located right over here now I've heard  the fan can be it bit noisy for some   of course you could swap that out and then you have your graphics card slot right here that's the Important spot some of you might not know but you can also install windows you can do a boot camp situation on a MAC book pro oooo look at that o my Jack attack even you love something like that three different display ports and a HDMI this thing will be for the graphical performance of your laptop Without being connected to an external monitor So we have the card installed over here now And then a single thunderbolt 3 cable which was included in the box Going to to this macbook pro here Now this one is running Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.1 There's a lot of talk about compatability issues with devices like this But on this version right here we got a prompt immediately saying "External GPU detected, log out to begin using the external GPU" It's charging up too So as of right now we are running off that desktop grade graphics rather than the internal graphics of this macbook pro Alright, so you may have noticed I've got a different laptop now I was using Will's and now I'm using mine A little bit of time has passed Because I've been playing with this thing, tweaking it a little bit I really wanted to place it on my desk And using it for a slightly more extended period before reporting back This Graphics Card setup that I have here Is about as native as you can get while running 10.13.2 This card right here The Vega 64 is very power hungry This is a 550 watt Power Supply In here how is that really going to work with this particular card This card can want more power than what that's capable of So I've actually gone ahead and ordered another power supply, an 800 watt power supply to deal with this. I'd reccomend going with the Vega 56 instead of the 64 It's a little less power hungry and therefore slightly more supported Anyhow, I've got geekbench up here on the display I can actually test each GPU independently to start off let's do the Intel HD Graphics 530 that's in my laptop. Here we go It's scoring 19,642 On the OpenCL score, MacBooks without discreet graphics, without their own AMD cards just the Intel graphics Are gonna benefit the most from a set up like this cus they're working with relatively weak graphics to begin with Next up we're gonna move to The AMD Radeon Pro 460 Let's see what this can do 48,251 alright now last up and the most exciting AMD Radeon HD Vega 10 XT prototype who cares what it's called Let's see what it can do Ok, Boom I've got as high as 170,000 on this particular score A huge improvement here with Desktop Grade Graphics And the reason why it will be meaningful for a lot of users. You want the portability of a Laptop with graphics performance of a Desktop This kinda gives you both Now there's a reason why think like this have become popular on systems like Razer and now through products like this one they're trying to bring a more universal approach not just for Windows computers but in this case on Mac as well This is still a bit finicky it's not completely supportive. You're doing this at the moment at your own risk There you have it, there's the mantis venus With An AMD Vega 64 working on a MacBook Pro I think it's pretty cool, and quite frankly it's destroying the figures my laptop can produce on it's own I'll have the details down in the description. Also let me know. Do you guys like this type of video? Did it get too technical? Or are you into it? Would you like to see more? Let me know with your thumb down below, and I'll catch ya in the next one 
[Music] Dannan internet no no no somebody knows what that's from do you use a deer and end dananana net or is it no no nono not-not-not and that was it done oh no no no is there a dirt at the beginning or is it all none I've got a smartphone today and there's been an influx in smartphones recently you know they get a little less attention some international smart phones every company every brand every variation and I like variation is good selection is good a little more RAM or I like a slightly bigger screen smaller screen something close to a stock OS or less or maybe in this case a bigger battery who doesn't want a bigger battery will you want a bigger battery no you want a bigger battery Jack you want a bigger battery Lou you want a bigger battery we all want bigger but you want a bigger battery batteries are good okay we can imagine a universe in which unlimited battery life exists a sort of battery utopia fancy seeing you in here until then to get better battery life we have to have bigger batteries I did a video recently on this oukitel device that is a beast which had a 10,000 milliamp hour battery in it but that thing was huge that was like a weapon so today I have a phone it's got a six thousand milliamp hour battery it's from you the phone he's never [Music] 6080 milliamp-hour 18 by 9 aspect ratio so it's got the new the slim design that everybody wants 2160 by 1080 display six gigs of ram 64 gigabytes of storage in 8-core processor android seven one and quad cameras what it looks like it has a case installed also this phone is big but not crazy like it's manageable I'll show it against a pixel to XL it's definitely thicker it's a little bit heavier back the device you have the fingerprint reader probably my favorite spot you see the dual cameras right above there a textured power button USB type-c as well as your speaker it does look like you have a dual camera setup in there one two cutouts and if I move over there should be your sensor over here a screen protector a Type C adapter an OTG cable type see one of these robust charge cables and then also a type C two mini jack connector SIM tray features dual SIM / microSD expansion also alright so I might as well go ahead and test out the fingerprint sensor here so I'm gonna add one there it is boot it up it's not an OLED display or anything like that I don't even know if I told the people what the price is what was it well 219 219 bucks for this I mean you saw the spec list fingerprint how fast is it oh it's very slow it's not the fastest finger print reader I've ever used not even close actually I'm really curious about these dual front facing cameras the one lens is responsible for the the bouquet effect in the background and the first lens captures the foreground yeah we've seen better we've seen worse the key factor is the beard hair test now of course you've got your favorite Beauty modes as well who needs that in their life know what I know when it comes to the blur mode you can adjust it in real time now the rear camera same deal right dual lens 21 megapixel and five megapixel sensor and now I'm gonna test it with the blur mode I don't know man the blur mode it works well it doesn't it just keeps the center of the frame in focus in the surrounding area blurred I don't think I'd be buying this thing for the blur mode that said I've seen very few of these blur implementations that actually looked good to my eyes it's not terrible considering the price point at 219 that is a usable photo right there oh how about this recent video the mind-blowing 33 million pixel display this thing is insane and it's just a mono speaker it more pixels than anything I personally it works it's not strong at least it's not crunchy but it's just not very loud go check out my tests of razor phone speaker against a bunch of other ones it's actually there's some interesting results there they haven't gone overboard with the tweaks to the OS this is pretty standard stuff so apparently it'll shoot HDR video all the way up to 1080p you are hearing my voice through the microphone the focusing distance is not super close oh and I guess it is actually there's me there's you there's Moe I'm kind of impressed for the price and just the fact that they were able to cram six thousand milliamp hour battery in a package that's this smooth it's not a crazy difference in a pixel you're looking at like 3,500 milliamp hours compared to 6000 ah you look at the package it's kind of surprising that's a feat of Engineering will it explode I hope not that's a normal form factor just with a huge battery well done I think [Music] 
so you might have noticed that recently the channel a hit kind of like this crazy figure this crazy subscriber count' 10 million subscribers 10 million of you guys to be honest I I just felt it necessary to sit down you know and and kind of address it and and just talk about it and address you guys like directly cuz I know a lot of you have been around for a while in the past I've done giveaways and things like that to to commemorate those moments and I'm not saying I won't do that that's probably coming up very soon I don't know give away some phones or something like that to celebrate but I also just wanted to sit down and kind of have a little bit of dialogue as well now before I get into that I know a lot of people like blue you told us that Jack is gonna be revealed when you hit 10 million subscribers and that hasn't changed this thing is in development it's progressing there will be something very shortly so don't go anywhere you're gonna meet Jack but there's a little bit more to it so I just wanted to I guess half the purpose of this video is to let you guys know that we're working on it and we have something coming up but to be honest the reason that I wanted to sit down is more than that I wanted to sit here and just maybe speak to you guys in a slightly different manner than I normally would when I got a product here and I'm talking about something and you've got the antics and so on I've been passionate about technology and gadgets forever basically since I was a kid since as long as I can remember and I think somewhere subconsciously I always wanted to turn that interest into something professional something they you know because sustained me could could be my life and so on but I don't know that I ever had any kind of direct plan for that so I published a few videos online on a different channel before this one and and they actually picked up some steam people were interested surprisingly enough oh my goodness like but people wanted to watch this and I guess it made sense because I wanted to watch it some of the early inspiration you guys have to remember this thing hasn't existed forever I mean not just YouTube but like this segment within it has not always existed so I was watching people like soldier knows best I was watching John Rhett injure back then the channel used to be called John for Lakers these were some of the earliest unboxing analysis videos that were out there and it was compared to now it was a small thing you know it was a tight-knit group of people that were interested in this at all it never at that time felt like something that would generate so much interest from from this number of people from you guys but I guess you kind of just invest in whatever it is that you're interested in or happened to be passionate about and sometimes at least in this case other people develop a similar passion and then you end up connecting in this strange way I mean that's ultimately what YouTube enabled it enabled this kind of two-way thing through this camera lens I've said it before and I'll say it again if I went to some traditional media company to some executive at a television station I said listen here's what it is it's me it's tech there's a box I'm unboxing it no one's gonna go for it man they're not gonna put me on prime-time alright it wasn't gonna happen that way and that's why this platform is so powerful because it circumvented all that all the red tape it allowed for me to just start speaking for me to start making videos to not need some gatekeeper to you know unlock the door let me through and then keep me on a tight leash control what I wanted to say or what I wanted to do and over the years I got to be honest man it's been there have been difficult these difficulties in figuring out how to navigate this kind of strange environment going from somebody and I know this kid this year could probably sound obnoxious like who does this guy think he is he's on what's he doing he's on YouTube big deal or whatever just with an interest in this stuff to somebody that's getting emails now from the biggest brands in the world being like hey man are you gonna be at our event can we sponsor a video li these are all things that are difficult to manage especially when you were once a kid who just wanted to get your hands on this stuff now you have all these opportunities in the world and you're trying to navigate it in a responsible way turns out that's kind of difficult and so especially in the last little while I've been really considering some of the things some of the steps some of the ways that I can stay out in front of it some of the responsibilities that now exist because of the position and so recently I've been trying to do a better job of just being real of just bringing the realness to the camera lens whatever that means whatever my feelings are to just dig a little deeper and be like you know what I really have to let these people know I have to tell them in plain terms what my thoughts are and I don't think I felt the same sense of responsibility along the way I think when the channel was smaller it was easier to just be like well I don't know yet and then that transitioned along with the responsibility to the point where I was like no you have this huge following of people that are making decisions based on what you say you have to think you have to you know push yourself a little farther a little push yourself a little harder to come to some sort of conclusion that can be helpful to people and so that's been a bit of a push recently and I'm not even there and it's it's gonna continue to be difficult to kind of balance that tightrope of like how to operate and sustain this business and everything else but still bring the realness on the lens this is kind of a weird thing to be talking about just because of the 10 million subscriber milestone but I just feel like a lot of you guys have been along for the ride and so it makes sense to give you a little bit more background at this point about sort of what I'm trying to do or what's important to me or the things that I consider before I say words we do have a good time here it's a fun time but there's a lot of analysis that goes on behind the scenes that you guys aren't necessarily exposed to and now that we're sitting here at 10 million and you're a part of it I feel like hey why not bring you in a little bit more after all without you guys there is no this without your viewership your continued support there is no this so in a way you kind of deserve to know the mechanics of all of it and what the challenges are going forward there's never been a road map for this you could probably find some people they're like no I knew it was gonna happen exactly like it did they're probably lying though it kind of had to be carved out and it continues to have to be carved out but it's okay I'm not complaining the process is exciting now obviously I can't do this forever but I'm doing it right now so I might as well do it my best and for that opportunity I owe you you guys are the one that put me in this place so it's the least I could do [Music] 
so today's a day today's another day another day another video I gotta say I'm excited about this one because there's a nostalgia component here because in front of me is a device that's gonna bring me back it's gonna take me back to another era the tech that got me started in this game the tech game let's go to doing this my friends is the samsung galaxy folder to which is one of the last remaining flip phones in the world of course this other cheapo flip phones but I mean a legit from a big brand a flip phone and it runs Android and they're making it now I just ordered this from Korea in fact where they sell it and it's I guess popular enough to keep making executives flipping the phone maybe you never experience what it was like to flip a phone but me I go back I had the razor you flip it up you make a deal people see you flip it up they're like let's make a deal then you flip it now our phones are less phone and they're more computer in your pocket but that doesn't mean there isn't a place a warm cozy little hole like a gopher or a fox did you ever see that Wes Anderson movie with the Fox in it Oh quite good it's a 16 gigabyte phone let's flip it around here 3G 8 megapixel camera a bunch of Korean writing 16 gigabytes of memory they list the size of the display in millimeters ninety six point six millimeters quad core processor ok I need a knife which I moved hey this is uh this is historical it's like this will be in a museum one day the last of the flip phone okay actually well then oh my it looks like a display but it isn't it's plastic we have a volume rocker over here camera on the back speaker flash microUSB on the bottom no fancy type-c connector oh now isn't there something satisfying about that a physical keypad I need to make a business that's huge that feels so unusual nowadays you got the real estate put it in escrow I'll pay cash this is a touch screen up here so you're still you're tapping away but then you have this directional pad and dedicated keys so you could type out a text old-fashioned style with the t9 click click click man I used to know people that were rapid-fire with the t9 but of course you can reach up like this and you can type on screen to the headset but this device does not include a headphone jack you need a micro USB headset a micro USB cable a power brick and adapter remember the days when a battery shipped separately and you installed it yourself how exciting take this back panel off a SIM card slot and also a micro SD card slot big fan of that now the battery is at 1950 milliamp hours so not super huge you know I could see this device being popular amongst senior citizens maybe what about people who are kind of rugged with their devices it's kind of like vinyl you remember Jack went vinyls making a huge comeback right now it's the nostalgia factor I said angry where they do angry will adieu coming for you [Music] mm powered by Android and Android flip phone the Korean writing here again this is popular in other parts of the world not so much in North America and look at that its proper Android and I noticed something really cool immediately there's an outdoors button genius why isn't that on other devices just a quick tap and it triggers a super-bright mode which lasts for 15 minutes you know the other thing I noticed having stared at it and held it up to my faces it's huge that is a massive it's a massive undertaking holding that thing up but it is a flip phone and that's kind of cool you have a choice you can use the keypad or you can go directly to the display you see I could just tap up on here scroll through like that I've got my notifications as well as my quick toggles over there and go back home like this back button and multitasking button this is essentially an entire Android phone just in this top part and this section right here you can still use this pad and not touch your display you don't get anything good prints up there I guess that's kind of cool now otherwise you have access to all the usual apps I can go I can watch YouTube on here now the keyboard is obviously tiny you can see with two thumbs I can kind of line it up like this and I can type reasonably well here a nice landscape viewing experience here's a side benefit look at that Jack it's like its own stand the speaker fires to the back here but I'd say it's comparable to like the s8 or something like that I want to launch the camera app I'm gonna shoot this in landscape mode that doesn't look too fantastic right now yeah it's a little bit blown out can I make some adjustments to it or what not really hey the only thing I can adjust this video resolution very high high or VGA and then I can also flip the camera around so you can take a look at Jack there is hi Jack how's it going man now the quality on this front one not the best I've seen let's do a quick snap here hmm yes we've seen images with better contrast and more detail by no means a great camera it's probably not why you're biased I mean they say it's eight megapixel this is not a super expensive phone either so you kind of have to adjust your expectations there it does take photos now I notice that the menus are very easy to read the text is all very large once again contributing to my speculation that this thing is mostly targeted at the older generation of people listening they need phones too okay maybe you download snapchat and you become an influencer or a social-media influencer that's what we need we need more senior citizen influencers I'm all fed up with the young influencers you know what I used to do I used to walk to the supermarket for my mom uphill both ways that's right Jack uphill both ways barefoot in the winter now of course we can just go ahead and and and make a phone call as well we can we can quickly launch our contacts here we can just start we can just start typing a number you could just go in here for one six you're dialing all right you can pick up the phone and call use your voice like a human being well it's your grandpa Lou how do I sound youngster all right what do you think can we can we get a business deal done or what can we hash out the details yeah can you sign on the dotted line yeah I can do that you see what happens with a flip phone all right guys you get business done I'm not an Instagram it's all business it's Android on a flip phone in 2017 it's still a thing and I'm grateful that it is I would recommend this to anybody who's comfortable with a flip phone and use one in the past this is obviously for a select group of people but if you know that group of people or if you are that group of people do everyone a favor and let them know that this thing exists flip phones they aren't dead question number one of the day from NAS TGM will you ever do a jack face reveal I'm not sure exactly how I would do that I mean I'm not Jack obviously but I will say at 10 million subscribers you may learn a little something more about Jack so tell your friends to subscribe because we're almost there here's one from market 249 what was your first console the very first game console I had was actually one that my parents had before me it was called in television very bizarre the controllers were kind of like old-school corded phones they looked like bones sort of they weren't of course they had a number pad on them though very bizarre and then shortly after that I got the original Nintendo and the game changed forever and here's one from Fred left flesh are you going back to the pixel when the new one comes out so if you don't know I'm sure most of you do I've always been a fan of the pixel devices well not the pixel devices because they only recently became pixel devices with that name but previously the Nexus devices this stock Google devices iPhone every single one back to the original and I've used them all as daily drivers so certainly when the next pixel to pixel 2 or pixel XL 2 comes out I'll be using that for a while possibly exclusively time will tell so there you have it your questions have been answered as usual if you want to participate in the question-and-answer session leave your comments down below this video and you might make it into the next episode you [Music] 
special delivery here quite the package in front of me I'm told to hit this button to unveil the brand new D brand grip so here we go oh my here we have the grip installed on an iPhone 10 so the reason for this package is because of the technology inside of the nudibranch grip it's called d3o and it's in this container right over here this is a patented material which is like nothing I've seen and you're gonna understand why in a moment here you probably also can see that I've got a mallet and you know I'm gonna be inflicting some damage hopefully this material here can stop the damage from happening it looks like some kind of slime or goo but that's its resting stage and that I mean that's satisfying on its own I might just go ahead and do that if you I mean the hole up and down and well you know I have a thing for that so this is the magic right here and it is quite strange your standard slime or goo but you'll notice that as it kind of falls down under its own weight there's something that's that's satisfying right there it's almost like liquid this allows this stuff to be formed into various shapes and be used in all types of different equipment including hockey equipment when force is applied to which the molecules bunch up look at that they bunch up and they become resistant so it's soft to my touch I can easily poke it but when force is applied look at that it completely changes its behavior so the scientific term for this type of behavior is called non-newtonian now I know what you're saying I've seen this stuff before it's called Oobleck it's cornstarch and water no no no no that's not what this is that material it liquefies way faster and because of that can't really be used in commercial applications like a phone case now you've seen this mallet sitting over here and you know I'm not gonna tease you like that I'm gonna need a participant I'm gonna need a volunteer and a volunteer we have ladies and gentlemen it's been a while say hello to your favorite guest here on unbox therapy although Willie do will dispute that his name is oh yeah Moe is going to wrap his hand in the d3o and I'm gonna get the old one-two cuz that's what you wanted you're sick you're twisted [Music] so you want this stuff in your life it's obviously very cool and you can get it in the d-brane grip it's in the corners here there it is you're getting this same tech right here but in grip form you probably also noticed the new black camo and changes depending on the angle that's kind of a cool look so the grip is on IndieGoGo right now it's got like two three days left in the whole concept here is you pick a skin you put a skin on your device and then you put the grip around the outside it's also super grippy as the name implies it's not gonna slide off of a surface it's easy to hold on to and so on that's where it gets its name from you're not giving up your click there's no click sacrifice click four days there oh baby all right I'll just be this be here for a bit starting up my new channel it's gonna be a slime channel it's called a pivot alright somebody's got to be thinking about the future of unbox therapy No yeah alright goodnight you 
now many of you know I've been traveling recently I was in India it was an incredible experience I met so many of you guys yes the unbox therapy viewers sunglass shopping in India somebody told me that this place is 150 yeah they told me that - honey is my first experience at Indian McDonald's Maharaja Mac the international family in general had a great experience now one of the reasons I was out there was to help launch this particular device in the Star Wars limited edition 1 + 5 t now many of you know I've been using that device for a while it's right over here but of course it's just the standard 5 T this device here has in many ways been inspired by the film home on I was told that the white on the back here inspired by one of the final scenes in the film is a visit this planet with a really sandy kind of ground what was the name of the planet we'll look up the name of the planet where the final battle scene is the Star Wars nerds are so angry right now they are mad crew it Kermit crate the planet is called crate there's texture on here all right a little more grippy the Red Star Wars logo you'll see the silent do not disturb switch metallic red color with the texture of course the volume rocker as well as the power switch and the SIM tray are in black a familiar look on the front the standard 5 T a darker black reflective 1 + logo a silver metallic on the standard 5 T you can kind of see the antenna on the top and bottom on the limited edition you do not see the antenna bands at all kylo Ren inspired case inspired by his helmet in fact Star Wars the last Jedi this is if you are very serious about your Star Wars fandom the - charge brick must be tight see some stickers - not just one + stickers but Star Wars the last Jedi as this is where things get kind of interesting because inside the box here there's a bit of an easter egg now when I was at the event they apparently said they spent all this time on this particular piece of paper and I was like well what's the big deal there's a tiny little poem on the back strive to rule the galaxy care to choose your side and so on now apparently there's more here than initially meets the eye if you look at the first letter of each sentence and read it downwards scribble with pencil am I supposed to scribble this with pencil Oh found it some down here there's some words being uncovered here whoa find the secret compartment and check the weather forecast on h2 and we have really dudes attention now big time okay there's a secret compartment in the box I guess is it in the box oh it's here this is the bottom of the box what is yes Jack you remember this kind of a thing I know what this is you know what this is Jack we're gonna come back to this in a moment there's a bunch of custom wallpapers kylo Ren option black and red those soldier dudes the trooper helmet that's the death trooper right don't you remember this one has the beef with Finn okay never mind you kind of have to have that to go with it since it is a special edition all the quick toggles are red now red and black including when you go to settings here check that out standard 5 T here so that's the difference there so if you want to see some camera testing and some other functions of the 5 P you can go watch my original 5 T unboxing video time for us to look at this Easter Egg folds out like this goes on to here comes down and kind of locks it in that and then what you think this piece goes on top I think that's ready to go like that the card told me check the weather forecast so I'm gonna check the weather here hatched oh ok here we go yes put the holographic device on the screen keep the prism at eye level whoa may the force be with you how about that for an easter egg everybody else step your game up I got the prism I got the hologram with the Star Wars vibe I mean you saw the Leia hologram you remember the classic scene this is deep you got the oneplus logo that's a true collaboration I mean don't just slap the logo on you've got to embed the culture into it and that's what they did there [Music] so there you have it the 1 plus 5t limited-edition Star Wars a very compelling and unusual unboxing experience with the easter egg and the pencil since I picked this thing up while I was in India what a time I had I did shoot some video I'm gonna pile it all together show you guys the experience stick around and be ready for that it really was an amazing trip today's episode of unbox the area's been brought to you by white stone dome glass a screen protector that you can finally install easily with no air bubbles none of those dust particles you know the issues if you've ever installed a screen protector before it's not that much fun now they've gotten a lot better they're made at a glass and you have these phones with curved displays that's a bit of an issue with a lot of screen protectors not with the dome glass full cover with no lifting they make it for the iPhone 10 the iPhone 7 8 plus the S 8 plus and no 8 they make them for all kinds of devices so you could check that out through the link in the description but what really makes these special to me you can install this dome glass by using the installation jig that is in the box that's right I said jig you didn't come you're expecting me to say that but I did kind of this little contraption where you place the phone in and it kind of does the work for you to a certain degree then afterwards you use this UV LED lamp to kind of solidify as a whole process okay so there you have it finished installation super clear glass screen protector not a single air bubble in sight you spend all this money on a device throw a protector it's terrible but not if you pick up one of these the iPhone 10 is the one that I installed they make it from anymore I'll link them down in the description thanks to them for sponsoring this episode and if you're worried about your glass get yourself the dome glass protect yourself with the dome if you know what I'm saying [Music] 
pop goes the weasel what doesn't that mean what's going on here look at that fancy packaging if that doesn't pique your interest I don't know what would eco-friendly types of packs kind of fitting the shape of it the futuristic vibe because inside is a highly requested piece of tech started out on Kickstarter you've seen in your headphones you've seen over ear headphones and this is a combination of both some level of intelligence here able to tune sound specifically for your anatomical makeup that your unique eardrums function that sounds incredibly sophisticated and my understanding is that it is if this is the future right here I need to know about it and so do you they're called neuro the actual headphones are called neuro phone type-c cable lightning cable micro USB and also an analog cable some people's reactions to these things were banana Wow what we're gonna find out if the mind is blown ooh the secrets a perfect sound is you how cryptic is that Jack these are not inexpensive they're around 400 bucks oh that's a key to my heart right there some sort of magnetic enclosure for your uncle ooh there ooh very high caliber experience the smell is fresh as well oh man that's what the inside of the ear cup looks like excuse me that is so bizarre that is gonna go right into your ear canal responsible for highs and mids and then the bass is gonna be sort of in the surrounding region I've never seen a headphone like this a lot of protective plastic on here [Music] okay the earcup itself is adjustable right on the headband your connection point is right here what you'll see is it's got a proprietary connector on the other end downside you have an issue with this cable or you forget to bring it with you not easily replaceable really do update here to tell us that these are the first headphones at least the first we've seen that actually charges from your smartphone although there's no indication to me that that's happening right now maybe we have to install the app first do you own neuro phones yet yes find a quiet place for just a moment and we'll guide you through getting started okay ensure the charging port is on your right okay do tab and adjustment all right so here we go whoa that feels very unique oh I woke up right away she okay she just sent hello I'm neuro phones you will see me in two Bluetooth settings right now this is what the app looks like pretty basic and by default they're set to some kind of generic mode the real key thing here is the personalization of the sound signature so what you need to do here is set up a profile I'm ready oh wow it looks like your neurons aren't creating a good seal as I adjust the headphone it's becoming more black I think I got it now and this is so futuristic well so I feel the need to explain right now I heard a series of beeps and bloops and it was kind of analyzing the way I hear thing it was able to create this personalized setting now and what it's doing now is playing a sample song in generic mode and it told me to switch over to personalize so this should be my reaction here wait let me turn it up first here we go personalize the personalized has way more base use the outer ear drivers to create the immersive feeling of a live performance you have some different settings here from gentle up the front row let me turn this up again oh my goodness oh my oh my [Music] oh when I tap the left ear cup it turns off the personalization regardless of my settings gentle it sounds sort of like normal headphones all right you get up to that front row setting oh man it lets you know some of the most bass I've ever heard on headphones in the front row setting this is a visual representation of my personal setting now the rumble of the bass is serious man is the most bass I've ever heard period not even close no close second it is so much bass if you're a bass head at all I mean you have to try this this is bananas this is like this is like a whole new device you kind of forget that it's headphones that are producing it [Music] man I don't know how long you can listen like that it's a super aggressive it's pushing your boundaries I've heard some of these songs a million times inside a year I'm getting motivated you know you see the basketball players they arrive to the arena always with some headphones on they need to get their hands on these cuz they think they're getting pumped up for my goodness you're not gonna believe me till you try it I mean that's the thing you're gonna have to take my word for it and of course the millions of headphones that I've tested these are something different I promise you [Music] 
today I've got a product that you've all been waiting for something incredible amazing outlandish let's go check it out so today is an unusual day because it's not every day that you have a phone sitting in front of you with a retail price of $2,500 now you're probably thinking for that price it's probably got the latest specs it's probably got the greatest camera the fastest processor well if that's what you thought you you're probably wrong the device in front of me is expensive for other reasons primarily to do with this on the top of the box here Lamborghini that's right it's the latest Lamborghini phone the alpha one for the Alpha the alpha male it might be you this thing is being sold in two stores in the world alright it's being sold in Harrods in London and is being sold in some mall in Dubai this is not for everyone wait a second is that a leather ish texture it is bit of a presentation Italian leather it cannot be luxury without carbon fibre a fingerprint sensor we have a 20 megapixel camera a badge on the bottom Lamborghini alpha one because you deserve it it's got a headphone jack on the top I'm noticing something right in there you see that little dot there is that some kind of defect that I see how mad are you here the alpha-1 speakers on the bottom capacitive buttons USB type-c on the bottom there's been a substantial price decrease in the lamborghini series of phones here this is $2,500 but the last version was 6000 a power brick probably Oh what's going on here there's nothing in here there's nothing in there it has the power icon is that why they included that in the box what a letdown okay fine they sent this this one here that's not gonna that wouldn't have fit in there Jack please help me here man this is incredible in the main box there's no charger they send it separately okay also in the box I'm hopeful another empty box this is supposed to be the cable so I guess the cable that you get with that this is some kind of a rebrand like they just panic and put the badge on there the Lamborghini sim tool look at that you can't have a luxury product without a warranty card okay there it is powered by Android is it possible to own a phone like this without an actual Lamborghini this boot-up is a little slow by the way oh the car sound there's a theme going on here to tie it all together of course the stock background looking sort of like the dash in a Lamborghini itself there you go never forget the bull this here all looks familiar I mean the speakers are forward-facing that's good I've been asking for that oh can I say something real quick here the Professor X thing a whole Lee mole people lost their minds the Saint Professor X is not telekinetic strictly telepathic go back to the comic books I went to the wiki the Marvel wiki a marvel calm and yes there's evidence there have been cases in which he has moved things Lowell Apple telekinetic but he's moved things before including in some situations his wheelchair which was hovering how do you think it was every anybody who's ever owned a MacBook you've seen it you've known about it you've just connected your charger and not even we got a 1440p display here is the previous Lamborghini phone around 6,000 bucks there are some similarities here to be honest I think that no one it looks a little nicer so it's less shiny the leather has a more matte finish to it it's a little bit less bulky as well not that I mind a little bit of bulk to a phone but this one is overwhelming I mean they're both obviously insane optical image stabilization live photo a manual mode slow motion and the magic exposure modes okay very loud focus beep there kaboom and a very loud shutter as well you could probably get a phone with these capabilities identically for like a couple hundred bucks obviously it's not about what's inside it's about the logos and the leather you've had some pretty high caliber selfies recently including the unbelievable rear camera selfie from the meizu pro 7 plus go check that out I think it's the only device on the market capable of that at least in the way that they've implemented it oh hey nope here we go front-facing camera hello there Shaboom it looks like the beauty moded me by default there's a beauty thing happening am i complaining of course not there you have the real version this is a 5.5 inch qHD display the camera on the back as I mentioned before is 20 megapixels it's got a Snapdragon 820 in it 64 gigs of storage which is expandable I should probably pop out the SIM tray here just to show you okay so it's one of those dual I mean this should be on every phone you shouldn't have to spend $2,500 and you don't many phones shipping with this nowadays a relatively large battery 30 to 50 milliamp hours and some people that are trying to defend the price point of this device have stated that it's got a pretty decent built-in DAC for headphone users but there's other phones that do that for a lot less money phones from LG phones from ZTE with incredible DAX built in so for me that's not a huge differentiating factor the reason you want a phone like this is because of that guy right there that little guy right there that word and probably the brand name or something to do with it the fact that it's the Alpha the fact that you've got so much money boatloads in fact the $2,500 for an under spec phone doesn't even bother you alright that's who it's for that's why it exists you can choose to H or you can choose to understand I don't know what more can I say what more can I say it's the Lamborghini phone and to be honest I'm kind of glad it exists I don't know why something for everyone I guess it's a little bit of fun it makes the noise of the car starting up when you turn it on I mean it's obviously ridiculous but why not let somebody have it let them live a little bit question time so here's one from someone called Pro potato do you think the real iPhone 8 is going to have the same design as in the mock-ups I think it's gonna be very close if not identical some of the latest leaks that we've seen I have boxes full of cases sent to me by companies that are incredibly confident that that's what the iPhone is gonna look like so much so that they've got all the marketing material printed out the cases themselves have been manufactured and the packages that the cases are in so because of that I have to say I've got a pretty high level of confidence that the iPhone is going to look like those mock-ups at least for that special version the iPhone Edition or X or whatever it is that they end up calling it unbox therapy what is your dream car if you have not already gotten it and you know to be honest I think people they get a little bit crazy about cars I am more of a simple guy which one would you prefer a digital wash or a mechanical watch here's the thing a lot of people they've noticed I've had this g-shock on my wrist for years and I love it it's durable the battery never runs out and I just I don't know it feels good there it's it I don't feel I don't feel like I have to be gentle with it I can bang it against things and it's light enough that I hardly notice it I've also got kind of big wrists so I like to have a chunky watch on there and for as long as I can remember I've just gotten comfortable with the g-shock layout I just want the time we can do some other things as well the many years of testing all the different smartwatches and even wearing some fancy ones I always come back to the familiarity of the casio g-shock like I said I'm a simple guy [Music] 
so a lot of people been asking me to talk about this recent situation with Apple specifically regarding the iPhone and this idea with software updates come slowdowns to previous models I became aware of this just like you did I have to admit when I was reading it and I was looking at the different screenshots of the geek bench scores and so on I have to be honest I wasn't surprised hey man new phone just came out why is mine slowing down is Apple trying to tell me something this is this is something that people have talked about for a very long time both of you that aren't familiar with the back story here's how it breaks down Apple recently put out some new software a user I believe on reddit noticed that their device was substantially slower than it had been previously with one of these recent software updates he ran some numbers did some comparisons and figured out that yes there was a performance decrease in his previous generation iPhone with the new software install turns out he wasn't alone people were basically wondering if this was something that Apple was doing intentionally or if it was more of a nitch scenario now you can see in front of me here I've got an iPhone 6s and I've also got the latest iPhone 10 now of course Apple would love for you to go out and buy this new one as soon as it comes out what are you doing sitting on that old one there come on pull out your wallet we'll take a few of those pennies that's how all businesses runs they want to compel you to upgrade to the next generation and to do so frequently real question now was there or is there something nefarious going on create a scenario where your phone is not performing the way that it used you so that you have to go out then and feel forced to do an upgrade Apple responded they came out and said yes this is happening and here's why the thinking here is that battery life over time is going to get worse and one of the ways that you can mitigate some of that decreased capacity is to lower the performance of the device so Apple has essentially made this move in favor of battery life over performance now I can kind of see where they're coming from for users who are holding on to older devices it's possible that battery life is more important to them especially when you consider the performance enthusiasts are the ones who are more likely to upgrade to a new device to begin with and the people who are holding on to or recycling old ones might not be such power users we could have a huge discussion about which is more important performance or battery life it's obvious based on apples statement that they've made their move now I think a lot of people who hit me up on Twitter expected me to come in here make this video and just go after Apple to try that again oh-ho I kind of get what they're doing like I kind of understand why you might prioritize battery life the real problem for me does it have to do with that decision it has to do with how Apple went about it by not making people aware in advance or possibly even giving them the option maybe you're on this phone right here the success and maybe your battery is substantially depleted from the original capacity when you get that new software update what about a little checkbox performance over battery life or maybe you want battery life over performance see the problem without presenting that option is it allows people on the internet to go down all sorts of rabbit holes with the conspiracy theories and so on in fact it's so far down that path now that there are two separate class-action lawsuits that have been filed against Apple for what some consider to be a shady business practice now at this point I do think it's worth noting that Apple it's that brand that's under the microscope in a way other brands aren't at least not to the same extent people will really look into it and try to discover these small little tweaks and and unusual behaviors because a lot of these stories they have legs you know people want to know people want to report on it so it's a possibility that these types of practices are in place with other manufacturers as well and it just hasn't been discovered yet anyway in my opinion this is something that's become a big deal that really didn't have to the opportunity existed for the user to make that selection you know you probably still would have a lot of people picking battery life anyways and one of the side effects of Apple's decision here battery replacement businesses are skyrocketing in terms of activity because everyone's thinking oh I can get better formants out of my iPhone 6's just by replacing the battery perfect so I want to send the question to you guys if you have an older generation iPhone would you be more likely to select battery life over performance or performance over battery life we can use the comment section down below determine which is more important to users via trust Apple do you trust any of these companies at the end of the day everyone's trying to make a buck and as a consumer that should always be front of mind for you you can make the decision options are good this episode of home box there apenas been brought to you by Dollar Shave Club their new deal 5 bucks it gives you this cool trial kit so you can try out the various products that they have you haven't

money but your time to head over to dollarshaveclub.com slash unbox therapy that links gonna be in the description as well use that link so they know where you came from so one of my favorite sponsors here in unbox therapy helps you look good and it helps me pay the bills you didn't expect that it just came out I didn't 
so I've got a special package here possibly an exclusive in early unboxing it's the zenfone 5 and it's actually my very first look at the zenfone series you might be surprised at what this thing packs in at the mid-range price point now you can see on the side of the box we love photo so you can probably guess there's gonna be an emphasis on camera to a certain extent in here so what do we have here we have sim tool a case is included you gotta love the free case now look it's that device so this is kind of like a bluish tone to it it shimmers around this focal point where the fingerprint sensor is up here in the top corner you see the dual lens setup which is implemented a little differently than other manufacturers I'll tell you more about that in a moment this is the front of the device and once I boot this up you're gonna be able to see we have a new member to the notch family although in this case a slightly smaller notch than on the iPhone 10 before I boot it up though let's look around the device you see there's still a headphone jack I'm happy to see it manufacturers hold on to it there are some very nice headphones they use that Jack speaker as well volume rocker the power switch on the right hand side and then the SIM tray over here on the left and you'll see you have expandable storage as well also inside the package we have a quick charger a headset with an in-ear style which I always like to see and get the right fit you have some extra ear tips as well many manufacturers aren't including headsets at all anymore so this is good to see also type C cable to keep it all charged up okay let's power up the device here now since I'm filming this just before the announcement price is not exactly official this thing is gonna compete in the same territory as something like the 1 + 5 t now there's gonna be different versions of the zenfone 5 there's gonna be the 5 the 5 Z and the 5 light this one is right in the middle of the three I can speculate a little bit here I think this is gonna slot into the mid-range and I think it's gonna represent some pretty decent value so there you get your first look at the notch cut out we can thank Apple of course bringing on this trend but at least it shrunk down a little bit in this case surprisingly this is a 6.2 inch display it's very easy hold on - but of course when you're watching video and whatnot you have to get used to that not sitting up there now I do want to test out the fingerprint reader as well fingerprint on the back all right so I mean that's doing the job I'm still a fan of fingerprint sensors at this point you guys heard my whole rant on face ID face unlock in general I don't mind the face unlock on the 1 + 5 t because it's fast even there I end up using the fingerprint as well it's kind of a thing where you're like you're already unlocking it before you even look at it right like face IDs not gonna see me from there it's a bit of a physical adjustment I also just don't like the swipe up gesture from below because for me that's a two-stage thing if there's a bit of an adjustment here and Dennis white the whole thing could have been over a long time before that with the fingerprint you know without bowing to your device anyway people are talking now about the under display fingerprint reader all these various vivo devices like maybe that's the future I don't know those don't seem to be as quick as the traditional capacitive ones on the back or wherever else they happen to be so ok now something to keep in mind this is a prototype like it's it's a pre-release version even though it's in the retail box and whatnot because of that it can't really evaluate it yet this is by no means a review at this point in the meantime one of the things I'm excited about on this particular device is the camera implementation and the reason for that is because they've done something similar to LG where they opted to use the second lens as a wide-angle lens as opposed to just contributing to portrait data for depth of field or low-light performance and you can see that's represented at the bottom here by these indicators you got the one mountain or the three mountain to get the the wider angle perspective I'm gonna show will what I'm talking about there we have the stock main camera and if I switch over to wide I mean you can already see my knuckles in the corner here being picked up by the lens so that's just how wide it is maybe a better demo of this is if I use it on myself here so you can imagine I mean I could get like one more person in the frame here put on the wide-angle I got here like two people over I just really like wide-angle cameras it's a nice implementation so it looks like the wide sensor is an 8 megapixel sensor and when I switch to the main camera she had switches to 12 megapixels so that's something to keep in mind okay so wide has no problem seeing that thing and it's right up in the grill now also you've got a pro mode which gives you access to all kinds of settings here if you want to go in and toggle you want to play with the white balance exposure compensation focus whether it's auto focus manual focus you can do that all within the professional mode or the automatic mode actually has some AI functionality built in right up there in that corner just by pointing this at this object it figures out that it's a plant and you'll see the plant icon pop up in this location over here somewhere it's able to learn and figure out what these objects look like frequently adjust the camera settings accordingly so you end up with an image like that there so it's got a regular selfie mode but then I also noticed there is a selfie panorama and a gif animation mode I'm gonna leave it in Auto the selfie test very important here so it's an 8 megapixel image on the front camera look how happy that character is the glorious beard hairs which are incredible for autofocus might I add now another cool thing that this device has on it that I haven't seen before is this AI boost and that's gonna boost the performance of the device and juice out some extra horsepower from the Snapdragon 6-3 6 whether you want more power or if you want to save some battery life so you can turn that off and extend your battery but then I don't know you want to play a game or something you turn on AI boost to juice out a little more performance now another emphasis on the zenfone 5 is an improvement in the audio performance over the previous version so course as usual I want to test the audio so the implementation is actually kind of similar to the new Galaxy S 9 where you have audio coming out of the earpiece up here as well as on the bottom and each one kind of represents different frequency range so you get a little more high-end out of this one in clarity the low-end and the bass comes out at the bottom one thanks and you can tell when you cover up the bottom on how that operates these unusual this is the charge doc so that the speaker is ready to go when you want to take it with you this also oh I like oh wow I like what they've done with the speaker here certainly for watching YouTube there's a lot more clarity coming out of this one which is weird because this has two forward facing speakers there might be a little bit more bass on the pixel to excell but overall I think the experience on this one is somehow more pleasing that's one of the louder phones that I've tested absolutely claim music and create your own audio effect with the customized equalizer this is out of the box here fine-tuned audio output that fits your headphone configuration remember you do have a headphone jack DTS surround sound for your headphones we have normal settings settings for pop rock vocal and of course custom which allows you to toggle in your favorite equalization settings and then there's also sliders for bass and treble and you can save your own custom equalizer and we can optimize for Wired or Bluetooth headphones that's cool it's not just a headphone jack but it's it's a whole suite even myself there are moments where I still find myself in a pinch that I'm carrying the pixel to XL with no headphone jack it's just convenient to have that alright and if manufacturers keep it there I'm happy it's pretty bright for a non OLED display now it's important to know that pixel to excel display is not necessarily regarded as the top tier in the game at the moment but it is surprising when you see them head to head there's a slightly different color tint to it as well anyways this is an interesting device to me I mean that's why I'm making the video a lot of it has to do with the targeted price point all right this is the zenfone 5 there's gonna be the 5 Z and the 5 light I think it's gonna be in a compelling spot somewhere around that 400 dollar range it's a pretty interesting set of features at that price point yes you have the Snapdragon 636 in here but you add to it the ability to boost up some of the performance or toggle it back for power efficiency which that's gonna be a very power efficient chip for battery life and the implementation that they went with on the dual camera setup with the wide angle lens of course we're gonna see more about camera performance on this thing over time when I can evaluate the final software but the package as a whole with the large display in the small form-factor if you can get used to the knotch life or if it's something that doesn't bother you or if it's something you saw in the iPhone and you were like where is the Android version of that I believe we have our first player in that space right here in the zenfone 5 you can begin to make that comparison I'm gonna keep my eye on this one if you guys want me to dive a little deeper when a final software is out really getting to the nitty gritty compare it to some other players at this price point and do me a favor leave a thumb down below just to let me know you're interested in this device and I'll go ahead and do that but for now there it is the zenfone 5 unboxed here on unbox therapy [Music] 
[Music] nature we have something that I have been excited for we have something contending for the top spot of a very competitive product segment a product segment that I have explored to a great degree personally that segment is Bluetooth speakers now I've done plenty of videos on Bluetooth speakers as some of them are lined up over there the diamond box the latest biggest diamond box is over that that thing was loud and don't forget one of my favorite videos all-time the DVLA phantom they live in upstairs upstairs but there has been one speaker requested above all the others it's over here this giant box sound box Black Edition it's pretty heavy rechargeable keep the music playing 30 hours it's using Bluetooth or auxilary input they clean weather drink and shockproof what is it spring break with a beer pong and jumping off the house into the pool I do not recommend doing so volume up to a hundred and nineteen DBS Baltic birch plywood black aluminum frame those sound like good materials that thing looks serious what do you think jacket I bring this to the parking lot after hockey or what it's metallic boom black edition with the badge on it oh oh now I like how on the corners they did these bumpers your controls are over here off indoor outdoor cold clicky oh look at this day lodge polar bear in search of a meal of any kind if he does not catch at least one bird he may not see another day in the Arctic Nature doesn't care about you if you were out there you without your fancy little outfit feed a little bowtie think of polar bears got time for that so I'm guessing the sound sort of changes or possibly the volume depending on if you pick indoor or outdoor mode a Bluetooth indicator light and yogs iller e input north american power cable european one your power brick ah this is the battery okay but where does it go oh wow it's pretty solid and then this piece clips in there I can pull this battery out and use the same AC adaptor and just plug this into here that's smart and really do this out there [Music] hey the og original dummy bear okay go that's for you for you guys will do endorse let's uh play you some music here's my boy soft eyes very clean clean loud sound I wonder what happens if I flip it to outdoor kablammo [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] well I do ladies and gentlemen Willie do what was the cartoon with Bo Jackson Wayne Gretzky Michael Jordan was it called Pro stars you see that over there he's got a handle on it you know that it work yeah go see if it works what they do ladies and gentlemen [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] it might be the loudest it's so hard to know for certain even in the outdoor setting yes it carries further there's more high-end it's still not breaking up too much where you're like mmm it's really built for parties it's built to be outdoors it's got the big handles on it as a package deal for a party speaker I think it might be tough to beat seriously sound box this is the Black Edition I think it's pretty good [Music] 
so today I've got a cool one this is a product called torch 2.0 and this lets you add heating to any coke Tanny jacket I guess you could even add it to a hoodie now I featured something kind of along these lines in the past it was a sweatshirt where you put your hands in the pocket and then there's a hand heater in there grab grab that thing grab it what do you got this thing works a little different they're calling it a universal coat heater and what I like about this setup is you get to use your own coat so you're sure that you've got one that you like this unit attaches to the inside and then the battery that keeps everything juiced up is detachable just bring that thing inside charge it up and then you're heating all over again peel and stick the velcro installation kit into your coat attach your torch coat heater turn it on to enjoy hours of soothing warmth so this is the main unit microUSB cable I believe that will be to charge the battery which is over here it's a pretty slim standard looking portable battery seems pretty Universal to me right this is a standard USB connection other side benefit if this is in your coat then you've always got a battery backup for your phone to power brick in the box lastly these look like the velcro pads that the unit attaches to that is definitely velcro in fact it is velcro brand velcro the real stuff yeah that's a grip right there holy smokes ok that's gonna work and the heating elements I suppose are just there in there simple stuff and then over here on this side this is a pouch and this is where your little battery pack is gonna go so this piece is gonna plug in here like that and then the battery unit goes inside the little pouch clamp it down that's it so this is a pretty standard kind of black coat here and I'm just gonna lay it out as they have told me to do alright so now I am gonna remove the sticker part of the velcro here kablammo okay that's on there place that in the center there Jack can you see that there it really sticks on there and if you take this pack out it's also the soft side of the velcro I think that's an important touch right so it's not the scratchy teeth side it's the soft side so you're not gonna notice it if have to pack out also it's cool that they've designed a battery bank here which has LED indicators so you can quickly reach down hit the button and see how much charge you have left only thing left to do this is the interesting side over here with the power switch red is high blue is medium and green is low so on the high setting you can expect somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a half hours of battery life and in the low setting you can get as much as four hours it is already beginning to warm up oh man that is nice here we go well I'm gonna get cooking soon I'll tell you what Oh me not gonna me huh I'm just gonna wear this for a bit wait for peak temperature to kick in from a functionality standpoint I mean you noticed the battery pack you're kind of a weary I mean it feels like you have a wallet in your pocket sort of oh it's getting like skin like toasty now oh this is kind of genius this kind of a good eye I mean having a battery bank is already useful on its own you might already carry one and now you just got it right here where you need it plus the heat if I have a long walk to work if I'm on the bike if I'm on a motorcycle oh it's cooking I'm going now oh yeah yeah this is a smart move all right this is the way to do it you got to be outdoors a little bit Nicole heck it comes to the rescue and it's not a whole different coat and you get a battery bank plus it's removable and you can have it in two different coats let's see how this thing keypads hold up so far so good they're in there and I just want to see what the removal process looks like so let's say you want to keep it in this coat permanently well you just want to take out the battery bank so that just comes out boom bring that inside charge that up all right now maybe you want to go a step further and remove the whole thing let's see if the sticky pads stay on this material all right so it does come out again this is gonna depend a lot on the material you're sticking it to at first the back piece wants to come off with it it is a very strong velcro connection so I'm not sure I'd be taking it out all that frequently I think this is more the kind of thing when you install it you probably want to leave it there or if you do take it out you're gonna want to let this adhesive set in a little bit longer once you take this off this becomes a normal coat all over again and you're not gonna notice these velcro pads in there just one two three you're back to heating I think they're onto something especially at this price point sixty five bucks if you're freezing out there you'll take all the help you can get what are you doing your shovel in the driveway 11 pizzas I don't know what you're up to if you have to be outside in the weather that we are dealing with right now you'll take any advantage you can get the porch 2.0 you never know what's gonna show up here human beings they keep making things well-done porch I think it's a cool idea DIY a detainee coat 
drop your chin hard to try to buy the time so that you can apply the yellowjacket into their arms and then this is easily the craziest accessory for a smartphone that I've ever featured here so you can escape to safety I'm a little bit apprehensive in general because in front of me is a self defense iPhone case it's called the Yellow Jacket and it is the only backup battery stun gun iPhone case like a currently this thing can put out seven million volts I don't know what type of neighborhood you like to hang out in but you wear it on the phone and if anybody attacks you you hit them with the stun any a part of the face the neck or to the groin area down they go they leave you alone it has a secondary functionality of being a battery backup as well 3,800 milliamp hours of power that's positive that's what it looks like very rugged boys and girls this is a dangerous thing it is not a toy concealed inside the yellowjacket is a high-voltage stun gun dual safety mechanism an ambidextrous trigger so you can fire it off from the left or the right it's not the battery case aspect it's not the protection of the phone itself it's the protection of you from some attacker oh man look at that warning this product can cause severe injury or potentially death never leave it unattended around minors only use if you are in serious danger mr. Willy new is getting nervous over there he's sitting off-camera and he's starting to get a little nervous this is interesting they have included a screen protector I guess if you're into self-protection why not phone protection as well this is the teal color but it comes in a couple of different ones that's some full juice right there mega stopping power oh I think I just armed it microUSB cable to charge it up a little wrist strap so you can keep it nearby another warning if misused oh man so there's an outer case in an inner case so this is your stun gun portion and this is the inner case just goes in like that there you go it's quite a large contraption when you're holding it but again you want the 7 million volts so you're willing to put up with that I suppose but now but not oh my goodness would you look at that that is gruesome they need to be sharp because if somebody if you have an attacker that has to poke through their clothing I think you arm it like that oh oh my that is a nasty sound a gruesome nobody wants anything to do with that if you're some kind of attacker and somebody hits you with that my goodness you're backing off you're moving away you're gonna wonder what you got hit with will are you sure you want to do this don't forget though that is a clear warning you want to do it sure all right let's go just remember what I said this is your choice I want you to tell the camera get over here and tell the people that this is your choice will he do this is on me I'm ready to get stunned let's do it let's do it oh man are you sure are you what do you say will well this thing's evil oh man you want me to do it to you yeah this is heavy this is heavy stuff let's all hold it there all right I'm not obviously I don't want to hurt you man all right all right you got a show Willie do some love here hit him with the thumb I won't really do to be fine I'm sure he will be Bobby I think okay I'm gonna go right there okay ready all right Oh in their official video they're like you hit the neck you hit the groin but the groin is there's a lot of material there that's a tough hit but the neck is often exposing neck to face mm-hmm here it is man yellow jacket iPhone case thumbs up for Willie do know was it it burnt I smell burning oh that your flesh Jack can you try and tell them to take one was that the worst one okay Jack I'll do it if you do it if you like you should give him the feedback like in a practical sense it's obviously a deterrent like if someone's hitting you with that when you try to grab them or something you're like whoa yeah what was that stun it stuns you so you would back off and the sound is gruesome on its own quick disclaimer here you're not supposed to be out there looking for fights this is a back-up plan this is if every if everything else fails it's bulky you're probably not gonna carry this around yourself no no so maybe you're a female you walk home I don't know on campus maybe for that night class I will probably feel better with this thing in my hand I guess I think the covert nature of it is kind of the cool part and if something were to happen it's it's obviously not for everyday for most people but at least stay through the battery in there as well put your hands together for Willie do put his body on the line for the unbox therapy family if that doesn't deserve a thumb nothing ever will Yuri [Music] 
today I'm going to show you what might be the world's smallest laptop it's from a company called gamepad digital as you can see on the side it says pocket so they're trying to imply that you could fit this thing into your pocket you'd have to have a rather large pocket and I don't know how comfortable that would be nonetheless this thing was incredibly popular in fact it is raised I believe close to 3.5 million dollars on IndieGoGo so people are obviously interested in tiny laptops so let's go ahead jump inside the box and see what this thing is all about so this looks like the power brick which you can already tell it's about the size of some quick-charge bricks for smartphones and you can see here that you have a USB type-c connector okay cool also in here a USBC cable look at that look at that little guy it's like slightly bigger Nintendo DS XL whoa made out of aluminum a solid aluminium brick there now the version I have I believe is running Windows but they do sell a version with Linux as well and the price is somewhere around 500 bucks which sounds kind of expensive for something so tiny but maybe that's the reason you want it so far first impressions here on build quality very it's almost MacBook Eska that's kind of funny look at that look at this little guy it also happens to have a touchscreen so you can reach up and immediately interface with it all right so as mentioned USB 3 standard headphone output HDMI output of the micro HDMI variety and the USB type-c connector which will also be used to charge the unit let's go ahead and boot this up alright so it's loading up Windows right now Windows 10 it's not the brightest screen I've ever seen you can tell like with the white background you can kind of get a better sense for how bright it's gonna be so the display is actually 1920 by 1200 and that's in a 7 inch form factor alright so here's some of the specs on this unit specifically it has a quad-core 1.6 gigahertz Intel Atom processor 8 gigs of ram 128 gigabytes of storage this is Gorilla Glass 3 on the display I mentioned before it has a of cooling the wait is under half a kilogram at point four eight zero and they're claiming a 12-hour battery life with this lithium polymer battery that's inside all right let's load up a video here and get a sense for how it sounds and what the video looks like I'll load up and unbox therapy video let's just make sure I'm running it at a high resolution that's a pretty nice looking display right there now let's go ahead and hear the speaker while we're at it seems to be muted right I mean the speaker works but oh my goodness it's it's quite tinny and of course you have the headphone jack you've also got bluetooth on here so that said though I am impressed with the visual here the actual video itself at 1080p I mean it's it's probably above my expectations for something so small so here's the thing you're probably thinking okay so it has a nice display it's got good battery life so it's a little maybe it is maybe I can't I can just watch videos on the go but then why do I need to I mean might I already got a phone it has a huge display on and I can watch videos on there but I think the difference here is that this form factor allows it to be propped up by default no special equipment just immediately in a form factor where you can enjoy it while you're eating lunch whatever it is that you do on an airplane you have limited space pop this thing open and because of the hinge you can get the exact right angle to enjoy your content now of course if that was all it was you wouldn't have this keyboard you wouldn't have a full PC so I think what's happening here maybe it's a multimedia focus for someone but can they get a little bit of work done I suppose that's possible but with a keyboard this tiny I'm not sure how that's gonna work out so let me do a quick typing test here now one thing that's strange me you do your hands bump into each other this little pointer thing obviously nowhere near as effective as a trackpad now there's no room for a track but how could they possibly have gotten a trackpad in maybe you could carry around a tiny little mouse that's possible and then of course you have the aspect of the touchscreen I could reach up and touch it but that seems so weird on such a small screen look at this my finger is bigger than any possible touch point let me like look at that you have to be pretty precise alright let's check out this pocket ability real quick going to my left pocket here regular pair of shorts oh my goodness it's gone it is surely pocketable now the question is but I use this just kind of straight out of the pocket with my thumbs that's something I was curious about that backspace lines up pretty well I say I wanted to type unbox therapy you and Bo X I can still thumb tight so maybe the real move there is to just use touch and your thumbs and now it's a truly portable device Wow I can reach everywhere in there look at that they've really surprised me on the fit and finish plus it technically does fit in your pocket and I can't say that I've ever put a laptop in my pocket I don't think I'm gonna shift too many people away from a dedicated laptop as a whole but hey this might be useful to you plus remember the power brick is tiny too it's like a smartphone power brick that's your whole travel setup right there plus let's be honest your phone is probably already USB type-c so now it's one charger for both there are sacrifices you're making here in exchange for mega portability for something that they've said is pocketable full Windows 10 I suppose on its own it's kind of impressive there are plenty of things you can do with Windows I mean you do almost anything with Windows and that's kind of a step up on the other things that might fit in your pocket like a mobile device a smartphone and so on there are some things that you're still incapable of doing on those platforms as far as set of functions that you could fit in your pockets this might represent it that said you might be sitting there thinking ok it's around 500 bucks I mean I could get a laptop for 500 bucks and yes I have to carry a backpack possibly or a laptop sleeve but I'm gonna type better I'm gonna get a bigger display that I can watch things on I'm gonna get better sound so yes it's for a very specific group of people who need ultimate portability and possibly the versatility offered up by Windows alright so thank you very much for sticking around to the end of the video today we have a special segment I don't know if this goes over well we might continue this segment inside a Q&amp;A section where you guys can ask me questions about anything I guess may be related to a previous video which was recently uploaded or maybe related to nothing at all that I've ever done and I don't know it's up to you you ask a question I answer it so I went out on Twitter last night and I said hey at the end of tomorrow's upload I will be including some of your questions I'll probably pick I don't know three and then I'll answer them and maybe we'll do it all over again if it goes well so here we go let me load up my Twitter here and see what some of those questions were all right here's one from Zig our Trivedi what do you think your audience's age group is now this one's actually easy to answer because I have analytics available to me where I can check and see what the age group of viewers is and the majority are between the ages of 18 and 30 somewhere in that range and mostly male in fact I think the viewership is close to 95% male so if you're not in that group if you're one of the five percent of females watching say hello in the comments down below you're part of a very special group and the 5% thank you okay here's another one our H L asks what was your first smartphone and this is kind of tough because I'm not really sure what constitutes a smartphone but I did have a Palm Treo I don't know if you remember that device it had the keyboard on it it was kind of like a blackberry the interface was similar but of course was a palm product had that antenna that stood up at the top now at the time they're only there's a handful of applications none of which were really that great but it did sort of feel like the future and then after that believe it or not I had an Android device before an iPhone I had the very first galaxy s maybe there was an iPhone in between there okay here's a question from CES prinkle or C sprinkle and the question is what is the most mind-blowing product you've ever had on your channel this is obviously tough because there's been so many I don't know maybe like 1,500 videos or something like that it's really hard to pinpoint over the entire period of the channel the most mind-blowing but there have been many and a couple come to mind immediately especially a fairly recent one which was the DVLA phantom speaker if you haven't seen that video you definitely need to go and check it out it's a Bluetooth speaker but the very unusual design it's about this big can sit on a table and can linked up to others it's very spensive but it will blow you away if you sit this closer you just like how is that sound coming out of that package it's true it is truly mind-blowing then the other one that comes to mind is a little bit older it was the unspeakable cup this is a cup it's like a regular travel mug it has some technology on the bottom that stops it from tipping over you can slap the thing all right you can knock the thing of course if you really want to knock it over you can but it's very difficult to do so certainly if it was accidental it would likely stay standing up so if you have a hot coffee in there if you look if you like to have a drink near your computer or something like this you can knock it over at the time I was amazed you should go check about that video as well if you want to see me attempt to knock over a nun spill of a cup I end up just slapping anyway I don't want to spoil it go check that out alright so there you go a little trial run of the end of the video Q&amp;A now you guys can ask me whatever you want you can ask me about this video the last video any video any personal question is completely up to you and you can leave them here in the comments of this video that you're watching right now because I'm gonna come back to this video before filming the next one and answer some more questions at the end of the next video that's a lot of words there but I promise that I'll do it and hopefully you guys enjoy this segment if you do leave a thumbs up down below just to let me know as well and there you go a little bit more dialogue back and forth hopefully I can give you guys some useful info in this segment of the video 
so I've been meaning to try these out the Google pixel bud sort of Google's answer to the Apple earpods it has its own charge case but there's still a cable involved this cable goes around the back of your neck would have been nice to see a fully wireless design comes in two different colors to match the phone this is the just black version my understanding is this is gonna work really well with the pixel device we got to try it out there's the little case that's small that's portable type-c connector over here pretty straightforward boom there's two contact points on each of the two ear buds for the right and the left adjust the amount of slack kind of cool so it fits in this area here and then you close it do you unlock your phone and turn on Bluetooth Bluetooth is already on open the case next to your phone where the buds still inside right within the OS shows a picture of the ear buds yes I'd like to connect now it's explaining the fit to me this way so I'll meet your Google assistant here your messages calendar events and other important info all I do is touch and hold the right earbud hey Google what can you do she said you can say things like play music or what's the weather what's the weather nine degrees Celsius partly cloudy nailed it did the Raptors win their last game No the Raptors lost 120 to 119 yesterday versus the Wizards that's nice the real killer feature here beyond your notifications and Google assistant is also Google Translate for obvious reasons hi my name is Luis I am your friend okay let's bring in our special guests okay everybody round of applause Barry our helpful Mandarin speaker today you must have used an app like this before you but you would just hold it up to the other person and then pass it back say something in Mandarin back to me me home Eugene into my own hello how are you today it I just heard that in the pixel bedroom so I could say back to you hi there I'm doing very well and thank you very much for helping me out with this video right here what the how a child I see means a journey punctual you took a ship here it's pretty good I mean there's color missing words a little bit but I understand the whole content this is convenient right here because the other person doesn't need to have anything I could just pass my phone here and I would have the headset and you and I back and forth what do you think not bad now what would happen if we both had pixel buds what would happen if we both had pixel puns I didn't translate the pistol pose you're not happy right now you're not happy right now okay let's get more complicated then it's preposterous how intricate making an unbox therapy video is for our extravagant audience [Music] no no preposterous magnificent you got to kind of adjust a little bit slow it down a little bit if you are a pixel owner they integrate really nicely there's nothing better than Google Translate I mean it's got so many languages in it I realized I didn't listen to music onions [Music] I think they probably sound a little bit better than air pods you can't really put them on par with like some dedicated over ear headphones or something they're not really there but I was recently in India although most people speak English there but in the event that they did I could have been I could have done I could uh that's right so I gave this a little bit more thought it's an expensive pair of earbuds a lot of promise with the whole translation aspect it all sounds very good there's actually a lot of drawbacks to this you don't have a fully wireless design I don't particularly find them to be the most comfortable earbuds either they don't fit in my ears that great they don't block the surrounding sound at all so don't expect some kind of isolation here also this this big compelling feature with the translation it's cool but really you're just using Google Translate for now it's not quite real-time the only difference is one person's audio is being heard privately I can't help but feel at this point that this product here is sort of like a 1.0 and there's a lot of room to grow there it doesn't seem like a legitimate air pod competitor as it stands right now as of right now giving the price giving the 1.0 status of this product I can't recommend it to you I'm gonna say do not buy the pixel buds wait for the next version they gotta get better happy Chinese New Year get out of here no chance how do we short name just be like senior pilot [Music] she knew a lot to nice indian well I can't get Julie Julie Julie again quite la did I nail it he said perfect do need ah don't need seen yin quite la you happy do you want to say anything to the world okay mom hey daddy see you gotta say hi to somebody all right it's not easy all right give my thumb thank you very much thanks man thanks appreciate it she and you a lot [Music]

it takes a lot to get me amplified you know done like a thousand videos maybe more well how many videos have we done 1200 video every so often a product that shows up here and it's just like whoa this is that product today first glance you like I don't get it it's a monitor big deal seen on five one but this one is different this one packs more pixels than anything I have personally ever feast into my eyes upon 8k monitor 8k 7680 by 40 320 pixels at 60 Hertz what oh my how do you even what do I even what am I even met so many pixels that you're gonna need to feed this thing to display four cables to juice it up now I do feel the need to tell you that this is very premium at the moment alright it's not inexpensive price fluctuates a little bit but you can expect somewhere around 4 grand for this thing so you better be serious about your pixels 100% Adobe RGB srgb rec.709 and 98% coverage spin it around to the back here Jack can pick this part up for you there you can see the two display ports that I mentioned earlier as well as a bunch of USBs 4 USB ports so you can keep your peripherals plugged into this thing and then a single USB cable to the system that you're using the display size itself 31.5 inches diagonally what do you say shall we jump inside this box microfiber cloth quick start power to display ports and USB upstream for the USB hub as you'd expect the stand has to be pretty heavy bootable base stay still monitor moves plus the cutout for your cables very modern and sleek design you've got to get the right eye line on there look at how much it goes up and down very nice there's a little release button here no screws necessary it just clicks right in if I wanted to release it I would just push there whoa so you could do the full-on portrait setup that is my case here I'm using a GTX 1082 DisplayPort cables up into this and it just it immediately figured stuff out now what you're looking at here is still a scaled image because of Windows if I go to display settings here you can see I'm at three hundred percent which is Windows recommendation if I went all the way down to a hundred percent check this out like what happened to that text there can you even see that now in its native resolution that's how small text appears so I have downloaded some images here which are all 76 80 by 43 20 or higher keep in mind you're gonna have to go off my reaction here you're viewing this video in 4k unfortunately so watch me as I watch this here we go ah oh my that is obviously a stake in the lens and the camera sensor like any you know certain areas of the frame are gonna be sharper in here to my eye I've never seen that much detail on a stake in my entire life will look right here look right in here the glistening ridiculous ridiculous ooh Golden Gate Bridge obviously a different aspect ratio here kind of a panorama I mean we can see individual cars over here there's so much resolution to work with here I mean I'm like a detective I can get this guy's license plate over here okay I might be exaggerating this is Los Angeles at night with this cool blue hue going on I don't know if you guys can fully appreciate this but look at that I mean you can individual windows over here it's just so much more resolution than 4k this is maybe my favorite and I'm still unsure if it's a real photo or computer-generated but it doesn't really matter when you look in this section right over here I mean even at a 10x ooh look at that in there what are you talking about up into the trees here I've never looked at another 8k one so I've never seen an image this wonderful surprisingly the streaming is working pretty good over our wireless network this is an 8k video and I mean it kind of speaks for itself to be honest there's actually a surprising amount of very beautiful 8k footage on YouTube that you can enjoy if you one of these monitors obviously very few people do but there are 8k cameras out there and this is the effect you can get this is what individuals shooting on those cameras this is what they see before they publish this is better than some of the still images I downloaded each frame a ridiculous amount of resolution as of right now these guys are ahead of the curve gaming that's a whole different story when you're pushing this many pixels but certainly for any kind of photo editing graphical work where you need to see incredible detail as of right now what else are you gonna put on your desk besides you've probably got four or five grand burning a hole in your pocket right I'll do something with it yourself a few extra pixels actually this is the perfect time to ask you a question what resolution are you watching this video on the display you're using right now what's the max res I bet it ain't a cake this episode of unboxing has been brought to you by the tick watch s &amp; E as well as the tick o many now if you guys are unfamiliar with this this is the most affordable watch that features Android wear and they've had two different models here so this one on the right this is the e model and you can see it comes in a couple of different colors and this one is the S model you can see the detail around the bezel on this one also comes in white and black now to charge this guy up you have this portable charge cable it just slides on there like that boom charging so these guys raised over three million dollars on Kickstarter and have recently began shipping this model out it's got enhanced GPS tracking step counter heart rate monitor and so on and since it runs Android wear of course you have the entire universe of Android wear apps that you can load on here it's also a water-resistant ip67 this right here if Jack can pick that up and that is the heart rate sensor so if you're looking for an affordable but still high quality Android wear watch you're gonna want to check out tape watch now next up is to take home mini which as you might have guessed from the name it's a lot like the Google home mini but with some added functionality in fact this device here is a little more rugged its splash proof and this one is truly portable because it has a built in battery I remember when the whole mini came out you know that'd be nice as a portable speaker as well well that's what this one here this is what it looks like and you'll notice it even has a little carrying strap and since its splash proof you can bring it down to the beach and so on plus you have large tactile buttons but then the convenience of having Google assistant built-in so you can ask it questions you can search things and so on so thanks to tic watch and take home minnie for sponsoring this episode of unbox the P there's a deal right now so you can save some cash on either of these devices 20% in fact check out the details down in the description use the code unbox and click the link down below 
now I've been wanting to check out this phone for a while the me a1 Xiaomi device part of the Android one program around $200 that gives you a clean Android experience and on this channel I have featured so many budget phones that don't do this budget phones that for me I probably wouldn't consider using just because I don't want to have to put up with the skin there's a kind of confidence a kind of Genesis a qua inside of using a relatively stock phone out of the box and quicker updates when it comes to new software getting rolled out dual camera setup pure Android fresh OS upgrades pure as the driven snow do they know it does from you do you do try to Snapdragon six to five I think it's a great chip at this price point and a five point five inch full HD display four gigs of ram 32 gigs of storage hopefully I can recommend this thing some of us people out there might be upset with the appearance being so similar to an iPhone 7 7 plus course one difference here is the fingerprint reader I like this location I'm happy this location is by dual camera setup flash in this location and the antenna layout almost identical to the iPhone does come in black gold and rose gold dual SIM storage expansion there speaker USB type-c and a headphone jack IR blaster surprisingly enough I understand the criticism on the front here with the larger bezel and so on but I want you to adjust your mindset here to the price point there's a benefit to this type of software setup that might exceed the benefit of going with some newer brand some less established brand and whatever software they're gonna give you out of the gate that close to stock experience is very valuable to me all right I'm just being honest earpiece front-facing camera capacitive buttons down at the bottom also in the box a screen protector USB type-c cable and a nice little power brick very portable we are running on android 8 how clean does that look one thing is kind of bugging me a bit I gotta be honest here having the back button on the alongside on the Samsung side Google Apps Google services obviously the six to five snapdragon is not the highest performing chip in the world but it's a good cost to performance ratio and it's great with battery let's boot up YouTube on both of these obviously we're not working with OLED here so the off-axis is gonna suffer a little bit but nonetheless fairly bright well maybe a $4 or $5 smartphone is not right an actual $5 phone go check out the video we'll play the same video here I mean you can't compare pretty decent volume but it's not forward-facing think that speaker is delivering on what it should at this price range since we're on the topic of audio this one actually beats this one when it comes to versatility with the headphone jack there's enough manufacturers that have decided to keep it around I have to mention it as an actual feature now I know what you're thinking you keep telling me this is a replacement to my pixel to excel so I don't need to spend 850 I just I'm gonna spend 200 220 whatever it is for this thing where you're giving up the most is right there cameras in smartphones have become these major differentiation factors pay more you get more in the camera department when you boot up the camera app here pretty straightforward quick little photo here now this is actually kind of a good test for the dynamic range because it's really hot up on the top of the leaves here getting blasted by the studio light and then you have of course a very dark background you know I got to be honest it's just not gonna be pixel level but is it usable I think you're in the territory pixel town you want to go to pixel town with the camera the pixel so dominant in the camera department you already knew that sort of mid-range camera performance at an entry-level price suppose it depends on where you are globally if you consider this entry level here in North America that's definitely entry level that's that's a budget device fingerprint scanner not the fastest I've ever tried but it does get the job done as well there's a lot of get the job done these things as much as they are entertainment devices so Media devices designed for consumption there are also tools you got to get things done for me strip down super clean OS right out-of-the-box and the fresh updates I hold that as a very important characteristic you guys know I love the 1 + 5 t at 500 I think it's a great phone but not everybody's even gonna have that much you got to remember this thing is half the price less than half the price if I move over to the pixel it's gonna be so familiar because the lack of skin now some of you might think of going overboard like Lou stock Android Holy Smoke it's hard to describe it in a tangible way it's a taste thing being a tech enthusiast want to try new Android features as close to when they come out as possible so this device satisfies that part of me and it does so at a price point that's kind of unprecedented if you're staring at around 200 bucks and you got to make a smart phone choice you just want to buy the thing outright like a citizen of Earth you want to take a look around think you're gonna need to look real hard at this one [Music] 
[Music] what did you really do what do you got a fancy juice over there looks tasty though man it looks good we need you down here we got a big TV apparently otherwise known as wallpaper it is that time that we will change the landscape of TVs forever because today Willy do this is the signature the W TV OLED from algae wallpaper you never heard about wallpaper before the a plaster it on the wall you stuck it there instead of painting we see that kind of wallpaper just wouldn't be suitable for an environment like this for a bunch of tech savages like us so what do you say Willie do do we crack into this box or what do we take this thing out or what do we hang it on the wall or what let's go and then pulldown then they come off like this oh that's the TV right there oh man that slim it has been done the wallpaper TV lives look at this beautiful setup over here as it blends in with the picture frames and in fact this far thinner than any of those images we have on the wall and of course far more vibrant as well this thing is thin it is crazy thin let me show you the side of it here that pen is what twice as thick as the TV it's honestly kind of bizarre at first when you look at this thing and certainly when you pick it up as well it's like it's actually flexible to a certain degree and because of that the important components are housing this unit right here this speaker unit so not only do you end up with better sound than what you would traditionally have on a flat panel TV but all your HDMI USBs and so on are housed in here and then a single cable connects the two of them video signal and power will travel through this flat cable right here [Music] so it is a 4k panel of course it's OLED from LG that's kind of their thing now I've been using their products for a while you've probably heard me speak about OLED it has attributes unlike any other TV tech I mean the dark blacks right the bright whites the contrast the saturated colors basically kind of attached itself magnetically me and and will do we just kind of like lined it up it was like both and of course it's a smart TV as well so you've got everything built in YouTube that's what we're watching this on right now these are firing upwards that's why those speaker grilles look the way they do it's bouncing off the surface there it's got a real virtual surround sound effect this thing here is more optimized for that virtual surround kind of scenario now wait that's some NASA footage tell you what Oh Lee look at that oh my what is that the Sun solar flares can you Jack the vibrance look at the difference between the black and the bright spot that's completely pitch black comparatively pixel for pixel that's Canon image does an image get better than that I mean where do we go from here are we just transplanted there that would be too much work I think this TV costs around $27 a year to run and I'm in Austria right now where are you Jax obviously not in Austria even know where that is all right guys so what can I say it's a TV that's thinner than a pen it's about as thin as I can imagine a TV being if you haven't looked at an OLED panel before your eyes will be impressed I guarantee it just do it if you don't believe me there's no stand for it at all it's got to be slapped on the wall but then again with a name like wallpaper and I designed this thin what would you be doing putting on a stand anyway huge shout out to LG for hooking this up because take a look at the space now it's finally coming together this place a bit of disaster then we got this and it was like hey let's let's wrap it up so now this entire space look at it [Music] place to hang out get a massage travel to some other planet or Austria it's all happening here now [Music] [Music] 
so you guys might remember a while back I did a video about a five dollar smartphone a four dollars a four dollar smartphone this really bizarre situation where and we're about to find out what the hell is four dollar phone does people were pre-ordering this eventual smartphone that would be sold for four dollars it was like everyone thought it sounded too good to be true and it turned out that it was and then those phones never ended up shipping and it was a huge fiasco how are you this afternoon alrighty then well maybe a $4 or $5 smartphone is not a reality right now for various reason but I have what is the cheapest phone period that I've ever looked at by far by a longshot no it's not a smartphone as you can tell looking at the picture here if vive v1 made in India a monochrome display a SIM card slot is kind of important on a phone torchlight phonebook FM radio SMS and 650 million power batteries how much would you pay for something like that this is five dollars it's a real thing you can go out and buy this right now why is it interesting well you kind of have to adjust your mindset a global perspective on this it's made in India first of all so it's made in the domestic market and sold to domestic customers this may be their very first point of connectivity we all know where that goes from there so this is gonna put a phone in the hands of a lot of individuals who maybe never had a phone before so the question is what were they able to pack in here for five bucks [Music] okay cool unboxing experience is fairly bare-bones that's about it let's see the cheapest phone made in India thank you there's a power brick to charge it up removable battery and there is the device what a throwback that is kind of reminds me of my first Nokia or something like that a number pad as well as the old-school t9 style texting navigation happens here to call and hang up earpiece up top monochrome display on the top there's a flashlight I wouldn't expect to see that in a $5 phone a headphone jack oh my goodness even a $5 phone has a headphone jack so no microUSB it's got a tube style connector and it looks like the speaker is on the back over here here we have our SIM card tray first of all it looks like there's a sim already in there maybe they give you a simmer maybe they gave me a sim I don't know let's see what happens let's see if this has juice there it is monochrome but a little bit of contrast there no big deal ambulance police here's the flashlight there you go possibly an emergency phone that somebody could keep in the glove box of their car or something all of a sudden you start to understand why you would want to have a flashlight there oh you need to have headphones plugged in for the radio because the headphones are gonna act as the antenna there's a calculator built-in six plus six equals well there you go games is actually oh it has snake and only snake okay I'm having some nostalgic feelings right here we have messages there's a phone book let's try the different ringtones what was he doing I'm asking you I didn't need vitamin yet I find that a little difficult to believe that piercing my favorite is number whew a lot of drama there has a surprisingly strong vibration motor so if you can't hear it you can feel it I don't think I'm gonna be able to put my sim card in here to make a phone cause the problem I think it's a micro these ear pods what are these cost will us price 35 bucks 35 5 let's see if we get this FM radio to work on here oh so this is action this is acting as the antenna right now that's a pretty loud speaker a little FM radio might cost you five bucks I don't know pixel to XL Viva be one eight hundred and fifty dollars five dollars how many of these could you get for one of those a hundred and seventy with the quick mats who's that guys quick maths he goes two plus two is four what not freaked out now obviously I'm not comparing the two that wouldn't be fair that's not fair at all but 170 people with the connection with some form of connection to the rest of the planet or just one fancy boy like will do with this fancy smart phone you want to browse I want to be on social media we're gonna be on my Twitter tweeting smart phone people unbelievable it's such an unusual thing to feature I went on the Amazon page some people are upset they're like call quality not that grey the thing I like about dumb phones in general their functionality is basic so generally what you end up with something that can turn into a good emergency phone is it this thing is five bucks and what does that mean for smart phones and connectivity on that front that price keeps coming down as well and so accessibility goes up the more we can create and distribute ideas $5 phone it's not something I thought I would see technology it keeps pushing and I like that and I think you should too vive v1 it's a thing it's real you can buy this 
oh my goodness what is better than a single 75 inch TV oh I don't know maybe two of them Vizio wanted to do something big I said we'll help bigger your TV's those are pretty big but if it took two of them when you put them side-by-side right oh we've been doing that with computer monitors for how long the dual monitor setup everybody knows about it so why not the living room is it innovative well of course it is that's why I'm doing it maybe someone wants to play video games in the other one doesn't the 75 inch M series home theater display from Vizio chromecast built-in giving you access to your favorite apps also use your smart phone as your dedicated remote they call it the ultimate remote well it's always in your pocket so it probably is it features high dynamic range better known as HDR or HDR 10 Dolby vision ultra color spectrum up to a billion colors 4k Ultra HD because you know it's gotta have the pixels and 32 active led zones we have a couple of smart cast sound bars the 45 inch vizio smart cast salvar systems will they do [Music] that looks so sick oh my goodness can you believe it dual 75 inch screens in a single living room setup you want to watch a little bit of Netflix also play some video games enjoy a nice little film but it's not just that either because these you have chromecast and smartcasts built into them I can select from my different sources as you can see and if I jump over to youtube I can select vizio cast now I'm chrome casting but I don't have a chromecast hooked up to that TV because it is built-in and then from there I can head back to the Smart cast aspect that you can see I can control the media from here so I don't need to search for the remote control that's kind of a cool implementation I'm always losing the remotes anyways I'm trying to show you what's possible I'm trying to change the living room forever this is all about tech overload that's a hundred and fifty inches of entertainment imagine it now video games movies sports - sports that wants two games at once it could be a party I should mention real quick the subwoofers that came with the sound system oh my goodness they go underneath the couch and they grumbles should we do a test I didn't touch your remote just all off of here okay check it out you feel it rumbled so from google play music it's pulling the artwork here so whether I'm in SoundCloud or I'm using google play music here or YouTube or whatever it might be it's giving you a visual representation as well now I expect that for things like YouTube obviously but with these other apps is kind of cool too especially like the SoundCloud one where it shows you across at the audio wave get a nice big 75 inch representation of that so there you have it an absolutely insane setup courtesy of Visio and the 75 inch displays who knows this could be the start of something groundbreaking it might be the start of the dual screen living room no longer relegated to just the office and the monitors but no why not for entertainment as well [Music] 
welcome back to another episode of the incredibly popular series here on unbox therapy gadgets under a particular price point today we're back to gadgets under $10 let's go ahead and get straight into it so first things first on the far side here we have a light bulb obviously I wouldn't show you a standard light bulb this one is a little bit fancier so it's kind of like a budget version of the Philips hue or one of those other programmable Wi-Fi connected bulbs now obviously this one is a little bit more low-tech for 10 bucks but you do have a remote control and you can change the color of it so for a basic type of installation you can have all the ambience of a colorful light without the expenditure of a Wi-Fi connected one all right so I have my famous IKEA lamp here with wireless charger built in I did a video on this very interesting you can charge it can lamp you can do it all so I'm gonna put this in seems right and now my magic lighting remote controller I'll pull this tab out we might need some lights off would you look at that all the basic ones white blue green red and then of course the different sequences the flashing the breathing cycle look at how look how gentle that is okay so a simple way to add some ambience to your light fixture or to your room maybe your bedroom without the investment of a whole setup that's connected to your network maybe this is on your bedside table and it's under ten bucks all right so next up we have a couple of items here that are kind of connected this guy here and this guy here this is for people who drink beer could work for a coca-cola doesn't really matter but this one over here is specifically for bottles look at this this was like four bucks for both of these I think this is a bottle cap remover which also happens to fire the bottle cap why I don't know for fun I guess they give you to include it and they also give you a ring which can open a bottle as well a bottle cap opener ring you got to be a serious drinker to wear that at all times but it looks like it should function it's way less fun than this unit here before I use that I do want to mention another gadget here the beer chiller dick this is for a warm beer in order to instantly chill it and keep it cold this little unit here rather than having to be filled with water it has some sort of frozen fluid in there you stick this thing in the freezer and if you get stuck with the warm beverage you slide this in and instantly it's cold now in the package it came with two and just like on a fancy cooking show I already have the other one frozen so I'm gonna crack the beer and then I'm gonna test this up see how quickly this guy can cool down a warm beer so you can see this is frosty very cold we're gonna use that in a moment first let's try this bottle opener see how this functions here alright so this I get in there like this ooh very nice look at that comes off quite easily and then what do we fire it you ready for this you're gonna lose an eye here I do not do not fire this at people okay it's still a metal projectile let's try it could be fun oh I've had some good distance to it you pop the bottle you fire it into the end there's no mess it is you don't get these bottle caps lying around everywhere it actually has some utility to it it's also kind of fun let's slide this guy in and see what happens okay here we go there's like a gasket a rubber gasket in there so it's secure so the beverage itself enters that chamber and then comes up the ice-cold contraption it's definitely not ice cold yet maybe this thing is targeted more at keeping a beer cold as it says on the top here but then again if you have a nice cold beer how long are you holding on to it what are you doing you hold on to it for a couple of hours or what you need to keep it cool to gene to make it cold let's find out I mean it's definitely colder but it ain't ice cold it's not like the hyper chiller this is more to keep it cold alright if it's a really hot day you're out there but it ain't an ice cold beer alright so next up we have this thing here zag gadget cleaning foam let's go ahead and try it let's see here now you're gonna

cash I'm serious get one of these gadgets or maybe there's something better I don't know comments here's a good one from Donald Trump something tells me that's not actually him but very original username there what one gadget would you take with you for the rest of your life this is easy right I think I don't know am I gonna have battery life am I gonna have electricity because if so I'm taking my smartphone okay you can do the most things I can stay in contact communicate I could play games on it I could watch YouTube assuming the infrastructure stays up and running a smart phone is that one gadget that's on you all the time it's the one that gives you access to everything else so the rest of my life gadget would have to be a smart phone here's a good one how do you get so amped up every episode your videos are the loudest i watch at times I've got to reduce the volume but man it's fun to watch keep up the psychie you know what that is it's a good question because I feel that it's important to bring my a-game to the table I try to remember what it's like to get some new gadget because ultimately I'm an enthusiast first I'm interested in tech like naturally without this channel that's why I got into this channel so if I come on here and it's just like ho-hum here we go another product another gadget and I'm not really doing service to the thing until what your experience would be like if you were interacting with that thing I've done like 1200 videos there's so many products that come through they start to just look like a stack it starts to look like a pie who would want to watch that if I get pumped about a product whether it's all camera or otherwise this is me oh man I'm like look at that thing that thing is cool you need to go out and get one that's me to you and it's me in my regular life to people who ask me that question they say Lou what do I need I say you need to listen to me right now alright here's what you need to do that's that's what I do that's who I am if you can't get passionate about it why are people asking you for why are you the one that people are asking for advice if you don't even care so the reason I'm amped is because I care oh here's a good one hey Lou I've got a question how much time does it take to record a video do you get to enjoy your life to believe yes believe it or not I have a lot of time left so one thing about my videos is that they're never scripted ok there's there's I'm not sitting down and I'm like formulating how I'm going to express something I want it to be organic you know I want to just I want to go off the top like what is this thing making me feel how am i interpreting it what is the impression what is the reaction those are the important components to me so because of that it means I for the most part I get to sit here put a product in front of me and see what happens and the good part about that is it means I can make a lot of videos I don't need to necessarily invest my whole life plus I work with great people who are able to take certain tasks off my plate when it comes to editing and other things so I can have a pretty decent balance between how often I'm at work how often I'm at home and how often I'm doing things that I enjoy there you go three questions answered for you remember leave your questions in the comment section of this video and you might show up on the next episode 
would you look at these unusual gadgets especially this one I've said it before I'll say it again I'm here to uncover what's happening in the entire realm of gadgets and today is no different something here called the Symphonica a modular system called vibes something called the mighty you're gonna get to learn about all of them a very formal intro hmm first I want to kick it off with this vibes system think of it kind of like moto mods where you can swap out an attachment on the back of your device put on this case here then click in the sound engine this thing looks pretty substantial or the battery bank 150 times your battery charger so it's kind of like a bumper so here's an s8 just slam it in there this is your fold getting chunkier benefit is a lot of protection wow that is a substantial speaker so this is the charge doc so that the speaker is ready to go when you want to take it with you this also has a kickstand on it and then you have a speaker you have a Bluetooth speaker which is stationary wherever you happen to be you press this release take this with you this remains plugged in an EQ button volume up and down play pause answer phone call okay so clipping it in is easy my phone is huge now we're gonna listen to that in a second but this is the volt rocks even though it's a type-c connector to go into the phone it's a micro USB connector to charge this up you see we have a full charge there 3000 milliamp hours and then all that happens is this little piece pops out and you have a type-c connector on the iPhone version that's gonna be lightning same idea it clips in there into there and we're charging up hopefully this thing has some battery as well whoa I was sensual that is why is that making me uncomfortable well so we'll pair it up some volume here let's do a quick comparison here provide audio honestly I expected to do outer if I was gonna go through the hassle of carrying all this around I think I want a little more juice I think it's a cool concept but as it sits right now at least the speaker unit it leaves me wanting a little bit more next up the mighty obviously it reminds me of mp3 players before we had smartphones the cool thing to have was an mp3 player of some kind it's kind of a throwback iPod works with Spotify Premium take all your music with you and the ability to leave your smartphone at home works with Bluetooth headphones and wired headphones thousand-plus song storage drop resistant water-resistant disconnect from your digital distractions and be one with your music for a present and more joyful light comes in a couple different colors turn on tune in drop out let's move USB 2 mini Jack charge port and the headphone jack a cliff look at this you could clip it right here this is really bringing me back to my ipod shuffle days all right let's see if this thing has any juice on it probably not any of course there's a flap and update how dare you all right so I let this thing charge overnight not that I had to I mean and there's my mighty shows up right away success and now the player connects to Spotify zero percent of the storage is being used you see have 96 percent battery there guess I'll just add a few things to it there it is and they just go ahead and sing such a nice simple little player it's a throwback getting retro vibes here that's kind of cool alright so think about it last but not least it's called the Symphonica passive acoustic speaker this is some old-school stuff the amplification is strictly coming through the design the shape of it and the original speaker on the smartphone oh wow whole smells delicious it just looks cool this is so that you can at least charge up your device when it's in here it's also gonna be the thing that holds the device there come up through the bottom I guess this little thumb screw I'll screw it in these little bands are four different iPhones five six six plus we're gonna use an iPhone 10 so and I guess it just creates a better seal let's try to eat I mean it's simply not gonna compete with proper amplification it does make the sound a little more direct I don't think that's really what this is about I mean it just looks really cool but I think for most people they're gonna be better off with a Bluetooth speaker but it will not smell this guy [Music] not even close [Music] 
I've got a bunch of smartphones in front of me and I can't say that I mind one of the great privileges of this particular profession is the ability to try out a completely absurd number of smart phones so I'm gonna give you a little bit of history right now on what I have been gravitating towards the phones I've been using and what I'm about to do which is drastic in front of me here I have my various daily driver smart phones for the past little while the past few months at least I've got them in chronological order of when they occupied my pocket on the far left I have the Galaxy s8 which I put my sim in so I got my hands on the Galaxy s8 when it came out enjoyed the phone it had its own sets of positives and negatives I switched over from that device to one that I actually didn't show you guys unfortunately I never got around to making a video in the active version of the SI an AT&amp;T exclusive device which increases the battery life up to four thousand milliamp hours now you know I'm a big fan of big batteries otherwise it's essentially the same granted it has this alternative body on it kind of like having a case on your phone it has a shatterproof display which sounds good but it actually made it more prone to scratches so I ended up with a tiny little not the worst scratch in the world what it gives you in flexibility when you drop it you give up a little bit in hardness one of the things that I didn't like very much about these phones is the fingerprint scanner maybe this was the only place they could put it but maybe they could change the shape I don't know but I never really had ultimate confidence in this location in the shape of it if you're using a case a little more finicky to get your finger in there of course you touch the lens there's a giant fingerprint on the lens right now otherwise an awesome phone but then the pixel comes out the pixel to pixel choo XL we're talking about the pixel I've got a bunch of them in front of me if there's a new OS Android 8 I'm like I gotta use it I enjoyed this I mean again not without its issues the color shift on the display probably not the nicest OLED display of the bunch an almost entirely plastic build which you may or may not like lots of positives to the forward facing speakers not a thing that we see on these other two vices it feels really nice to type on the camera is very nice from there I tried out this thing that was so different you probably caught the video I was very complimentary of this device meet razor phone in an age of bezel asst smartphones they were like who cares and what we're gonna do is put the best speakers ever in a smartphone in this smartphone it's the best speaker I've ever heard of smartphone and that's what they did and because of that I was compelled to move my sim over and give it a real shot the multimedia I'm enjoying it I'm really liking the fingerprint scanner the location of it on the power switch the noise that it makes when you unlock very razor esque but then you look at the camera and I believe I've got some level of preliminary software on here so my confidence is not a hundred percent yet considering this phone hasn't shipped in regular users aren't using it yet but also majorly important a four thousand milliamp hour battery the same as the s8 active so that brings me to the end of this lineup and you've probably already noticed sitting there is an iPhone 10 the phone that has had a split reaction some people think it's the greatest thing Apple's ever made others are critical of the notch and the software the fact that it's not a hundred percent optimized yet but of course we are talking about Apple's flagship and the camera so far has been phenomenal but the iPhone and Apple in general is a source of major influence in the tech space I feel a responsibility to give you guys as much feedback as I can to dive in more deeply to find out what's good what's not so good and what might even be bad so today I am switching to the iPhone 10 something you probably noticed here is this is a lineup of Android devices so this is kind of a big deal I will be using the iPhone 10 exclusively as my daily driver for at least one week at which point I will come back here I will sit here and I will give you the one week later report Jack show the people cue the music bye bye Android hello iPhone 10 the SIM card is in this is my new daily driver device for at least one week I have officially switched to the iPhone 10 and I will hold nothing back one week from now the truth will be here and only here so subscribe if you haven't yet and stay tuned 
this is an iPhone 10 otherwise referenced frequently as the iPhone X I really don't care what you call it there's been some news developing and I feel like we should discuss it I'm no stranger to this device I used it for an extended period of time and I came back to you with some video content my findings my feelings and so on and I want to be clear about something at this point right now this is a good phone the camera is nice and so on and a lot of people enjoy it and that's cool for me it just ain't my choice and I don't think it represents a great value given its price point but today's video is about an article that I read yesterday on Forbes which was informed by an article on Apple Insider essentially stated that this phone right here in front of me might be getting canceled by Apple this is not a TV show how do you cancel it what do you what do you do here well according to Ming Chi quo this prolific information leaker who is essentially I mean he's never wrong this guy all right his company KGI securities reported recently that production was going to shut down soon and that the reason for it a lack of demand for this device right here now he stated that one of the reasons for this potential cancellation is a lack of demand specifically in China regarding the overall screen size of this device it's not the biggest screen in the world face ID where you add there you go obviously there's plenty of orders that are already put in for this there's retailers and telecommunications companies that are gonna have these things on the Shelf it just means that you're gonna shut down the assembly line sooner than you normally would and the current rumor based on the information from this guy is that that'll happen at some point in the summer this would mark the first time ever that Apple has shut down or canceled a particular device before the next one has actually launched like you you buy an iPhone 7 right now you can even buy a brand new iPhone 6s I believe the idea here is not that the 10 would be completely dead but a modified larger version would take over for it and this one would be buried forever but that's not where the story ends all of a sudden there was an update Ming Chi quo he kind of backtrack a little bit was like wait I phones performing pretty good I'm not really sure they're gonna shut it down I'm not really sure what's going on and to me that 48-hour backtrack is kind of interesting on its own was the original information bad did something change in the face of the reporting I'm not really certain the question still remains is this phone going to be canceled or not now of course you guys know where I stand on this particular device I don't think it's the greatest value for money and I even anecdotally I know people in my life I have chosen to upgrade to the iPhone 8 or 8 plus instead of this and so when I saw the report come out stating that that's what people were doing that they weren't gravitating towards this model I could see some reality in that at least in my own personal experience so at a certain point you have to wonder if that influence has leaked out or if people just in general haven't gravitated towards this particular phone you might think something is a great deal or a great design and someone in China or India or elsewhere might think other ones but this development it certainly lends itself to my intuition which is that this marketplace has gotten incredibly more competitive recently and what you are able to get at lower price points has improved substantially so the question going forward probably not just for Apple but also for Samsung and the various other premium smartphone makers how big is the demand for a $1,000 phone and do they sort of need to reconfigure a little bit in order to match the demand that does exist now for the record I don't imagine that the next generation iPhone flagship will be less than this one I think Apple is perfectly happy playing in that premium space and so is Samsung but the numbers once they eventually become public well those won't lie and we'll find out for certain what the demand is for this particular device compared to the others what do you think is gonna happen do you think that this will survive that the iPhone 10 will remain intact or will this one go to bed somewhere you let me know down in the comments also what do you think is the perfect smartphone screen side Tim Cook he's gonna be down in these comments he's gonna be reading what you're saying so get your voice out there [Music] 
let's try that again oh-ho so you just watched the Apple Keynote the iPhone 10 the iPhone 8 and so on very exciting everyone was pumped it was your usual Apple lovefest now there were a couple of developments during this keynote regarding the release date of the iPhone 10 which looks to be delayed from the iPhone 8 but I think some of that has to do with software and more specifically this face unlock feature I missed this moment the face unlock demo went wrong course afterwards on my Twitter everyone was hitting me up blue did you see the demo the stock price of Apple it dropped because the demo failed it was it was a failure I've been skeptical of the face unlock in general for a while apple claims to be going a different route so let's go ahead let's see how they're describing their face unlock and then well then we'll see the failure your iPhone is locked until you look at it and it recognizes you nothing has ever been simpler more natural and effortless okay here's my first issue right here it's like simple and natural and effortless here's I've been talking to the guys here in the studio after watching this keynote it's actually not all that natural because it often doesn't get the face unlock from this range or this angle instead you're kind of like this you're blocking your view it to me it's not that natural so they've got way more sensors up here in the section the only cut out along the bezel of the iPhone 10 including an infrared camera a flood illuminator a front camera and a dot projector now they're saying this flood illuminator allows for this function to work even in the dark projecting light onto your face illuminating it enough so so the recognition can take place it projects the dots onto the face and then the infrared camera picks those dots up a software analysis using neural networks to detect if that's the face that was originally registered it's being measured in a three-dimensional sense and cannot be fooled by a picture or something like this this information will not be transmitted to the cloud instead apparently everything will happen locally in your device and our phones is an 11 Bionic chip with a built-in neural engine to process face recognition okay so this is where that Bionic term comes from with the a 11 chip this neural processing is neural network they're talking about is embedded into your device they playing touch ID is one in 50,000 the face ID is one in a million because of these various dots that are being projected onto an individual's face he does say that if you have an evil identical twin that they might be able to get in or probably could get in I don't know how identical identical twins are after saying all that invites the next guy onto the stage Craig federighi and he proceeds to attempt this unlock that has just been talking about now this is probably not a finished product there's all kinds of fails that happen during presentations for various reasons but in this particular case I was already skeptical Apple they're not famous for fails on stage but of course the internet reacted the stock market reacted so let's check out this moment so let's take a look now unlocking it is as easy as looking at it and swiping up and you know let's try that again oh-ho-ho let's uh go to back up here and get right in okay so there's this two-stage system where you look at the device and then you also swipe up in order to unlock it it's not like on the galaxy s 8 where you hold it up and that's it it unlocks one stage it has two elements and what happens on the first device that he holds up here he doesn't function he does the swipe portion and it asks him for a passcode this is going to be a fear of many people adopting this new technology it might not have been apparent to you immediately but after the initial face unlock fail Craig he reaches up and he kind of wipes his face like this now first I thought it was just some kind of nervous reaction but I gave it a little more thought and I realized he obviously knows more than we do he's been involved in the development of this feature in this device so is it possible that this feature is being broken in some cases by substance on the skin if it's a little bit oily or maybe there's some sweat on there maybe if somebody uses a lotion who knows a reflective aspect to having some shine on the skin which might mess up the face ID feature and it seemed like he was aware of it you might build in the habit of just using the pass code all over again like you have on previous devices this thing needs to be bang on if it's going to have widespread adoption oh ho ho I don't think it requires a major overreaction and I definitely don't think that the product is a failure because of it but you know that is not ideal for Apple they would have loved for that first demonstration to go the way that they expected which was to unlock the device immediately oh ho but judging from the feedback I've gotten a number of tweets comments people talking in the live stream about it it's obviously important to people so I felt the need to just do a quick breakdown to show you that face ID fail and you can make of it what you will let me know down in the comments will this stop you from investing in the iPhone 10 are you a little bit nervous about this face system are you okay with going back to a traditional passcode or its touch ID just too important to you or a fingerprint unlock in general thanks for watching guys and if you're interested in more iPhone 8 or iPhone 10 content I will have those devices here on the channel as soon as possible so make sure to subscribe so you don't miss any of that [Music]

[Music] today is an exciting day because I've got the latest device from one plus the one plus 5p hmm never settle look at the cut look at the pictures in here alright here we go it's made out of anodized aluminum oxygen OS based Android 7.1.1 Snapdragon 83 v adrenal 540 GPU 8 gigs of RAM DDR 4x storage is 64 or 128 gigabytes 3300 milliamp hour battery width the - charge quick charge bluetooth 500 NFC enabled 6 inch 1080p display with 18 by 9 aspect ratio and it's also got 2.5 the Gorilla Glass 5 holy smokes alright so it looks like I've got the midnight black 128 gigabyte version not complaining about that particular option ooh the first thing here's the device how about that unboxing experience with the little tray there very slick aluminum build dual camera system up here NFC sensor in this location moving around the rest of the Vice we have a headphone jack so if you want to protect that high-end set of headphones you're still golden USB type-c connector your power and lock switch got your mute switch there volume rocker up and down and I like the minimal branding just the subtle little one plus symbol there okay also in this box we have Owen other-- case sim tool Quick Start Guide the good old fashioned sim one sim - tray what seems to be a very high quality charge cable this plugs into the - charger so oneplus claims that with this brick here and a half hour charge you can get a day's worth of battery who should we do the face data move it a little closer look at that so it gives you like a little outline of where to put your face ears and whatnot and then it just scans it so unlike on iOS where you're kind of doing this action you just line it up and it grabs it ok let's try let's say it's on the table it's locked whoa that is that's quite quick I must say let's try the fingerprint and this is your usual setup here so let's give that a shot now that might be even faster than your face so you have a lock device you pull it out of your pocket the payment terminal is over there and in one kind of motion you just unlock it and kaboom now the display is the next thing you probably noticed this is AMOLED you just get a lot more contrast it has this kind of appearance of being super close to the surface the OS here it has a few tweaks to it but ultimately it's a very close to stock Android experience though when you pull over to the side it's a little bit different over here on the Left pane by default you have a memo option some recent contacts recent apps and then a dashboard which can show you some details about your phone like available storage battery life and data remaining on a data plan now you probably have a lot of questions about the camera specifically the portrait mode and I believe in order to enter the portrait mode you swipe over shoot with portrait to help the subject stand out so what it's gonna attempt to do is isolate the subject in the foreground from the background and I can move him even a little closer and it does so automatically and identifies it with this depth effect icon down on the bottom it did kind of well with the action figure that's kind of nice that this is gonna probably be a better example it did a pretty good job on the edge now she obviously doesn't have ears but it did a pretty decent job now if I head back to the standard camera mode this is where you can engage for the secondary lens we can go ahead and zoom in and we can drag the icon to continue even further as you can see there I'll give you guys a look there so you can get a sense for the quality of our favorite green plant oh and the specialty coca-cola and then of course the camera mode and we'll go all the way up to 4k and we'll do a quick little test the 4k 30fps setting on the 1 plus 5t little auto focus there shifted I'll grab this guy and as usual say hi to jab the camera also features a pro mode if you really want to dive in there let the ISO readout shutter speed you can see if it's a level shot or not we can change is away from auto our white balance shutter manual focus mode and even the ability to shoot raw of course it's also got a front-facing camera the selfie test kicks off in three two one that is a selfie whoa like specks of dust on the sweatshirt alright cool so far so good now of course you know I gotta test his speakers to protect you from laptop hacking I think Jack needs one of these they gave us a Canada one team USA holy smokes thinner than I expected [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] it's a down firing speaker alright this is kind of this status quo the upside here is you have to have phone jack now of course they've got the unique slider for silencing this actually has three stop points silent do not disturb ring do not disturb silent very nice all right nice little touch something special something unique since we have all the cases here I thought might as well do a case fashion show while we're at it so let's go ahead and try some of these out the Rosewood bumper case not bad next up the sandstone protective case this one has that kind of gritty grippy feel to it the ebony wood bumper case the construction will be like the other one here we have the silicon protective red and also the easiest to get on and last up is the one I'm most excited for the carbon bumper case contains DuPont Kevlar fiber and that's your look and this concludes the one plus 5t impromptu case fashion show so there you have it the five T the latest device from oneplus let me know down in the comments what do you guys think about it could this be your next phone 
so I've always been a fan of magnets I love anything magnetic for as long as I can remember my favorite character in x-men magneto although I always wondered Magneto Professor X because Professor X I mean he can move any object magneto is stuck with metallic objects anyway there's one magnet that I missed especially and that's the magnet on the MagSafe connector of the MacBook Pro anybody who's ever owned a MacBook you've seen it you've known about it you've just connected your charger and not even thought about it nestles itself up to the connection point it's quite charming in fact Wow as you know the latest iteration of the MacBook Pro no longer has a MagSafe connector but it's not over because this company right here VIN puck they think they've solved the situation not just for the new MacBook and MacBook Pro but also any USB C device this is essentially the MagSafe concept for USB type-c it's called the pop mag bolt s and it's capable of fast charging various devices notebooks tablets smartphones etc now right about now you're saying Lou I don't get it what's the big deal you plug in you unplug get on with your life well here's the thing okay I've seen this before over my years of being a tech enthusiast and dealing with many people's tech problems in my personal life I've seen the laptop fell off the table scenario somebody tripped over the cable it's all bent out of shape the laptop you you don't want that and the MagSafe was a solution to that problem no problemo so that's the reason that this is especially exciting all right I'm gonna open up the silver one and let's take a closer look at this thing whoa it comes with its own case a table SATA first they're not messing around vim POC is not messing around okay a substantial cable there it looks pretty long longer than I expected in fact a little velcro cable management on there and this is what the cable looks like okay of course two connectors here it actually kinda looks like just a normal type C cable now this end is completely normal because you only need the trip side on one side this side here will go into you phone or your laptop so here's the magnetic portion look at that it's as simple as that you see that there Jack look at that this thing slaps in there and that's it meg safe is back so let's give this a shot okay here are my devices it's an SI it's a MacBook Pro I'm going to insert this on this side here so this guy will just live in there like that it's time to charge as it often is and you just line this baby up Oh convenience that I just saved the day is the MagSafe back well I don't know it might be you just get near there Oh satisfying yeah I thought so this is a Galaxy s8 insert that into the bottom there now yes in this particular scenario you have to get used to having a tiny little bump on the bottom I don't know to me it's not that offensive same idea kaboom yes it's a long cable - how about that they're not messing around I guess since its intended for a laptop it kind of has to be can I tell them a quick story alright I don't want to throw anybody under the bus here and this is why I was avoiding this story earlier but this that issue it just happened to me like two days ago there was a trip over a laptop I'm not throwing anybody under the bus luckily the laptop was ok but the charger itself was busted now you know what I just felt I had to tell you I personal experience with this was which is part of the reason that I'm this motivated and wasn't me who tripped over the thing just to be clear so the other end of this thing just like you would normally do with your charging brick and the magnetic end is on this side oh there it is dunt dunt and we're charging the real test is the trip test I'm put I put my laptop on the line for this Oh and dangerous kind of nervous right now actually use that I use I use this laptop it's not a decoy oh man here we go okay course it works though you know one thing that I noticed depending on the way you pulled it out so what you'll see is like if I wanted to pull the whole thing out I could you just get used to pulling it off a certain way like you just flick it up or to the side and then that thing just stays in there no big deal right like that it really is like adding mag saves back to the MacBook Pro without needing to permanently modify anything and I've seen this type of product for phones and other devices but I think on the laptop is where it makes most sense because if somebody walks past this thing you know that they're there very frequently sitting on tables with the cable going to the wall like that's not an uncommon scenario and this essentially guarantees that your laptop's not going to go flying off the table or that your Chargers gonna get busted or anything else it's just gone look it's it that's just it's a simple thing but it's great question time I like this one from Matt Bryan here will you receive fan mail well the answer is yes I have been for a while there's an address on the about page of my youtube channel where people have sent stuff in the past I haven't done any type of fan unboxing series but I just spoke to the other people here at unbox therapy and they think it might be a good idea some a fan unboxing episode maybe send me frequently it could be insane it could be bananas I don't know leave a thumbs up down below if you think that might be interested send some stuff here's one from Cole how much are you willing to pay for the iPhone 8 well not the most fair question because I'll be buying it regardless cuz I'm going to be making videos about it here on YouTube but if I was a regular person like just just your average tech enthusiast I think it will be hard to justify at the rumored price twelve hundred dollars people are speculating but the Edition version could start at 1200 or be around a thousand this is starting to become a major investment for the average tech head and on top of that there are so many great budget phones now it's kind of tough to justify I will buy it regardless but at $1,200 I'm gonna have a hard time recommending it to people so here's one hey Lou what is the weirdest tech you have ever seen in your life well it's hard to answer because we get a ton of tech and gadgets and general weird things here at unbox therapy [Music] now if you want to know what that thing's for you got to tune in to the next episode of question time [Music] 
you got a stand for something in this life god damn it this is gonna be fun I ordered this thing here in front well that's I mean what I do sometimes people send me things other times I'm like I have to order that because I need to find something out this is one of those moments this phone the x5 from doogee it's an Amazon phone a phone that I bought on Amazon and he costs $58 a $58 Android smartphone what are you talking about you $58 I can't I saw the iPhone 10 released a thousand bucks what do you mean I'm not 58 I can barely go out for lunch 58 the whole smartphone marketplace it's gotten more competitive there are companies like the recent device that I featured here the razor phone I've been using in my SIM cards in it I promised you was gonna be and it's in there 600 bucks 700 bucks it's in that range okay I see what they can do at that price point the essential phone just went it's $500 now the essential phone there's always gonna be people that just want the best and that's fine there's a convergence in expensive phones have gotten a lot better and a lot closer to the expensive ones period no ads so there are devices in Amazon that are subsidized by ads you boot them up you watch an ad this one no ad 5.0 inch 720p display in mt6582 are first of all the fonts here we need to do some work on that not a kind of contrast from the black and the gray Android 6.0 gigabyte of ram 8 gigs of storage 5 megapixel camera 2 megapixel front alright listen we're not competing on specs here that's not the goal 58 bucks power brick USB cable as well a standard microUSB no fancy USB type-c alright and then the device that's pretty much that's all there is ok so that's the back of the phone matte black finish camera up in the corner everything looks to kind of make sense there there's the display the x5 ok some capacitive buttons on the bottom obviously something of yesteryear as far as devices are concerned you don't see this so much anymore let us remove this screen cover here ooh all right when it comes to budget devices for whatever reason they will install a screen protector to preserve the lifespan volume rocker over here speaker is on the bottom there is a headphone jack surprisingly an off-center microUSB port on the top of the phone that is not common at all I remind you 58 dollars so I noticed we're dealing with a removable back situation here and again this was common on phones once upon a time you hardly ever see this anymore a 2400 milliamp hour battery 2 SIM card slots and a micro SD card slot unbelievable 3d stereo sound where are the stereo speakers I guess ok here we go a little bit of a laggy opening sequence there why was there no setup they set it up in advance that always freaks me out a little bit the app button is a little different than usual but it works there's a couple of things you wouldn't normally see like app lock up there and parallel space but otherwise it's not overloaded what are you supposed to do with this button oh I see quick toggle lockscreen game mode etc a screen recorder right in your quick settings there by default it's taken me to do GCC it is not the brightest display boys and girls the sound is not that bad the display is darkest so if you have a few more dollars to spend you definitely need to go check out this video I'm using it right I'm using that phone right now alright it's made an impact on me because it does basically what an expensive one does at one tenth of the price once upon a time a phone in this price range will be like unusable but you could tell already like I'm doing something though I haven't launched the camera yet the camera ain't gonna be good I know it and the lag from when you hit the button the leg you're out you're with your friends and why not oh good we're young we do stuff we go out we're out cool yeah yeah wait wait your friends who feel let me see what you got how do I look you see that looks like you're half in the bag yo look what we did last night blur factory I'm gonna really try here not the worst thing I've ever seen it's I mean it's a five megapixel image it kind of reminds me of images from phones about four years ago maybe now the front-facing camera Oh actually better than I expected although I think they buted me I think I got beauty but in all honesty at 58 all right it's not gonna be for everyone okay I'm not trying to convince you to throw out your Galaxy s8 I'm trying to show you the landscape of what's happening to inform you about the fact that $58.00 phones are a thing and they're kind of decent for the price you can watch a video on YouTube alright and that's the main thing so you can keep watching unbox therapy so I could keep doing this good night this episode of unbox the P has been brought to you by

so I've shown you many different keyboards over the years all the coolest all the weirdest all the most unique this device it's a thing that you interact with all the time pretty much every day if you work on the computer live on the computer game on the computer you're in front of a keyboard let's kick it off with this one here it's called the Expos economic mechanical keyboard very simple packaging here it's a nice white box the most obvious thing that you'll notice about this one is probably different than yours is the layout look at that that is that is super unusual the reason that an ergonomic keyboard in general has this type of layout is because of the way that your hands kind of rest down on the table and with a straight keyboard right you might have to bend them back a bit to get in the correct position where naturally the wrist kind of wants to go this way and so these keys are meant to follow your fingers essentially look at this you'd normally have a space bar right across the bottom instead you have this split design so there's two spots for the space bar and in the middle they've utilized that space for control shift and enter button and a backspace which is kind of cool because that gets used frequently having it there instead of there might save you a couple of seconds it has some feet on it too so you can get a better angle there you see so now it's even even more in line with how your wrists want to live while you're typing so it's optional mechanical key switches with Gator on red black blue or brown and it's also got RGB adjustable lighting and apparently the casing here is made out of an aluminum alloy the whole thing feels real solid so type-c the standard USB all right let's see what this backlight looks like oh look at that this this area in the center here lights up it's glowing like a oh and the RGB starts moving around there we go okay you can see that a bit better now definitely if you look along the top from pink purple orange red green and so on you can of course configure this however you like you can have it cycle like this stick to a particular color but that's kind of what its gonna look like for a person like me okay that's already like not a sophisticated typing machine typist I'm already kind of pecking around this is a very foreign experience could could I get used to it possibly like look at me I'm reaching up here you're definitely not gonna open this up and immediate we feel comfortable with it unless you're familiar with the ergonomic concept all right so that's the expose next up also equally unusual it's a 60% mechanical keyboard these things are all arranged since this keyboard is small you're gonna be missing certain keys like even the directional keys so as you can see here by holding the function key you actually end up with these functions coming back to you in like a duel like a key combination scenario this one is off Amazon it's very affordable it's also mechanical this one has key switches called red switch these are I believe the same as the switches in the last keyboard I was looking at okay let's crack this open here wow look how small that is this is tiny mmm look it look how slender and sleek that is it's only 60% of a regular keyboard the only thing that strikes me immediately like whoa what am I gonna do without that is the directional keys but of course holding down your function key you can turn these other keys into your up down side to side if you use them of course the layout a lot more familiar here a lot more traditional and the bottom is pretty straightforward oh very nice this is a lot more similar to what I'm using right now whoo zoom in on that orange blue Oh like a split look at that the triple setup so this is not the brightest backlight in person you can see it a little bit when you look at it directly but anyway you can cycle through there's a few different settings as I mentioned before and of course the focus here is shrinking down to the bare necessity of what you need a keyboard to be now if I take out this next keyboard you're gonna see how just how much smaller this thing is comparatively this one is from a company called Maya Nicks and they sell it with these interchangeable key caps like this it's also backlit it's also RGB but much more of a classic layout so look at this one here full-size and now this is really gonna help you appreciate just how small the 60% keyboard is look at that it looks tiny comparatively speaking I like this look at this thing very nice solid build mechanical key caps we have a cable here with the little bungee on it which i think is a cool look a full rubberized mat on the bottom ooh very little slip there maybe not as much of an incline as you might like but reasonable Oh another thing I like on this the OS key it mean it actually says OS as opposed to being a Windows key or the Apple key this will work on both platforms so why have a dedicated key that can't be interchangeable that's very cool also in the package we have a sticker a little bit of paperwork look at the look at the inside of the box is that cool or what why does that remind me of The Simpsons why does that make me want a donut well I know why because there's a picture of one right there also a silca packet which as you know is Jack's favorite treat but you're not jack so where's jack okay so that's the layout of the keyboard let's plug it in and we see the RGB lighting again not super bright but really the purpose of these back lights is for dim environments anyways okay last up we have a wild one this is the retro classic from Azio azo I have featured their products in the past in fact I featured one that looked almost exactly like this which I was like this thing is over the top steampunk style keyboard they went even further with this one the artisan series retro classic this one is primarily in my opinion for appearance you want the ambient environment maybe you go this way so three colors are available there's this one with the copper and the black there's also a full black onyx version and then there's one called posh which is white mostly this is the most steampunk looking version of the retro classic and they claim it's gonna be the right height with an adjustable incline look at the unboxing experience whoa that is wild oh my goodness it has like a leather deck in there holy smokes alright this one wins for unboxing experience braided USB cable guys this actually smells like leather right now it smells like I'm at a shoe store like I'm getting a fancy leather shoe and this one is completely different look at it it's actually like a typewriter this would take me a while to get used to much like the ergonomic one but like I said I think this is for a certain type of environment maybe it's a it's at the front desk is the receptionist to like some cool business has this thing sitting there you walk in you're like whoa look at that thing this is that keyboard this is all legit alloy on the outside with the copper plating the copper coloring it's heavy move in now let's plug this in real quick I mean you can already see it shining through but go ahead turn off the lights look at that that is some bright backlighting a ton of contrast through those key caps so this is obviously a really cool look I mean that's what this keyboard is about all right so there you have it four unique keyboards this one might be the most unique it's certainly the heaviest and it feels the highest quality but for me the one that I would most likely put on my desk in fact I'm gonna go put this on my desk right now the Maya Nicks I don't know what it is this keyboard here is just speaking to me it's the color it's the gray I'm gonna customize the keys I think I like the fact that the whole bottom is rubber it just feels really solid don't forget we had this little guy the 60% keyboard I think this is gonna be popular for a number of users I feel like you've got to be a power user I feel like these other two keyboards here are more focused on power users even though this one looks the same once you use this thing there will be an adjustment period and then this one here which is the ergonomic layout I don't personally have a ton of problems with the traditional layout but I can see how given a certain number of hours spent on a keyboard you might get sore in the wrists and so on so there's a few options there for unique keyboards hope you guys enjoyed it let me know down in the comment section which one would you go for I'll drop links down in the description to each one question time we've got some good ones today first stuff from Mohammed Ben said it did you still playing hockey some of you know some of you don't in fact there's some videos that would expose the fact that yes I do play hockey and I still play one of the few ways I maintain this physical structure right here I just think like why would you exercise like lifting weights it's boring get out there play a game hockey is that thing for me so I play twice a week I'm in the offseason right now cuz I play in the summer I play in the winter two separate teams two times a week get on the ice alright have a Molson Canadian and get out there maybe have the Canadian after the Olli okay so here's one from Marcel studio which game console is the best one for you Xbox or ps4 ok the truth here I don't play very many console exclusive titles like titles that only exist on PlayStation or only on Xbox one of the series that I that I did get invested in in the past that was exclusive was Uncharted so because of that game I've generally been in the PlayStation Camp but here's the thing like these are more comparable than they are different so you can't go wrong with either the PlayStation Camp or the Xbox camp I know people get fired up you gotta be on this one you gotta be on that one I would say follow the exclusive titles that piqued your interest and then grab that console but anyway my playstation gets more use ok here's the third one from Silvio do you watch Game of Thrones well in fact I did watch the first season all right so I was like I'm going along its medieval things are interesting the cinematography and then the Dragons started coming out towards the end and I was like oh man I don't know if I can keep nothing like I think it's cool but I just wish it had to just stayed like this a little bit less mystical I don't know is that even they're gonna be so mad at me now for this it wills mad at me right now I just wanted it to be like a long form of Braveheart or something like that that's all I want it don't put any spoilers in the comments I know everybody loves Game of Thrones so so be it all right I could deal with a little bit less of the magical mystical side of it that's just me so there you have it your questions have been answered remember in this video leave your questions down below one more time because I will be answering them in the next episode you might make it on the show 
[Music] [Applause] [Music] steady got it good oh my goodness look at this the entire tech mafia Meetup who do we have here it's big Dom there he is we got John or - you're not so average consumer Oh sensitive the only mr. Linus tech tips oh my it could be worse we got mr. Austin Evans I don't really know what they say about Austin - why don't you say something about Austin hey guys we got mister who's the boss over here what do you got you got something to drink or something going on there well done over here we have Marquez here's the reason here's what we're doing today we're gonna find out once and for all which smartphone is in the pocket of each of these very important individuals so we're gonna start with Dom which smartphone is in your pocket right now do I reveal it right now or not the iPhone 10 oh there it is sometimes it's hard to break away from that ecosystem what is it about this ecosystem you're talking about more specifically just iMessage I guess I've heard this argument I truly don't understand it what is it is it is this a green bubble a green bubble blue bubble type of prejudice going on here it's a green bubble blue bubble whore what do you think about face ID though it works for me though it's really if you with sunglasses sometimes right there's no Rhema resonant reason to rhyme for it it's just a really rising rising reason to Ryan Florida charted right here right I hear Austin just cracking that bag everyone over there is giggling and covering their mouths what happened what's going on no Nazi let's give a lap to Austin because obviously he wants the attention here as about to do a hilarious joke about how I love rechargeable batteries it's not only funny all right iPhone 10 why why is that your choice I love the hardware on this phone the speakers are great cameras great I legitimately really do enjoy face ID this is like the best hardware I've ever tried on a smart phone like I love the pixel too but I'm excited okay hey man this is your moment like I'm not gonna interrupt you you make your case but not doesn't bother me there's so little I don't like about this phone do you consider yourself to just be an iOS guy like it's gonna be hard to break away from that's not it so what was the last Android device you used extensively that was it's like my main phone yeah okay so that's your prayers your answer there's your answer all right moving on who wants to be next thrown in the fire and the flames of the tech world it's Linus tech tips hi how many videos did you make us he is 45 one five videos round of applause everybody who is this man and what are they made up which smartphone is in your pocket and why so I'm on the pixel to excel my Galaxy s8 something I have installed on it is making the battery drain really fast I haven't had the time to deal with it are you trying to say you preferred it is that on my trip I actually have five phones with me I can give you the reasons for all of them this one I'm on because I pop the sim out of the mate 10 Pro there was some software that wasn't installed on it I needed to use so I put my sim in here you sounded like the most reluctant pixel user I've ever heard in my life it's okay oh so you're not a big fan of it yeah robot [Applause] it's good it's really good I love them I haven't used a phone for longer than a month at a time in over half a year part of my deal is I switch the eight I was using the A+ the pixel to not the XL this was the last one I was on before I switched to the razor phone which I frankly didn't like that much so the sim went back in this one you could put any one of them in your pocket not not the most convenient at that moment which one would it be I'm really happy with this one okay so what is this one sort of look at these hands I can't handle this much phone so really what I want is the s8 back but with not my battery is about this in the form factor of just the pixels yeah I'll be fine yeah I like this watch better than I like my phone once we fed to the lines next if we're talking pixel then we're talking me a pixel to excel and if you guys have been following me in this recent trip how about this view I've taken pictures of this view and I truly believe this is the best camera on a smartphone right now period I am NOT taking a bad picture with this phone plus I like stock Android and all the usual things that you know about this is in my pocket for now there's no lies here it either is or it isn't all right who's next Kutner your next man the pressures on iPhone time wow it's just two phones so far I'm gonna be straight out its iMessage man in the ecosystem whoa that's what it is for me I don't even know what this means the scientist is saying it's not about the blue and green okay well is it about I'm always on my computer always on the phone somebody hits me up usually it's a family member who's also on iMessage I get it wherever I am I mean you could do the whole thing but I don't want to make some other messenger you know a lot of the world that use watch that for example yeah I've you know I've got that comment a lot yeah but it's like okay I got to tell you go download something what would it take for you to switch over iMessage on Android honestly I mean that's not gonna happen obviously but yeah what are we sitting at right now three to two Oh can't wait a hotly-anticipated take from the man himself mkbhd what did you have you a smartphone Awards the best phone the best this the best that it was a lot of bests but I think what do people really want to know is what's in the pocket what's in the pocket and why which pocket first of all because I do right now you have two phones yes main SIM card the number you have this phone number pixel to XL naked pixel to XL panda a colored power button stock Android great camera all the same reasons you said thinking pro reader isn't a good spot I have big hands so I couldn't even use the smaller version of the phone big phone person if there's an XL that's where I'm going but the other pocket I do carry an iPhone oh you really believe this are you running for president next there are things that just work better on iOS I use the best iPhone I can I use my favorite Android phone Wow this diplomat right here came prepared pick a damn phone right now if you had to drop one is that it I'm dropping the iPhone yes no it is darn it [Applause] no cop-outs in here no calm pouch in here I don't like this whispering collusion just two phones in the whole room what are we sitting at now 3-3 tie breaker happening now mister who's the boss what's happening - no preamble no banter I came from the note 8 I couldn't stand it because of the battery a pixel two batteries great the screen is not fantastic but you kind of get used to it just want to mean they might comment on dislike blueness if it's not terrible the pixel the pixels better in every way 4:3 pixel to XL to iPhone 10 I gotta be honest I'm a little disappointed that it broke down that simply there's a lot of amazing phones out there maybe they said something about us maybe we're a little too predictable maybe we need to get out there a little more often I'm not really sure this has been incredible this is unprecedented I don't know maybe you want to see something like this next year you people there in the audience if you do I think you know what to do you use your thumb to let Jack know that that's the case I want to say thank you to everybody that's been in this video I hope to do it again that is the smartphone that's in their pocket no lies it's the real deal here in Las Vegas CES 2018 yes

some people say reform is here safe put that man in jail what does he think he is doing I'm responding to the will of the people the Nero is back oh my goodness I am back with a video that I am genuinely excited for this in front of me is an exclusive look at the very first phone from the company razor I don't even know how it ended up here but I've heard a little bit about this and I knew as soon as I could get my hands on it I wanted to because this is a phone that features something that no other phone has right now also it's the first foray into phones from a company famous for gaming equipment and more specifically I am at least my exposure has been to their gaming laptops which I have loved in here is the razor phone 64 gigabytes of internal storage the battery is 4000 milliamp hours now you know I'm a battery junkie four thousand milliamp hours from now on I set the standard USB type-c charging cable USB C audio adapter it's got a quick charger in the Box you don't need to buy it extra wink-wink nudge-nudge I don't even know how to wink that count sim eject tool and important product information guy now some other specs I know for a fact that this thing has 8 gigabytes of RAM most excitingly is the display that's the special feature that no other phone have whether you're watching movies in bed listening to music on your run or kicking virtual ass on your commute we're gonna have to bleep that cuz this is a family show you need a device that delivers breathtaking visuals cinematic audio and the power to last all day it has this aggressive angular design to it that is cold that is cold aluminum Razer logo on the back here Jul 12 megapixel cameras at the top I love a wide-angle lens on a regular camera I love it on a phone as well ok so before I turn this on I want to prep you with some exact specifications this device is the first on the planet with a 120 Hertz Ultra motion display it's also the world's first phone featuring Qualcomm quick charge point o + 8 gigabytes of ddr4 Ram 64 gigabytes u FS of internal storage and up to 2 terabytes max through microSD and all of that is powered up by a four thousand milliamp hour battery okay I'm gonna put this down for a moment and look at the other items in the box Oh looks like we have some paperwork here as well as what might be the world's coolest sim eject tool ever see that Jack the Razer branded sim eject tool a little Quick Start Guide and then also of course the Razer stickers to show your pride braided USB type-c cable type c2 mini jack adapter okay lastly we have I'm guessing the power brick yes and this is your Qualcomm quick charge 4.0 plus power brick with the razer branding on it you're gonna want to use the included charger to charge up super quick so here we go initial boot up there it is razer logo powered by android oooh nice little Razer animation so there you have the new 5.7 inch display a razer branded set up here which is nice my speculation i guess was correct i believe the power switch over here jack can you pick that up right there this is a power switch fingerprint this is the thing that everybody wanted Apple to do with the 10 so you didn't just have to rely on face unlock alright let's check out this fingerprint oh are you guys hearing that sound effect right now I'll ask my favorite unlock lock and unlock ever all-time it's got some games included by default titanfall mobile version World of Tanks a racing game alright let's check out the settings real quick some data about the phone so here we can see 1.5 gigabytes of 7.5 gigabytes of memory used Android 7.1.1 I've shown you a lot of stuff that's cool but this to me is the coolest the display supports a hundred and twenty Hertz refresh rate now you've seen this in gaming monitors you may have seen it in some tablets but never in a phone now interestingly by default the refresh rate is set to 90 Hertz on the device but it can go up to 120 so let's go ahead and do it and what you went oh my it's like instant now your eyes aren't gonna pick it up the way mine are because you're watching this you know through a video 24 frames per second but when you're scrolling a list there oh no lag at all now of course relying on the processing power of the device as well but what this means is that the display is just it has this more responsive attitude much like if you've ever seen the difference between 120 Hertz a 60 Hertz monitor then that's what this is like and and you feel it when you interact with it oh and for those of you wondering about resolution out-of-the-box 1440p it's at its max you can toggle that back to F HD 1080p you know I just noticed as well a very stock experience being provided here by Razer no no heavy skinned or anything like that camera jack is curious about the camera as am i so let's launch this open right now now the implementation on the rear camera it kind of leaves you guessing a little bit but that's part of the software it's the app at some point during the zoom you're switching over from the wide-angle to the zoom lens to the telephoto lens as I do so I'll show you here you're not really sure where you have switched to a digital zoom I mean you can kind of guess I guess it's about halfway across this is fully wide and then as I begin to zoom in and you can tell that your optical up into a point at which point digital zoom takes over so I kind of wish a dedicated button there to just pop into the other lens quickly you're pinching and zooming like you would otherwise even on a single lens system all right let's try the front one now front selfie time the beard hairs are on full display I have to say I am satisfied alright so we talked about the display in this incredible refresh rate but of course a display has to be good at displaying things first and foremost so let's boot up some YouTube here and see what the video quality looks like and also at the same time test out these stereo speakers which I've been told each unit has its own end for extra volume they might be the best speakers I've heard you guys probably can't tell cuz they're firing at me there's a little bass in them which is kind of crazy to say about a phone so far just hearing what I heard on the YouTube video I think it's gonna be pretty nice we'll see [Music] [Applause] well it's the best speaker I've ever heard of smartphone that's it now you can tell there's been focus on the low end here because the phone it kind of vibrates a little bit from the thickness everybody else needs to reevaluate not only are these speakers loud but they're just thicker there's an attention on the lower end and they didn't over push them either to the point where it's like grinding and chewed up at the high end of the volume what can I say guys I can't hide it like I'm really into this phone I just like the matte black the masculine design the idea of a fingerprint sensor in the power switch that turns me on the idea of loudspeakers on a smartphone that turns me on the idea of the ultra-fast refresh rate that turns me on I mean there's just so much cool about this phone that I don't see in other phones I think the real deal breaker is still gonna be the camera and I'm gonna use it more extensively preliminary results look pretty good so far but to be quite honest I rarely will swap out my SIM card when a new phone arrives this one is instant its instantaneous my SIM card is gonna come out of my pixel right now and it's gonna go into this phone for a company to put out their very first device and hit something like this with no history in the phone game well done Bravo that's all I gotta say about it [Music]

so I'm sure all of you have a heard of the Apple earpods they might be the most popular fully wireless earbuds on the planet apparently Apple can't keep them in stock people love them but here's the thing they're kind of pricey 159 bucks they're not gonna be for everyone and so you might still want the almost air pod experience for a lot less money and that's where this comes in this is the mini HP Q - I ate tws a fully wireless earbud that looks like denticles of apples air pods I ordered this from one of those Chinese e-commerce sites I don't remember it might have been DHgate or Aliexpress I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of about 40 bucks for these we'll see if this is any good or not could be a complete nightmare but if you're looking for air pods on the cheap this might be the way to do it what does it say in the back hbq with charging case immediately this is bigger that's quite a bit I have some legit air pods here you can see they are not identical this one still pocketable still smaller than the pixel buds container the other difference that you can see right away I can show Willie do over here the air pots of course they use the proprietary lightning connector this hbq mini I ate situation is micro USB and also there's a difference on the back here would be shape of the container what else is in the pack let's see micro USB cable to charge it up a user manual what else do you want do not overuse all right well you get 10 minutes a day it's enough music for you okay I don't know I don't know what they mean by that keep away from Wi-Fi no Wi-Fi anymore throw your router out the window you got the CheapOair pods now who needs a router to stream the music cool I mean yeah regular Apple earpods and the knockoff version from China over here so this is magnetic on the air pods very satisfying of course you've probably seen these before comes out slips in it's charging now once it's in there this version there's a click - it's not magnetic not quite as satisfying now I see some LED lights that I'm assuming implicate charging look at that I see red I see blue and is something else in the bottom here you can see these two little prongs that's how the charging takes place you can see the other contact points on here official airpot on that side and there's the hbq on the other quite quite similar now obviously if you know what you're looking for you can tell the difference immediately nonetheless they're pretty much the same let's check out the fit you know if anything I would say the hbq has a slightly better fit for my ear that is bizarre it's isolating sound more the air pod is a little bit loose for me so I can still really hear my surroundings so far so good now I notice that this earbud it has a button on the side of it in fact both of them do I'm guessing we have to manually power these outlets let's test this out oh there it is HB q i8 tws connected battery 100% that's good why do I feel like it's only gonna be the right ear bud right now I only connect to one or the other pairing with one ear bud why would you want to pair with one ear bud double click either side to enter pairing mode okay so long as you power them up at the same time you're all good this button here it acts as a play/pause button or an answer phone call button both of them are working right now not terrible I mean maybe let's just connect the airport's do an a/b test right here oh there we go okay cool the official air pod sound a little bit better I mean not that I expected anything different I mean these are quite a bit more expensive than these you could get four pairs of these instead of these these do work granted pairing situation let me give it one more test here okay so I'm gonna disconnect says it's connected to the old ones okay let's go yeah yeah so the button works for play pause these get the job done they really do they sound better or at least as good as whatever earbuds like we're included with your phone but of course fully wireless and they have stayed connected they've maintained this dual connection I haven't had the one earbud thing happen anymore no this I mean this is obviously a copy right I mean they took this they try to make something close to it so you have to treat it as such it's functioning maybe a little bit beyond what my expectation was from a sound quality perspective I just at Loic patience to begin with now when it comes to charging it back up drop it in here the light turns blue just like the air pods the battery inside of the case will be responsible for charging the ear button now the battery they're saying is 60 ml amp hours and the DA is another 950 that's substantial maybe it's not so bad maybe this is a little beyond my expectations you know sometimes you look at a product some sort of a knockoff what was the last one we did we had the impostor version of the galaxy s 9 the clone thing was a nightmare but in this range you're getting nothing close to an air pot for 40 bucks you're dead set on that look but you just can't put the bill on the real deal maybe the knockoff versions for you I can't speak to the reliability I mean it's amazing what you can find out there including this right here you decide let me know in the comments would you take a chance or something like that are you steering clear

[Music] today I've got a monster a smartphone version of a monster a battery monster this is the largest battery smartphone que 10,000 pro and the 10,000 in the model name stands for a 10,000 milliamp battery that's inside of here they're claiming that's like a week's worth of battery that of course depends on how you use your device so the display is 5.5 inches it's got Android 7 on it dual SIM card tray expandable storage through micro sd though the version in front of me already has 32 gigabytes of storage pre-installed the second version of this particular phone without the pro was the initial version now this one a little bit more slender oh look at that they think they've included the little pouch will they do there you go the pouch is all yours now you need a pouch like that for a device of this stature that is a beast oh my goodness is hefty now it has a case pre-installed free case why not a fingerprint sensor on the back of the device cameras in that location there this is all metal it's cool to the touch its plastic that plate but it feels kind of like leather capacitive buttons here at the bottom front-facing camera sim card tray on this side a 3.5 millimeter jack only micro USB on the bottom wish it was Type C especially with the battery of this capacity but anyhow it's not a super expensive phone priced around 170 bucks depending on where you look a glass screen protector and then another soft screen protector as well so I don't know they're just giving you options here micro USB 2 female USB port for connecting other devices to this device share media or to take advantage of that giant battery the giant power brick they say fast charge on it but I assume you're still looking at a couple hours to charge this thing up it's just a giant battery this thing does not move around at all when you type on it got so much starting this to it it's like a tank okay let's go ahead and add the fingerprint here we go gives you a little vibration says it's got it okay cool so this display it's nothing fancy it's not all that or anything like that not like you would expect it to be at this particular price it just looks like Android 7 there by that yes it is pre-installed there's not a ton of bloatware if any now the camera on this pro version is supposed to be better than the previous k 10000 so let's go ahead and check that out the green plan that is not real the shutter is not instantaneous but it's better than some other inexpensive phones I've looked at not terrible for a falling that's a hundred and seventy bucks so device locked ah actually not bad not the fastest that I've tried ever but reasonable now there's also video mode to which I believe is capable of 1080p 1080p video using the K 10000 Pro you could probably shoot video for days on this thing maybe not days and as usual the selfie test beauty or no beauty what do you say not the best we've seen selfie enthusiasts want something a little more detailed but it's getting the job done beyond the fact that it's capable of becoming an object of self defense it's also got this giant battery in it you might use it for multimedia or you might use this cable here to kind of extend the life span of your other devices I'll show you how that works I can go ahead and plug any other USB device into the K 10000 Pro and here is a pixel and kaboom 10,000 extra milliamp hours for my smartphone it's a cool feature okay you're gonna be so popular you're the guy with all the juice like you've always wanted to be it's somebody who's gonna be away from the wall or maybe even any other person for a while if it's a person who's an outdoors type they go hunting or camping I'm kind of curious about multimedia because maybe you're on an airplane maybe you're going to Tokyo alright if you're not plugging in your smartphone and you try to watch video on it the whole way you're done you're dead and you're done now one thing to mention here the straight-up display that isn't OLED starts to feel dated you know you can see how the glass sits above it it just it feels a little less vibrant less contrasty so that's something to keep in mind so how does video even look well let's find out bring up some unbox therapy real quick a recent video oh the speakers a little bit mashed potatos let me turn up the clock 144p oh I died a little inside a piece of me is now gone forever if you are forced to watch my videos in 144p i owe you something i want to buy you lunch ok here alright 144p squad i feel your pain let's boost this up here 1080p the speaker is still mashed potatoes and for those of you that don't understand the terminology of mashed potatoes scrambled eggs and so on any type of food that is crunched up a little bit you know good video actually looks better than I expected to be honest oh yeah go watch that video by the way holy smokes dual screen smartphones what year are we living in back to the future Blade Runner is it finally happening flying cars Oh screams OH kind of sucks if for a phone that is this size they wouldn't put a better speaker in it use the headphone jack who is this phone for that is your question of course it isn't so unusual and so unique I think if it's for you you probably know it in other words you're the type of person where battery comes first they wanted to knock your socks off they wanted to take what you thought was possible in a smart phone and just go to another level which I kind of respect so if you're the type of person is away from an outlet for a while if you're the type of person that wants to use this thing to also charge up a bunch of other devices because you just like to share like that if you're on an expedition might be for you as well you had 10,000 milliamp hours at your disposal how would

and you will pair up to the adapter it's modular it's beautiful now this isn't the first solution I have found for taking a wired headphone and making it Wireless there in fact other ways to do that as well from various brands so here's an adapter from a company called air mod and they're focusing on the Bose products so the qc25 in the QC 15 here are a couple products to turn those headphones into Wireless and they fit in there perfectly as well and then we've got this company here EXO audio they make similar adapters but for Beats headphones so here's one for the Beats Studio here's one for the beats solo2 and then the last one is this one here it's called air link now to me these are the two most exciting why because I've got some m50x already and because the air link takes any headphone and makes it Wireless so this little guy this little module would you look at that how pretty is that little thing so this will clip on to your shirt your sweater pocket coat something like that and not only does it give you control over volume your microphone for answering phone calls and even what looks like a shutter button for a camera right there this clips here the ear pods go up and into your ears and now you're not tethered to your pocket I know before you say it I know what you want to say you want to see but that's not actually Wireless because there's a wire going to this module but it is a lot more can then having the wire go all the way down to the pocket so with a product like this you're able to shorten the distance from the cord to your ears okay so that's cool the air link the other adapters that I mentioned earlier exciting stuff if you have one of those pairs of headphones or if you want the universal one but the one that I'm most pumped up for is this one here from East Brooklyn labs because like I said the iconic m50x now gets the Bluetooth treatment it now turns into a bluetooth headphone and best of both worlds here you can still use it with a wire if you want to so let's crack this open see what it's all about so it has a similar shape to those beats adapters that I showed you earlier also in the package is a tiny little micro USB cable to keep this thing charged up and then the adapter itself it's got a matte finish on it which I like so it shouldn't get too many fingerprints your power switch is over here and let's see how it fits in so this is the design of the m50x if you've never seen it it has this channel which moves downloaded oh you might be wondering as well Lou what's up with your m50x why you have the cool color on there so this is a D brand skin actually allowing you to customize the look of the m50x I told you it's that popular they even made a skin for this how many people have this headphone and worth mentioning before I insert this the m50x doesn't allow for a 3.5 millimeter connection on the headphone side it's actually smaller it's 2.5 millimeter right there okay so let's go ahead and check out this fit here ooh I like that so the way that they've built this this is cool design here this section of the headphone sinks into this section of the adapter right here so it doesn't hang down too low it's not it's not much of an obstruction at all in fact it only increases the length of the ear cup by not even half an inch and that's what it looks like when you're wearing it so well here I mean it's really not a big deal it has hardly any weight to it and all of a sudden my favorite headphones are now Wireless I mean that's cool so there you can see see that little blue light it might be tough to see because it's lit up in here but the blue light starts flashing immediately when you have the power switch flipped on I mentioned that this charges up over microUSB and then on the front you have your controls the Bluetooth button volume up and down I think it's impairing mode immediately though because it is flashing blue right now see that there so let's check if it's available m50x bao m50x it's now I'm gonna put these on and let's see how this sounds through the adapter so as far as the button in the middle goes I think you might hold it to re-establish a Bluetooth connection but if you tap it it pauses what you're listening to so you need to have a conversation and tap it again and then it picks up again they've done a serious job here I am beyond impressed that is a package the m50x is already a great headphone one of the minor drawbacks you can't use it wirelessly now you can without giving up the wired capabilities the sound quality though is probably the most impressive part lots of juice which I didn't expect on a large / ear headphone and just overall punchy it sounds good I would recommend this if you have an m50x or you're thinking of getting an m50x this is probably the best companion piece that you could add to it I'll link it down below in the description they've done a great job just remember this isn't your only Avenue as I mentioned earlier in the video there are solutions to essentially turn any wired headphone into a wireless headphone including earbuds and so on with the universal adapter I showed you called the air link and then of course the separate products for the beats headphones and the Bose headphones I just think this is probably my favorite of the bunch so check these guys out oh and also worth mentioning the company that makes this adapt their East Brooklyn labs they're claiming a 5 hour runtime so 5 hours of listening on a single charge and I also just noticed not only is it available on Amazon but you can get it bundled so you get the headphones and the adapter all in one package either way I'll link it down below you 
they're everywhere many you are you're joining me right now for the pixel to event livestream which just started we are joining in progress area with the power of machine learning on our neural machine translations being so or two billion translations in many many languages every single day to me shows the power of staying at a problem constantly using computer science to make it better and seeing users respond to it at scale this is why we are excited about the shift from a mobile first to a AI first well it is not just about applying machine learning in in their products but it's radically rethinking how computing should work at a higher level in an AI first world I believe computers should adapt to how people live their lives rather than people having to adapt to computers and so we think about four core attributes as part of this experience first people should be able to interact with computing in a natural and seamless way model took a step in this direction with multi-touch but increasingly it needs to be conversational sensory we need to be able to use her voice gestures and vision to make the experience much more seamless second it is going to be ambient computing is going to evolve beyond the phone be there in many screens around you when you need it working for you third we think it needs to be thoughtfully contextual mobile gave us limited context you know with identity your location we were able to improve this we using and AI first well we can have a lot more context and apply it thoughtfully for example if you're into fitness and you land in a new city we can suggest running routes maybe gyms nearby and healthy eating options and in my case being a vegetarian having a weakness for desserts maybe suggest the right restaurants for me finally and probably the most important of it all in a computing needs to learn and adapt constantly over time it just doesn't work that way today in Mobile you know developers write software and constantly ship updates but you know let me give a small example I use Google Calendar all the time on Sundays I try to get a weekly view of how my week looks lost but once the worst week starts say on a Monday or a Tuesday I'm trying to get a view into what the next few hours looks like I have to constantly toggle toggle back and forth Google Calendar should automatically understand my context and show me the right field it's a very simple example but software needs to fundamentally change how it works it needs to learn and adapt and then applies the important things like security and privacy as well today a lot of us deal with security and privacy by putting the onus back on users we give them many settings and toggles to improve those but in an AI first world we can learn and adapt and do it thoughtfully for our users for example if it's a notification for your doctor's appointment we need to treat it sensitively and differently than just telling you when you need to start driving to work so we're really excited by the shift and that's why we are here today we've been working on software and hardware together because that's the best way to drive the shifts in computing power but we think we're the unique moment in time where we can bring the combination of AI and software and hardware to bring a different perspective to solving problems for users and we're very confident about our approach here because we are the four friend of driving the shifts with AI three months ago at Google i/o our Google AI teams announced a new approach called Auto mo although ml is just our machines automatically generating machine learning models today these are handcrafted by machine learning scientists and literally only a few thousands of scientists around the world can do this design the number of layers weight and connect the neurons appropriately it's very hard to do we want to democratize this we want to bring this to more people you want to enable hundreds of thousands of developers to be able to do it so we've been working on this technology called Auto ml and just in the past month for a standard task like image classification understanding images our auto ml models are now not only more accurate than the best human generated models or they are more resource efficient so it's pretty amazing to see we are now taking it a step further let me talk about another use case object direction when we say object direction just fancy name for computers trying to delineate and understand images being able to draw bounding boxes and distinguish between all the way vehicles their scooters mopeds motorcycles and even pick up the bike in front it has a lot of practical use cases the Street View example for Legos works based on object direction google lense which you'll hear about later as well as our photography in pixel use this object direction this is really hard to do the best human generated models we have only have a thirty nine percent accuracy but our auto ml models as of the past couple of weeks have have reached from forty three percent accuracy they're constantly getting better so the rate at which we are seeing progress with AI is amazing which is why we are really excited about combined even okay so right about now you might be wondering what about this pixel what about the pixel - that might be what you're tuned in for well as you know what these keynotes there's a little bit of information to get through first regarding other developments and things that are going on that are exciting and so on but I promise you there will be pixel to talk and after this livestream I'm gonna have my hands on video with the pixel - as well so definitely stick around for that if you have any questions regarding the pixel 2 or pixel 2 XL hit me up on Twitter right now it's a little bit easier to manage than the chat right here or you can do one of the super chats at the top you might see those super chats up there where where the question can stick I'll also look at those art I'm gonna unmute this match the 60 is furthered by thinking about AI software and hardware together I couldn't be more excited by the direction our Hardware team is taking and approaching their work here so to give you a lot more insights let me welcome break onto the stage thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hi everyone I want to welcome everyone here today Google fans the media in the front row we have some of our top sales reps from Verizon and other partners it's great to have you all here yes welcome welcome we've got a lot to show you today including a few surprises so I thought I would quickly set the scene and explain what we've been working toward and just how it ties in to the vision that sundar outlined a year ago we stood on a slightly smaller stage and introduce the world to Google pixel home and Wi-Fi chromecast ultra and daydream view this is the first generation of Hardware made by Google so much has happened since then and we've made tremendous progress in our first year for starters our team is getting a lot bigger we're bringing on 2,000 very talented engineers from HTC along with some important IP it's an amazing team that's created a series of industry first innovations and by working more closely together we'll be able to better integrate Google hardware and software and our products have built up a lot of momentum going into our second year let's take a look ok Google ok Google ok Google Play the soundtrack to spaghetti for Pitt Bay we will set to hold the product event at San Francisco there are now my mom [Applause] [Applause] you see anybody recognizing that little montage we're still in the early days of our hardware line but we're off to a great start we're thrilled to announce that they're now 55 million chromecast devices around the world Google Wi-Fi is the number one selling mesh router since its launch in the US and Canada and in the last 12 months alone the assistant has gotten a lot smarter thanks to Google we've added more than a hundred million new unique featured snippets from the web video results from YouTube and new local places in Google Maps and a lot more and Pixel had a great year I just wish we had a few more of them to go around but user satisfaction among pixel owners is among the highest of any Google product ever industry analysts and the media gave pixel rave reviews to our performance scores led the industry and pixel had the best and top rated smartphone camera [Applause] we're really proud of how well the pixel did for our first generation smartphone in such a competitive space well you all know this better than anyone but the playing field for hardware components is leveling off and I don't envy those of you who have to write reviews for a bunch of smart phones with very similar specs megapixels in the camera processor speed modem throughput battery life display quality these core features are table stakes now Moore's law and Dennard scaling are ideas from the past to be honest it's going to be tougher and tougher for people to develop new exciting products each year because that's no longer the timetable for big leaps forward in hardware alone and that's why works and to make all those thousands of memories easy to find on any of your devices we did the same thing with home networks Google Wi-Fi uses machine learning not only to keep your signal strong but to reduce Wi-Fi congestion while you're moving throughout the house your router is intelligently transitioning your devices to the best Wi-Fi point and placing you on the right channel when you're using the assistant or Google home you'll notice it can pick either going even in a noisy River says our deep learning capabilities and neural beamforming help Google home locate the slogan sound and hear you accurately so we can do with just two microphones what others normally need 6r8 to do and this is what it means to design hardware from the inside out it's this combination of AI software and hardware working together that provides a helpful experience for our users and that's where the big leaps forward are going to happen in the next 10 years we're still in the early days for our hardware line but we know what it takes to build great products in a crowded field we were at first with many of our most successful we had a little drop in the stream there we're back though on Android and even search but in each case we succeeded by doing what we're best at reimagining the experience to make it radically helpful for the user and as you'll hear today our next generation of devices is radically helpful - they're fast they're there when you need them they're simple to use and they anticipate your needs everything is designed for you to keep the tech in the background and out of your way interact with your devices naturally through your voice or by touching them and by building Hardware around our AI and software we're creating products that get even better over time they're constantly getting faster and more helpful the more you interact with them thanks to machine learning as a family made by Google products represent the ultimate Google experience today we're going to show you how we're creating a family of products that are there when you need them at work at school and on the go but we're gonna start with the most important place your home so let's hear next from Rishi Chandra who leaves our home team over to you Rishi okay so it looks like Google home first and then probably pixel after thank you Rick it's been a really exciting year for us Google home was the first product to bring the Google assistant to the home and we've been constantly learning from our users so that we can make the assistant radically helpful for you for example as Rick mentioned in the last year we can answer over 100 million new questions and the best part is you know the talk like a computer or teach Google home any new skills it just works now we're really happy with a positive feedback thus far we know this is a journey so been working hard to bring Google home to more people and more countries this year we launched in five new countries and we're happy to announce that we'll be launching in Japan later this week now bringing the assistant of people all around the world is no easy task we had to make sure we can understand people at different age groups genders and accents so we trained the assistant at a scale that only Google could with over 50 million voice samples from hundreds of different ambient environments we've been investing in voice search for over a decade which is why we have the best voice recognition in the world now earlier this year we had a major breakthrough with the ability to recognize your voice we call it voice match with your permission we build a model of your voice by looking at dozens of different voice characteristics like vocal constructs pitch and tone this is a really big deal Google homes great for the whole family but doesn't mean I want to get the same answer to every question an assistant can only be truly useful if it knows who you are and with voice match we're the only assistant that can bring personal help to each individual member of your household so he asked a question we match your voice and we respond with your calendar your commute and your personal reminders now voice match has already become one of the most popular features on Google home today over half of all queries are from people who train the assistant to recognize their voice and starting today we're rolling out a voice match to all seven countries Google home will be available now another popular feature is hands-free calling you can use your Google home to call any landline or mobile number in the US or Canada for free without any additional apps or accessories it just works and I'm happy to announce they'll be bringing hands-free calling to the UK later this year and starting today you could call out with your own personal mobile number so whatever you're calling will know it's you you just need to verify your number to the Google home app and of course with voice match we can recognize your voice to make sure we call your contact with your personal number and history calling also has the intelligence of Google built right in just say hey Google call the bakery on 24th Street okay calling no eval bakery we do the hard work to figure out which business you want to call thanks to Google's deep expertise in local search making a call has never been easier I'm probably gonna order a lot more pizza so to kick things off I like the welcome Giulio lead designer for Home Hardware [Applause] Thank You Ricci I'm thrilled to share with you how he thinks design is redefining technology in the home you heard Rick mention earlier today that everything in a hardware line is designed to fit into your life the home is the special intimate place and people are very selective about what they welcome into it you don't want to fill it with black plastic complicated buttons and random blinking lights our vision is to build simple helpful solutions that work in the background helping you when you need it and staying out of the way when you don't so here's what that means to us we design for the spaces our products live in and we take inspiration from the materials and colors that people already use to make their home more warm and inviting second when designing for real hopes form and sites really matters for creating something that actually fits into any room or on any surface and lastly the way you interact with our products has to be so intuitive you never even have to think about it and so simple that the entire household can use it with that we are introducing mini the newest member of the Google home family [Applause] the first thing you might notice is the striking simplicity of the design its sleek and smooth with no corners or edges and it's small enough to be placed in anywhere in your home it makes Google home more accessible to more people in more rooms and as you can see almost the entire enclosure is made out of fabric and it's not just about aesthetics its core to the product experience that is why we created this material from scratch right down to the yarn it needed to be durable and soft but also transparent enough to let through both light and sound this perfect balance allows for all of mehness technology to be thoughtfully tucked away underneath the clean simple enclosure so the four LED lights under the fabric are there when you need them lighting up to show you that it hears you or it's thinking and you can control it by touch give the fabric a quick tap to pause your music adjust the volume or talk to your assistant we thought a lot about how to get great sound with such a small product - we embrace mini circular shape to project 360 degree sound so it's really crisp no matter where you stand in the room it would be surprised how amazing the quality is and if you want bigger sound you can easily connect mini to any chromecast built-in speaker wirelessly we created mini in three beautiful colors coral chalk and charcoal colored really matters in the home this is the place where we choose our drapes and carpets and pink colors with so much care we brought that same level of care for many for the chalk color alone it took us 157 tries before we found the perfect shade of grey so that's Google home mini with all the power of the goo assistant you can make it your sous chef in the kitchen you're white noise machine and their nursery your voice Ramona Priya TV in the living room or your alarm clock in the bedroom or all of the above Minnie will retail for just $49 in the u.s. gonna be available for pre-order online starting today and in stores starting October 19th from major retailers we're also really happy to announce that Minnie is coming to all seven Google home countries so with that let's take a look at this ad that will launch later this week with this little thing well it's dude a little mini you put it in round it and control it with your voice hey Google Play my fun playlist okay playing now it's also or no control and a white box and a sous-chef let it cool for 10 minutes it can play this on TV or that on the internet it can tell you the weather will or if your flights delayed because of the weather and it knows the difference between you I see so if you go hey Google call Alex it won't call your husband's friend Alex it'll call your friend Alex colleague Alex hey how are you okay gotta go girl anyway it's May but st. people who help you find stuff on the Internet so you know no biggie it's smaller than a donut in weighs less than a full-grown chipmunk put out the nuts it's powered by the Google assistant so it has Google Maps Google Calendar it gets you to all your music block of your favorite shows all of YouTube and lots and lots and lots of other stuff you love oh good left 150 bucks yeah if Google Hill minutes a little help at home like only Google can okay so it's a price point thing it might be more approachable you know more people now 49 bucks put them all over your house we also want to share how the Google assistant continues to get better over time from the start we've been helping everyone people with their everyday routines for example one of my favorite features is my day which gives me a personalized briefing of my important events of the day and with voice match each member of the house can get their own unique start to the morning routine well soon we're going to be extending routines in two important ways first we're adding more routines to help you with those everyday moments like getting ready to leave for work coming home in the evening or turning in for the night second we're adding additional actions to the routines so now when I say good morning I not only get my personal briefing but I also can turn on the lights start the coffee maker and even play my favorite morning playlist this kind of help is exactly what I need to get my day started now another ritual for me in the morning is I'm always looking for iPhone before heading to work well Google assistant can help there to just say hey Google Find My Phone and will automatically ring your Android phone even if it's on silent mode and for iPhone users we just give you a call it's gonna it saves me five to seven minutes every morning [Applause] now we're also working to make the smart home work better for you the Google assistant can now voice control over a thousand different smart home products from over a hundred brands and even more importantly we brought our deep expertise of natural language processing to make it easier to voice control in a more conversational way so for example if I want to change the temperature I shouldn't have to remember the current thermostat set it I should be able to say hey Google make it warmer okay warming up the living room your sister knows what warmer means I will just take care of it for you now voice control is just the start we believe the next evolution of the smart home is to bring real intelligence to the home so it can behave in a more thoughtful way your home should smartly adjust to you not the other way around so Google and nest are working together to reimagine the smart home to tell you more I like to welcome Yogi CTO of Nest [Applause] Thank You Rishi a nest we like to talk about the thoughtful hell one that takes care of the people inside it and the world around it we recently took a big step forward in achieving that goal by doubling our portfolio by shipping six new hardware products when I love about nest growing ecosystem is that we combine the best-in-class hardware and machine learning to help make people's lives easier and your nest experience reaches a whole new level when it's combined with Google products let me show you three examples of how we can provide you with even more help a help with nest cam good at home and chromecast we can help keep you keep an eye on your home chef with your voice so if you hear some unexpected sound and by the front door and I'm in the back with the family room without my phone I can just say ok Google show me the entryway ok streaming the entryway and then I realize it's not an intruder but my pet pig Cayenne and she's found the leftover lunch in my son's backpack sadly this has happened more than once and if I want to keep it for later for my kids I can simply say ok Google save me this clip to show them why we don't leave food in our backpacks with our new video doorbell nest hello we can also start to solve some of our common pain points through Google and nest integrated computer techni computer vision technologies of course most of us want to know who's at the door before we get off the couch through a feature called familiar faces nest hello we'll be able to the people that you ask it to remember so when their doorbell rings and nests hello recognizes the person at the door it will automatically broadcast that information to Google home devices in the house auntie Suzie is at the front door and you don't even have to ask and if nestling doesn't know who's at the door you can just say ok Google show me who's at the front door and we will stream your camera feed right to your TV this is another great example of what Google and Ness can do together and this last one is my favorite your home can soon get ready for the night just with a simple command as Rishi mentioned you can personalize your routine to include actions for nest products so all I have to say is hey Google good night ok let's get ready for bed I've armed your security system your first calendar event is tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. your alarm is set for 7:00 a.m. sleep well in the background my fitness my assistant is also turning my security camera on adjusting the thermostat and turning off the lights this really simplifies my life and gives me the peace of mind that I cannot get any other way together nest and Google deliver an ecosystem a product that makes your home more secure and energy-efficient more connected and entertaining with the best home assistant experience our close collaboration make this product work seamlessly together and help us get one step closer to a truly thoughtful [Applause] on that note to tell you more about Google system let me welcome we should be back on stage alright so better integration nest products if you have then you add home to them and you can see the automation goes King a more thoughtful home it's just one way to help make our jointly hectic family lives a little easier you know the Google assistant already provides a lot of help from using your voice to order more diapers playing a lullaby in the nursery checking the traffic those piano lessons or easily giving grandma a call now if you're like me make me hard to gather the household together for those family moments like dinnertime a movie night well the help we're launching a new feature called broadcast it's real easy just say hey Google broadcast it's time to leave for school got it broadcasting now the assistant will broadcast some message to all the other Google home devices in my house it's really great parents are gonna love this feature kids in kids are gonna hate this feature but that's what makes it useful speaking of kids we think Google home has a lot of potential with to help kids and families voice interactions so simple and easy to use kids are naturally drawn to it so we want to be thoughtful about what it would take to deliver a great kids experience we conducted research with hundreds of parents and kids from across the country from different backgrounds so first we're announcing support for family link accounts on Google home these are Google accounts that parents can create for children under 13 they can manage it within the family link app and as we all know kids have their own unique way of speaking sometimes it can be a little hard to understand even for us parents well fortunately we've improved our voice recognition accuracy for kids so the assistant can understand them too and finally we're introducing over 50 new experiences with the Google assistant to help kids learn something new explore new interests imagine with story time or just share laughs the whole family so let me show you how my kids and their friends had some fun this weekend ready to savor musical champion [Applause] [Music] which was the first planet to be discovered using it I can tell you as a parent it's great to see the kids without their screens and sharing experiences together as easy to get started just say hey did it right let's learn to play science quizzes for top-2 an astronaut or try hey Google let's play a game to play musical chairs or tackle a riddle and finally hey Google tell me a story to your classics like Snow White or original stories like the chef to love potatoes better bring this up Jack still likes the stories and Star Wars we're getting many other top brands in the family space including Warner Brothers and Sports Illustrated kids and starting today we're opening up the actions on Google platform for developers to create experiences specifically for families and kids all these new family features will be rolling out later this month across all Google home devices ok finally I have one more exciting edition to share that's coming to the Google home family [Music] big one [Music] [Music] so this is a smart idea right because now it becomes your Bluetooth speaker your main Bluetooth speaker also of course you can put them all over your house this is a this is becoming a Sonos competitor now [Music] [Music] well I gotta make it seem like they sound good say hello to peace our biggest and best sounding Google home ever just like the pixel reimagine the camera will do the same with sound but the combination of great hardware and software powered by Google's machine learning capabilities that's cool now it starts with a strong foundation of great hardware the first thing you'll notice is how we obsess over the base its to 4.5 inch woofers have 22 millimeters of excursion and extremely high range for their size that means these Wolfers can move a lot of air allowing max to really hit those low frequencies and max can play loud really loud it's one of 20 times more powerful than Google home so to fill any room in your house with amazing audio now great hardware alone isn't sufficient for great sound the challenge of speakers today is that they're tuned for ideal acoustic conditions but they fall short in the real world that's why it always sounds different in the store than in your home the sound great the speaker needs to adjust to you in your home so today we're announcing smart sound a new audio experience powered by Google's AI it allows max to adapt to you your environment your context your preferences so for example if you set up a speaker on your wall on a shelf in a corner fairly common places it can dramatically change the sound balance of the speaker and make the music sound muddy and the vocals lose clarity well with smart sound we automatically tune the speaker to correct for this effect using a machine learning model trained with thousands of different room configurations what's really cool this is all done dynamically so if you decide to move max a few feet it'll compensate within seconds and overtime smart sound will automatically adapt the sound to fake your context lowering the volume in the morning raising the volume when the dishwasher is running or just a jus adjusting the tuning bass the typing maybe you're listening to whether it be music podcasts or news it's about delivering a consistent crisp thoughtful sound experience one that's tailored to your home and your moments now great sound only matters you can play a lot of great content well YouTube music you'll have access to the world's broadest catalog of songs remixes and covers and we also support all free and paid Spotify users along with other top music services just use your voice to start playing your favorite tunes max also supports casts Bluetooth and stereo aux input so you play anything from your phone or plug in that record player to breathe new life into that vinyl collection and of course max has a Google assistant built right in we made your assistant can hear you even when the music is blasting using your unique microphone placement and Google's neural beamforming technology and with voice match the assistant can become your own personal DJ we recognize your voice and we can play playlists and music stations personalized to you and Google home max is designed to be incredibly versatile and fit naturally in your home you can stand it up vertically place it horizontally whatever it's makes sense for your space its base magnetically pops into place so when you change Max's orientation there aren't any rubber feet where they don't need to be we thought through every detail and finally max works seamlessly with the Google home family and hundreds of chromecast built-in speakers so you can use multi room to sync every room in your house with immersive sound Google home max will be available starting December for $399 and will come in two colors chalk and charcoal now will Edition launched in the US with more countries coming early next year and make sure you have an amazing sound experience out of the box we're providing a free 12 month subscription to YouTube red which includes YouTube music ad free we think you're gonna really love the newest members of the Google home family along with the updates to the Google assistant they represent a big leap forward and type of helpfulness yeah fun and sound you can expect from Google in the home and the clothes we gave max to a music lover to get their thoughts let's take a look [Music] I'm a producer in a DJs I'm not classically trained but I'm obsessed with music I listen to music all day long I'm constantly being critical of Milan music of Misrata here watch this hey Google Play particular by Major Lazer sure particular by Major Lazer &amp; DJ maphorisa here it is on YouTube every room I have music my bedrooms living room we'll turn it up [Music] hey Google play the song that goes whistles like Linda all right no no better by Major Lazer here it is on YouTube you can find the periphery of walls and where it is located and room have that technology to understand where it is and to adjust appropriately is amazing that sounds great and that's this is the system if people could actually hear what we're giving them from what it leaves our studio that would be amazing that's what they need producer artists for love anchor will turn it all the way up so this is obviously this is a play at Sonos boughs all the home audio systems that they try to cover the whole home which I mean that didn't exist before at least not from Google as you just saw there's so much amazing innovation happening in the home space and at the same time our phones have evolved become the most trusted devices in our lives but you ever wonder why the laptop experience has been basically the same for the past 20 years so while the laptop experience hasn't changed all that much how we use technology in our lives definitely has we live online we create and collaborate more than ever we use tons of apps every day and we're constantly jumping between our phone tablet and laptop to get things done and have fun should we be able to do whatever we want on whatever device is in front of us we think so we worked hard to combine the most helpful parts of a laptop a tablet and a smartphone to fit how we use technology today meet Google pixel book the high-performance Chromebook takes a pixel of reimagines laptop experience by marrying the best of premium performance hardware the speed simplicity and security of Chrome OS the smarts of the Google assistant and all your favorite apps pixel book is the perfect example of how we combine the best of hardware and software with AI at the center we'll start with a stunning versatile design pixel book is the thinnest lightest laptop we've ever made at just around 10 millimeters thin and a kilogram light in fact it's so light I find myself constantly checking my bag to make sure I haven't forgotten

made it easy to interact with the assistant and all the ways you use pixel book when its intent or entertainment mode and the keyboard is tucked away simply say ok Google Play future me and that exact music video I had in mind starts playing on YouTube other times though it's not the right moment or place to talk to your computer like if you're sitting at a coffee shop or out in the audience right now so pixel book has a key that puts the power of the assistant right at your fingertips letting you type your request and we're using your pixel book as a tablet it's easiest to show your assistant what you need help with on your screen that's why we created the new pixel book pants whoa a smart responsive companion for your pixel book pen is not dead not yet just hold the Pens button and circle an image or text on the screen and the assistant will take action when you're browsing through a blog and discover a new musician you can circle their photo and the system will give you more information about that from there you can check out their Instagram page go to their YouTube channel get a list of their songs and more or if you're doing homework it's just I can help with your research oh like if you get stuck on a really unfamiliar concept just circle the word and the assistant will give you everything you need powerful man the pen is also handy for moments when it feels more natural to write draw or take notes like when you're using your pixel book as a tablet the experience using a pen should be like writing on paper to bring that experience to life we partnered with the engineers at Wacom and together we built the fastest most responsive stylus experience ever with just 10 milliseconds of latency 60 degrees of angular awareness and 2000 levels of pressure sensitivity pixel pixel book pen uses machine learning for handwriting recognition and demonstrates how performance Hardware combined with our expertise and machine learning delivers a user experience that just works better and shouldn't the apps you know and love on your phone also be available on your laptop with pixel book they are pixel book fully supports Google Play alright guys how much is it gonna be guessing me chat over there how much what's the price in fact it's never been easier to put the final touches on your favorite photos in Adobe Lightroom and then post them straight to

available in the US Canada and the UK on the Google store and over a thousand retail locations including Best Buy pre-orders start today and nouvion stores beginning October 31st we can't wait to see how you use pixel book to work play and create next Mario is going to come out and talk about our pixel phones okay brick they're doing a pixel phones and I just want to remind you guys as soon as this live event is over I will have a hands-on video immediately so don't go anywhere keep it locked here we go pick some phones [Music] [Music] at Google we believe in questioning the status quo asking more from the world around us is in our nature after all Google was built on a single question what if all the information in the world was available to everyone everywhere a big question for us is what if smartphones got smarter and simpler we set out the design of phone ourselves because we believed we could make the smartphone experience better the first pixel phone delivered a clean and fast UI put the Google assistant in your pocket and brought you and brought you the best camera ever in a smartphone and we didn't stop asking big questions or working to solve big challenges for users today we're proud to introduce the Google pixel to design for you with the best of Google built in we've created the new pixel in two sizes a 5 inch and the 6 inch XL with thoughtful design elements and improvements to the UI throughout we're bringing you more Google assistant capabilities we've added new smart experiences to the camera and will continue to deliver the best photography plus we're introducing some innovative new products to complement your picks for experience we do all this by bringing together the best of hardware software and AI let's begin with the design we've evolved a pixels iconic look to be even bolder the all aluminium body with a premium hybrid coating gives it a sleek and clean profile the soft sculpted back with a distinct side band feels comfortable and secure in your hand the refine visor is made of sturdy gently curved colored glass and transitions seamlessly into the metal body we've placed the fingerprint sensor where your finger naturally Falls it's extremely accurate secure and it unlocks faster than any other smartphone we also added a small pop of color on the power button for a bit of playfulness over on the front pixel two's front-facing stereo speakers are precision tuned to deliver the perfect balance of volume clarity and frequency response we place them so you can comfortably watch videos in landscape mode without muffling the audio with your hand if you prefer headphones use your existing analog headphones with the included adapter or your digital USBC headphones for the highest resolution audio all the way to your ears or avoid cables altogether with your upgraded Bluetooth 5.0 support and high five codecs the smaller 5-inch pixel tube features a full HD OLED display and it's as smart as it is beautiful the display intelligently selects which specific pixels to turn on leaving the others perfectly dark for a 100,000 to 1 contrast ratio that's twice the resolution and more than 10 times the contrast ratio of phones in its category with LCD displays pixel two comes in three colors kind of blue just black and clearly white we love picking the color names so let's talk about the display on the XL the six-inch pixel to XL was designed with an innovative P OLED display technology we elegantly curved the glass to bring the display to the edges for a full screen immersive viewing experience the screen supports 18 by 9 q HD plus resolution with over 4.1 million pixels which equals 538 pixels per inch for amazing detail we tune the display to take advantage of the wide color gamut for vivid and realistic colors we've integrated a circular polarizer which lets you enjoy the screen even while wearing sunglasses and we've optimized the displays on both phones for virtual reality they're both daydream ready the pixel 2 XL comes in two colors just black and the stylish Li simple black and white feel free to choose whichever size pixel you prefer because you'll get the same great experience on both we don't set aside better features for the larger device both devices shot 7 water and dust resistant and have an all-new battery that charge is super fast you get up to 7 hours of charge is just 15 to 60 7 now Sabrina from the pixel product owner is going to take us through the new pixel 2 UI and some cool and useful features [Applause] thanks Mario we're constantly working to make a smartphone experience easier and more helpful and you'll see improvements throughout the pixel twos UI that helena starts before you even unlock the phone let me show you the pixel twos new always-on display you can see important information like the time date email and text notifications and reminders all without pushing any buttons or unlocking the device and there's more than just notifications on your always-on display have you ever heard a song you loved and wondered what it was called [Music] with now playing you can just glance down to see the song name an artist on your phone what makes this feature so special is that the music is identified without your pixel to sending any information to Google on device machine-learning detects a music is playing and matches it to a database of tens of thousands of song patterns on your phone in this example you can see that pixel recognize the song perfect places by Lorde from here I can tap on the song title and I'm taken to this little assistant I can add this on to my library my favorite music service like google play music or Spotify search the web for the song or even watch the video on YouTube this features brought me some delightful moments over the past few months and I'm finally learning who sings my favorite songs ok so let's go to a live demo live demo here we are on the new matrix were using the live demo you can see here I've selected one of our live wallpapers this is from our new collection called the living universe and if you look closely you'll notice subtle movements like the waves crashing on the beach I love them at the top of the screen there's a space called at-a-glance where you can easily see the latest updates on your day we're starting with calendar events today with traffic flight status and more coming soon in this case I can see that I've got a mysterious meeting coming up not sure what that's about we place a Google quick search box at the bottom of the home screen which we found that it's easier to reach and we're making it even more powerful it stays with you as you swipe across your screens of apps and widgets a quick tap into the search box can help me find anything that I need as I start typing I can see web search results at the top but also contacts and apps from my phone I can even drag an app from here and drop it right on my home screen we've also made it faster and easier to get to the Google assistant on pixel 2 with a new feature called active edge just give your pixel a quick squeeze where your hand naturally holds the phone and ask for whatever you need no big speak no big speed button take the break it to you I just I just squeeze find it take a selfie one hand no buttons [Applause] our research team investigated dozens of ways to trigger the assistant but squeezing the phone felt the most natural satisfying and efficient after a lot of work and machine learning we're able to accurately identify an intentional squeeze if we're really proud of how it turned out and it even works when you're voting in a case so your assistant is just a quick squeeze away making lots of common tasks on your phone fast and easy from calling and texting friends to controlling your smart home to enjoying your favorite music and videos and having the same assistant at home and on your phone means the experience is connected across devices for example I can say to my phone ok Google broadcast hey I'm almost home with the pizza so get ready for dinner and be my voice message is shared with my family through the Google home in our kitchen the routines race you mentioned are coming to the phone as well that's why we've also customized routine specifically from long ago the one I use most is when I'm on my commute I jump in my car drop my phone in the cupholder and say ok Google let's go home sure let's go your commute home is currently 27 minutes with heavy traffic if you take us 101 south you have one unread text message it's from mom it says we'll bring dessert to dinner tonight here's where you left off in fresh air have a safe drive I'm Terry Gross with fresh air super useful all from resume is my choice right from right where I left off my assistant even adjusts the volume so I can hear clearly on the road and automatically sends a message to my husband letting him know I'm on my way like all the new routines that the assistant will support you can customize this one based on your preferences so with a quick squeeze useful routines on-the-go and an assistant that keeps getting smarter pixal continues to be the most helpful phone around pixel to launch with pure Android Oreo with features like notification dots picture and picture and many more if you already have a pixel you recently receive the Android Oreo update and we hope you're enjoying all the improvements as a pixel user you'll always be the first to get OS and security updates without having to do anything your phone becomes faster more capable and more secure all the time next up like Aparna is going to share some smart helpful new ways to use your pixel to [Applause] have you ever asked yourself what kind of puppy is that or I want to lose with that pattern our phones can help us in many ways but sometimes the questions we have are difficult to describe into a search box as you heard sooner talk about we believe that as computers can understand what you see it unleashes a whole new kind of assistance that's why we started working on Google Lenz a way to do more with what you see you're super excited to bring a preview of land that's as good as humans we're just getting started with helping you do more with what you see be the photo from five years ago or something right in front of you in time we want to bring lamps everywhere super excited to bring a preview of lens to pixel users first so you'll start to see this icon appear in Google Photos and soon Google assistant we just talked about how the phone can help you understand the world but it can also help you place things into the world that's right that's augmented reality we see there's a powerful way to bring the physical and the digital together that's why we started working on a our core our augmented reality SDK for Android and we see that developers are already using it to create some amazing experiences I want to show you a few examples here so let's take house they're bringing the show room into your living room using a our with League of Legends you can watch one of the most popular eSport games on an AR map built by grab games and with Lego my favorite you can build virtual models with characters that really come to life all the fun no LEGO pieces to step on we at Google are also making some fun things and our teams have been working hard to create this new experience we call it a are stickers it's built right into the camera and six clues it to pixel with a are stickers you can express yourself with playful emojis like this one food characters here there's lots to choose from and more will be added over time our partners are also making some fun stickers here and I want to show some of them to you right now so let's start with the Netflix original my favorite show stranger things can wait for season two ready to see it okay time to set the mood lights please okay here's Lea using the pixel camera we're looking at the AR stickers within the stranger things collection yes okay so let's pick up character let's pick Demi Garden and place him right next to me okay you need to have a cup of coffee name notice how the creatures not just sitting around where you put it right it's not a dead sticker it's moving it's reacting to what's around it it's alive we really pay attention to the motion the physics the lighting we want to make it feel like it's actually here is it let's have some fun this is a great photo or video by the way please but let's have some fun here Lia can be dropped 11 into this alright ok this is getting interesting now we have two characters in the scene and notice how they're not just reacting to the environment around them they're reacting to each other and they know each other's presence that's a big reaction these interactions make some really interesting moments here Thank You Mia now you can be the director of all kinds of stories and share with share these with your friends you have more AR stickers to play with your favorite characters from SNL YouTube the NBA and just in time for episode 8 Star Wars I've been playing with these stickers at Zoey videos and they look great and this is because the pixel camera is specially calibrated for augmented reality it allows robust tracking even in low-light conditions it also supports 60 frames per second rendering of AR content you saw how the camera can help us do more with what we see with google lens you saw how the camera can bridge the physical and digital with AR but the pixel camera also takes awesome photos so to tell you all about it we'll have Mario back on stage thanks a bar now we hear everyday from users of the first pixel phone that the camera is one of their favorite features you can see why in the amazing photos that people post with the team pixel hashtag last year pixel received a DxO score of 89 that was the highest rating that DxO mark had ever issued to a smartphone with pixel - we have reimagined smartphone photography for great hardware and unparalleled imaging software tuned by our engineers and researchers today we're proud to announce that DxO mark has issued pixel to an unprecedented score of 98 that's the highest score of any smartphone camera let's talk about how we achieve that and it starts with great hardware the pixel 2 has a 12 megapixel F 1.8 aperture rear camera with optical image stabilization we've integrated these components with our HDR + computational photography for every photo we take a burst of shots with short exposure times to avoid blowing out the highlights within a line and combine each pixel algorithmically for optimal color and contrast all of this happens instantly with zero shutter lag the results are stunning with high dynamic range even in challenging low-light conditions this year would increase the dynamic range and improved texture and sharpness and combined with a new autofocus mechanism an optical image stabilization to reduce blur from shaky hands and get amazing shots every time like this and this pixel - also brings you portrait mode but we're implementing it a little bit differently we're applying Google's unmatched computational photography and machine learning portrait mode lets you take professional-looking shots with a blurred background to make the foreground pop like you might capture with an SLR camera other smartphones do this by combining the images from two cameras pixel to does portrait mode with just one camera and machine learning what's unique about pixel 2 is that it can generate a true depth map with a single lens so you get beautiful portrait shots without needing a second camera the way this works is that the pixel to camera includes a dual pixel sensor technology this means that each pixel in an image can contains a right and a left view the difference in perspective from those pixels combined with machine learning models trained on almost a million photos means that this works on really hard cases like a busy colorful background and yes this does work with objects too and there's more portrait mode doesn't just work on the main camera because of the quality of Google's computational photography with a single camera you can also take portrait selfies through the front camera on both the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL the pixel 2 takes amazing videos too we're applying optical image stabilization simultaneously with video stabilization at the same time other smartphones do optical or digital we do but don't do both at the same time during video recording on a pixel - the OIS Hardware actively corrects shake artifacts while at the same time the software based video stabilization uses intelligent frame look ahead to stabilize the overall video we call this fused video stabilization and it's another example of Google's hardware + software + AI working together the result is less motion blur even in low-light your videos look smooth and professional the pixel 2 camera also supports a feature called motion photos the photos you take with your in for the photos you take your pixel captures up to 3 seconds of video the scenes removing uninteresting motion and applying our unique fuse video stabilization technology to the results but of course the proof is in the photos and videos so we invited some photographers and producers to test drive the new camera and they were stunned by what they can do with the pixel - Jamie McGurk better known as 13th witness in on Instagram and filmmaker Zac McTeague documented a recent trip to New Orleans using just a pixel - the film you're about to see uses no attachments fancy rates for lighting all of the video footage and stills were captured on pixel - phones without any image enhancements or color Corrections [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] okay so it seems it seems pretty evident that the camera is gonna be one of the compelling features about the next version of pixel you can see here that doing a demonstration they claim that there's no fancy color correction after the fact post production or rigs to offer up greater stabilization I think that interesting stand out from the previous part of the talk about the camera is that there's both optical and electronic image stabilization happening at the same time of course shaky video is not something anybody wants and you know everybody's out there trying to vlog and do whatever else it is with their devices having both forms of stabilization hopefully produces a more stable image and before and Spencer color Corrections now the pixel to camera is simple enough and smart enough that your photos and videos can look just as good so the picture booth photo experience doesn't end when you take a photo or shoot a video we want users to be able to easily find them and store them securely without having to worry about running out of storage after all simple storage and search is part of what makes a school roll so we're happy to announce that pixel to users will continue to get free unlimited storage for all of the photos and videos they captured in the highest resolution including 4k videos and motion photos this is a big deal this is a big deal pixel users take twice as many photos as typical iPhone users and store an average of 23 gigabytes of photos and videos per year in Google's cloud if you handy is iCloud you reach your free limit in less than three months with pix or you can safely and effortless effortlessly store all of your memories for free with your permission Google photos automatically tags and catter categorizes those thousands of photos and videos will take with your pixel too you can search for photos of your friends of a specific location of dogs all without the hassle of manually tagging or sorting finding your photo the photo you're looking for is our problem and not yours we're delighted by what we've been able to achieve with pixel 2 in terms of photography and our so excited by all the moments that you're going to capture so to recap the smart and simple pixel 2 has everything you'd expect from a smartphone and some things you might not a gorgeous display that brings your apps photos and videos to life an all-day battery that charges super fast plus water resistance and security features to keep your phone in your data safe easy quick access to the Google assistant which understands you and get smarter and more helpful all the time fun and useful ways to use your camera like google lens and AR and the best photography from any phone for brilliant photos and smooth professional videos we're also making it easier than ever to switch to pixel most new pixel users will be able to transfer their stuff from their old phone in less than 10 minutes including all of your photos and iPad and even your eye messages so let's talk about availability and pricing pixel 2 with its 5-inch cinematic display starts at six hundred and forty nine dollars for the 64 gigabyte version the pixel to excel has a six inch fullscreen PL LED display and starts at eight hundred and forty nine dollars both phones will be available

radically helpful smartphone that combines the best of Google hardware software and AI we hope you'll love it as much as we do okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay guys there we have it okay pixel to pixel to excel I told you earlier in this stream I have a hands-on video it's coming out in moments in seconds in fact it's coming up very soon so keep it keep an eye on the channel I'm gonna be publishing it any second year I have four devices in that video that you can check out closer that I get to actually handle so the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL just like I said that's the video you want to see so don't go anywhere not yet all right so as you've seen we've spent the past year reimagining a simpler more helpful smartphone experience we've also been working on some new products to make your pixel to experience even better let's start with the newly updated Google daydream view our virtual reality headset we kept everything from last year that people loved and we made it even better to start we have a new lineup of colors that complement this year is made by Google family we also upgraded the lenses and the fabrics so the headset has our widest field of view yet and is super light and comfortable of course what matters most in a VR headset is where it can take you last year we launched with 25 apps and games and now we have more than 250 high-quality VR titles we've also seen that people love going places with VR videos so we're excited to announce a slate of premium video content coming to daydream including multiple new original series on YouTube VR and on Google Play Movies you can experience new IMAX movies available for free to pixel to owners so you get to hang out with Tigers run alongside elephants dive into the ocean with some sharks and blast into space [Music] with pixel twos new front firing stereo speakers these movies sound as amazing as they'll under threat and now you might have missed that front front firing front fiery TV so your friends and family can see what you're seeing the new Google daydream view is the best mobile VR headset on the market and will be available for $99 today we're also announcing a smart new audio accessory that works perfectly with pixel to our first pair of premium wireless headphones they're called they're called Google pixel buds our team designed pixel buds for great sound delivering clear highs and deep bass so whether it's jazz house or a symphony it all sounds incredible with pixel buds controlling your music is super simple because all of the controls are built into the right earbud you simply tap to start and stop your music or swipe forwards and backwards to change the volume now what's amazing is when you paired your pixel buds with your pixel 2 you get instant access to the Google assistant we optimized the experience to be quick and easy just touch and hold the earbud and ask your assistant to play music send a text or give walking directions all while keeping your phone in your pocket it can also alert you to new notifications and read your messages pixel buds work great with pixel they even give you access to a new real-time translation experience it's an incredible application of Google Translate powered by machine learning that's like having a personal translator by your side to show you how easy this experience is I'd like to invite Isabel back on stage for a conversation in her native language Swedish so Isabel is going to speak Swedish into her pixel buds and all hear the English translation out of pixel twos front speakers and then I'll respond in English we go and she'll hear the Swedish translation in her pixel ones to illustrate this today you'll hear both sides of the conversation okay hey Isabel how's it going he needs a Ben who that nagging he open a pack that's fast what do you think of these cool new headphones vertically under my cool under her Lumina mitten the sign another dollar to go make a mistake Oh blah so what were your up here what color should i get midna LuAnn hi we can fix the Evalia hmm yeah throw down sky blue one scallop acid a rule you are brown or people can make no CN or Fe under a gray today between the tweeting there is speed right it has to be fast to be used so with pixel buds I can use real-time Google Translate to have a natural conversation in 40 languages or letting you connect with the world around you in a more natural way by rethinking how headphone should work connecting it to cloud-based machine learning and giving you access with the touch of the finger Gugu pixel buds come in a pocket-sized charging case that provide up to 5 hours of listening time with just one charge and the case holds multiple charges see you get up to 24 hours of listening time when you're on the go pixel buds are available in clearly white kind of blue and just black - beautifully compliment your pixel - and they'll be available in November for $159 and pre-orders begin today the translation I mean we have one more product to show you it's about photography now we all love photos a lot of our photos let us step back into a moment with friends with family some of our favorites are the candid ones like this they capture the essence of the moment but the problem is to get those photos someone needs to be the photographer on duty waiting to press the shutter button at just the right moment and we were thinking how do you capture those fleeting spontaneous moments while letting yourself be part of the moment so we've been working on that and I'm really excited to share an entirely new type of camera that work to make your pixel what we call it Google clips and this first edition is specifically designed with parents and pet owners in mind so you can capture more of those spontaneous smiles first steps and first tricks now cliff's has all the things you would expect from a great camera a high-performance lens a powerful image sensor it has a shutter button but that's not what this camera is all about we reimagine this camera from the inside out starting with the software and applying machine learning to build a camera that takes photos for you so you can enjoy the moment and instantly get shots you couldn't get before thank you how does all of that work it starts with an AI engine at the core of the camera let's talk about what that engine does when you're behind the camera you look for people you care about you look for smiles you look for that moment your dog starts chasing her tail clips does all of that for you turn it on and it captures the moment so you can be in the moment and because the software is at the core the camera it's gonna get smarter over time we also reimagine what camera hardware should do for you clips is tiny it is almost nothing so you can easily toss it into your pocket and it's a hands-free camera so you can get these amazing new perspectives on your experience and get yourself in the shot by attaching clips to almost anything or setting it down now from the beginning we knew privacy and control really matter and we've been thoughtful about this for Clips users their family and their friends let's start with the basics it looks like a camera and it has an indicator light so everyone knows what the device does next it looks for stable clear shots people you know and you help the camera learn who's important to you and finally all the machine learning happens on the device itself so just like any point and shoot nothing leaves your device until you decide to save and share it this approach to designing and engineering clips required some significant technical breakthroughs to miniaturize the type of powerful machine learning that only a few years ago needed a supercomputer let's take a look at what Clips actually captures so here's some clips I've captured with my family at home now as you can see it's not just photos that clips is taking taking little snippets that capture the whole moment we call those of course clips you can save them as a motion photo or choose any frame to save as a high-resolution still it's like having my own photographer shooting and choosing the best moments for me and I just have to swipe to save to Google photos which can automatically make movies out of your clips in seconds so that's the new Google clips a new type of camera that brings together the best of Google AI software and hardware tell people more is we captured genuine candid moments of family friends and pets clips we coming soon and selling for $249 take a look at some of these great clips from our earliest users enjoy regarding insistent regarding this product right here is this idea of like passive computing right lately where the device or software can predetermine what you might want and then do it so you don't have two buds and clips blends AI with the best of Google software and high performance hardware to create new radically helpful experiences for users this is our strategy for the Google hardware team and you've seen it come to life in all of our new products the two newest members of the Google home family the beautiful new pixel phones and our premium pixel book laptop and of course the Google assistant is the primary way we bring an AI to our users your personal Google is ready to get you to help you need when you need it talk to it type show what you see or just give your phone a squeeze it's the simplest way to get things done and it just works so here it is this year's made by Google family [Applause] we've created them as a single set of products that are designed for you with familiar elements from soft materials to curved lines and simple stylish colors they look great together and they also work great together and perfectly demonstrate our approach of reimagining hardware from the inside out thanks so much for joining us today whew live stream viewers take a closer look at our new products at a redesigned Google store for everyone here in SF jazz you'll get to see everything up close in our demo area outside thank you so much and enjoy your day there you have it the end of the live stream many products introduced demonstrated there but of course you're mostly interested in the pixel to pixel to excel and because of that I have an exclusive hands-on video coming out very shortly in fact in 16 minutes at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time that video is gonna drop on my channel so if you're not a subscriber maybe click that button turn on notifications real quick because in 16 minutes I'll have a dedicated hands-on video with close-ups for various models for different models the two XL and the pixel two so just if you're already a subscriber stick around a couple of minutes time I will also put a link on my Twitter but it'll be on my channel page so you can you know you can take a closer look at this device not just via the livestream but in my actual hands you can get my initial impressions just remember it is a hands-on video I will have a more extensive review I haven't had very much time with these devices so just keep that in mind when you go watch the video coming up like I said in 16 minutes so I'm gonna go ahead and end this here 2 p.m. now 15 it's time hands-on video on the channel okay all right I'm going to end this here thanks for joining for the live stream as well 
so I'm excited for this one the name alone has gotten me motivated here Batman say something Batman would use the bat band there's a thing in the world called the Batman then it needs to be here on the desk so I could tell you what it's all about ear free Wireless hero Bowl hero Bowl with bone conduction sound it's being modeled I was the first choice I couldn't do it and so they ended up with this I think it's not that bad but of course there it is put on your head with the logo in the upright position download the app to calibrate swipe one finger to bring volume up two fingers for the next or previous track and click it once to play pause and take or end a phone call that is so strange looking I mean it's certainly not headphones some light reading with an afternoon cup of tea that's what Jack likes to do connect to your virtual assistant be social be social Jack do you know how to be social at life listen to music and free your ear for your ear I've done videos on bone conduction style headphones before but they looked more like headphones that Raptor on the back of your neck this is unmistakable if you see this thing you're gonna ask some questions yes bat Bend I heard something okay cool now now there is an app I'm supposed to get as well so I should probably do that Batman by studio banana oh my the app has a an average of a 1.3 rating that's a little rough connected sweet there's presets so you can choose between outdoors indoors or a personalized preset oh this is cool alright so you can also set the microphone sensitivity balance between the left and right channel let's say it's just cool like there like that it sticks and it's kind of comfortable - I don't know maybe I don't mind it you could hide it like oh that might be the move I'm not doing anything look I got the ears all right let me play the demo track a lot more vibration than I expected oh the closer you get to the this is much louder down here okay it's quite a bit louder now here's my personalized let me create one here let's just max it we just need more that does not sound great let's just do outdoors like you hear this right now yeah you hear this I mean you can't be listening to this on an airplane or something no that actually sounds better this sounds way better like this what it is is the closer that gets to your actual ear the louder it gets you know it bleeds that this out the sound bleeds out so if you get a closer to your ear the louder that it gets so I did a video a while back that was the first bone conduction audio device that I had tried and the design on those it kind of brings the bone conduction part up in front of the ears if it sits right here and those are usable the trouble with these unless you've got them right over your ears it's just not loud enough maybe that's fine maybe that's where you would end up wearing them anyway the whole premise here is that your ears remain accessible to outside input you're at the grocery store you go for the jog like I said you're on the bike you need to be aware of your surroundings see the trouble is if you don't give that correct mix you end up getting not enough of either not enough of your surroundings not enough of the audio that you're wishing you were listening to now I felt like with that last pair it was good enough but with this I feel like you're probably giving up too much plus I think this thing is expensive how much is this will $250 you want to be that whatever that is you want to be that nice I'm not wearing this I'm not gonna wear it it's not happening if it sounded great maybe I kind of like the idea of not having my ears covered when I'm out but compared to the pair that I tried in the past they did sound better and that I think that counts for something I don't know what to tell you two-fifty man you could get some serious headphones for 250 like the IQ buds that have microphones in them so you can get some spatial awareness Tom say something oh you're amplified right now I don't know who this is for other than the girl on the box some kind of a costume I mean that's I have to try it I got to be on the lookout for that new tech but what I would say is if you're looking for bone conduction look away from these I look the one that's a lot less expensive I will link it down below in the description a company called aftershocks and that one does a better job for less maybe it's for somebody if that's for you I want to know in the comments how you see yourself using that beyond the fact that you're a huge Star Trek fan and it's time for you two to beam beam off into another galaxy far away this episode of unboxing has been brought to you by the new honor 7x and in celebration you can probably tell I've got seven of them

device 0.2 second fingerprint scanner so it's got something they're calling full view display which is 18 by 9 by default but then you can utilize that extra space to have a multi window set up pulled

don't have any issues here a little lag here we go there's the link I need and if you guys want to talk to me if you want to if you want to make a comment or ask a question do it on Twitter please instead of on YouTube where the chat is just flying so go over to my twitter at unbox therapy and I'll be monitoring Twitter during the event it's just a little easier to answer questions on okay and then we add an image here [Music] what do I need mmm still hasn't started yet here we go this will work everything looked good okay it's been tweeted so we should be good to go I see everybody coming in on Twitter right now look at this right in time mm-hmm if you're watching this after the fact I hope you fast forwarded that intro there but look people aren't even sitting down yet you know how this is they make you wait they said 1 o'clock but of course they make you wait it's what is that fashionably late makes it seem more important more special so in the meantime like I said I could take some of your questions on Twitter it's gonna be the easiest place to kind of manage that until we have some actual action going on up here so let's see here even Twitter is moving quickly right now did I have any problems with a Nintendo switch no no mine is not warped mine is in good shape oh wait a sec the lights are off let's turn this up a little bit here here we go guys there's lots of ways to be as a person and some people express their deep appreciation in in different ways but one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out and you never you never meet the people we never shake their hands you never hear their story or tell yours but somehow in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love something's transmitted there and it's a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation so we need to be true to who we are and remember what's really important to us that's what's gonna keep Apple Apple is if we keep us us yo will can you hit the Lights to the place thank you I love hearing his voice and his inspiring message and it was only fitting that Steve should open his theater it is the honor of a lifetime to be the first to welcome you to the Steve Jobs theater Steve meant so much to me and so much to all of us there's not a day that goes by that we don't think about him memories have expecially come rushing back as we prepared for today and this event it's taken some time but we can now reflect on him with joy instead of sadness Steve's spirit and timeless philosophy on life will always be the DNA of Apple his greatest gift his greatest expression of his appreciation for Humanity would not be a singular product rather it would be Apple itself we dedicate this theater to Steve because we loved him and because he loved days like this where he could share our latest new products and new ideas of the world and we do so not only to pay tribute to Steve but to inspire the next generation of creators and innovators Steve was a genius and one of the many ways that he showed that was in the his uncanny ability to unlock the talent of everybody that he worked with he thought deeply about our workplace and its surroundings and he believed that they should inspire talented people to do their best work so over a decade ago he began to work on a new campus for Apple his vision for Apple Park was to create an incredible workplace of the future where engineers and designers could all be together collaborating on the next generations of Apple product to change the world Steve's vision and passion live on here at Apple Park and everywhere in Apple today and always we honor him [Applause] we're here today to talk about some incredible products but before we get to that I'd like to take a moment to talk about what's happening in Florida and Texas southeastern United States and across the Caribbean our hearts go out to all of the people whose lives have been disrupted by hurricanes Irma and hurricane Harvey you're in our thoughts we send you our strength you're in our prayers Apple is working closely with relief and recovery efforts through hand in hand and the American Red Cross and in addition to Apple's direct contributions we're making it really simple for the entire Apple community to donate via iTunes and the App Store the handed hand benefit for hurricane relief airs tonight on all of the major broadcast networks and I encourage you to watch it and however you choose to give I hope that you open your heart to this important effort thank you [Applause] now let me tell you a little bit about our new home we'll start movin an apple park later this year but of course such a large move it's really more of a process and the first big step is the opening today of the stage' of Steve Jobs theater it's the most state-of-the-art purpose-built theater ever built or events just like this one Apple Park has been built to reflect apples values for both technology and the environment it connects connects extraordinarily advanced buildings with a rolling Park land to form an open and inspiring environment for our teams to create and collaborate the park itself was converted from a sea of asphalt into a hundred and seventy-five acre green space with over nine thousand trees Apple Park is designed to be seamless with nature it's open transparent it brings the outside in and connects everyone to the beautiful California landscape it's powered by a hundred percent renewable energy thank you [Applause] and in fact we have one of the world's largest on-site solar installations right here and just like everything we made apple parkas that has been designed with extraordinary attention to detail incredible precision and really beautiful materials we've got a great visitor center which will be open later this year where we will welcome everyone and inside the visitor center you'll find an incredible augmented reality experience or you can learn more about Apple Park its design and its innovations you'll also find a fantastic new Apple Retail Store as you know Apple Retail has always been about more than selling it's about learning inspiring and connecting with people now our stores are also the best place to go discover explore and experience our new products so before we get to some incredible products we'd like to give you an update on retail and to do that I'd like to invite Angela Angela you know they're not gonna give you a phone right away right they got a cover being this first thank you it's great to be here and I love the fact but the same team that designs at the park also designs our largest retail stores around the world it's funny Jackson will call them stores anymore we call them town squares because they're gathering places for 500 million people who visit us every year places where everyone's welcome and where all of Apple comes together but what really brings it all the life as Tim said are our incredible teams we've always said that our people of our soul and they're Apple's greatest differentiator because they bring personal connection to communities all over the world they humanize technology but along with our amazing teams our commitment to design also sets us apart to make things simple beautiful and that's why we think of Apple retail as Apple's largest products and like all of our products we design new features to take the customer experience even further in our largest cities where we can we create a plaza a space open to everyone come in and relax meet up with friends or just listen to a local artist on the weekends inside we've designed a forum a place for customers to come and create collaborate or just connect again with one another for local entrepreneurs and app developers we had a quieter space in the larger stores called a boardroom where they can learn more from our teams or again share with each other and the genius growth a redesigned more relaxed servic service experience now in the heart of our largest stores and lastly the avenues have a like shop windows around a town square they're carefully curated and they change seasonally to always teacher our newest products and services and this summer to turn on these new features we've launched today at Apple our in-store experience designed to inspire customers to go even further with their past I just noticed uh ten to ten dollar Apple's DNA live chat things unbelievable what's going on here for and they trust us to teach them like photography music gaming and app development we've created new programs like photo walks where customers can perfect their photography skills with features like portrait mode and memories and we do all of this in a really fun social way by taking them out to the neighborhood to explore with each other or Swift playgrounds where the next generation app developers can begin to learn the basics of coding and one of my personal favorites shout out to calling ping we're at 10 bucks assessing their to stay updated on the newest technologies and acts in some of our larger stores sessions are led by local artists like this music lab called the art of beat making with RZA and the Raleigh team in Brooklyn these sessions in all stores are led by our creative team

Mississippi I'm a two-time Olympian it's owned by a deer we're seeing a mountain poncho I'm the father of a nine-year-old I a 99 year old portrait every day for the last two and a half years I have

for sharing their personal experience with all of us we have some great news about the future of Apple watch and to share it with you I'd like to invite Jeff Oh Jeff [Applause] thanks Tim thanks dad those stories are really great and it's it's really inspiring to us that so many people are getting healthier with Apple watch with watch OS 4 they're gonna be able to do even more we're adding smart activity coaching which is gonna help more people close more rings more often a completely redesigned workout app with high intensity interval training new features for swimmers like Auto sets and gym kick an industry-first it's really simple you just tap your watch on the machine get going and all your metrics are insane one of the things that enables these fitness features is the apple heart rate sensor and it's been at the core of Apple watch since the very beginning and today it's the most used heartrate monitor in the world and we want to use it to help even more people so we're doing three things first we're making enhancements to the heart rate app to give you more information now you'll see your heart rate right on the watch face so you can keep an eye on it with just a raise of the wrist and when you launch the heart rate app you'll see new measurements like resting heart rate Apple watch calculates this daily by correlating background heart rate readings with accelerometer data and recovering heart rate which tells you how quickly your heart rate drops after workout a lower resting heart rate and a quicker recovery rate can be signs of improved fitness and now you can keep a better picture of your heart rate you'll have a better picture throughout the day the second thing we're doing is inspired by many of the letters we received from customers who noticed an unusually high heart rate when they wouldn't expect one so Apple watch has been helpful for them but we realize most people won't notice so we're adding a feature and now Apple watch will notify you when it detects an elevated heart rate you and you don't appear to be active [Applause] and the third thing we're doing is focused on heart rhythm a regular heart rhythm has a familiar pattern but when your heart beats irregularly is called an arrhythmia it doesn't mean it's beating too fast or too slow it just means it's beating out of its normal rhythm and that can cause problems the most common form of serious arrhythmia is called atrial fibrillation or afib and it affects tens of millions of people and is a leading cause of stroke but the challenge is many people with afib don't feel symptoms so it often goes undiagnosed we've been looking at this for a couple of years and we think Apple watch can help in our initial studies Apple watch has been effective at surfacing irregular rhythms so we're expanding that work and today we're announcing the Apple heart study whoa 100 bucks [Applause] it will use data from Apple watch hundred-dollar super check what's up dude shout out to you and notify users this study is being conducted in partnership with Stanford medicine and we're working closely with the FDA and they've been great to work with so later this year the first phase of the Apple Park study will be available in the US on the App Store those are the updates focused on fitness and health and they join the other great features of watch OS for we have a completely redesigned music experience an intelligent Siri face fun new characters from Toy Story and more shout-out to Abraham as well as that's Nigel razor it will be available to all Apple watch customers on September 19 [Applause] and now I'd like to introduce the next generation of Apple watch what do you guys are you here for the Apple watch I doubt it you're probably here for the next size phone but anyway you got to talk about the watch [Music] [Music] shoutout to aim farm [Music] shut it again to Marcelo Kenzo [Applause] introducing Apple watch Series three and it has cellular built-in [Applause] now you have the freedom to go anywhere with just your Apple watch this this has been our vision from the very beginning and we believe built-in Cellular makes series three the ultimate expression of Apple watch now you can go for a run with just your watch and still be connected you can leave your phone when you go to the beach or just run a quick errand and it's really nice to know you can be reached if needed while staying in the moment you can receive an important call is just your watch and and the number is the same numbers your iPhone you don't have to manage a separate number the actual ion

one live or any Apple radio music station you can even ask Siri to find you the perfect track now the best device for staying motive before staying active has all the music you need to stay motivated what to enable these features on Apple watch we have packed Series three with the most advanced technologies ever in a watch inside is a new dual-core processor delivering up to 70% more more performance it's really really fast Siri is quicker than ever and thanks to the new processor for the first time on Apple watch Siri can talk it's 64 degrees right now in South Lake Tahoe it's actually it's really convenient to not have to look at the screen when you ask you the question for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity we developed a custom wireless chip we call w2 there's nothing else like it it delivers up to 85% faster Wi-Fi while being 50% more power power efficient for both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and we've added a barometric altimeter so now you get flights of stairs climbed and elevation gains after a workout we're also releasing an app for developers this can be great for skiing and snowboarding apps of course got a snowboarder out there of course the biggest challenge of all was adding cellular you see our little watch is already packed and you have to add antennas radios power amplifiers a SIM card and if you don't do it right it gets so big it looks like a house arrest bracelet and you're not gonna want to wear it so our engineers have been hard at work and it's learning really it is kinda crazy Cellular in your wrist rather than add an antenna the display itself is the multi frequency antenna for both LTE and ts and of course you have to have a SIM card but even a nano SIM would be way too big so instead we integrated an electronic sim in its interaction of the size embedded SIM so I don't think I've seen where we ended up even with all these new features faster dual-core processor w2 altimeter all the stuff you've got to put in for cellular the case for series 3 is the same size as series 2 the thing for me though and when a bigger Apple watch in general I need a bigger display on me I got these big lists you know that's my issue the only difference is we extended the back crystal amir 0.25 millimeters that's as thin as 2 sheets of paper it's it's really magical to make a stand-alone call on a device there's our first like magical you are you know used isn't sure there's plenty more where that came from I'm gonna switch watches so you guys can see what's going on this watch is connected over the AT&amp;T cellular network this is our new Explorer face and I'm gonna tap on the the phone app and I'm gonna call Deidre who's a colleague on the watch team so the question is here how does this integrate with your carrier are you having a separate plan is it subsidizing is a purchase subsidized hi hi Deidre hey I'm calling you from the new Steve Jobs theater how are you doing oh yeah sure sure you are why don't we pull in some video and show everybody where you are [Applause] this has been a merriment but you know me I'm playing yeah that's you Deidre give give give well it looks beautiful out there well so it's so fortunate so far so good danger hey I should probably cut it off before something goes awry but be safe out there and thanks for doing this yeah okay okay that sounds great teacher so activities Fitness you don't want to have your phone you just have to watch embedded SIM card kind of interesting gonna be attention I'm telling you right now it's gonna be expensive [Applause] I'm gonna go roll over for a minute I you know you got you guys get it but sometimes people take technology for granted and just just for perspective I might in fact I'm actually double Mike in just the right location so you can hear me teachers out in the middle of a windy blade showed up an obsession for the super Chandra if you guys do a super check out below a beanie pops up on the way out she's very shadowing and the signals being sent over cellular coming in and that's just darn close to magic [Applause] series three comes in a wide variety of cases and bands we have a beautiful new gold aluminum finish along with silver and Space Gray we're excited to introduce a new band we call the sport loop it's designed for an active lifestyle and it's light stretchy and breathable okay an Apple watch Nike Plus we have exclusive new colors and they're releasing a new version of their Nike Plus run Club app with great new features like in run audio coaching and we have some wonderful colors across all of our bands that you just have to see in person we have a great partnership with Hermes and the tradition continues this year with some new watch face there's the expensive one bands like the one the left that's inspired by the classic Hermes driving glove and last year we introduced a white ceramic watch this year we're adding a ceramic watch in a gorgeous gray finish [Applause] all of these watches were built with a great deal of care as well as a concern for the environment and they're free of these harmful materials so that's Apple watch Series three cellular GPS swim approves 70% faster dual-core processor barometric altimeter all the features of watch OS 4 and it still has all day battery life up to 18 hours across the mix of LTE Bluetooth and Wi-Fi we have two versions of here we go these three there's one with cellular at 319 without cellular that has all the other great features at just 329 and we're gonna keep series one in the line at a new starting price of 249 I don't know what do you guys think with cellular are you gonna pick this up you're gonna buy that disagrees three cellular will be available in these nine countries with these 14 carriers at launch and six more coming later in the year and we've worked with each of these carriers and they're each off have a special introductory offer for seriously this is what I was talking about we we subsidize the series 3 without cellular in these 26 countries at launch orders will begin September 15th and availability will be September 22nd that's the update on Apple watch and now back to Tim okay kinda cool me having more functionalities a good thing everything was kept saying I don't know I don't need the watch just does what my phone does now it actually does what your phone device or helping like in the series 3 takes that to a whole new level now Jeff showed you some very cool things you can do with the cellular function series three and one of those is to strain 40 million songs right on your wrist we've made a great ad showing just that shout out to angry ginger boss as well as rain 94 thank you for the shoot thank you for the super chats also Marcelo pencil who wants me to say

gonna be unboxing all this stuff apple tree has changed the watch the new film television simply the addition to end the TV yes we enjoy movies TV shows sports news games absence and so much more in fact we've just been awarded our second Emmy for Apple TV thank you the semi was in recognition for how Siri makes it so easy to search discover and interact with your TV content we're really really proud of the efforts we've made to improve the TV experience now throughout the history of TV there's been a few key inflection points that have changed the way we experience television it of course all began with black-and-white and it was first transformed with the introduction of color it took a huge step forward with the advent of HD each stage brought with it a more true to life experience a more immersive experience now we're at the next major inflection point one that has the most stunning visuals ever that are ideal for the large TV screens that are coming into our living rooms this will bring cinematic quality to virtually everything that you watch that's why I am so excited to introduce Apple TV 4k Apple TV 4k 4k at the heart about time to be honest are two key technologies that are driving this next evolution of the TV experience and to tell you all about them I'd like to invite Eddie to the stage Eddie thank you Tim it is really great to be here tonight Apple TV 4k is incredible and it starts with two big advancements in picture quality first is forte let me show you this is an image in 4k it's got incredible detail that's possible because 4k has four times the number of pixels of HD but resolution isn't everything there's an even bigger advancement that's more important and it's called high dynamic range or HDR while 4k is about the number of pixels HDR is about better pixels let me show you here's that same 4k image shout out to aw interesting camera our look at the color HD oils apples or zoo this because it supports the industry standard HDR 10 as well as Dolby vision up to us I though your experience you tap TV forecast you are killing Moe livers the highest picture quality ever and asking where we are Dolby 4k HDR cinema projector in the theater so let's dim the lights and let me show you the new Apple TV and we remastered our screen savers our customers love these to take full advantage of 4k HDR those are cool I use those you just lead the Apple TV onyx here we are Dubai those are nice and even at night you can see incredible details in the buildings and the cars on the road now here's a city shot that really shows off the crispness and sharpness that's possible in the new Apple TV I own so many Apple TVs I got a revelation they replace them all now Apple every single in 4k the Texas sharper the images are brighter and more vibrant but let's take a look at a 4k HD art clip this is from the new spider-man will be coming to iTunes later this month this high-tech stuff makes it too easy with your father America no secret chat thanks D whoa you're the Avengers what are you guys doing here more handsome in person [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] honestly they see the trouble with this with the 4k Apple TV to me is that it took so long and I've already accumulated so many of these things now at the heart of the Apple TV we've got the powerful a 10x fusion chip this is the same chip that's in our iPad pro and the new Apple TV isn't just slightly faster it's remarkably faster CPU performance is more than twice as fast as the current Apple TV and graphics are more than four times faster and of course it runs the latest version of TV OS the best operating system for the living room now to experience 4k with HDR you also need great content and we've been working with the large Hollywood studios to bring all of their 4k and HDR movie titles to iTunes so now you'll have the biggest releases in the best picture quality all on iTunes all available for the same price as HD ok and if you bought one of those movies in HD from iTunes we're gonna automatically upgrade them to 4k HD are at no additional charge it's cool that's kind of thing now in addition to iTunes we've been working with leading streaming providers like Netflix to bring their 4k HDR titles to Apple TV and later this year Amazon Prime video with all of their 4k HDR titles and originals as well now last year we introduced the Apple TV sandwich I don't really have an easy way to watch your favorite movies and TV shows in a single place it's been available in the US and today I'm happy to announce that we're bringing it to seven additional countries Canada and Australia later this month and the rest by the end of the year we'll get a candidate Love Dare for us now for each country it's really important that we have the content that those customers know and love and that's why we're adding all of these local services to Apple TV now later this year Apple TV will do even more because we're bringing live sports so you'll know if you're a huge sports fan like I am you're really gonna love this wait a second if your favorite team is planning on ESPN it'll automatically appear right first in the up next list you'll even get notifications when a games about to start or there's a close game so you can start watching instantly and if you scroll up you'll see even more games and in addition we're bringing live news to the TV app now let's take a look at those games as you can see we show you the score and the time remaining to help you decide which game to watch that's cool what does he know my name judo yeah ok Balu straight unit actually wouldn't be here at another score you can turn the feature off now we also have a dedicated sports tab where you can see every live and upcoming game and as the seasons change so will the sports tab always showing what's you what's best for you a sports in the TV app is a real game-changer for sports fans and of course the new TV app is available your iPhone and iPad as well if you own an iPad or iPhone there's no better choice than Apple TV you can now share your photos on the big screen including live photo effects 4k video memories you can play from the over 40 million songs and Apple music including the music that your friends are listening to and because Apple TV is always home you get anywhere anytime access to all of your home pet accessories and of course you've got access to choose from the thousands of games and apps on the App Store and with the 8nx fusion ship there's so much more that Apple TV can do check out the gray scenes and what's possible we'd love to show you a new game from that game company they're known for making artistic and critically acclaimed games as a matter of fact their first game called flower was chosen as the first video game ever to be in the permanent collection in the Smithsonian it's very very cool so with that I would love to welcome their CEO Jenova Chen at SETI [Applause] at that game company we treat games as an art form today many of us play games alone we believe games is a medium that can bring people together gaming and that should be not something I've ever wanted to do participated I so that was not a big way let's put it that way why don't we take off sky is a romantic social adventure game when you fly above the clouds to explore the wonders of a mysterious world the game is designed to be adaptable to the most casual players the control is simple and intuitive everything can be done with one finger on the Siri remote oh hey that's a max friend Jeff and he's asking us to follow him let's see what he has discovered compassion and generosity are key to unveil hidden areas of the world as well as growing your character so by lighting all the candles Jeff and Mike was able to summon the spirit and he's about to teach Mike the knowledge of how to sever a magical creature [Music] the sky we really tell you see here's the thing like I mean maybe for a certain audience maybe for a certain age group this type of game on the Apple TV could be compelling but it's so hard to take a device targeted at specifically passive content in other words Netflix and and movies and so on and then and then also have it game versus the other way around where you have a game centric device that can then do those things like a Playstation or an Xbox because the control hold you back I mean the little you can't put that little remote up against a proper controller not in my world not yours probably this guy could talk about romance all he wants let's oh there you go check it out like - well it is needed the most [Music] where's the light Mike was able to free all the butterflies and together they can move on to the next part of the adventure with a live orchestral soundtrack and cinematic experiences you can expect to be immersed in ever-expanding world so join hands with your loved ones and play sky exclusively on Apple TV I pad an iPhone this winter thank you thanks Jennifer we can't wait for you to get your hands on sky we're so excited about the new Apple TV 4k it's got powerful hardware that delivers stunning 4k HDR video live sports along with live news TV shows and and and movies all in the TV app and the perfect big-screen companion for your iPhone or iPad a new Apple TV 4k starts at $179 it joins the existing one you can order it starting on September 15th and it ships just a week later that is the new Apple TV 4k thank you and I'd like to turn it back to ten it's the phone now all right excited don't panic at least I think it has to be it's the beauty and the magic of the cinema right in your living room for the Apple TV 4k next up iPhone [Applause] Apple has always believed that technology infused with humanity could improve people's lives and changed the world no other device in our lifetimes have had the impact on the world that the iPhone has nothing else has become so essential or put so much power into so many people's hands than iPhone it's truly amazing how much iPhone impacts the world each and every day our intention with iPhone has always been able to been to create something so powerful so immersive and so magical that the hardware addict account to virtually disappeared maybe there were more over the last ten years we've reimagined or invented numerous technologies to create just that experience the first iPhone forever changed how we interact with technology by introducing multi-touch and that's true I agree with that most infamous time you are actually touching the software instead of buttons it's magical old magical stairs changed the way 3play learn communicate spawning new companies and new industries along the way which of the viewing experience to places literally never seen before with technologies like the retina display we change the way people communicate with features like iMessage and FaceTime that allowed us all to connect in more meaningful ways and with Siri we used artificial intelligence to make our voices more powerful iPhone even revolutionized security and privacy with touch ID and our wallets with Apple pay and of course I firm put amazing easy-to-use cameras into our hands becoming the most popular way to capture the image of our lives over the past decade we pushed forward with innovation after innovation after innovation bringing us to this moment when now we can create devices that are far more intelligent far more capable far more personal than ever before we had huge iPhone news for you today oh and it gets started right now Oh drama [Music] [Music] iPhone 8 okay so we have an 8 iPhone 8 this is the confirm step forward for iPhone and to tell you all about it I'd like to invite Phil to the stage Phil a [Applause] good morning everyone I am so excited to tell you all about the new iPhone 8 and the new iPhone 8 plus these are a new generation of iPhone and they improve on everything we love about iPhone the design is all new it has glass on both the front in the back the aluminum band beautifully matches the finish of each iPhone 8 it comes in silver space grey and a beautiful new gold finish it's made from an aerospace grade 7000 series custom aluminum alloy the glass is a seven-layer color process making sure there's a beautiful precise view and the glass is further reinforced by an internal laser welded steel and copper structure hmm we're so excited because this glass is the most durable ever in a smartphone iPhone 8 and 8 plus it's also microscopically sealed for water and dust resistance and they have a new retina HD display in each model there's a 4.7 inch Retina display in iphone 8 and a 5.5 inch an iphone 8 plus now Apple Retina displays are renowned for their incredible color accuracy and they have great wide cinema quality color gamut we've built in our 3d touch technology into the display and for the first time an iPhone display it is our true tone technology now with true tone it adapts the color temperature and intensity to the ambient light around us along with the displays iPhone 8 8 plus of new stereo speakers as well the 25% louder than the speed I like you more than I like in a deeper bass 2 and this is pretty incredible inside iPhone 8 mate plus it's a brand new chip and this is a breakthrough performance in a mobile device we call it a 11 Bionic whoa Nonnie this is the most powerful and smartest chimp ever in a smartphone the 64-bit design 4.3 billion transistors six core we're gonna geek out therefore because it is so awesome it has two high-performance courts the 25% faster than the Explorer CPU okay it's industry-leading attention is for high efficiency cords through up to 70 percent faster than the ones in the a-10 chip they're managed by our second generation performance controller that now can use all six cords at once it could deliver up to 70 percent improvement in multi fitted workloads and they have our first ever Apple 2 design graphics processing unit or GPU this is a three core design it's 30% faster than the graphics in the previous a 10 the GPU is designed to accelerate 3d apps and games especially those that use our new metal 2 framework and the GPU also is incredible for machine learning apps and those kind of tasks get a big speed-up if these are our core machine learning frame or - this more to it the 11 Bionic includes a first new generation image signal processor or ISP so you know this is using photography the delivers faster autofocus in low-light as new pixel processing for sharpness and texture and for the first time to help reduce noise that is Hardware enabled multiband noise reduction all this helps to improve performance and helps us take better pictures perhaps the most beloved feature of every new generation of iPhone is the cameras and people love taking photos and customers sent us their photos for our shot an iPhone campaign like this one this is sent from Jeremy Perez Cruz is shot it with an iPhone 7 plus and people gonna love taking pictures with the iPhone 8 camera there's an all-new 12 megapixel sensor it's larger and faster it provides 83 percent more light and it provides warm it's more power efficient at the same time it is deeper pixels and a new color filter so this adds up to having better color a wider dynamic range of color and lower noise in your photos and videos i phone eight bus has two new sensors in its dual camera the wide-angle camera is an F 1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization the telephoto camera has F 2.8 aperture so as always we want to show you the kind of photos you can take off of our new cameras now these are photos we're going to show that have not been retouched in any way they're straight off the iPhone 8 and 8 plus so here's the first one this is absolutely beautiful now that's not the Golden Gate Bridge this is taken in Portugal it shows the beauty of wide color gamut as great dynamic range sharpness and incredibly low noise just look at that blue sky there's another example it shows incredible Y quality color again just look at the skin tones and the detail in the hair in the eyes if you look closely in her eyes you can actually see the photographer reflected there holding an iPhone to take the picture it's a great example of the amazing textures and depth and photography and really feel the fabric and you can see details in their face behind the fabric here's a great example of low-light photography texture detail and very subtle colors in this darker environment last year we introduced portrait mode iPhone 8x fantastic portrait modes and people flip over taking these photos and now with the iPhone 8 plus you're gonna get sharper details more uses in low-light and even a more natural bokeh in the background with the photos so this is a big hit we had a surprise in the future last year of portrait mode we brought it out in beta and it just got better and better over time and customers send us photos they love this so we challenged the engineering team to do that again to make it easy for all of us to take advantage of an advanced photographic technique and they're doing it and it has to do with lighting if you've ever had a professional portrait taken you know the Pro photographers use advanced equipment and have a great understanding advanced techniques to literally sculpt the light on your face to create the perfect mood for a portrait photograph our team is making as possible for all of us using the new dual cameras in the 11 Bionic chip and the iPhone 8 plus the team has come up with a new feature called portrait lighting and this is beta but it will ship with the iPhone 8 plus and here's how it works you compose a photo in the camera using the portrait mode the dual cameras in the isp sense the scene they create a depth map they separate the subject from the background and then you see machine learning a cream facial landmarks and actually changes the lighting of the contours over your face that happens while you're composing the shot [Applause] it's super easy to use right when you're in the camera app you use portrait mode and there's a new menu to select the lighting effect you well you just swipe to pick a different effect or whatever you want to shoot and these aren't filters this is real-time analysis of the light on your subjects face in fact you can go in later after shot a portrait mode photo into the Photos app and change the lighting effect so soft which one you want to use in your photograph that's a cool implementation they share [Applause] their team has done an unbelievable job on this and so here's an example of a photo that's taken not touched in any way this is portrait mode using portrait lighting it's actually using the setting and portrait lighting for stage light so it drops away the background to make this stunning dramatic photograph it's absolutely beautiful so iPhone eight eight plus four incredible for taking pictures they're also amazing for video as well in fact iPhone 8 as the highest quality video capture ever in a smartphone [Applause] along with the ICT we have an apple design video encoder this enables faster frame rates and higher quality video it does real-time image and motion analysis to predict changes in the content and optimize the video encoding algorithms so while you're shooting video let's say for K 60 frames a second shout out to Michael and divides each frame into individual thanks for your chance to million of them and we analyze the two million tiles every second looking for details like texturing edges to predict whether that tile has grass sky water of movement in it so let's say you're shooting 4k 60 frame of video and look like this it's beautifully optimized for quality and for compression level and this video was shot on an iPhone in 4k it's amazing and if you're one of the many people who loves shooting slow-mo videos that's got a lot better - now you can shoot a 1080p HD 240 frames a second let's double the frame rate of previous absolute beautiful so now iPhone 8 is incredible for shooting photos it's incredible for video there's a third category of use of the camera that's gonna become increasingly important in our mobile devices and that's augmented reality he this is an incredible area for us to advance in in our teams of work together hardware and software to make iphone le the first camera the first iPhone really created for augmented reality in the first smartphone designed for it as well we custom tune each iPhone for augmented reality the cameras actually individually calibrated in the factory and that makes a huge difference in the performance for a are there new gyroscopes new accelerometers an AR kit software is tightly tuned to all this hardware to deliver the best experience for motion tracking an AR greatly benefits in the new a 11 Bionic chip the CPU handles world tracking the new Apple GPU renders a mirthless mersive graphics at up to 60 frames a second the new isp does real-time lighting estimation this stuff is amazing that it happens on the device in the palm of our hands so I want to show you some of the work that developers are starting to do with AR apps on iPhone 8 but here's one example it's a game Warhammer 40k free blade from pixel toys and now use the photo mode to bring the free play night into the real world and play it right where your friends are standing around you here's another from Major League Baseball's advanced media team they're enhancing the app that out with a art kit so when you're at the game you can hold up your iPhone and see real time player information and stats so on top of the guys kind of cool I can't stuff it down that's a cool he's a art kit with this out to actually superimpose the map on top of the sky as you're looking at it around you this isn't some generic sky this is the sky around you [Applause] so now we want to show you a sighting AR out right here live on stage playing on an iPhone ad it's from Directive games this is a new startup based in Shanghai spawned by developers who have worked on some of the biggest franchises in gaming so please welcome at Lamar CEO and co-founder of director games at Lee and that AR Stephanie's kind of impressive earlier the summer with the introduction of a arcade Apple changed gaming forever what we're about to show you is one of the world's first competitive multiplayer games designed to be played entirely in augmented reality shout out to attend the mistakes for the super chair in the game players battle their friends in real time either online or around the table in the same room my friend and co-founder on that is preparing a match for us where we play the rebels against the dominators what's really cool is that they are kit the metal tool on the new iPhone we are able to experience games in an entirely new way since players are able to view the game from any angle our content has to be incredibly detailed with the power of the new iPhone an unreal support for metal - we are able to render the entire level on screen and amazing 1.2 million polygons while also allowing you to move in close to really appreciate the high visual fidelity I just look at those 4k section gorgeous now shall we go into the game AR allows us to use our position in the real world to gain a tactical advantage just look how long but as moving towards this cave lining up his target this is something that would have been hard to do which makes it soon it's like you're not just controlling the game you're in the game another awesome addition to the experience is spatial audio if you go close to the action the sound increases and if a solid object gets between you and the action the sound is occluded perfectly well the stereo speakers this is truly amazing that's kind of cool it looks like we're getting it pretty hard dare I say magical yes the foil to protect our heroes now let's lean fire on our enemies but post it to their base I get ready for the fatal blow with our super wet oh the duck ship is there did you take it up to the same time what you just saw is an amazing evolution in how games are played and experienced thanks to the combination of bayer kick and metal 2 on the brand new iphone we can't wait for you to play it look for the machines on the absolute this month exclusively on IRS thank you guys I don't think this iPhone 8 is is everything there will be some X or addition but don't think this is the only next time drill I'd be very surprised let's talk about Wireless they're just saving it for the end we've once said that the future is Wireless boy we rewrite that's becoming more true than ever before with iPhone 8 it supports LTE advanced for fast networking connections bluetooth 5.0 for the latest accessories of course it supports our great beloved air pods and the beats X headphones that use our w1 chip and the new Beats Studio threes as well and now with iPhone 8 but it's glass back or enabling the freedom of wireless charging big fan wireless charging use it all the time woman it makes a simple thing we do this every day we use our phones in the day and we charge them at night off and on it's totally by our bed stand in our homes or our hotels and words can't describe just how much nicer is to just put it down and pick it up whatever you want to choice a you there for years nothing to plug it in say well again gonna want to do this by your bedside I don't want to do this in a cafe or restaurant as they start to support wireless charging I want to do it in an airport so you can top up your charge before you get on the next flight and perhaps the best use case of all in your car you can get into your car wirelessly connect and start using carplay put your iPhone in the center console and it's charging all without ever having to plug in a cable again yes what makes this possible yeah Nate plus why was charging with Qi and she is the leading openness wireless charging standard and we hope to help chief by increasing adoption of it in creating new use cases for it thank goodness it's not proprietary good jobs airports cars have started to build and support for qi wireless charging and the work with iphone a beauty companies are offering cheap charters and those that are chief certified should all work with iphone 8 and we've worked with some developers are creating cheap charges and we're gonna offer them in our stores and online for our iphone 8 customers like this one from Mophie and this one from Belkin so that's iPhone II it's a new generation of iPhone it improves on everything we love about eyes I told you guys not Iike it's not everything technologies from the glass and aluminum design to the retina HD displays the new a 11 Bionic chip it's there designed for AR apps like no phone has been before a new single and dual cameras and support for the brand new photo lighting effects in portrait mode and wireless charging now iPhone 7 came in these three configurations starting at 32 gigabytes what really happened to your iPhone 8 it's gonna start with twice the capacity at 64 gigabytes and of a second one at 256 gigabytes and the price will be six hundred and ninety nine dollars iPhone 8 plus will have the same two configurations 64 gigabytes and 256 gigabytes and it would be priced starting at $799 will be able to pre-order them yeah there's definitely gonna be another iPhone as well and they'll be available later on September 22nd and we can all upgrade to iOS 11 starting on September 19 so that is iPhone 8 I like to turn it back to Tim [Applause] iPhone 8 a new generation of iPhone and a huge step forward but we're not stopping there what did I say we do have one more thing pulls out the Steve Jobs one more thing though pulls it out we have great respect for these words and we don't use them lightly our teams have been hard at work for years on something that is important to all of us the future of the smart phone the first iPhone revolutionized that decade of technology and changed the world in the process now ten years later it is only fitting that we are here in this place on this day to reveal a product that will set the path for technology for the next decade big words [Music] yep like like we said like we said and he's called the X and as expected this is iPhone 10 it is the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone and to tell you all about it I'd like to invite Phil back up bill book is fired out in a hole leak he never raises his bull I can imagine there are a lot of people at Apple that didn't get much sleep last night preparing for this is this this is so exciting and it is all screen it is beautiful to look at it is incredible to hold the display fix edge to edge talk to bottom it goes into each corner where it follows the tight curve of the design it's glass on both the front in the back using the same super-strong formula as iPhone 8 the beam is made from a surgical grade stainless steel it's both durable and polishes to a beautiful finish and look how the glass and the stainless steel fit form a continuous surface from front to back there has never been anything like it it's engineered to be water and dust resistant at a microscopic level comes in two beautiful finishes space gray and silver each has incredible depth in a pearl essence to the color in the glass iPhone 10 has an all-new display it's called the super Retina display super maintenance amoled for our quality and responsibility and wonder does it easily work really quite a breakthrough in mobile displays start with the super Retina display is five point eight inches on the diagonal which will be done same size as the galaxy s 86 by 1125 resolution that's over 2.7 million pixels there's 458 pixels per inch now this is the highest resolution and pixel density ever in an iPhone it's remarkable how this larger display can be packed on the phone that fits so comfortably in our hands the super Retina display uses OLED technology this game's first OLED display great enough to be in an iPhone traditional OLED displays have had great benefits like high contrast and resolution and no backlight means you can make them thinner but they came with trade-offs and brightness and rich colors and color accuracy at least compared to our retina displays but the super Retina display overcomes all of these deficiencies and lives up to all that we expect from an iPhone display in addition the new super Retina display she Samsung more neatly though those vision and HD more nuts it has an incredible a million to 1 contrast ratio there's the best color accuracy it integrates our unique 3d touch technology right into the display and like iPhone 8 includes true tone now all this innovative super Retina display technology is great but it's the point of it that matters and the point of it is to enable an entirely new experience that's more fluid more intuitive so let's start with a simplest thing how do you wake up your iPhone 10 well certainly you can raise to wake just like before but now you can also just tap on the screen and it wakes up now with the display going edge to edge and top to bottom bottom there's no more home button now this is an important part and a big step forward in the iPhone user experience hmm something we use hundreds of times today for so many tasks is an opportunity to rethink how iPhone should work and how we can make it better so now when you want to go to the home screen you simply swipe up from the bottom you go home it's that simple it's that easy it's incredibly smooth and once you do it for the first time you'll know there's never been a better way he and it works the same way across the system you're running an absolute like mail and you want to go home what do you do you simply swipe up from the bottom and you go home you can not intuitive so much nicer now the same fluid gesture also works for multi tasking so if you're in an app and you want to multitask you just swipe up the bottom you pause for split second and you're a multi tasking and then you can tap on any app and jump right to it we also use the home button for Syria so how are we going to do that now well of course you can just 
oh my goodness I love to receive a nondescript box like this one things are about to get exciting I happen to know what's in here it's a prototype captured a ton of attention on Kickstarter some stickers those aren't stickers those are business cards the CEO let's just get back please ah the world's smallest phone this thing is unbelievably small the zanko tiny t1 world's smallest phone you know I've covered plenty of phones world's small as this and that this has to be smaller than those sync contacts and music with your mobile phone mono color screen voice changer three days of standby time does have Bluetooth built-in it takes a nano SIM and it can store 500 contacts that's right it has a voice changer you can be a man woman child old cartoon young optimist duck robot Evie a whatever that means wall-e rap man and rap woman well this just got a lot more interesting let's see how small this thing actually is whoa that is unbelievably small it does not seem real holy it looks like it has a speaker on it too on the back there SIM card goes in the side here this thing makes a nano-sim look big smaller than my thumb about as big as an SD card about as big as a coin smaller than a small-sized bic lighter much smaller than a ketchup packet barely more than two pieces of gum it's tiny a micro USB cable to charge it up oh and a sim tool this little guy is around fifty five bucks and at this moment you're probably thinking who is this for what is I mean it's obviously a novelty thing is for people who have all kinds of tech pull this thing out at a party and people will be amazed you make a phone call on this people's minds are gonna be below the buttons are way smaller than my fingertip there you go Jack what do you think about that that's a pixel two XL I mean obviously they don't do the same thing but holy smokes just dwarfed oh there we go we got the time we got full battery life all right I'm gonna put my sim card in I'm gonna try to make a phone call what do you say looks like I have message let's give it a shot well what's your phone number did you guys hear that that's kind of nice I think it's ringing this is so bizarre oh wow kind of a loud speaker hey man you sound alright in here really I did not expect to have any kind of call quality here yeah you too man and loud feel like a secret agent right now leave your phones at the door sir I'm like no problem this thing's in the sock you like to go for a jog you need to maintain the contact maybe you don't want that whole experience you know what I mean maybe you need something more discreet should I try the magic voice okay well I'm gonna we're gonna switch wills gonna come in [Music] all right so obviously a novelty item to begin with it kind of adds to the novelty factor you want to have a little fun with it but when it comes to other productivity stuff like texting you can imagine that's gonna be a nightmare and for calling it worked surprisingly well what what are you talking about that little guy could fit right in there you could get a full-fledged phone for 50 bucks but you can't tell anybody it's the world's smallest as a novelty item as a gift for somebody who has absolutely everything there's no doubt this is gonna put a smile on their face
