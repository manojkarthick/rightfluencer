hey guys it's Emma today I thought it would be fun to give you a little tour of my house a couple things before we begin so my house actually was featured in her second book a beautiful mess happy handmade home so you can see it there and some of you have maybe already seen it a few things have changed so I thought it would still be fun to do a tour but if you see anything and you're like oh I want to know more about that a lot of it's in the book also some of my rooms have been on the blog so if you see like a piece of artwork or a rug and you're like I wonder where that's from then you can check the blog and see the room tours and check the bottom and there's credits and hopefully you can find what you're looking for okay so first room this is my living room so I thought I'll just show you some of my favorite things in each room or like some tea guy why's that have been on the blog so this room my favorite thing is the bookcase it's so big I love it and one thing I love about it is the shelves are adjustable so you can make them taller or shorter so we were able to fit our TV into the bookshelf and I love that because sometimes I feel like living rooms the focal point becomes the TV and I like that you know obviously we watch TV Game of Thrones is about to start back up guy on my TV but I don't necessarily want it to be the whole focal point of my living room so you get to kind of enjoy this bookshelf I recently put the books in color-coordinating so we just sort of silly they're actually it's actually really hard to find books now I keep standing over here and like looking for a certain cookbook or whatever and trays I can't find it don't remember what color it is I know but I just like how the colors look a DIY over here that you can see is these quote bookends those were pretty recent DIY that's on the site and I'm really loving them they're kind of fun another fun thing is over here on this fall I have a fireplace and we made this tiny little gallery wall it's not that small but it's smaller than this other one I'm about to show you and I have some pictures of me and Trey and just some kind of like graphic elements that I added so that was fun and a new addition to the room over on this side you can see my big gallery wall now that one seems tiny right so this one has lots of different artwork in it some of its kind of personal like that sunflower one is something I made when I was a child and my mom framed in gave it to me for Christmas this big one is actually my mother and she painted it of herself I think she was in college or just out of college she's a pretty talented painter and some DIYs over here is this coffee table which train I built and it's on the site so you can check that out if you like it recently we made this little side table and it's not a project on the blog it was just something really simple that we made because I like to keep all my magazines so yeah that's my living room some funny things one you can see this child gate over here oh how fancy that's what we use to keep our dogs out of the bedrooms when we're gone because they have a dog door so they can stay in this area and also this nice little doggie bed over here very fancy but our dogs like it so it's pretty much always out so we come over to this side of the room you can see these side tables that were on the sides and I'll show you this little area this is our back door you can see our dog door it's orange it goes into our back yard one thing I love over here is this coffee cart use that a lot as you can probably guess this artwork with the spoon and fork was on the site some time ago like two years ago I think and that little pug guy that's something that Katy Shelton made me is gun boy and I just love it I love that its tongue sticking out okay new room this is my dining room it's smaller maybe some people would call it a breakfast nook I don't know one thing I love and here is this table tray and I made this it's just wood and then it has pipe legs one thing I love about it is before we had this one we had a table that sat for people and a lot of times we would have two couples over or a few people and we didn't know if it at the table and it was the bummer we'd end up sitting on the couch with our plates trying to not spill so we were like okay well this space is never gonna have like an 8 seater it's just not big enough but we made this table of certain shapes so that we would be able to seat six people and that's been pretty good another fun thing in here is this pegboard my dad and I hung this up a few years ago and it just I liked the look of it but also my kitchen I was pretty full I have a lot of kitchen gadgets maybe too many some would say but I use them all so I figured hey but um this pegboard helps me have more space so have it it used to be black I recently painted it white and then I have these little vintage letters up top that say potluck just for fun and then this is my kitchen I love my kitchen I'm here a lot so one fun thing you probably know right away is my shelves are painted kind of funny and I really like them they're half white half black and they have this kind of stenciled what was literally since old look to it and then on the inside open this one we can see it it's really organized just kidding but the shelves are green so has that fun pop anytime you open one of the drawers there's also stainless steel countertop and that is not a DIY I had that put in sometime after I moved I had to save up for it and I love it it's one of my favorite things because you can cut right on it you can clean it really easily so I love the stainless steel this is our guest bedroom this is the last room in the house that I actually finished so it still still feels really like fresh to me because it's kind of new but it's not new but it's kind of new anyway some of my favorite things in this room so one big piece of the room is this headboard the sleepover headboard you can't see it right now but it lights up these little holes have Christmas lights in it and this was a DIY that we shared on the blog two or three years ago quite a while we built it with our dad and it's really cute sometimes I'll I try to remember I'll light it up before a guest comes so when they come in it's like oh but then no one ever leaves it on usually beyond that so it's gonna last a long time for that reason probably we actually had guests this past weekend and I didn't turn the light on but another fun thing is this little corner shelf this isn't something we shared on the site it's because it's really simple you can immediately tell how it was made but it's something that I put in and I just basically wanted to not take up too much space because when guests come over they usually have suitcases so I was trying to keep it kind of sparse in here but I also wanted to put these branches in here because I just think they're cool so I built a shelf that could accommodate them so that's that area magazines try to change those out and then over here on this wall a couple of fun things this is probably my favorite feature in the room it's these little globe guys and they have lights see if I turn one on for you just to show you for kicks you turn them on like that so they're fake but so they're safe you can turn them all on and they're really cute turn them off cuz I'll forget another cute thing is this giant poster this is just a picture I took of Trey when we were in Costa Rica and I used the ax beautifulness actions to do this kind of double exposure look and then I printed it at Kinkos it's just called a blue print print actually I guess it's FedEx now they're not Kinkos anymore and then this trunk is something that Trey already owned before we got together and we kind of gave it a little makeover together so it's sort of the first DIY type project we ever did together as a team and so I really like it we'll probably keep it forever it's pretty cute and we store like extra blankets and stuff in there that's pretty much it that's the guest bedroom this is our home office I caught our home office we don't usually work in here it's kind of more of a music room craft room sometimes workout room just anything that's not the guest bedroom where our bedroom pretty much happens in here so I call it a home office okay so I'll show you the different areas over here is where Trey does all of his music he plays guitar and sings and currently I don't think he really has a band project but he's wanting to start one up and he's really talented so I hope he does and I'm really biased - of course he also sings with our friends they are in a band called mixtapes and these things with them it's a 90s cover band and they're awesome and I love watching them and I love watching him do that so that's this music area over here is more of the desk area and this is a standing desk that we built and shared on the site and I love it and really glad that we did that it just makes the room still feel pretty big but you have plenty of space to do things or just clutter it up like we do just put a bunch of stuff in here some prints up here and that's really fun my favorite piece is this one my mom painted it for me I told her I wanted something black and white and made that we're just showing off my mom's work a lot okay say I like it okay over on this side of the room this might be one of my favorite features in the room did I say a favorite feature I don't know I really like this one though it's our macrame curtain and it kind of hides clutter but you also can see things which is good because all sometimes forget what I put up there so I like having that and it also kind of adds a texture to the side of the room but it's still neutral because it's white I just really like it bla bla bla I love it keep talking about over here is my sewing crafting area so lately I've been getting a lot more into sewing so I've been using it for making like headbands mostly I'm still new so you know not too advanced projects but my next one I've got this dress that has a broken zipper at a second hand and it's a really cute dress so I'm gonna replace the zipper and that's one of my next projects and then I just have storage for different things and this is an old dress that Elsie designed from the red velvet line back when we had it a couple funny things in this room I left this bench out I was gonna put it up and then I was like now I'll just let them see we work out in this room so here it's this weird pinch in the middle we also have free weights all around the room and a lot of times we'll forget and Trey or I mostly Trey will leave a weight and we'll walk in here and you can't see it because of this carpet or this rug so we'll end up like subbing our toe on it like so that would be my the one drawback to this rug is you cannot see clutter so you end up hitting your toe a lot but I still have this rug it's kind of psychedelic and fun okay that's the home office here's our bedroom this is the last bedroom in the house you saw the guest bedroom in the home office already so this is where Trey and I sleep I recently kind of rearranged it so it feels a little bit bigger and I just kind of pared it down I've been going through like a simplify your life phase for like the last three months it's been good so a couple fun things in this room recently we added this picture to the front of these drawers and I love it I'm still kind of thinking about painting these white parts black just I don't know why cuz I like it white I think I just have like a constant need to like change little things I don't know but I'm kind of thinking about it but at any rate I really like it Trey really liked how it turned out this is where he stores most of his clothes so I'm glad he liked it some other fun stuff is up here we have our marriage certificate and I like that we have it displayed somewhere in our house I've been thinking about doing some kind of project with it not the actual I probably like take a picture of it and use that or something but I'm not sure what I'm gonna do yet but I have it on my mind so I'm gonna do something another fun thing is this artwork that's kind of behind here and it is all photo strips of our photo booth from our wedding and we use the party-party app to make that as well as our Canon printer and I really like how it turned out right now it's kind of hidden but it's also really busy so I feel like that kind of works else have this vintage lamp that was from the old red-velvet store and over here I keep this is my side of the bed over here I keep my lap desk Trey has his on his side and some magazine storage if we go over here you can see these fun hanging lamps they're both vintage paddle for quite a while and I like them a lot although I don't really use them they're kind of more just decor but I like how they look and also these little necklace hangers this one was actually made and gifted to me from Kinsey who does sincerely Kinsey she used to work for us that they read well with the store and that's how I got to know her and she gave it to me for Christmas one year and then I made this one it's just knobs that you add to a piece of wood and this piece is kind of weathered and that's how I hang all my necklaces so that I don't forget that I have them and remember to wear them sometimes another fun thing is this little guy he's our wood transfer and yeah other than that it's just kind of a plain bedroom so if there's anything you saw throughout this tour that you're curious about or you want to know more you can either check out our book happy handmade home or you can check out the room tours that are on our site a beautiful mess calm thanks for letting me share my house with you guys you [Music] 
hey guys it's Emma you probably know my sister Elsie and I from our company beautiful mess what you might not know is that a beautiful mess almost didn't happen for years we really struggled we were very in debt and behind on our taxes see we had a lot of ideas but we didn't know how to into a profitable business then we changed our mindset we found a new method for approaching our ideas this didn't happen overnight in fact it took us years to go from very in debt and almost bankrupt to a million-dollar company and we learned a lot of lessons along the way we really want to share those lessons with you maybe you too are struggling a small business owner or maybe you have an idea but you don't know how to turn it into a profitable business we'd like to help we'd love for you to check out our new eCourse start small dream big you can find more details on our website a beautiful mess calm 
oh sorry we were just checking your Instagram I'm Elsie and this is Laura and we love Instagram who doesn't right the only problem is with keeping photos on your phone is that you never print them out and the other issue yeah I would have my phone with me today but I dropped it in the toilet this morning so it's drying out in a bag of rice as I speak so to fix this common problem of never printing out your photos we decided to start a challenge so here's what it is you will print out as many Instagram photos as you can and you will put them in an album simple right and then share it on Instagram using the hashtag my beautiful mess so we can leave you comments so we're starting our challenge today everywhere in the office is the crime address yeah even Trey it's crazy though there are some people that have never printed out a photo from so we're gonna fix that today so join our challenge and we're gonna start our party 
I'm going to show you a half double crochet stitch you begin with taking your hook and doing yarn over once and inserting it into the top of the first stitch bring the yarn through so that you have three loops of yarn on your hook yarn over and pull through all three stitches to show you again yarn over insert your hook pull the yarn up so that there's three loops on your hook yarn over and pull the yarn through all three loops and that is a half double crochet stitch 
hi everyone I wanted to give you a peek into my new house so I'm gonna give you a little tour of it and it's completely empty and exactly how I bought it so you get to see it from this place and then see what I do with it moving forward this is my front door I'm planning to someday paint it and I'm probably gonna change out the stained glass somehow or I might not if that turns out to be too hard welcome to my kitchen this is the first room that you walk into from the entryway this was also probably the room that I'll spend most of my time in the kitchen so it was a big feature for us this room when we were house shopping because it's really big it has probably like twice or maybe even three times as many tours and cabinet space is my current house so which is nice because there isn't a pantry so there should be plenty of space though with how many comments we have so one downside to this house that we noticed when we were looking is the countertops they're really nice but I don't like them I wish that every house came exactly how you wanted it like oh it already has the counters I want it's already painted the way I want everything's exactly how I want that would be perfect right but that doesn't always happen so for us probably one of the biggest and most expensive updates we're going to do to this house is get new and I actually have some of the samples I've been getting a lot of quotes because like I said it's expensive so I'm trying to make sure that I make the best choice and a cost-effective choice and we're also looking into when we do rip out these beautiful countertops we're probably going to donate them to Habitat for Humanity Springfield which we worked with last year when we did the habitat house so hopefully someone will get to use them just not me another thing that's gonna change in the kitchen is we're gonna paint all the cabinets guess what color white it's gonna be nice for me because I photograph a lot in the kitchen so it's gonna be really bright and feel really big this is one of two living areas in the house it's directly by the kitchen so I'll be staring into the space while I'm cooking most of the time you'll see over here there's a giant fireplace I love this fireplace this was one of the things I loved about the house when we looked at it I think it just I mean it looks huge and it's just beautiful and I'm really excited to like put a Christmas tree in this area sometime this year another fun thing we're gonna do in this room is Trey owns a piano that has always been at his parents house because we haven't lived in a space that was big enough for it yet it's pretty big piano and it's gonna go on this wall so we're gonna have a piano in her house which is pretty cool he plays piano a little bit but that's pretty much this space will have a couch I'm gonna paint I get to start that tonight okay that's pretty much the space I'm really excited about this space because this is gonna be my new home office this wall right on the other side is that big fireplace that we just saw so we're just on the other side of that there is no door so it's gonna be an open office area but I'm gonna put my desk and my sewing machine and my file cabinets with all our papers and then I'll have these windows so I could photograph things in this area little things and there's a door right over here to our backyard and we're gonna put a doggie door in there so my dog can probably sit at my feet and do all day while I'm in here typing or doing paperwork or whatever this is our dining room so when you're in the office if you turn around this is the space you see so these four areas that I've just shown you are kind of one big room is what they feel like when you're here but they're different spaces they're gonna be decorated differently so we're showing you all of them but this one's the dining room I've never really had a formal dining room and I guess I still don't because it doesn't technically have its door or walls maybe but it still counts because I can fit a big table in here so I could maybe host friendsgiving or Thanksgiving here we're just a bigger party and back here we're gonna be turning this into the liquor cabinet and also dishes and cups storage so that'll be fun and different that's really about it we'll probably get a new light fixture that's it for this space so this kind of dark cave life room is the second living area and we plan on using this space to have a TV and couch and maybe a couple chairs so this will be where we watch movies or our favorite TV shows like Game of Thrones I try to mention that every video the own thing that's really happening in here is we're gonna paint but other than that we're just gonna move in our furniture and probably change out this fan light fixture someday maybe I'm not very invested in this room yet there's three bedrooms in this house and two of the bedrooms look almost identical this is one of them this is probably gonna be Trey's music room so where he can record and just play music and the whole house although that's okay something to do and then the other bedroom will be a guest bedroom where I'm going to try to lure the Larsen's back as much as possible this is the master bedroom so this would be where we sleep what I really love about this space it has these really pretty kind of double I guess French doors that open up into an outdoor patio space that I'll show you next there's also really big closet like biggest closet I've ever had and I'm so excited about it currently we have like a coat rack coat closet and just clothes I'm just like we have that many clothes but still it ends up kind of we have all four seasons here where I live so end up with more clothes than you think it's winning and then we also have the master bathroom which is really interesting it has a double shower which I've never had before so that would be cool and a double sink we get our own sinks so fancy excited about that too so if you go out the French doors in the master bedroom you'll find yourself in this space which is kind of an outdoor patio that's covered by this canopy and it's screened in so you can escape the mosquitos at our current house we have a hot tub so we're gonna be moving that here it's actually going to be right behind you and then you also have kind of a view of our backyard which i think is small so not too much mowing but still big enough that our dogs are really going to enjoy it we have to get a fence put in so we're doing that later this week

beautiful nest calm you 
hey friends it's LC from a beautiful mess and today I am partnering up with my friends from Canon to share with you a fun DIY to create a gallery wall this is my breakfast nook and as you can see my walls are kind of boring I haven't come one single picture in my house yet and today I'm gonna change that so let's get started Cheers a variety of frames to fit your wall so I just measured the length of my wall and then chose different frames and different orientations to fill up the space the next is to add the campaign hardware to your frame this is going to make it look much more custom and more expensive and add a fun touch of bold next it's time to print and frame your photos I did a combination of personal photos from some recent vacation and some photos that I bought online from Aero Napa the last step is to just hang your photos and I styled mine in the couple plans because I wanted it to have you know a little bit of color besides just black and white and then Jeremy's dad always says the most important part of our project is to step back and enjoy your good work 
hi I'm Emma and my sister Elsie and we are really excited today for two reasons first we're gonna make an awesome cocktail for you all so it's our wait can we start over cuz you should say this is our first cocktail recipe ever okay our first video recipe okay hi I am this is my sister Elsie and we are really excited for two reasons first this is our very first video cocktail recipe ever also this is our favorite cocktail recipe that we've ever made it's a really good one it's called toasted coconut margarita so the first thing you're going to do is toast some coconut for your rum so just take half a cup of sweetened or unsweetened coconut we like sweetened and put it into a dry pan no oil and no butter and toast it on medium high heat until the coconut becomes brown then once it cools a tiny bit you can smash it up with your fingers to make smaller pieces you really need them to be pretty small so that they stick to the room and then the next thing you do is you will need some honey and we're gonna paint the outside of the room with the honey so you just get a little bit on your paintbrush and always make sure to do the outside of the rim and not the outside and the inside because you don't want too much of your garnish going into the drink so a couple of questions you definitely want an unused paintbrush right yes don't use the paintbrush that you're really using for painting just have your own separate kitchen set or if you don't have a paintbrush what else could you use just you can use your finger oh so I sometimes do that um if you're you know running low on supplies it's it's just a little bit more messy but it works just as well and do you always line glasses with honey or do you ever use other things so if it's a garnish like the toasted coconut then honey is best because it's really sticky but if it is something kind of light like just regular salt all you need is lime juice or water or lemon juice so next I'm gonna roll it in the toasted coconut and this is sticking really well so that's good but don't feel bad if you have to go around a couple times to get it on there really well but totally normal sometimes it just sticks better than other times so that's how it should look and we'll get you set that aside and use it in a few minutes awesome so next we're going to make our recipe and we're gonna do it in a shaker so the first thing you need is one ounce of cream of coconut so if you've never used cream of coconut on you ingredient it's a funny thing you have to shake it kind of a lot sometimes more than 20 seconds so you can actually hear it go from a solid to a liquid and it makes you feel really cool yeah yeah and if you don't get it all the way then it'll still be kind of solid and it won't really get it into your drink so if you see that that happens shake it more and try it again so I got one asset fat and then you need one and a half ounces of tequila you can use any kind as long as it's not super smoky oh you don't want a smoky coconut drink okay it could be a little bit smoky but you don't want it crazy and then next you need one ounce of Cointreau this is a really good orange liqueur and you can also use triple sec if you already have it on hand or if you find this kind of hard to find cool it's perfect for margaritas though so I always keep it just in case so if your margarita person it's an ingredient to have okay next we're gonna squeeze in some lime juice so it's three ounces but I usually just use like and a half lime halves because I don't like measuring and you can just squeeze it right into this one's really tough right into the glass I like your little juicer though Thanks these are actually really handy I really like this missing full wine bowl it's my favorite part oh that one's super juicy then just one more this is probably my favorite part of this drink because it is so limey it smells so good really good yeah okay and then the next thing we need is one ounce of simple syrup and simple syrup as the name suggests is very simple it is simply sugar in water so to make your own simple syrup just combine equal parts of sugar and water in a pot over medium heat and stir until the sugar completely dissolves once it cools you have simple syrup so you don't buy it ever again if you put a lid on your jar you can keep it for a couple of weeks so it's really nice to have for drinks and you can use it for like lemonade and stuff like that too or coffee yeah coffee okay so the next thing we need is three ounces of coconut milk I'm just gonna pour it in go for it why measure when you could not measure you really have to measure once you've made this one once you'll kind of know what you're doing and then a splash of half-and-half this is really for the color it makes it a lot brighter white plus who doesn't know half and half mm-hmm and then just shake it gotta make sure the top one right really more shaking and you can serve this with ice or without also you can make a blended version of this if you just want to blend all the ingredients instead of shaking them I think that sounds awesome yeah that would be the one our mom would love that just depends on if you usually order your margaritas on the rocks or frozen okay oh wait one more thing the lime garnish and then we're done so we're gonna do a cheers to our first cocktail menu ever we did it you 
I am here today to share the special features of the new a beautiful mess and killing more camera bag we've been working on this bag with Kelly for about a year or so and we're so happy and it's finally coming to light so our inspiration for this bag was the vintage style satchels that we love so much we have tons of different brands and tons of them and we love them we wear them all the time but none of them fit our cameras so we asked Kelly if it would be possible to make one that could fit a camera and a laptop bag and she said yes so that was our inspiration for getting started on this bag so we designed this bag to have a lot of different functions first of all it's definitely a camera bag you can fit your camera and then at least two other lenses it's also a laptop bag it can comfortably fit like a macbook pro or kind of a smaller laptop it can also fit your iPad and we put in a special kind of bonus feature that it has a diaper pad so it can also be a diaper bag so I'm going to take you on a little tour of the outside of the back first so it has these cute straps and this is just kind of the fun design of it looks like a vintage style satchel Kelly's logo is right here and these straps are actually adjustable so you can get more space for your bag and it'll still buckle so the front of the bag has this big pocket and then inside of it you can see there's spaces for credit cards and then there's also a really good space for your phone and then on the back of the bag there's one big pocket this is where I usually stick my iPad or my journal and then our favorite thing about that outside of this bag is that we designed it to have two straps that it comes with the first one is leather that matches the back color and the second one is this cute striped campus fabric we got to choose three colors for the camera bag so I picked Brown kind of a camel brown color because that's just my everyday preference for a bag color it matches most of my shoes and things like that and then Emma picked black because same reason it's kind of just her everyday bag color and then we both love this kelly green color for kind of our fun color now I'm going to show you the inside features of the bag so first of all this is the diaper pad it matches our lining and just kind of a fun little bonus if you don't have a baby maybe save it for later like I am or just you know give it to a friend and then it comes with a lens holder this is really nice there uses this all the time for her giant lens so it's just kind of a cushion holder for your lens and then you can see there's space back here for a laptop there's our logo beautiful mess there's a zipper inside of here so you can fit like kind of little things that um maybe lipgloss or something and then this comes out but you can see this is where there's these adjustable velcro pads and you can fit your camera and then a couple of lenses really comfortably in here I love them so customizable because we kind of carry different a different assortment of things depending on if it's a vacation or if it's a day at work real quick I want to show you a couple of ways that we pack the bags so I really have three main uses for this bag two of them that I use so the first one is just every day at work you can see here I have my laptop I have my camera and then all the little things that I take to and from from my house to work back and forth that I want to have throughout the day every day the next way I pack this bag is for a weekend trip so I take this with me often on trips either a road trip or when I'm flying it's a perfect carry-on you can stick it under your airplane seat really easily I love that and I actually recently took it on a trip work this was the only bag I took with my purse so really stuffed stuff in there but it all fit so the last way to pack that we wanted to highlight is the diaper bag Sarah's been using this for a couple of months as her diaper bag and you can see here how she packs all of her essentials thanks so much for taking this little tour with me of the Kelly Morris a beautiful mess bag if you have any questions email Kelly at Kelly more bag comm and visit Kelly more bag comm to shop for our bag 
now I'm going to show you a single crochet stitch with your foundation chain in your hand take your hook and insert it into the second chain from the hook bring the yarn through that chain stitch so that you have two loops on your hook yarn over and pull the yarn through both of those loops on the hook and that is a single crochet stitch I'll show you again insert your hook into the chain bring the yarn through the loop so that you have two loops on your hook yarn over and pull through both of those loops and that is a single crochet stitch

we often get asked why DIY and I think there's a lot of answers to this question you know one reason is because making something can add another layer of meaning to a project for example for the past few months we've been busy prepping for my wedding day my brother designed our invites my sister designed my wedding dress and countless other family and friends have been involved in so many of the projects for creating for the wedding I will never forget all the help that I've received from them some of my very favorite memories from the season are times that we were working on projects together just making things DIY has made my wedding day more special and meaningful to me I'm really excited to share all the pictures with you you 
now I'm going to show you a double crochet stitch it's similar to a half double crochet but with one extra step you start with a yarn over and insert your hook into the top of the next stitch pull the yarn through so you have three loops on your hook on your hook you yarn over and pull through only the first two loops so that there's two loops remaining on your hook yarn over again and pull through the final two and that is a double crochet stitch I'll demonstrate again yarn over and insert through the top of the stitch pull the yarn through yarn over and pull through two yarn over and pull through the last two and that is a double crochet stitch 
hey guys today I'm here to share a fun little video called hand lettering tips with Elsie hand lettering is something that I'm super passionate about and I use almost every single day in my job I'm self-taught and so today I want to teach you some of the things that have helped me to practice and become better at hand lettering over the years for him lettering I like to use lots of different tools but today I'm just going to focus on three main tools but they really love the first one is the sign pen the second one is the color brush and the third one is the aqua pen tip number one try lots of tools so when you first start hand lettering you want to try every different tool available just to see what you're most comfortable with and you might be surprised which ones are the most fun for you to use my favorite is the pen I use this 90% of the time and I like to have a lot of different ways of pens from something very fine to something that's very thick like this sign pick this color brush is really cool it's kind of an ink filled brush pen and it gives this really cool messy effect to your lettering this OP wash pin is a really cool watercolor pen and what I did was I filled it with some paint and then also some water and then gave it a little shake and now you can see it's giving this really fun watercolor effect the more you experiment with each medium the more you'll find your comfort zone and kind of your thing so just try them all out until you find which one we love the most tip number two imitate type you love so this is totally not a tip about copying but rather it's a good way to practice so here I have this book that I love called away at home by Jason grant and it has some really great hair lettering in it so I'm just kind of imitating it with my awk wash pen and seeing if I can get something similar and it's not totally similar but it's a fun challenge and it's helping me to kind of step outside what I would naturally do and try to imitate something I think is cool tip 3 practice makes perfect and I'm putting perfect in quotations because we all know that nothing's ever perfect but the more you hand letter the more comfortable you're going to become and the more beautiful your hand lettering um I still have good days and bad days right definitely something that I don't know you just keep practicing forever every time I'm on an airplane or on a conference call I just write my name and write the Alpha bit over and over and that's really the best tip that I can share with you so I hope you've had fun seeing a little bit behind my processing pan lettering and I hope you have fun practicing thanks closed 
hey guys this is Sarah from arrow and Apple and I'm going to give you a little bit of a tutorial on the curves tool in a color story so let's get started so first of all I have already edited this picture and I just edit it with curves so I'm going to show you a little bit before I got there I'll just kick share of the beautiful Laura government then you get one pretty flat pretty boring back to it ba-ba-boom alright I'll show you how to get there let's go back to our before and then we'll just hit the curves tool and get started so what this line is this represents all of the tones of the image as it is the bottom left is going to be your the darkest part of your image the top right is going to be the lightest part of your image see you move it and you can tell what part of you're really effecting if you ever want to go back just to make sure they're all the way to the corner and then this middle dot is the middle the mid-tones in your picture you move it around just to see what you're affecting don't ever be afraid to move these around because you can always put the back where you got the you can always redo it it's not a big deal alright so we're going to make this image maybe a little bit lighter and we're going to do a photographer's call an s-curve so did you know you can put more points on this line so just by touching it we're going to do that this point is going to we're going to bring it up because anything above this line is going to make it lighter and anything below is going to make it darker so this is going to affect the lighter part of the image and we're just going to make those light even lighter and then this point right here we're going to pull it down pretty drastically so it's a little bit more drama so that just really adds a big old bump of contrast you can even like kind of pull the highlights down to make it a little more muted if you want to I wouldn't go too far because then it gets real let's see let's do a little bit Federation is key and then to make a film look you would invest with the darker parts appear much so you take the sky and pull it up a little bit and it's just going to like the darkest parts of your image which is you know with that not don't does will never like that if it looks good the only thing is I just want to make this image a little warmer so you have these separate channels of curves to manipulate to with the red to the red channel the opposite of red of cyan which is like aqua so if you go up it's going to be more red down it's going to be more Sonia I'm just going to boost the red just a tiniest a little bit and I am going to make this the shadow is what you can see in her glasses if you pull it up the shadows are going to be more red you pull it down they're going to be a little more cyan and I think I want to cyan personally so we'll go to the green so opposite of green is magenta I'm not going to do anything with this because I like these tones how they are in the image if you pull it up it'll be green down up you magenta and you can really go to town with that if you feel like it and then the blue is opposite of blue is yellow so this is what I came here for and I'm going to pull this down a little bit warmer and I think that looks pretty eh okay so go back to my all this is what it looks like I like it so I'm gonna the checkmark and we're done so let's look at the before and after again before okay boom for after kind of obsessed with before and afters but I feel like I'm not the only one so anyway if you have any questions about the curves tool I'd be happy to answer them and thank you a beautiful miss for having me

hi I'm Anna Rose and Amir with a beautiful mess you ever tried to put on false lashes and you totally mess them up or you couldn't get them on because your hands are shaking well today I'm going to show you some great tricks to get them on and we're going to use these wonderful false lashes putting on fake lashes is pretty easy but I'm going to show you some ways to make it a lot easier I like to use the strip lashes I like the ones from our dell these are the 120s these are a demi and I like a demi because they're a little bit shorter and they're not they're a little bit more natural sometimes the lashes fake lashes the strips can be really long and they're too long for your I most of the time when i'm using the mountain put on a client i'll cut them down to make them fit your lash line these tend to be pretty good on almost everybody i don't really need to cut these if you find that they're too long you can still snip off one of the corners the inner corner of the outer corner to make them fit appropriately but i like the Demi's because they're really natural and easy and they work on almost everybody so the first thing you're gonna do is you're going to pop the lashes out of the little case I like to bend it like that like in half to make it easier to get them out you like to pull from the middle instead of from the end so that you don't curl the lashes up on the end and then what you're gonna do is are going to take the lash and you're going to kind of wiggle it back and forth in this little horseshoe shape what that does is it bends the band that it's pretty easy to set them right on your lash line and then you're going to take some of your glue this is duo this is like standard-issue lash glue it's a pretty good one I like the dark tone and I put it on my tray like that and then you're just going to take the end of your brush like liner brush or whatever and put it on washes on the band just a little bit not too much you're going to let it dry a little bit you wanted to get tacky you don't want it to put it right under your lashes when they're still wet because it will slide around and be weird so we're going to keep kind of massaging it into this little horseshoe shape and blow on it a little bit so that it gets a little bit dry and then when it's dried out a little bit you're going to the first thing you want to do is stabilize your elbow you know what your elbow up here when you're trying to put your lashes on you don't want it out here because you're going to your hands going to be shaking it'll be really hard to get it in the right place so put your elbow on a table and then grab a mirror and you're gonna put your mirror I like to your what make sure you're looking down so I like to look down into the mirror so I can put it below my face and then stabilize your elbow and all you're gonna do is look down and just set the lashes right on your lash line you just kind of press it in to your lash line just like that your lashes should go on very last after all your makeup is done after your liner is on it should be the last thing that you put on if you work around your lashes if you put them on first you're going to end up with some crazy eyeliner and some crazy mascara so I like to put them on last and make sure you get your finger and you really press down on the corners of your lashes once you get them on there so that the corners are on really good so once it's on there really press those down make sure they're on there good and then if you want you can add an extra coat of mascara too what's what we call marrying the lashes together so you can add an extra coat of mascara to blend your natural lashes with your false lashes but I like to have a coat of mascara on their first on my natural lashes this crazy mascara just put them in your color now your lashes are Allen wasn't that easy do you like that little tip I think the most important thing is to stabilize your elbow if you like my beauty tips you can check out more on a beautiful mess calm or on my blog a scanner is calm 
okay I'll see you from a beautiful mess and today I'm going to give you a tour of most of the rooms of my home where I live with my husband Jeremy and our dogs Dali and Sookie so the first space that I have to share with you is our entryway and these are the stairs that lead upstairs and this um horse stencil is a DIY that we did I think almost when we first moved in I still love that and then over here I have a brand new DIY these wall art pieces are something that we just did in the last few weeks an entry table flowers everything's painted gold and some books that I love and so that's my entryway and I'll turn around next and show you the other side so funny story um one day I started painting this door yellow and I promised Jeremy that I would finish it that day because I have a horrible habit of starting a project and then not finishing it for months and halfway through the day I started getting food poisoning so it really was halfway painted for like a month anyway I love our yellow door and also I have these hanging planters and this planter set which this is just something that I found at a flea market and I didn't paint it or anything it's just a place for cactuses and I like how it's round and then this artwork up here is by my friend Elise Blaha okay now we're moving on from the entryway into the living room and this is really one of the reasons why we even bought this house I love how giant the windows are the windows are huge and the light is really good in here so I've taken lots and lots and lots of pictures in here and it's been really helpful for both my work and just like having a happy attitude every day when we wake up so over here we have a bookshelf it's metal it's actually kind of a display case I think it's vintage I got it at the flea market exactly this color I didn't paint it or anything and I really like it I think I will keep it with me through our next home and everything it's just one of those unique pieces that you find once in a while and when you see something like that you have to definitely get it because it might be gone the next day this is our hanging chair I actually waited for I think two or three years to find one of these vintage and every time I found one they were broken or just didn't seem very secure so I just bought this from Amazon because I just kind of didn't want to wait anymore it's been hanging in our home for almost three years now and it is super secure our contractor is kind of like a giant person and he sat in it no problems people always ask about that but it's not scary at all to sit in and for adults kids love it I would definitely recommend it if you're thinking of getting one the only thing I would say is have a professional install it so moving over here this room has been through a lot of changes since we first moved in I think I first started off with a yellow couch which I ended up selling to a friend and then we had another couch which Jeremy ended up taking to a studio and last year for Valentine's Day we ended up buying this Gus furniture Gus modern I think couch and we love it it's the perfect fit for this kind of oddly shaped room and I'll definitely keep it through our next home and everything so I'm really happy that we finally tried a sectional this artwork up here I made myself just a quick DIY to fill the space but I have ended up loving it these brass planters people always ask if these are DIY but actually I found them at a flea market so they are vintage I think we could do them as a DIY though and I'm going to try that in the future anyway my dad helped me restoring them so that they had the varying height and let's see this rug is from Anthropologie it is it's just one of those things it took me a really really long time to pick the perfect rug for the room and I've been super happy with it it was one of those bigger investment pieces but totally worth it to me so I'll show you the other side now so opposite from our big front window this is our fireplace and it actually is the same color that it was when we moved in we didn't even paint it it just happened to be white almost everything else in our house was a bright bold or dark color and we painted it um this is a piece of artwork my mom did it's one of my very favorites these pictures are a DIY we did a couple years ago I think it was like ten ways to display photos but you can see it's still going strong um and it really lost it I think I'll leave it there semi forever and then these um gold planters I just did this past week and I really like finding plants that kind of look like hair like for this horse I just think that's really fun and then this is something I made in my pottery class a few weeks ago and I just haven't had a chance to hang it yet I'll show you the dining room next okay so this is my dining room this is one of the first DIYs that we did when we moved into the house our eight person dining room table it's been definitely one of the most practical and well-loved DIYs that we've ever done I still love it actually around Christmas this year I decided to paint it white just to kind of give it a fresh look and after we had added the brown wood to the walls I felt like it needed a little more white in the room we used rust-oleum oil-based paint to paint this and that's also what we used to paint the piano a lot of people think it's kind of bad to paint a piano but I think if you love and appreciate something more after you've painted it then it's okay for you to do um next thing I wanted to share is I made this bark art it's just done with the rust-oleum spray paint instead of the brush on pink and this was one of the first things we did when we moved in and we used it as a bar cart for several years and then recently I switched the bar stuff I'll show you it's in the new other dining room and this is being used as a coffee cart and I think it's super cute so this room was one of those rooms that took a lot of different stages to get it to where we were happy at first it felt too boring then it felt too sterile and eventually we got it to feel cozy and welcoming and just how we wanted it so don't be afraid to take your room through a lot of different stages just because you've put in some effort doesn't mean you have to call it done so this is my kitchen it's a pretty small kitchen but I feel like we've done the most we possibly could with the space when we bought the house it was painted red it was very cramped and claustrophobic there was a extra countertop covering half of a door and now we've kind of opened it up and lined it and brightened it and made it a lot more functional so I have these sorry so I have this collection of glassware there are all shapes and sizes I didn't have enough storage to have a ton of complete collections so I kind of just have like three or four of each glass and I'm happy with that this fridge is from Big Chill and it's one of the it was kind of like Jeremy's present to me when we moved in and it's definitely like more expensive than a plain fridge but it's something that will last us a long time and it just I feel like it's kind of the highlight or the feature of this room we decided actually my mom talked me into going with a double oven and it has been a huge help and I've really enjoyed having it so I would definitely recommend that we did quarts for the countertops and they're pretty much indestructible so that's something that I would definitely do again in another house or recommend and then over here we have this Clementine wall and this was one of the DIYs that half way through I was sure that it wouldn't work and I was I thought it looked like sponge paint and really bad but then when we got to the end of it and I set back and look at it I couldn't be more happy with it it looks a lot like wallpaper and it really has kind of like given the kitchen a lot more personality so this is our kitchen next we'll go to the new dining room so this is a room that's been through a lot of changes and in its current form I have shown it on the blog yet I am about to shoot the room tour and I think it'll be the last one that I have to share for the whole house so when we first moved here we were working from my house and this was our studio so it had um crates and then there was the insect's wall and there was a couch down here and it was a completely different space but after we moved my work away from my home it kind of became an awkward nothing room that was filled with stuff even though we couldn't close the doors so people would always see it and it looked bad but we just didn't know what to do with it so we finally um furnished it and made it into a real working room so I'm really proud of this so this table is from West Elm the first time that we use this was around Christmastime and we had the big Christmas dinner here at my house for the first time and it was such a special time for me and I was really happy that we went ahead and did this because there was way too many people to fit at just one table so it's been great for parties and everything since then over here is a wine table kind of like a buffet Josh made this for us custom for our space and I love how it fills up the room and it's one of my very favorite furniture pieces in the whole house now above that um we moved our bar stuff in here kind of minimized the bar stuff that we kept at home because we just had way too many bottles that we weren't using so I took some to the studio and minimize that and above that is um a collection of art prints and a couple that I made one that Rachel made me the weaving actually and I really like how the colors coordinate and so that is this well the last spot in this dining room is our record station and then we did this artwork in record frames it's just photos printed out in record frames this was a recent project on the blog love having the record player right here in the house because we have a pretty open floor plan in the downstairs and the kitchens there are the dining rooms they are the living rooms there so right this is right by the entryway so when you walk into the house it the music will fill up the whole downstairs so that is the end of the downstairs part of our tour and next we're going to go upstairs where our bedroom is okay so this is at the very top of the stairs and there's this funny little landing thing it's like it has two stairs and then it just kind of stops and there's a window there and it's one of those things where when you buy an old house which ours is I think around like 1885 something like that um then there's always something really weird about it like we have a lot of windows in her closets and things like that so um anyway on the first day or maybe the first week we had clothes on her house we were here just like painting and stuff one of the neighbors came over and kind of came into the house was chatting us up and stuff and she said can I see the stairway to nowhere and I was like yes so I brought her up here and she was talking about it like it was like a big deal or something and we were like okay okay trying to figure this out lots of people have different theories about like it used to be another stairway into the attic or they just raised it up so that people could walk on the stairs we really don't know why it's like that um so anyway she told she was talking about that and then she continued to say um there's only two houses in Midtown that are haunted and one of them's mine and I was like what's the other one and she didn't say anything and she left so that was our awkward beginning so opposite from the honeycomb shelves is our hallway for the whole upstairs this is where all the bedrooms are right there is the kid's room which I'm about to show you here is our bedroom and then back here in the back is a room that we've used in the past for a guestroom and now we're using one downstairs and then a bathroom back there I'm not going to show the bathroom but it is in our book happy handmade home if you want to see it it's just not you know bathrooms are weird so anyway these bookshelves I really love they been super useful and I was intimidated about having enough books to fill them up but um and I guess I don't quite have enough but oh well it's um something that I really love in the home and then behind me I have painted our wicker chair white as many of you suggested on Instagram and I really loved it it freshened it up and um it's kind of I feel like it has a more 60s vibe now so that is the Holly so next I want to show you our playroom this has been one of those like kind of weird unexpected rooms when we first started writing our book our editor asked us if we could include a kid's room and we were like whoa Adolphe kids so no not really and she was like are you sure and I was like actually you know what I have an extra room in her house I have lots of nieces and nephews so we decided to do a playroom and it has been used so much actually Penny's coming over as soon as we finished shooting this video to play so it has been a huge blessing we really love having it and um I'll show you all the different elements we have kind of this little IKEA chandelier this art wall that my dad helped me install this was these are all projects that were featured in our book happy handmade home the sorry the blanket that has the roads on it super cute and fun to play with that's from the book I'll definitely keep it forever though and then we put a swing in pull on my microphone and we put this swing in and when we had it hung by our contractor you have to help find the studs or the beams in the ceiling and so there's only like two places he could put it so I ended up putting it kind of close to a window it hasn't been a problem at all but we do always supervise the kids when they're playing in here and we tell them like it's not like an outdoor swing like you don't like really it's more like a chair so anyway this is our kids room and it's been so fun to have this room for the kids to play it's basically a babysitter when there's more than one kid it takes care of everything Julie oh that pigeons are furni pounds that they could bite you and get you lost and then kill you and how you can get sad like this so this comes to the last room in our house our bedroom and it is a really hard really weird bedroom to explain because it's actually two rooms that are connected together you can't close the door you see in and out at all times and we decide to make it our TV living room so kind of like a hangout area and then the smaller part of it is where our bed is and it's the bedroom so it works really well for us we love it and we probably will never live in another house like this again so it's been fun so the TV is here over here we have I have my makeup and stuff this is where I get ready in the morning so I have scarves um flowers bracelets lipstick just like oh these are all the different things and here's our closet this is definitely one of those classic examples of like nothing's perfect there's no door I wish there was a door on here and we first moved in I think I thought I'm going to get one that matches it and fits and everything but I just never did and this curtain isn't even really like what I would pick for this room but you know it is what it is and that's what it looks like back here I have my perfume and then some little Polaroids or sorry not Polaroids photo booth photos from different special occasion ends in our life and those are really special to me this a plush sculpture Katie made for me for my wedding so it's one of our most special treasures this chair is actually from our book happy handmade home and we painted it with the gold gilding paint that we love to use it's super smelly but it works great over here we have our couch inner loveseat and art wall that I did I think a year or two on the blog so I'll link back to that and this space is really pretty much set up to be comfy and I'll show you my favorite thing about our dining room table it's from West Elm but it opens up so you can have you know a snack or whatever and it helps us keep the dogs away from like popcorn and stuff so this is the living room side of our bedroom and I will show you the other side next okay so this is the last room in the whole house this is the bedroom side of our bedroom and this is dresser we have a Debbie Carlos print and then over here our bed this comforter I think it's of stock now but it was Lily Wallace for anthropology and then have this new paint color that we put up pretty recently these hanging bases were a project in our book and so our bedroom is really pretty simple and pretty small but it does the job and I'll show you a shot where you can see kind of from room to room but it's just kind of one big open space and we're really happy here so that's the end of my home tour thank you so much for coming along with me I'm sorry I was a little bit Spacey at some point if I think I just need to eat lunch but it was fun doing this so um yeah you 
everyone happy weekend today we're going to show you how to make your own iron-on transfer t-shirts so tray made me a quote t-shirt recently it was from my favorite YouTube video I said not my chair not my problem and I wear all the time so we thought this would be a fun gift idea and really easy to make at home we actually already made a few you can see behind us I made this one honey you baked with a favorite quote from one of my favorite 90s movies if you know that movie you can leave it in the comments on our YouTube I made this one for tray cuz I bake get it mm-hmm I don't know but today we're gonna make one for our friend Katie so let's get to it step one so the first thing you need to do is design your quote so you can use Photoshop or microsoft word or pretty much any program where you can type out text and then it's very important that you flip it because when you iron it on it will reverse the image so it needs to look backwards to you to start yep next you need to print it out and it's always good to do a test print just to see if you like the sizing before you waste any of your awesome transfer paper agreed quote and then the next step is to trim so you will just want to trim with kind of a rounded edge that helps it to really adhere to the t-shirt and not to peel off when you're wearing it so just go around the design and keep it as round as possible I like your scissors thank you so orange so pretty there my scissors I'm teasing her a mom loves orange I love orange orange is everything right step 4 prep your surface you want to use a hard surface and we're protecting our desk with this extra piece of scrap fabric here under our t-shirt so once you have that ready you can put your t-shirt down get your iron nice and hot different iron-on transfer papers will recommend different temperatures so check yours for what it recommends usually it will say no steam though so get the water out of your iron no steam so just iron your shirt this way we won't have any wrinkles before we put our design down step 5 put your design down get it exactly where you want it you don't want it to be angled unless you want it to be angled know you can get creative and now we're ready to iron depending on the size of your design will change how long your iron time will be we're gonna iron for about a full minute and as you iron just gently move your hot iron around on the design this will help to ensure that you don't burn your design in any one spot last step I lie your design to cool a little bit before you try to handle it otherwise you can burn your fingers once it's cool I've already done that once it's cooled peel back your design and you want to do this carefully because you don't want to pull your design up while you do it just work slowly to reveal your masterpiece looks good alright do you want to tell them the quote it says I'm not like a regular mom I'm the cool mom we made this for our friend Katie and if you remember what movie it's from leave it in the comment and you can see more details about this project on our blog a beautiful mess calm you 
now I'm going to show you how to make a granny spring you start with a slip knot on your hook and then you chain four insert your hook into the first chain and do a slip stitch to create a loop chain three and then do two double crochet stitches into the loop chain one and do another three double crochet stitches in the loop repeat that again two times so chain 1 and double crocheted 3 one last time chain 1 and double crochet three chain one and connect to the first chain three on the other side with a slip stitch that's your first round for your granny square for the second round start by chaining four and in that first space right beside that chain do two double crochet stitches chain one and go to the next open space by skipping three double crochets there and it end do three double crochet stitches chain one and do another three double crochet stitches in the same open space now you chain one and move into the next open space in the first round by doing three double crochet another space and another three double crochet these are the corners that create the square shape chain went again and moved to the next corner open space by doing three double crochet a chain and another three double crochet chain one and go back to the first space you did those first two double crochet stitches to finish the last corner so that's three double crochet stitches you can chain one and then do a slip stitch into the top of the chain on the last stitch there that's the second round of your granny square to start the third round we're going to chain four stitches and do two double crochets in the same open space that the chain is in that's the first part of your corner you're going to chain one and move on to the next open space on the side with three double crochet stitches then chain one and move to your corner with three double crochet stitches again chain one and another three in the same space chain one and move into the next open space with just three double crochet stitches chain one move into the next corner with three double crochet stitches chain one and another three double crochet stitches you can repeat this for the rest of the way around to complete the third row in your granny square once you've done the final three double crochet stitches in the last corner you'll chain one and then insert your hook into the top of the chain in the first stitch so you kind of hat did that chain four at the beginning there so you can't one two three four and put your hook in that fourth chain and bring the yarn through and complete it with a slip stitch and that completes a three row granny square 
hey guys today I'm here to teach one of the most asked questions that I get when it comes to scrapbooking which is how do you resize your photos for your scrapbooks so there are a lot of little things that I want to cover in this video today I felt like it needed to be a video because I think that it's easier to learn some of this stuff visually so some of the stuff that we're gonna cover general tips for resizing how do I get photos that are the perfect sizes for all my different pocket pages in my scrapbook with just one printer also how to create a grid so like this kind of thing where it's one big photo but cut into different pieces that match perfectly for pocket pages and then a little bit about why I love my wide format printer because I've talked a lot about how I'm obsessed with it and how I use it all the time but I want to get into the specifics of why it's pretty much the only printer I need a little bit about printing full-page photos printing collages and how to add text to your photos before you print them out so ready here we go alright so I'm just going to run you through the general basic process of how I resize my images in Photoshop before I print them so the first thing I'm going to do is click file and new and I am gonna create a new image that is 13 by 19 inches and then 300 pixels and the reason why I pick those things is because 13 by 19 is the size of my printer paper so this is going to be the full size image that prints out and then all of the other images on top of it can be the actual size that they'll end up being when they're cut out does that make sense hopefully that makes sense okay so this is the size of my printer paper I always just stick with 300 pixels or 300 dpi because that is just the standard size for good quality so I picked out a couple pictures ahead of time and so on this one I want to make this one a 9 by 2 because that's the maximum size that you can print out a photo or that's the maximum page size for the Messi book so I'm gonna crop it and then I'm going to check the size and see it's still on 72 pixels image changes up to 300 and then change this to 9 so it's 9 inches by 12 inches click OK and now it's the perfect size but I'm going to turn it to the side before I copy and paste it so I will just push edit and then cut and then I go over to this new untitled image and I push edit and then paste and then I just move that to where I want it on the page that looks good and then that you know once this big 13 by 19 paper prints out then that picture of the pink house is going to be 9 by 12 inches perfectly so I can just cut it out with my scissors and just throw it in the messy book so next I'm going to take a couple more pictures and resize them different sizes for the different page protectors in the book so with this one I think I want to do a 3 by 3 inch square so I'm just going to crop it and then again I'm going to go to image size and just check it to make sure that it's the 3 by 3 inches and 300 pixels so that it all matches up ok so that one going to cut and then go over to this blank image and paste it and then I kind of I like to just line them up where there's a little bit of space in between each one a little bit of white space so that it's easier for me to cut them out because I usually use scissors just because this big printer paper is a little bit too big for my paper cutter so I'm getting rid of these images from before and then I'm finding here another one from Charleston one of my little friends and then this one let's say I want to make this 3 by 4 to fit a different page so I'm going to move it so that I feel like it's the perfect crop of her cute little face and then I'm going to check the size to make sure it's what we want it to be again there it's all resized and then I just click this tool to do the cut and paste action again so sometimes when I'm getting them ready in a new on a new page like this I'll do like one row of three by fours and one row of three by threes just so that they're not like if they're like this then they're kind of uneven so I just kind of keep them separated and if you plan out ahead of time you can fit the most possible images on your page obviously because you can figure out how they're gonna kind of Tetris together it's another cute picture I'm gonna say I want to do this one 3x3 so I'm just gonna crop it and change that size and then I'm going to outline it and paste it this one all put in the 3x3 row and then on this last one I'm gonna try something a little bit different I'm going to add text to it so down here I can control what color my text is I want it to be white and I'm just going to start typing on my picture I have a font selected right here and I think I'm just gonna put hashtag TGIF what that would be a little bit bigger yeah then I'll just place it where I want it on the image and then flatten that and then just like all the other photos I'm going to go to the image size and make sure that it's 3 inches by 3 inches and then 300 on the resolution and then I'm going to cut it and paste it cool and then put it into its spot so if this were a normal day where I was trying to get as many pictures as possible I would probably fill the entire page I hate wasting paper so I always try to plan it out so that I have the most possible images on each piece of paper and then if you're happy with what you have all you have to do is flatten the image make sure it's all the way fun and then we'll just print it out with our Canon printer and I will show you next what I do so a couple of quick tips about printing your photos so first of all always make sure to select the highest quality this is a really big deal because if you accidentally leave it on low quality then your image could print out with like lines on it or if the color ever seems really off that's probably what the problem is the second thing is to always make sure and select the correct type of paper that you're using so we always use this Canon Pro luster paper it's my favorite paper because the color is beautiful and it's matte it's really easy to write on the photos with a pen so make sure that you select the correct type because if it's wrong it can really affect the quality too and then the last thing is to always make sure that you select the correct paper size because if I started like I actually did start printing this at first and it was the wrong paper size so the whole image was on this tiny little part of the paper just because I had selected the wrong size so always watch out for those things okay so after you have printed out your images the next thing to do is to cut them out so they should already be sized perfectly so if you feel comfortable with a pair of scissors you can just go ahead and cut as perfectly as you can right along those lines that's what I usually do because I'm I just like scissors I don't know but if you have a giant paper trimmer which I don't but if you do you can stick this in the paper trimmer and do it that way or another option is if you're just nervous about not getting the perfect lines you can take this with a ruler and an exacto knife and trim it that way so just go ahead and trim these out and then you'll be ready to add them to your scrapbook next I want to talk about how you make a grid out of one photo this is actually a lot easier than it looks so all that you do is take a 9 by 12 image because this is um these 3 by 3 squares are adding up to be 9 by 12 inches total and so you would just take this and you would just cut the 3 by 3 squares out of the whole thing so you could just use a trimmer or an x-acto knife and just cut the whole thing into 3 by 3 squares you don't have to print it in any special way okay so for this last section I just want to talk a little bit about why I love my wide format printer so a wide format printer is a printer that prints larger than a standard size so a standard piece of paper is eight-and-a-half by 11 which if I use that it would be too small to make a full page nine by twelve photo for my scrapbook also if you use like a twelve by twelve scrapbook you would need a wide format printer to get a photo that big so a wide format the one that I have is thirteen by 19 inches and I do use it to print these big photos but I also use it to print all the little photos just how I was showing you earlier by resizing them and putting them all on one giant piece of paper and printing them out so some of the things I love to do with it one is to make these giant photos so large full-page photos are a big deal to me I like to mix them throughout my book and to me that's what makes a beautiful scrapbook is having some really big photos I just feel like it shows them off and kind of highlights your favorite moments another thing that I love about having a printer this is something that you can't do just by printing your photos that like I don't know the grocery store or whatever is that you can make these collages so this page is made completely out of Instagram photos from our honeymoon and I resize them all small and then collage them all together on one big piece and then printed it out together so I love being able to do that because sometimes you don't have one amazing photo from an event but you have a bunch of special little moments and you can put them all together and it really creates a beautiful page and then the last thing that I love to have a printer for is to add text to my photos before I print them out so like for the entry or sorry the what would you call it the first page of this one year our first year of marriage scrapbook I did some handwriting on it with my tablet and then I also did some writing with a font and I did all of that in Photoshop before I printed out the image so those are just some really cool things that you can do with a wide format printer so thanks for going with me through all of the information about my wide format printer and how I print my photos for my scrapbooks if you have any questions at all just leave them for me in the comments and I will be there to answer them 
hey friends is LC today we're starting the video tour of the new a beautiful mess studio and we're starting with my very favorite room the kitchen let's start with the before we almost didn't even look at this house because the kitchen was so dark the wood walls cabinets and ceilings made it feel really really small here's what our kitchen looks like today we decided to knock out the upper cabinets and replace them with open shelving we were able to reuse the bottom cabinets by painting them and replacing the hardware instead of linoleum we chose to go with water-resistant wood flooring this is one of my very favorite updates we knocked out the window above the sink and replaced it with another window almost twice the size we swapped the location of the fridge so now there's more space we added a sliding barn door to the bathroom we painted the wood ceiling white which really brightened up the room we skin coated over the countertop to give it the look of a cement countertop this was one of my very favorite DIY projects we gave our tiny bathroom a makeover to match the vibe of our kitchen thanks for joining us for a quick tour of our kitchen we'll have more video tours coming soon 
[Music] today I'm excited to share with you my hallway makeover and it features one of my favorite DIY projects ever a giant family gallery walk so here is a quick before and after you can see it come a long way in the two years we've owned our house from huffing through carpet entry walls and now having light whitewashed wood floors and runners and now school photos so I took all my old photos actually only like two or three of the photos on the whole wall are newish they're mostly all old from either before I was born or my husband and my childhood so to make my gallery wall I bought 24 inexpensive frames that already had maps in them and they fit 8 by 8 size photos and then for the finishing touches for my hallway makeover I just added a few colorful things like some runners this really pretty textile and a couple of plants and it was done 
today we're gonna do one of my very favorite things in the whole home decor universe it's a one-day makeover the thing I love about one-day makeovers is you can wake up to a space that's kind of okay and by the time you go to bed it looks amazing it's a great feeling because it happened so quickly and it's a huge transformation so the space I've chosen for us to work with today is in my German I call it the awkward room we're kind of making it into a second dining room and for the last couple years it's been kind of a nothing space so we just got this awesome custom record shelf and it holds records but as you can see I really didn't have enough records to fill it up so I need to do something with that and then also when you kind of zoom out and look at the space it really needs some artwork or something above it it's just kind of on a plain blank wall and it just really feels unfinished so those two things are what I'm hoping to tackle today and give it a really good transformation before and after happiness so this project is probably going to take me all day but in about two minutes you'll get to see the before and after ready 
they're gonna be really shocked to see the mess it's a mess is it am i smiling at all because I feel like I'm about to smile every time the same succulence I'm almost done with my crocheted dog sweater so if I can just get lovers to pose in that it'll be ready mm-hmm yeah yeah no so emoji potholders cutie kitchen cute nice partner which emojis though uh heart eyes dancing girls you know drill important good something with emojis we definitely need okay yeah we haven't done that in like two days all right we're gonna just try to put one great doing great doing really good pretty good Percy well over the last few months we've spent over $20,000 on succulents succulents you don't have to say it you don't have to say the cream I don't think I can yeah we'll say a curse later I don't know let me see what it look like before okay all right so do it like this I'm trying to just pull it backwards it just makes me really nervous I see that gun sorry I can't look not it's completely it is the fake it is the toy a toy gun everybody get on the ground get down get down please you ready I'm ready sorry

hey I'm super excited because today we have bought a new home in Nashville Tennessee and Jeremy and I are going to use the roar of our whole empty house the first room is the entryway I'm super excited to redecorate this space we're thinking new wallpaper new colors and we really like the marble tile that's already here so I think we're gonna keep that this is the room that we call the front living room it is super dark right now which we would like to brighten it up a lot we're planning to use this as our TV living room and use a projector screen instead of a TV and also I think that this dark fireplace is something that we're gonna change so several of my friends have made the comment to me that our house kind of has Virgin Suicides vibes which is a movie that's supposed to be set in the 70s this house was actually built in the 70s and hasn't really been updated that much since then so we're excited to give it a fresh new look this is the kitchen and I think this can be a pretty good before and after so I'm pretty sure this lattice is going to have to go and we're thinking of solutions for what we can do here this is our breakfast nook we plan to put a small round table here this is a doorway that goes down into the basement which I'll show you in a little bit and I'm really excited about these built-in shelves because I'm thinking a rainbow display of glassware the sunroom is one of the things that initially drew us to even look at this house in the first place it's super bright and airy and we're planning to take out the carpet paint the brick white and add a lot of plants to this room this is the dining room I love how there are doors that look out onto the sunroom right here and we are planning to keep our dining room table from our previous house maybe put the wine shelf over there and try some new wallpaper in this room this is the main living room this is what you see when you walk through the front door and so we negotiated the crib piano into the house whenever we were putting in our bid and everything and Jeremy super excited about that because he was a piano performance major in college so this room we're planning to probably paint white will see the curtains are kind of not my style so we're gonna do something more airy and I am still very confused what kind of house we're gonna do in this room so right off the main living room is this small little library and I thought this would be the perfect place for my office so I'm excited to paint these shelves and put my desk here and kind of have all my supplies and things that I use everyday like my printer and computer in one spot this is the main hallway where the bedrooms and most of the bathrooms are so there are five bedrooms in this house and they all go one two three four five down to the master down at the bottom of the hallway so I will show you quick shots of each of those and we are going to do a couple of guest rooms and we're excited about that because it will give an opportunity for like my parents to come also I mean tray or also during a penny at the same time so here's a quick shot of each room down the hallway this is the real one jury room it's right next door to our linen closet which is whoa linen closet right this is pretty cool I has a sink here's where the washer and dryer will go we're thinking maybe tile on this wall and I'm trying to figure out what we're gonna do with these countertops this is our master bedroom the windows in this room are huge which I love the lighting is really pretty and I'm keeping the bed we'll go here and then right behind you is the master bathroom we've never had a double sink before in any of our houses so we're kind of excited to both have our own sink and then there are closets back here to store all our clothes and some cool drawers that I'm still trying to figure out like what we're gonna put where but I feel like there's a lot of good storage in this bathroom cool so that's the whole upstairs Jeremy is gonna take over now and show you the downstairs where we're planning to renovate it into his new studio hey it's Jeremy when we were house shopping we were looking for something with either an outside structure or a basement that could be converted into a space that I could use from my studio so this is perfect this right here is a basically a closet and I think we're gonna pull this wall out to about here make a vocal booth then on the other side there'll be another small room maybe for power pants or something and then over in this area over here will probably be a drum room and then the rest of the space out here will be my control room where I'll have my computer and all my preamps any keys and everything out here is what is currently a garage but we're going to convert it into kind of a sitting room so we'll put up some drywall we're gonna replace the flooring maybe with some kind of hardwood there'll be a wet bar and then I think a bathroom and we're going to replace the garage door with a glass storefront basically and I think that's about it you'll see a lot more detail well you know once we figure out what we're doing with the space but thank you so much for watching the video 
hey guys I'm here today to do a video walkthrough of our 2016 planners so a lot of you have requested to see a more thorough in-depth view of inside of the planners and so we thought we would do that in a video today so first of all I'm going to show you each planner and what makes them unique and then I'll show you the insides of it and how it's organized where they're all the same so there are three cover designs this time and the first one is this really pretty psychedelic looking marbled pattern it has gold foil on the front and on the side this is 2016 and then the elastic band is bright yellow and then the inside is also bright yellow so this is just like I don't know actually I have a hard time picking my favorite I think that this is my favorite I'm going back and forth though um so anyway I'll show you the inside in a minute but that is option a we kind of tried to make one for every personality type so I try to think of different people actually on my own Christmas list whenever I designed these so the second one is designed to by my favorite painter luleå Wallis from Charleston South Carolina and it also has the gold foil 2016 on the front and on the spine and then it has the pale pink band and pink on the inside so it's just a more feminine pretty design and I'm really in love with it and then the third one is kind of firm or like cool girl I just learned this one actually with Elora in mind and it is bright white its shiny so it's actually kind of wipeable and glossy it won't get dirty in your purse quickly and then it has a handwritten 2016 on the side this is um I wrote this out with paintbrush and now it's with gold foil and then there's the black band and it's white on the inside so it's just super clean and they all three have gold spirals so the thing that I love about the spiral planner is that it lays flat this is the biggest upgrade from last year and it was the one thing but last year we wanted to improve was that some people said that their spine ripped apart after halfway through the year and also it didn't lay flat which always drove me crazy so we kind of upgraded this year's design and I love that so let's go through the planner organization and see what that's like so the tabs again this year are color-coded so just rainbow I just think that's fun and it makes it really easy to find the different months and then each month has the same contents inside of it a to-do list a month for you and then a week view where you can make notes each day and then there's a spot for notes at the bottom and then a spot in the back just to have random notes and just a little extra page and then so that goes through the whole year and each month has a fun little doodle also for the label of the month each one's different kind of fun and then different colors and then this is the stuff at the end of the book there is a month view where you can see the whole year at once year at a glance and I love that especially for key holidays birthdays and vacations just because that's the one thing when I'm trying to plan out my year and someone's like oh I want to come visit you in November it's like oh I think I had something and you can look really quickly goals for spring summer autumn and winter we're a huge about goal-setting it's one of our favorite topics to make goals and achieve them so there's a place for that and then dates to remember this is more like birthdays and you know special things like that and then a 2016-2017 I don't know what you call it mini calendar so you can see really quickly you know what day your birthday is gonna fall on next year or whatever and then some extra pages for notes and there are two sticker sheets in the back one is emojis and we tried to do ones that were kind of for different special occasions like I thought you know this one would be fun I could put for date night and this one I could put for a birthday or something like that or seeing my sister and then some fun hand doodled arrows they have these little patterns and to them that are handed old I mean and so these are really fun just for like putting in I usually use them on the big month view just to like label like vacation starts here and here or trips and stuff because that's a big thing that I'm always forgetting so anyway that's what the inside of the planner looks like and pretty gold spirals oh and a little bit about the size real quick before I go a lot of people have asked how they compare to last year because since they're spiral-bound some people assume that they were really big like if you've ever seen like the Kate Spade planners or something like that but these are actually still really small they're totally purse sized they're just a tiny bit wider than they were last year but almost exactly the same size I compared them I don't have my one from this past year anymore or I don't know where it is because I'm moving but I held them up and they were almost the exact same size and then the binding is a tiny bit thicker because of the spiral but really again almost the exact same size so these are our three options and I hope that you pick a favorite and pre-order them or sorry order them before they're out and then also they make great gifts last year I think I seriously ordered 12 of them and yes I still have to order them even though I kind of anyway that is my planner video if you have any questions please ask me in the comments
