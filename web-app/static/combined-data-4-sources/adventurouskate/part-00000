Day Six offline in Antarctica and today MAY be the day that we reach the Antarctic Circle! Eeeee!

Funny coincidence -- just seven months ago I was on the Arctic Circle for the first time ever. The destination? Oulu  Finland. The occasion? The World Air Guitar Championships.

Weird as hell  and one of my favorite festivals ever.. Day Five offline in Antarctica and I'm sharing this post because it did something I never expected -- IT TOOK OFF WITH YOU.

After I published this  readers started sending me pictures of themselves all over the world with champagne  prosecco and cava. It touched me SO much!! What do you like to drink when you travel?. Day Four offline in Antarctica  and what is pretty much the opposite of Antarctica? This lovely little island off the coast of Nicaragua and one of my absolute favorite destinations in Central America.

If you haven't been to Little Corn Island  GO SOON. It's changing very quickly.. Day Three offline in Antarctica and today I should be setting foot on my seventh continent! What an exciting day!

I didn't make it there until I was 33...but I'm a late bloomer in a lot of ways. Here are some surprising things I didn't do until I turned 30.. Day Two offline  still crossing the Drake Passage to Antarctica -- and here's my monthly recap. Oh  and book lovers need to read this one because I READ A BOOK SO AWFUL THAT I NEED TO COMMISERATE WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO READ IT.

Who has read All the Ugly and Wonderful Things by Bryn Greenwood? I found it horrific and irresponsible  a book that glorifies the sexual and romantic relationship between an adult and a child  and a poorly written book on top of that.

That  and everything I got up to inJapan  in this post.. It's day one of being offline in Antarctica  and at this point I'm crossing the rough seas of the Drake Passage. It's a two-day journey before we reach the Antarctic peninsula. Hopefully those seasickness patches my doctor got me are doing their job!

If I'm feeling okay  I plan to go to the lectures. One thing that impressed me is that so many of the scientists on this Quark Expeditions voyage are women. In fact  among the scientific/professional crew  women outnumber men. That's unusual for any group of scientists  and I hope I get a chance to get to know these ballsy women. Maybe even interview some of them for the site! Would you be interested in that?. This is it! It‚Äôs time to ship out to Antarctica with Quark Expeditions. So excited  I‚Äôm jumping out of my skin. And wearing my seasickness patch. HERE I COME  NEW PENGUIN FRIENDS! üêßüêßüêß

I‚Äôm going to be offline for the next 12 days. Talk to you again on the 15th!. Greetings from El Fin del Mundo! When people ride their bikes from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego  this is where they finish and collapse. So beautiful here!. Greetings from Ushuaia  the southernmost city in the world!

The plane views were ASTOUNDING. I wanted to reach out and rub my hands over the mountains. Rough  jagged mountains with pockets of snow. Much better than flying over the Alps!

Also  the mountains on the left are in Argentina and the mountains ahead/on the right are in Chile!. Oh God  I hope I didn‚Äôt forget anything.

Off to the airport! NYC-Buenos Aires-El Calafate-Ushuaia-ANTARCTICA starts now!

(Also  totally got my hair keratined yesterday so I look good for the penguins.). This is the scariest packing I have ever done.

I‚Äôm a casual packer. I do it last minute  throw in my usual skinny jeans and blazers and boots  and if I forget something  I just pick it up on the ground.

...You can‚Äôt do that in Antarctica.

I AM SO STRESSED THAT I AM FORGETTING THINGS ALREADY!!

I fly to Ushuaia tomorrow at 3:30 PM. So close!. I'm excited to share my first big post from Japan. Getting off the beaten path in Japan is SO worth it  especially if you've already been once before.

So here's where you go: Hokkaido  the northernmost island  in winter. Snow sculptures  hot springs  small towns  fresh seafood  all the Sapporo beer  and a dish called GENGHIS KHAN!. With Antarctica just 48 hours out (!)  I thought I'd share a post from the most remote place I've visited until now: the Faroe Islands. Mykines is spectacular!

I was the first blogger invited to the Faroe Islands back in 2012. What an incredible time. Then at a conference in Scotland in 2016  I accidentally ended up sitting next to their team at dinner and we reminisced about what a fantastic trip this was! I really want to go back.. Have you been following Justin Trudeau's visit to India? It's been drawing a lot of attention because he brought his wife and kids and they have been wearing traditional Indian outfits each day.

First off  I AM SO GLAD A MALE POLITICIAN'S FASHION CHOICES ARE BEING SCRUTINIZED. Hooray gender equality? (#NeverForget Obama's tan suit.)

I think dressing in the clothing of the country you're visiting is a kind and respectful gesture  especially for formal events. That's particularly true for a country like India  which has such a different and more conservative way of dressing. I myself haven't been to India  but I dress to blend in with locals wherever I go. Even when it means discomfort -- and wearing jeans in Cartagena in August is the definition of discomfort. Dressing similar to locals makes a big difference in how you're treated.

I do think the Trudeaus overdid it a bit  however. When you're a guest in someone else's country and you wear a different headline-making outfit every day  you're making it about YOU  not them. It's the same reason why you don't wear a flashy dress to a wedding. I think a lot of the criticism could have been avoided if they had a better stylist who dressed them in more typical  sedate  and understated Indian clothing rather than bordering on garish costumes for every day of the week. By dressing this way  I think it sends a message of "This is how Westerners think Indians dress every day" rather than "I'm dressing to blend in with you."

Sharing this news.com.au piece because it shows tons of different outfits.

What do you think? I'd love to hear your opinions.. Ten books into 2018 and two of them have set me on fire. Here is the latest: An American Marriage by Tayari Jones  published this month  which I chose from Book of the Month and which Oprah has since named her latest book club pick.

Celestial and Roy are a young married couple in Atlanta planning their future. That comes screeching to a halt when Roy is convicted of a crime he didn‚Äôt commit and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

They try to keep their marriage strong. Then they try to keep it afloat. Then things get worse.

And then Roy‚Äôs conviction is suddenly overturned  five years in. What now?

Sometimes you need a book to brutalize you  to strip you down and scrape you raw. This is the one. You could say this book is about the prison industrial complex and the dangers of simply existing while black in America today. But more than that  this book is about the choices we make and those made for us. The marriages within a marriage.

Pick this one up. You won‚Äôt regret it.. Travel burnout is real ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not just for amateur travelers. Even if you‚Äôre a very experienced traveler  it can hit you hard ‚Äî and in some cases  it can be paralyzing.

Here‚Äôs how to deal.. Antarctica is around the corner -- I leave a week from today! Currently doing some last-minute Amazon buying. On the list: sock liners  glove liners  waterproof pants  extra camera batteries and memory cards. I even rented a zoom lens and an extra camera body.

People who have traveled to polar regions or rural cold areas -- what would you recommend? My coat and boots are provided by Quark so I don't need to bring those.. Traveling around the world allows you to see your own country through a different lens. One of the most stark differences between the US and every other developed country is the amount of gun violence and the frequency of massacres.

It's not just a mental health issue. Plenty of other countries have mental illness and this doesn't happen there.

It's not just toxic masculinity. It's toxic masculinity and easy access to killing machines.

The one issue that differentiates the US from other countries is the lack of sensible gun laws.

But that's not all -- it's also the presence of money in politics  eased further by Citizens United  which is an American tragedy. So many of our politicians are funded by the NRA  an organization dedicated to keeping America's gun laws as loose and minimal as possible. Some consider the NRA a terrorist organization  and you know what? That's not far off. As they fight for domestic abusers and the mentally ill to have easy access to military-grade weapons  they are making it as easy for these terrorists as humanly possible.

Gun control is an issue close to my heart. It was the first issue for which I protested in Washington  DC  when I was a teenager. But after we lost those sweet babies in Sandy Hook and our NRA-funded lawmakers voted to DO LITERALLY NOTHING  I lost hope that we would ever be able to prevent these senseless deaths.

But it feels different this time.

The teenage survivors of the latest massacre at Stoneman Douglas High School are speaking out and organizing. With Trump in office  we are living in a new era of protest and action. This time  we might actually be able to get some sensible gun laws made. And it starts with using the 2018 midterms to fight any and all NRA-funded candidates.

I encourage my fellow Americans to take the following steps from Everytown for Gun Safety in removing NRA-funded politicians from our government.. This is one of my favorite things I've ever written. Looking back at my semester abroad in Florence in 2004  a time when I brought ZERO devices that plugged in (I rented a Nokia phone and used Internet cafes!)  a time before digital photography  a time when I didn't see the point of solo travel if you had so many friends around you...hope you enjoy it.. I‚Äôm happy to be back in New York but had a very scary experience today. Two homeless men got into a physical fight in my subway car. One was waving his belt (fabric with a huge buckle) and throwing it around aimlessly  almost hitting the passengers around him.

Let me tell you it‚Äôs incredibly frightening being trapped in the middle of that and being unable to escape. The passengers and I ran to the opposite side of the car but the men kept chasing each other back and forth.

God bless the passenger who tried to calm the men down. He might have saved us from getting hurt.. I LOVE this story. You guys know how much I love Finland and Finnish people  and this story is SO Finnish ‚Äî the Olympians are knitting to reduce stress  and also to keep them from having to make small talk. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

They‚Äôre making a blanket for the president‚Äôs kid. How cute is that?. I‚Äôm so excited to write new posts about Japan! For now  I hope you enjoy this one from 2013. It certainly holds up five years later.. I‚Äôm back at home  sitting on my purple couch! What a seamless journey back to New York. Turns out I feel INCREDIBLY well-rested and like today is a normal day  even with the 14-hour time change. Here‚Äôs how I did it:

‚ÄîNo caffeine 24 hours before my flight.
‚ÄîStayed up late and only slept 2:30 AM-6:00 AM.
‚ÄîFlight departed at 10:20 AM  but I didn‚Äôt go to sleep until 2:15 PM Japan time (12:15 AM New York time  my usual bedtime). Had my four-course dinner and a champagne (okay  two  the takeoff champagne doesn‚Äôt count). 
‚ÄîTook a melatonin 15 minutes before bed.
‚ÄîTurned on binaural beats for sleeping and went to sleep.

I slept FOUR FULL HOURS  then snoozed on and off another two. Woke up  had breakfast and a coffee  and I feel SO rested!! Maybe it will fall apart by the afternoon  but I feel like an evil genius for succeeding this much.. Japan  it‚Äôs been real. What a fantastic country.

Time to fly home in style ‚Äî on All Nippon Airways in business class. I hope you guys enjoyed my live coverage from Japan and are looking forward to the blog posts! I‚Äôm looking forward to writing them! Especially about the wackiness of Hokkaido in winter and the cool places I discovered in Tokyo this time around.

So glad to be home in New York in just 14 hours...

#experienceana #partner. The two things I‚Äôve enjoyed most about this Japan trip have been FOOD and SHOPPING. Today I ate at Bird Land Marunouchi ‚Äî because nothing says Valentine‚Äôs Day like going out alone to eat meat on a stick!

Bird Land is the first yakitori (meat on a stick) restaurant to be awarded a Michelin star. I got their basic tasting menu (4 000 yen  or $36) and got six skewers of meat and vegetables in addition to several other dishes. I‚Äôd recommend getting the 6 000 yen or 7 000 yen menu ‚Äî I ordered extra chicken skin and everything was SO GOOD I wish I could have tried everything!

The first stick was chicken filet with green onions  and I had no expectations ‚Äî but it was the BEST DAMN CHICKEN WITH GREEN ONIONS you could possibly imagine. That salt was magical. I went on to chicken livers  ground chicken on a stick in egg yolk sauce  chicken necks. So many delicious veggies as well. Very healthy!

Also  I appreciate that Japan is so solo diner-friendly. So many restaurants have bars  which are ideal for eating solo without feeling like you‚Äôre on display. I ate the bar at restaurants specializing in yakitori  tempura  sashimi  and ramen  and nobody gave me the head tilt and the ‚ÄúOnly one?‚Äù that I hate.

Also  I totally went to the wrong Bird Land tonight because Google Maps is crazy in Japan  but they were so nice about it and let me switch my reservation from Ginza to Marunouchi.

Coming to Tokyo? Bird Land is an awesome place for a meal  assuming you‚Äôre not a vegetarian. Literally everything they served was outstanding.

Tomorrow I fly home to New York on All Nippon Airways. It‚Äôs been real  Japan! #experienceANA #partner. Looking for jet lag advice. I fly out of Japan about 24 hours from now and I want to get on a normal New York schedule ASAP. I got over jet lag in a day on the way to Japan and I want to do it on the way back too!

Here‚Äôs the plan:

10:20 AM Japan/8:20 PM NYC: Fly out
7:00 PM Japan/9:00 AM NYC: Land

Landing at 9:00 AM NY time means I need to sleep a lot on the plane. How do I make that happen? I‚Äôm flying business class with All Nippon Airways  which is a lie-flat seat (the only way I can sleep on planes)  but I also need to be tired. Melatonin can only do so much.

Should I stay up all night on my last night in Tokyo to get tired enough to sleep on the plane? I‚Äôm waking up at 5:30 AM for the flight anyway.... It was 2004 and I was a 19-year-old college sophomore trying to see all the Oscar-nominated movies. I went to the little $3 movie theater in downtown Fairfield  Connecticut  to catch a new indie film called Lost in Translation. It wasn‚Äôt as funny as I thought it was going to be ‚Äî it was something better. That film touched something deep in me  nostalgia for moments I hadn‚Äôt yet experienced.

At the time I had no idea what I wanted to do for a living. I would joke  ‚ÄúI would LOVE to get paid to blog about my life.‚Äù But it was 2004 ‚Äî the word ‚Äúblog‚Äù barely even existed  let alone ways to make money from it that weren‚Äôt a book or TV deal. 

I wouldn‚Äôt stay in a hotel room by myself until I was 25.

I wouldn‚Äôt make it to Japan until I was 29.

Yet somehow  14 years after that winter evening in Fairfield  I would be staring at the same view that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen enjoyed as they sought respite from the overwhelming metropolis of Tokyo. I wasn‚Äôt just there to gawk  or enjoy the bar. It would be my own hotel room at the Park Hyatt Tokyo  for me alone  with staff that greeted me by name at every turn.

And I would be here because I was getting paid to blog about my life.. One thing that helps me carve out a bit of normalcy while on a trip is to become a ‚Äúregular‚Äù somewhere. I like to learn a routine somewhere  get used to how things work  have a special order and go through the same ritual of ordering it and knowing exactly how much it costs. I get to feel what it‚Äôs like to live there.

And...I became a regular at the strawberry mochi stand in Kyoto station.

The lady remembered me and laughed when I showed up.

I have had one of these each day for the past five days. (I‚Äôm averaging 20k steps per day; I‚Äôll allow it.) Now I have to figure out how to bring home wrapped custard mochi because I can‚Äôt live without them!!!. Coolest guy at the Olympics.

I WANT TO KNOW HIM.. Here‚Äôs a secret about Japanese train stations: they are AWESOME. In big cities  they‚Äôre filled with high-end shops and excellent restaurants. Even Sapporo had a Marc Jacobs!

Last night  on a tip from Foursquare  I went to a restaurant in Kyoto‚Äôs train station called Katsukura. I hadn‚Äôt had a chance to try tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet  Japanese-style) on my first trip  so when I saw people raving that this place had the best tonkatsu they ever had  I had to try it!

The restaurant is hard to find. Go to ‚ÄúThe Cube‚Äù in Kyoto Station and take the escalators to the 11th floor. Take a left  walk in the door  and it will be on the left (they have a sign with Roman letters). 

Fantastic  melt-in-your-mouth tonkatsu. And you get to grind your own sesame seeds for the sauce with a mortar and pestle!

At 2100 yen  or $20  including an iced oolong tea  this was an excellent little detour and well worth the journey and 30 minute wait in line.. There‚Äôs always a point on my trips when I hit burnout. And today it hit me on my first day in Kyoto.

It‚Äôs strange ‚Äî I loved Kyoto on my first trip  but I didn‚Äôt really like it today. It just seems SO touristy  vastly overcrowded  and I didn‚Äôt feel like exploring or photographing temples. Plus  the weak winter weather of Kansai puts a damper on things. In Sapporo I got a full  blizzardy  wonderful winter! In Kyoto it‚Äôs just gray and damp. (I feel so bad for the women who rented kimonos ‚Äî they look like they‚Äôre freezing!)

I am pretty sure I saw a real geisha or maiko (apprentice) in Gion today  though ‚Äî she was in full dress and makeup and she was BOOKING IT down a random street  all business-like. I spotted a maiko on my first trip but I was too far away to get a photo of this one.

Not every moment of every trip is going to be a home run. Remember that. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a failure or you did anything wrong ‚Äî these are the times to sit back  regroup  and think of what you ACTUALLY want to get out of this trip. Change your plans. Re-prioritize. And go do something that makes you happy.. Adventurous Kate Accidentally Books Herself Into a LOVE HOTEL!

Seriously  it was an accident...there was nothing online that indicated it was a love hotel! I just wanted to be in Shinjuku! This place cost $220 per night which is pretty good for Tokyo...but...

Coming with its own karaoke system is a sign of it not being a normal hotel.

You‚Äôve gotta see it.. Thank you  Harajuku  for letting me embrace my inner 12-year-old girl. 

And yes  I ate the whole thing. üò∂ It was delicious. Sour cotton candy.. It‚Äôs strawberry season! Yay! Strawberries are everywhere in Tokyo ‚Äî and so are WHITE strawberries! Have you ever seen these before?

I tried one ‚Äî the cheapest single white strawberries in the Tsukiji area are around 300 yen ($3) each. And...they aren‚Äôt THAT special. They‚Äôre not as flavorful. If I were in a generous mood  I‚Äôd compare them to starfruit; if I weren‚Äôt  I‚Äôd call them watery.

Turns out these are popular to give as gifts in Japan. There are sets of beautiful  perfect white strawberries that package them like jewelry.

I‚Äôd also love to give a shout out to Yuma from Ninja Food Tours for a wonderful foodie tour of the market! If you‚Äôre in Tokyo  be sure to hit this guy up! I‚Äôm still dreaming of that tuna bowl and strawberry-stuffed custard mochi.... Four years ago  I wrote about what an awesome time I had in Golden Gai  Tokyo‚Äôs neighborhood of tiny hovel bars.

Tonight  I went back. It was a completely different experience. Most notably  I didn‚Äôt have to financially support a broke partner this time around  so I specifically sought out a bar WITH a cover charge. And I found one that was great.

A tiny bar with four bar seats. A friendly bartender with a huge collection of vinyl (and he played ‚ÄúNew York State of Mind‚Äù and assorted hip-hop for me! Two sweet and gregarious customers who informed me that yeah  if your hotel room has karaoke  you‚Äôre in a love hotel  girl.

Such a good night. Golden Gai is an absolute treasure  but for the first time  tonight I felt like I was part of the local community here in Tokyo. You must come here!. Highlight of the day: spotting a FURRY TOILET SEAT in a cafe in Sapporo! Japan  you are so weird!

Just got to Tokyo. Unfortunately some idiot stole my debit card info and is using it to make $100 purchases at a Wawa in New Jersey. HOW DARE YOU SULLY WAWA‚ÄôS GOOD NAME  YOU THIEF. (Wawa  for those of you who don‚Äôt know  is an amazing convenience store in the Philadelphia area. Seriously  it puts every other convenience store in the world to shame. It‚Äôs like the Target to 7-11‚Äôs Wal-Mart.)

Luckily (or not?) this is something like the third or fourth time I‚Äôve had my debit card stolen online while traveling. I‚Äôm prepared ‚Äî I have other cards and bank accounts ready. Still  it‚Äôs a huge hassle and I‚Äôm extremely miffed right now.. How do you like your ramen? The island of Hokkaido has three ramen cities and Sapporo is one of them. Their signature dish is miso ramen ‚Äî and they jazz it up by adding corn and butter! I got this dish at a place on Ramen Alley  a street crammed with tiny ramen shops.

Hokkaido is a major dairy producer  hence the butter. You see ice cream everywhere but I couldn‚Äôt convince myself to get one in below-freezing temperatures! I might today in Otaru ‚Äî there‚Äôs a famous shop with squid ink ice cream and I can‚Äôt pass THAT up!

While Japan‚Äôs population has been in decline for awhile  Sapporo has been holding steady. Why is that? Lots of young people keep moving here. This is a solid  affordable city with a good economy. It might not be as sophisticated as Japan or as pretty as Kyoto  but it‚Äôs a smart choice ‚Äî you can make a life here. I‚Äôd compare it to Atlanta or Minneapolis in that way.

Hokkaido has been a very interesting corner of Japan to discover. The easiest way to get here? Fly from Tokyo to Sapporo on All Nippon Airways and explore the region on day trips. #ExperienceANA #partner. WHAT A GREAT DAY IN HOKKAIDO TODAY. Here‚Äôs what I did:

‚ÄîTraveled to Noboribetsu Onsen and walked through the Jingokudani  aka Hell Valley
‚ÄîWent for a soak in Onsen Heaven  including sitting in a hot onsen outside in the middle of the snow  then getting into an even hotter onsen that had a view of people hiking in the snow
‚ÄîAte an outstandingly fresh chirashi don
‚ÄîDrank some Sapporo coffee in a smoky atmosphere
‚ÄîWent to the top of the Sapporo TV Tower for killer views of the city
‚ÄîExplored the Sapporo Snow Festival  including a moguls performance  music and dancing  snow and ice sculptures  delicious hot chocolate and more
‚ÄîRecovered from near-frostbite in my fingers at a bar where they charge for a craft cocktail what NYC bars charge for a simple mixed drink 
‚ÄîWent to Ramen Alley (a tiny street of ramen restaurants) and had the ultimate Hokkaido ramen: miso ramen with corn and butter (yes  seriously). Anthony Bourdain ate this on his Sapporo episode of No Reservations.

I‚Äôm so glad I decided to come to Hokkaido for a few days. There are some foreign tourists  mostly Koreans and Chinese  but there are almost no westerners here and I love it.

Just don‚Äôt ask me what warms you up better: Japanese onsen or Finnish sauna. I can‚Äôt decide!!!. I just fell asleep on the train (how very Japanese) so first priority when I got back to the station was COFFEE. Sure  there‚Äôs a Starbucks here  but I wanted to try something local.

Miyakoshiya is a Sapporo-based chain of coffee shops. With...smoking. Here‚Äôs your coffee and here‚Äôs your ashtray!

When I found out it was an all-smoking establishment  I gulped and said  ‚ÄúUm  that‚Äôs fine!‚Äù Even though I hate the smoke. 

Sipping coffee in a smoke-filled indoor environment is odd. Hard to believe that this was the norm in the States until I was nine or so.. Good morning from Sapporo! I actually slept from 10:00 PM until 3:30 AM ‚Äî I wish I were always this bright-eyed and bushy-tailed at 5:30 AM! I‚Äôm off to Noboribetsu for the day (and just you wait  the pics are going to be AWESOME) but for now  here‚Äôs a quick video I took from the view of my business class flight on All Nippon Airways yesterday.

It was my first flight with ANA ever and I have to say it was the best food I have EVER had on ANY airline. Especially the Japanese meals. There was a piece of salmon marinated in some kind of miso that I could have eaten 24/7! And the staff were so nice to bring me more green tea with honey whenever I ran out.

Also...between this week‚Äôs This is Us  Three Billboards Outside Ebbing  Missouri  and The Artist  I watched FOUR horrific fire scenes on the plane. Did not expect that. Plan your plane-viewing content carefully!

Stay tuned for more Japan adventures ‚Äî you can see more on Instagram stories at @adventurouskate.

#ExperienceANA #partner. Ah  the paradox of Japan. It all feels so simple and familiar  like you‚Äôve been walking those streets forever...then it takes a good half hour to find an ATM that works on non-Japanese cards and your toilet starts singing to you.

24 hours without sleep and I‚Äôm getting delirious. Excited to explore Sapporo and the surrounding area tomorrow. From the looks of it so far  I‚Äôm one of very few foreigners in town.. Good morning  everyone! I‚Äôm about to fly to Japan in style ‚Äî business class on All Nippon Airways  Japan‚Äôs only five-star airline! I almost never fly business class long-haul so this is a treat. Champagne will be consumed. Stay tuned for more.

Also  they sat me in Row K which always makes me happy.

14 hours to Tokyo  then heading up north to Sapporo. Time to watch last night‚Äôs This is Us and sob my eyes out! #flyana #experienceana #partner. To all my fellow nerds not watching the Super Bowl: I just finished the first truly great book I‚Äôve read in 2018. Exit West by Pakistani author Mohsin Hamid (2017). It‚Äôs an epic story of a young couple stranded in a war-torn city who decide to emigrate. And then it turns into something magical.

This book is the closest heir to my favorite book of 2016  Colson Whitehead‚Äôs The Underground Railroad. Real-life tragedy punctuated with the supernatural. And  most unexpectedly  a book that both supporters of refugees and opponents of immigration will see as a dire warning.

And on top of that  it‚Äôs a love story. And another of Obama‚Äôs favorite books from 2017 (I love that we share so many of the same favorite books!!!).

Give this one a read.. Today I picked up my scopolamine patches from the pharmacy. Why? Because a month from today  I will be tossing around the wild seas of the Drake Passage en route to Antarctica.

It takes two full days to cruise the Drake  and as someone who gets seasick often  I'm a bit worried I'll be spending the whole time with my head in the toilet.

I've never used these patches before. Have you? Do they work better than other remedies? What else would you recommend?. I used to hate winter. Now I live in a freezing cold city and don‚Äôt mind it. Even though some days  like today  the mercury doesn‚Äôt edge above freezing.

And if you zoomed out a bit  you‚Äôd notice there is a Container Store on the left  a West Elm beyond that  and amazing hot chocolate a block to the right at City Bakery.

It may be cold  but there‚Äôs always a place to warm up.. It‚Äôs been a bit of a quiet month blog-wise because of my move. Here are some of the first pictures of my new place and why it‚Äôs not quite what I hoped it would be.... I can't believe it -- only five days until I leave for Japan. üòç

This is my second visit and I am determined to blow my first visit out of the water. Crazier experiences. Stranger foods. I want to write about things in Japan that nobody else is writing about.

First up: Sapporo in the far north region of Hokkaido. Then Tokyo and Kyoto with a day trip to Hiroshima  maybe an evening stop in Osaka again to enjoy some fugu and all that Dotonbori neon.

Any recommendations? What would you like me to write about?. OH COME ON.. The other day a friend asked me what I thought about Mexico.

"I love Mexico " I said. "There are lots of places I want to go there. Mexico City. Guanajuato. Guadalajara. But..."

But what?

Mexico is a fantastic country -- but it's done to death in the travel blogger community. Lots of bloggers  particularly North American bloggers  live in Mexico long-term and have covered so many different areas  especially the Yucatan. I know very few travel bloggers who haven't set foot in Mexico.

But does that matter if members of your audience only read your own blog? It's all new information to them  right?

Yeah. It does matter to me. It's not enough for me to write the millionth post about things to do while based in Tulum.

Sure  I'll cover some extensively covered destinations  like New York and Paris  but those cities are so rich and layered and I know both of them so well that I feel like my content on those destinations goes much deeper than other bloggers' posts. But beyond that  it's important for me to cover lesser-known destinations on a regular basis: whether it's a US city like Asheville or a festival like the Air Guitar World Championships in Finland or something little written about like the visa-free ferry from Helsinki to St. Petersburg and back.

So what other destinations have been done to death in the travel blogging community?

Iceland. It's hard to stand out with an Iceland post these days. People keep publishing the same "driving the ring road" guides.

In 2016 it seemed like everyone was going to Cuba  but that has slowed down a bit.

And budget travel in the Maldives. It's gotten to the point that I don't even read them anymore. WE GET IT. YOU CAN TRAVEL ON A BUDGET IN THE MALDIVES NOW. It's gotten so bad that one of the original budget islands  Maafushi  has gone downhill already.

One more? BALI. Particularly from a long-term living digital nomad perspective. I can‚Äôt get excited about anything I read about Bali anymore.

So tell me: do you like to learn about new destinations? Do you gravitate to places you've already been and loved? Is there any cliche topic on travel blogs that you wish would go away?. Need a travel tip for Paris?

I've got 100!. A lot of people are curious about how I spend my days working on a blog. Writing posts takes so little time compared to everything else!

One thing I do is clean up old posts that happen to perform well. This post used to be TERRIBLE -- just a rant about how much I hated Kuta back in 2011. (Kuta is gross.) But it ranks well in Google and gets a lot of traffic  so I want to make sure the people who land on it find what they're looking for. I spent about 90 minutes changing it from a rant to an information-filled post helping people plan their trips to Bali.. Today several people from the Quark team and I talked about how people make lifelong friendships on Antarctica trips ‚Äî maybe because the journey down is so gnarly  it gives you a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in this together‚Äù camaraderie right away! I hope I make some close friends  too.

Tell me a story about a friend you met while traveling.. Good morning  all! Today I'm speaking at the New York Times Travel Show. Head to the Latin America pavilion at noon -- I'm doing a talk about my upcoming Antarctica trip with Quark Expeditions.

If you're here  come see me afterward -- I'd love to meet you.. Friends. Whether you're religious  spiritual  agnostic  or a nonbeliever  I ask that you keep Jodi of Legal Nomads in your thoughts and/or prayers as she undergoes her fourth blood patch Friday morning.

Jodi has been severely ill with a spinal leak for the past five months. She can't even sit up without being in excruciating pain. Her case has been exceptionally challenging for her doctors at Duke  the most advanced medical center in the world for spinal leaks. The third patch did hold for longer than the first two -- hopefully this is a sign that they're on the right track and the fourth patch will be the one that lasts.

Sending every vibe I have in the hopes that Jodi will be brave  that her medical team will be skillful and precise  that Shannon and her other caretakers will be strong  and that these holes in Jodi's spine will close and she'll be able to return to a normal life.. A story about life after Maria in Puerto Rico with an interesting angle: Puerto Ricans aren‚Äôt able to style their hair long and straight without power  so they‚Äôve adapted to curly  rooty styles.

I think hair and beauty are a much bigger deal than most people think. In this article  barbers and stylists say they haven‚Äôt seen much of a decline in visits. And during recessions  lipstick tends to sell even better than usual. The way you look affects everything ‚Äî your mental health  your confidence  how you carry yourself.. Greetings from the Finnish Olympic Ski Jump Team. üòÇ

LOVE YOU  FINLAND. Never change! #l√∂yly. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves ‚Äî being white is about 90% of why she was able to sneak onto these flights in the first place.. One year later ‚Äî another BEAUTIFUL day for the Women‚Äôs March of 2018.. The first time I went to Berlin back in 2013  I nearly got knocked over in the bike lane several times. We‚Äôre just not used to biking culture in the States!

Since then  I‚Äôve tried to be hyper-aware of bike lanes in cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Never stand there  not even for a moment!

This video from the Brooklyn Bridge made me laugh. It‚Äôs pretty much the worst place to bike in NYC because crowds of tourists block all the lanes. ‚ÄúBike lane  you‚Äôre in the BIKE lane!‚Äù. What is the country that you can keep going back to again and again without getting bored?

For me  it's Italy. So diverse and varied  but with such cohesive beauty.. Things have been a bit quiet and will continue to be quiet this week. The reason? I moved into my new place!

Here are a few pics of the VERY much unpacked apartment  and because I always feel awkward in selfies  here are some extra awkward shots of the top of my head.

This place is great. It‚Äôs a lateral move  more or less  so some things are better (much bigger  gut-renovated) and some things are worse (slanty floors  darker) but it‚Äôs more or less the same quality that I had in my last apartment. Manhattan apartments tend to be tiny  but Harlem and further uptown have much larger units.

I can‚Äôt wait to decorate and give you the full tour with professional  non-awkward photos.

By the way  those green crates are from Bin-It  and if you‚Äôre in a city that they serve  I can‚Äôt recommend them enough for moving. Renting crates is do much easier than buying and putting together a million cardboard boxes!. Are you an Olympics fan? I love the Olympics  but somehow I always forget the dates and book travel during them! (Then again  I'll be in Japan...I'll be in the right time zone! Yay!)

This is a huge story. North and South Korea marching together and competing together. Wow.. You guys! I got nominated for a Shorty! I've never been nominated for a Shorty before!

I'm nominated for Best Travel Influencer. I'd love your vote! There are tons of categories to vote for across so many industries!

I feel like Brian on that episode of Family Guy... "I've been nominated for a Woody!". This piece has been popping up in my Facebook memories since it was published in 2012. The crazy thing is that back in 2012 I thought it represented my life -- more than a year into full-time travel  getting ready to settle down. Ha. I didn't know the half of it.

But as time went on  my life began to reflect this piece more. When it was published I had no idea I would end up moving to New York -- and I did  just like the author. Like her  I became the one to say  "Come visit  you can stay in my apartment."

I hope you enjoy this cozy Sunday read.. I LOVE  LOVE  LOVE the idea of this trip. Imagine getting to ride a Vespa through the Italian countryside for a week -- you have a route  your hotels are book  and your luggage even gets transported for you can just enjoy the ride!

The Vespa Trip does tours through Tuscany  the Amalfi Coast  even Sicily! I would so love to do one of them.

Now  get me a ride buddy who looked like Jude Law in The Talented Mr. Ripley and we'll be talking.... Who's coming to the New York Times Travel Show this year? I'm going to be there!

And I can now share that I will be speaking on Saturday the 27th at 12:00 PM with Quark Expeditions. We're going to be talking all about Antarctica travel and doing a preview of my upcoming trip in March.

Media/blogger people  I'm also speaking on Friday morning (which is open to media only) on the "How to Be a Travel Influencer" panel.

Hope to see you there!. How cold was it in North Carolina last week? So cold  these alligators were hanging out in frozen swamps  their snouts sticking through the ice for air!

Don‚Äôt worry; they survived just fine. And one day they will rise up and KILL US ALL.. They're here! The New York Times's annual 52 Places to Go in 2018. This year  I can't help but think about whoever got that job to visit all 52 in a year. What an adventure that's going to be!

I'm VERY happy to see the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy on the list  and I know it's due in part to the excellent work their tourism board has done to promote the region over the years. Part of that promotion has been hiring travel bloggers to visit and create content. I was on Emilia-Romagna's first-ever press trip back in 2011 and since then I've returned to work on bigger promotional campaigns.

That's travel marketing for you! The ROI isn't instant  but it compounds slowly and then pays off for decades. Since my first trip to Bologna and the Emilia-Romagna region  I've sent dozens of you guys there as well. And now it's on the New York Times's list of top 52 destinations. That is AWESOME.. Let's talk cheap travel. What are some of your favorite destinations?

In Central America  I found Nicaragua and especially Guatemala to be high value destinations for a VERY low cost.

In Southeast Asia  Cambodia and Laos are generally the cheapest  but I think you get better value in Vietnam and northern Thailand.

In Europe  I was shocked at how cheap Ukraine was. Not quite as cheap  but still excellent value  are Albania and Macedonia.

What are your favorite spots?. You know what's surprising? So many travelers  from novices to experts  make the SAME EXACT MISTAKES in New York over and over! It drives me crazy and I feel bad for them...so I wrote this guide to help you plan an even better trip!

What would you add to the list?. Looking for an off the beaten path destination in Europe? I really love Albania! It's beautiful  it's strange  it's cheap  and it's mysterious. A great combination. Have you been?. Folks  if you happen to be in New York before January 14  get thyself to Miss Saigon - Broadway. This has been my favorite musical that I hadn‚Äôt seen in real life for the past 20 years.

Why did I wait until its final few weeks?? It was SO SO GOOD. And one of the highlights was seeing Jon Jon Briones play the Engineer. He was in the original ensemble 28 years ago and now he‚Äôs playing the lead!

If you‚Äôre a Broadway fan  you probably know that the original Engineer was played by Jonathan Pryce  a white actor. As magnificent as his performance was  it was problematic. The only roles for Asian men in the classic Broadway canon are in Miss Saigon and The King and I. That‚Äôs it. So to use yellowface casting is both racist and unfair to all the talented Asian male Broadway actors seeing one of few roles explicitly for them going to yet another white actor.

There was an uproar when Miss Saigon  starring Pryce  first came to Broadway. And thankfully that put the conversation about inclusive casting front and center. Since then  every actor playing the Engineer has been ethnically Asian. And Broadway is the only place where you see people of color cast in white roles on a regular basis.

(That‚Äôs not to say that there‚Äôs animosity against Pryce. For the 25th anniversary celebration in London  Pryce came out to perform The American Dream onstage with Briones  two Engineers side by side!)

In this cast  so many of the actors were similar to the originals in terms of looks and voice. Except for Briones. Tiny and conniving  he was a world away from Pryce‚Äôs original big  grand character. Briones‚Äôs Engineer was like Iago the parrot brought to life. 

One last thing ‚Äî it was particularly moving to see this show after traveling to Saigon and seeing the war scars firsthand  and after traveling to Bangkok and realizing the set literally recreated signs from Soi Cowboy today. It was much more brutal than when I listened to the soundtrack as a teenager.

I loved this show. Go see it if you can. Also  if you use the TodayTix app (which I always use) for the first time  you can get $10 off any show with the code AELAA.. Happy Friday! Here's a gift for you. $30 off your next hotel booking from Booking.com  no strings attached. And they've got all kinds of places to rent on Booking -- apartments  B&Bs  even the occasional boat!

Once you stay  they'll give me $30 off a hotel booking too. Enjoy!. Here's everything I got up to in December -- including some Vegas trip tidbits  a Scientology memoir  and how this move (10 days away) is the biggest thing in my life right now.... Wow  this is major news for New York. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has had a pay-what-you-wish policy for 50 years. Now  everyone will have to pay the $25 admission  excluding New York State residents and students in Connecticut and New Jersey  who can continue to pay as they wish.

--On one hand  I feel that art should be as accessible as possible to all people  regardless of economic status. On that level  this is hurtful  particularly to low-income people from New Jersey who live so close but won't get the benefits.

--On the other hand  this is the same policy that many museums and sites do around the world  from the Louvre to Angkor Wat. It's a policy that makes sense  especially for a museum as magnificent as the Met. As New York State residents  we are the ones who subsidize the museum with our taxes; we are the ones who should benefit from reduced admission.

--Kids under 12 still go for free. Seniors go for $17 and students go for $12.

--Also  if you pay for full-priced tickets  you get admission for three full days. That is worth a ton and will make it easier for you to see sites like The Cloisters  which come with Met admission but are far from the Met itself.

--Memberships are still fantastic value. $100 per year (or $80 if you live 200 miles outside New York)  which is less than $10 per month. Family memberships are $200 per year. AND you get to bring a free guest on every visit if you're a member.

--The greatest tragedy is that our government is slashing funds for the arts in the first place. Not to mention slashing funds for everything so they can give a giant tax break to their richest donors. It's 2018  motherfuckers. Get ready to be voted out.

What do you think?. It snowed in Savannah today ‚Äî something that almost never happens! Love these photos.. I wrote this four years ago  and almost all of it still holds true!

With the exception of one. Staying in an Airbnb. They create housing crises around the world (landlords make more money renting the out short-term to tourists rather than long-term to locals)  and many cities have banned them in some form  including NYC. In NYC  for example  Airbnb is only legal if you're taking a room while the owner is also staying in the house  or if you're staying in an apartment on your own for 30+ days.

But Airbnb refuses to stop showing illegal apartments on their site  so people end up booking them  hurting the neighborhoods they think they're helping  and breaking the law without even realizing it.. When I was in Vail this past August  I ran into my friend Sherry from Ottsworld Travel and Life Experiences  one of those blogger friends I run into all over the world. We grabbed some wine  gabbed about our upcoming travels  and she told me she was going to do a 19-day campaign in California with three other bloggers.

"NINETEEN DAYS?!" I said incredulously. "HOW?!"

Blog trips  a.k.a. press trips or influencer marketing campaigns  look like they're all fun and games  but they're actually super-long days filled with endless activities  lots of multi-course meals with booze  meeting lots of people and listening to their spiels  and you have to be "on" socially 24/7  which is exhausting for introverts (and most bloggers are introverts). Top it off with taking constant notes for the posts you will write later  having to update all your social media platforms in real time with professional content that you know will be scrutinized by your client  and getting maybe four hours of sleep each night if you're lucky  and you've got a blog trip!

This is a behind-the-scenes look at what those trips are actually like. To be fair  this is an extreme AND long trip -- I've never done one quite this intense and doubt I would ever want to -- but this shows just how much work it can be.

There's nothing like sleeping four hours before having an early kayaking session (no shower after)  a meet-and-greet with the local tourism board  a two-hour drive to another town  a four-course lunch with wine refilled throughout  another meet-and-greet with tourism people  a historic town tour  and you're about to fall asleep and you'd kill for a coffee but you're running late and it's time for another activity  scheduled RIGHT when the colors of sunset are at their brightest and it's killing you that you can't photograph it but you smile and nod and ask more questions of the latest tourism people you're meeting. (This is why I almost always do solo campaigns these days. I get better results when I plan my own schedule.)

Still  as I always say  travel blogging isn't heart surgery and it isn't coal mining. To do this for a living is a luxury and a privilege.

I hope you enjoy this glimpse behind the curtain.. This year  I want YOU to join me in a reading challenge! A very achievable 12-book challenge  one per month.

The twist: these twelve books need to have a theme. Here are some suggestions of themes and the theme I chose for 2018!. Happy New Year! What kind of place do you want to visit in 2018? Tell me what you like and I'll give you a destination.. Proud to share that Barack Obama and I chose four of the same books as our favorites of the year! (Does this mean we‚Äôre best friends now?)

The Power by Naomi Alderman.
Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City.
A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles.
Sing  Unburied  Sing by Jesmyn Ward.

Have you read any of them?. Dear Guy Fieri 

Why is your restaurant closing tomorrow when my waitress today told me it was one of the most profitable restaurants in Manhattan?

Who on Earth decided a "pumpkin spice cocktail" should contain cinnamon whiskey and coffee-flavored tequila  together? Do you know what I should take for this mid-afternoon hangover?

What happened that every batch of fries was markedly more tepid than anything else on the menu? Do you pass them through a refrigerator on their way out?

Why even bother to call them the "'Awesome' Pretzel Chicken Tenders" when their only pretzel content appears to be a few nubs thrown on haphazardly at the end?

Why does your Meyer lemon vinaigrette taste of nothing but vague garlic? How is it that the occasional olive brings more flavor than the rest of the meal put together?

How was the chocolate cake "with chunks of cake" the best thing on the menu  yet rudimentarily average?

After five years  how is your menu still riddled with spelling and punctuation errors?

Do you realize the irony in your giant FLAVOR TOWN sign when everything -- yes  everything -- on the menu is devoid of taste?

Why did you only give four days' notice to your waitstaff that they were losing their jobs  at the time of year when most people are short on cash  with no additional payment or severance  and only offering a few workers new jobs at your associated brewery?

How did my friends and I visit you today with the lowest expectations and still somehow end up disappointed?

Are we masochists?

Let me know.

---------------------------------------------
Today three of my friends and I decided to go to Guy's American Kitchen & Bar and experience it before it closes forever tomorrow night. We expected to have an awesomely bad and entertaining meal.

This restaurant received the most DELICIOUSLY SCATHING review of all time  phrased entirely in questions (hence the structure of this post). You MUST read it if you haven't: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html

Guy Fieri  as much as the internet mocks him  does a lot for charity and small American businesses. This restaurant  by contrast  bastardizes the values he holds dearly. Nothing about this is great or even mediocre American cuisine. There is so much better and cheaper food in New York  even within a three-block radius.

Am I glad it's gone? I'm sad for the workers who lost their jobs  with only four days' notice. Other than that  this is no tragedy. New York is a better city without this restaurant.. I am sharing an important post today from my friend Diana at DTravelsRound: http://www.dtravelsround.com/safe/ 

Diana was preyed on by a hostel worker in Bruges  Belgium. She kept the hostel anonymous in the post  but as soon as she published it  another woman emailed her to say that the same thing happened to her -- and she named the hostel AND the worker.

Diana is looking for more women. If this has happened to you  please contact her through her website.

Beyond that  this is a post worth sharing. So often people hear about terrible incidents like this and say  "Well  you should have known that Belgian beers are stronger. It's your own fault that you ended up blacked out and in bed with a stranger."

No. How about that man behind the bar shouldn't have been feeding you high alcohol content beers as you got drunker and drunker to the point of blacking out?. I came across a long-lost necklace when home for Christmas. I bought this at the end of my semester in Florence  on the Ponte Vecchio  home to jewelry shops.

Florence is one of the best places in the world to shop for gold. Everything is high quality (they only consider 18k+ gold to be real gold) and the pieces are lovely.

So toward the end of my semester  I walked over to the bridge  greeted the shopkeeper in Italian  picked out the necklace I had been eyeing for weeks  and paid my seventy-eight euros. I now owned a heart necklace with a tiny diamond chip.

I BOUGHT MYSELF A DIAMOND  I remember marveling at the time. I'M TWENTY YEARS OLD AND I ACTUALLY BOUGHT MYSELF A DIAMOND. I had spent the previous summer waitressing like crazy to save enough money for my semester abroad; it felt surreal to buy something so valuable.

It's funny that I found the necklace now  because I'm feeling similarly. Two and a half weeks from now  I move out of my beautiful brownstone apartment. And as I gaze at the walls  snug with a cup of tea on my purple couch  I'm feeling similar gratitude and awe.

"I lived here. Alone. For two years. I paid my rent on time  every month. I lived here by myself  every month. I bought all this furniture by myself. I alone was responsible for it. I made it work. In Manhattan."

When I first realized that I had potential to make travel blogging my full-time job  I just wanted to make $1000 per month so I could live in Southeast Asia. Today my rent alone costs more than double that.

I'm overwhelmed with gratitude -- and a bit of incredulity  to be honest. How did I get here in eight years?! Sometimes it feels like it passed in a blink.

I'm not moving far -- I'm literally moving one block away  which is kind of amusing. And once again  I'm planning to live there alone. But that doesn't mean that I will ALWAYS live there alone. I made sure to choose an apartment where two people could live comfortably. Just in case my life moves in that direction.

Either way  my first New York apartment will always hold a dear place in my diamond-stamped heart. For two years  I lived here alone. It might be the only place I ever live alone. I made it work. In New York City.. Real talk from Rick Steves. If you go to Europe and it seems like everyone's being rude  chances are YOU are the problem  not them.

Make an effort. Travel simply. Converse with people who aren't like you. Keep an open mind.. Happy Holidays from me and Rob the chicken!

(His name stands for Roasted Or Baked.)

Whether Christmas is a special day for you or not -- or especially if it's a more difficult day for you -- I wish you lots of joy and peace today and through the new year.. Nothing makes me feel like a baller like spending an extra $7 for a front row seat on the bus to Boston! Love those views!

To everyone traveling for the holidays -- I wish you safe journeys! Please be cautious if you're driving through snow!. Let's talk 2018 travel! What's one trip that you think will LIKELY happen and one trip that is VERY UNLIKELY but would be awesome if it happened?

I'm likely going to make it to Cyprus (my final European country!) this spring. Less likely  I think it would be awesome to visit the Arctic during the summer  especially Greenland. We'll see!. And now it's time for the WORST moments of the year!

Every year  I put together a list of my worst travel moments. This year includes a piece of my rental car falling off in the Keys  almost not making it back to the cruise ship before departure  and getting swept up in a borderline cult.. Earlier this fall I was shocked to find out I was named to the Irish America Business 100 -- the top 100 Irish-American business leaders. ME. Amongst CEOs.

The gala was last week. Here I am with Irish America editor-in-chief Patricia Harty  who not only remembered who I was  she remembered my Irish ancestors' origins  that I was fifth generation Irish with roots in County Laois! Impressive!

We were asked to share a quote about what our Irish ancestry means to us. Truthfully  I've always felt more in touch with my French and Italian ancestry than my Irish roots  but as I thought about it  here's what I had to say:

"At one point the Irish were among the most reviled in America. Today we are seeing history repeat itself as similar scorn is heaped upon Latin American immigrants. As
Irish Americans  I believe it is our duty to speak up for the immigrants of today. We must protect the people who came here to create a better life for their families  just as millions of Irish did before them."

Patricia read my quote out during dinner. I was touched.. Wow  I think they got most of the stereotypes here! The Chang beer and Chang beer tank...the road rash injury from motorbiking...the buckets...the bamboo tattoo.

I won't lie  I wore plenty of hippie pants back in my Southeast Asia backpacking days. Though I'm glad I never got that Thai tattoo I was considering ("Adventurous" in Thai on my side beneath my bra -- SO EDGY GUYS). There was a time for those kinds of trips  and that time has passed for me.

Friendly reminder: NEVER ride an elephant and NEVER go somewhere where you play and take photos with tigers. Both activities are animal abuse.. "Foodsplaining" needs to be a thing  because I saw it happen tonight.

I was at Joe's Pizza in the West Village today -- arguably one of the best slices in NYC -- standing at a counter and chowing down next to a couple who were around 60 or so. Then I overhear the lady say to the guys behind the counter  "I'm not a pizza maker  but..." and launched into a lecture on how their pizza could have been better.

I was speechless. The bloody AUDACITY.

Don't do that  people. Ever. It's rude as hell and serves no purpose whatsoever to tell some excellent pizza makers why you didn't like their slices. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.. Happy Shortest Day of the Year to my fellow northern hemisphere dwellers! The light is BEAUTIFUL in New York today! But damn  it's cold!. I read 70 books in 2017. 70! That must be a new record! Here are my absolute favorites.

Shout-out to authors Min Jin Lee  Angie Thomas  Kathleen Rooney  Taylor Jenkins Reid  Naomi Alderman  Celeste Ng  Jesmyn Ward  Nell Stevens and George Saunders.. Pretty cool to be quoted in TIME! Several travel experts  myself included  give their top tips for where to travel during the holiday season.

My big tip for traveling in New York during Christmas? Don't spend all your time in midtown. Midtown is crazy busy  filled with tourists  and extremely gray.

I used to not like New York -- then I realized I was spending all my time in midtown.

Take yourself out to Dyker Heights  Brooklyn  to see the craziest Christmas decorations. It's a bit of a journey but so worth it. Pretty much everyone who goes there is a New Yorker.

Oh  and my other Christmas tip: don't skate at the rink in Central Park. It's owned by Trump. Go to Bryant Park instead; it's free to skate (you pay for skate rentals) and you're not subsidizing Trump in the process.. Two years ago  Gerard of the blog GQ trippin donated bone marrow to a donor whose identity was kept private. Now they've finally found each other -- and she made it!

What a great thing to do -- and it's something that most of us can do  too. It's super easy to become a donor in the States-- go to BeTheMatch.org and they'll send you a kit to swab your cheek.

Someone out there might be very sick and waiting for your donation. Consider getting yourself registered.. This is a fascinating read on how the Queen travels. I should totally follow her lead and travel with a bag of my own blood! Does that count as carry-on?. Every year  I name my favorite travel moments of the year. Here's what made the cut for 2017 -- including hanging out with Hemingway lookalikes in Key West!. I'm sharing this because it's not just another Harvey Weinstein story -- it's representative of all the women whose work and art were kept from the world because of lecherous men who thought they could get whatever they wanted.

How much art has our world we been denied? How many advancements have been kept away? How many women have decided it was safer to abandon their ambitions than to face evil  day after day?

All women who create for a living need to read this.

I love the movie Frida  but I appreciate it even more now for what Salma Hayek Pinault went through. I always heard she worked really hard to get it made  but we had no idea what really went on.. Today I got to see a woman win a Caribbean cruise out of the blue. She was so excited! Carnival Cruise Line was giving away entries to win a free cruise here in New York  and you would enter by taking a personality quiz. You would receive a can full of air from the Caribbean -- it could be guavaberry from St. Maarten  coconuts from Cozumel  or just fresh Caribbean sea air. It was fun! Ten people won free cruises today! 

There's still a chance to win a cruise if you couldn't come down to New York today. Go on Instagram and tag a vacation photo with #OpenFun and #sweepstakes and you could win a cruise yourself! It's that time of year when it would be LOVELY to escape the cold to the Caribbean...

Mike Stein but we'll see how that anyway I'm enjoying the time that I'm spending here and although Chester is not on a lot of itineraries for northern England I really think you should add it it's really nice city there's a hostel you can do it cheap if you want to and it's very easy to get to from Liverpool and Manchester second most photographed clock in Britain after Big Ben that's pretty cool

I'm adventurous Kate and I swear this is not offensive this is only mud Dead Sea Med to be exact and I'm here at the Dead Sea in Jordan and here it is the Dead Sea is called the Dead Sea because there is no life living in it there are no fish which makes me very happy no crabs just a few kinds of bacteria that's all there is and because it's 430 meters below sea level it evaporates faster because it evaporates faster there's a lot more salt in it and because there's a lot more salt in it you can float additionally you don't want to get any of that awful salt water into your mouth or into an open moment if you can't help it because of the salt content it is extremely easy to float there are some people doing it down there you just get in scoot yourself along and you're floating no effort at all you could see all that white its crystallized salt it seems that the biggest joke here in Jordan is to hand you a piece of fish on platter and go from the Dead Sea now as for the mud there's this mud here that is supposed to have healing properties in it so you're supposed to go into the Dead Sea for ten minutes cover yourself with this mud and let it dry for 20 minutes and then let yourself rinse off and go for a swim in the dead sea again I don't know if it's going to work but no I'll try anything once and that is where you put the mud on here at the Dead Sea Kempinski it is an absolutely beautiful November day here
