Hello, everybody. My name is Markiplier and welcome to West of Loathing. Now, I know some of you may not have heard of this game, But it's made by the same developers of Kingdom of Loathing and I've been looking forward to it since Pax East in Boston. What I saw in that game was that it was hilarious. And I don't know if it's gonna be hilarious the whole way through, I don't want to over hype it, but everything I saw in-- Oh! Everything I saw in there was really hilarious. Alright, who do we want to be? Earl Dalton? Edwin Jones? Bjorn Walker? "Edit your name." ...Oh! I can edit my name now! My name is Mumflr Fump--Fumper--Fumperdink. (And so it begins) This is the adventure of Mumflr Fumperdink in West of Loathing. Alright, there we go. Ooh. "I had the strangest dream. I was choosing a character class." Should I be a Cow Puncher, a Beanslinger... Oh! Or a Snake Oiler? Oh my god, did I somehow make my gun into a flamethrower and-- oh my god, Snake Oiler. Oh, that's so funny. But I want to be a Cow Puncher. Alright, I'll be a Cow Puncher. "Cow Punchers solve their problems with their fists, whether it's shaking them at a disagreeable feller in a disreputable saloon or using them to punch a slightly more disagreeable feller in a slightly less reputable saloon. You've heard the Cow Punchers are in demand out West since The Cows Came Home, which stands to reason. The Cows aren't gonna punch themselves, after all." Wait, let me read of what--what the Beanslinger is. "Magic and cooking are inextricably intertwined in Loathing, and the Beanslinger is a mystical master of both. You've heard there's a shortage of cooks out West since The Cows Came Home, due to most of the cooks having been brutally killed by The Cows." Uh, maybe not. "Snake Oilers rely on their moxie and chutzpah to tame snakes, their fearlessness to extract potent oils from those snakes, and their cleverness to manufacture and sell potions made from those oils. You've heard Snake Oilers are doing really well out West since The Cows Came Home. Everybody needs potions and hope in these dark days, and also out West is where all the best snakes live." That's alright, though. But I think I'm gonna go with Cow Puncher. Those Cows ain't gonna punch themselves. Oh man, I'm so excited for this game. Alright, what do we got? "This weird poster appeared here one night." Alright, I can jump for joy at that fact. I can't do anything else about it. Read the spine of one of your books. "[Chester Danger and the Mystery of the Forbidden Lighthouse]. That was one of my favourites." "[Herb Brown and the Curse of the Ancient Cellar]. Dad gave me this one when I was a kid." "[The Occurence at Rattlesnake Mansion]. Rufus liked this one as much as I did." "[Bee--Bea Brown and the Curse of the Black Bridge]." "[Jefferson Swift in the Old Gulch], [The Miracle at the Black Hospital]." Oh! Hey, this one might come in handy! I got [Walking Stupid]! Well, that's what I like to do!(We know Mark, We know) I like to walk stupid! "Unlock Stupid Walking as an option." "This book tells the tale of a renegade sheriff who was really, really bad at walking." "You read the book from cover to cover and learn how to walk really stupidly." "Stupid Walking has been added to your option menu." "You got a perk: "Stupid Walking". You accidentally dropped the book and then ruin it by stepping on it 30 times-- --while you're trying to pick it up."(RIP) Oops. Oh, well least I unlocked Stupid Walking. How do I do that? Oh no, do I just do that always now? "When you were a child you, wanted to walk so badly." "You finally have." [Mark laughs at the stupid walk] [Mark laughs at another stupid walk] [Mark laughs at another stupid walk] (Giggly Plier) I'm sorry, it's not that funny. (are you sure about that?) Uh, "Hey, Russell. How you doin'?" "Caw." (Lemme Smash) "I'm gonna miss you buddy." "Caw, ca-caw." "Feed Russell a cricket." "You grab a cricket from your cricket bag and feed it to Russell." "He coos appreciatively and nuzzles your hand." "Maybe it's time for you to leave, too." "You open your bedroom window, not pictured, and unlatch the door to Russell's cage." "He winks at you, caws one last time, then flies away to the West." "It's time to hit the trail." Oh, maybe I'll see Russell out on the trail! "Goodbye, desk. Comb hair." "You comb your hair one last time." I gain one XP. Great! I don't seem to have hair. "Goodbye, bed. Time to head West and chase my real dreams!" "G'bye, phonograph." Oh. "You pull the needle away from the cylinder and stow the handle away." Oh my gohahaha-- [Mark laughs at another stupid walk] I don't think that's ever not gonna make me laugh the whole time I'm playing this goddamn game. Oh, geez. All right. Uh, I think I've done all these so there's no more there. Oh, my god, okay. Anyway, let's get outta here. Let's crab walk out of here. (Nyoom) Ah, "nothin' on the hat rack today." "What a mess!" OHH! :O Look at me! I'm so or-go-nized! :D Alright. [gigglyplier] "This hearth really puts the 'hearth' in hearth and home." Alright. Alright, let's see. "You're gonna miss Mom's cooking." I sure am-- ohHH my go-- [gigglyplier] [gasps] That's gonna be the whole goddamn game. "It's Mom's pie safe. It keeps all her pies safe." Oh, that's so nice. :') "You'll miss meals with the family." Ohh, "your little brother's room"? "You pick up one of your brother's weird books and flip through it." "O-ver math-matikee d'evarist guluhh." [Mark is trying] "Reading the title just gives me a headache." "You pick up one of your brother's weird books and flip through it." "On the application and dynamics of a general mathematical method previous applied to optics." I think it's about math? ...Maybe? "You pick up one of your brother's--" "An an-- invesk-- uh, Investigation of the laws of thought of--on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities. Just a title gives me a headache. "You look into--" Uh, let's see. I got a puzzle cube! Alright, I stole his puzzle cube. Cartwheel--! Ohh-- [gigglyplier] So tidy. OH, my god! Look at me, I'm so talented! :D [The Mating call of the Mark] Alright, nothing here? "It's covered with all weird diagrams and charts." Alright, well, goddamn, this is fucking hilarious. Alright. I think it's time to go. I think it's time to get out of here. Oh! Mama! (mom: what? Where did you get that walk?) Mama! Are you proud of me, Mama? (Mom: sure sweetie :3) Let's see, "no time to screw around. Time to head West." Deedle dee dee. Hi, mom. Don't mind me crab walking towards my mother.(mom: Son seriously, stop walking like that) Alright. "Your mom smiles warmly as you approach. I'm leaving now, Mom." "We're gonna miss you, kiddo. Oh, and before you leave, I got you a present." "A present?!" :D "Yep. It's a book you wanted for Crimbo. I know it's early, but--" What's Crimbo? Ohh! "The one about bartering? Oh boy!" "The one about desert survival? Oh boy!" "The one about-- --picking locks? Oh boy!" I always do pick the picking locks route whenever I have options like this. That's the one! Enjoy it." [Locks and How to Pick Them]. Please be careful out there. Write us a letter when you can. Oh, thanks, Mom. 'Scuse me, Dad. How you doin'? "Your father morosely jabs at the haystack." "That hat doesn't fit you, Dad." That hat doesn't fit you? "I'll grow into it." Okay, alright. Goodbye. "Time for me to leave." "His lip quivers a little." "Listen. I want you to have this. It's your grandmother's brass knuckles." Thank him. "Good... Good luck out there. Be sure to say goodbye to your mother." I did. Goodbye, Dad. Dig through the haystack. I got a needle! I did it! I got a needle, Dad! Are you proud of me? Is there anything else in there? Hey, bro. "Your brother Rufus is standing there looking nervous." "He's pretty good at looking nervous." Give him his puzzle back. "You hand him his puzzle and he starts fidgeting with it." Say goodbye. "Hey, Rufus, time for me to head West." "I still don't understand why you're leaving." "He's got a point, you know." "Why are you going West?" I'm gonna... ...Help people! "You've read the papers, Rufus. The people out West are in trouble." "They need all the help they can get." "But it's so dangerous!" "60% of the people who go West get killed within a year, and that statistic is from before The Cow Came Home." "I'll be okay." Don't worry you worry about taking care of Mom and dad. I'll worry about me, okay if you say, so I think I still think you'll be be dead by Crimbo is Crimbo Christmas is that what Crimbo is? Oh, missy rufus. Okay, you give him the playful punch in the arm too bad I'm a cowpuncher, and it devastated him shot him across the entire Cityscape. Oh, man Good new options a nerd mode combat grid. What is this stupid? Oh, I can turn them off Why would I want to turn off my stupid walking? Colour-blind mode?

Nerd mode I'll turn on Nerd mode Sure, I got those I don't know what those do See all right. I got brass knuckles, good for cow-punching Character Mumflr Fumperdink. On the Fumperdink. farm? Is this the Fumperdink farm? Alright You guys I'm out of here excuse me. Go West young man? Yeah, but let me see if I can talk to my parents again. He's just barely holding it together It's probably best if you just go. Your mom raised an eyebrow I just wanted one more hug before I leave, she smiles and hugs you again.  Can I get one more hug Please when are you gonna get tired of giving me hugs mom? Alright let's go Whoo hitching a ride across the great plains. What am I sitting on? carrots, beets? ooh I Don't want to skip the opening credits, this is the good stuff. Zach Johnson You did great here. Victor Thompson, Kevin Simmons good job on all this I don't know why there's a film editor, but that doesn't make a lot of sense. Dialect coach? *giggling* Riff Connor Oh okay, what am I doing to those goddamn carrots? Stunt coordinator. Again, This seems a little odd. Key grip, Chris Moyer. hmm. I don't represent sure about these opening credits. boom operator 200 miles later. Only 200 miles? well that's not very far to go west. Maybe I'm not there yet. Oop, no I'm there DirtWater? Dirt Water?. Oh no don't fall off. No! No, you dead now. Where you stupid walking? oh Well the bad news is you fell off the cart and got knocked out for a couple hours, and now you got no ride, no meat, no prospects. The good news is that you're in a town, rather than in a gulch somewhere Not much of a town though. You get yourself up and dry yourself off. Heeey, I like this town. Hey, buddy How you doing? Can I pick up this-
 turnip! Got dusty turnip! Hey watch it -hic- buddy No, hit does this look like a hick to you? A sign on the door reads 'gone drinking'. Are you? You gone drinking? can't a fella Buffalo gals won't you? Huh, what are you talking about Buffalo gals? usually... yuck, oh shit. I just stepped in poop. Oh. God damn it *groans* you skated right into that poo. Ughh. Alright listen here. As you walk into the saloon, the crazy-eyed guy sitting to the left of the door shrieks and waves at you to get your attention. "Hey. Where's your hat, dagnabbit?" Well I- "You can't drink in here without a hat! T'ain't proper." He points to the 'take a hat, leave a hat' box next to the door. Click on the box You look through the hat box and find a sturdy looking stetson. That looks like something you'd wear Oh, I got a four gallon hat! You grab the hat and put it on. Thanks, er... 'Pete!" Thanks Pete. He you give you a friendly (if somewhat twitchy) nod. "Say feller..." Yeah? "You headin west? If'n you want some company? I'd be more than happy to come along- just lemme know!" well uh... "No pressure!" Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Where am I? Where am I here? Oh, there I am here. What'd you say Pete? "Who, me? Well heck, I say all kinds o' things! For instance, dagnab machines. Can't trust 'em no more than a double-crossing so-and-so!" Uh-huh. Pete takes a swig of his whiskey. See you later, Pete. Why can I read that so well? It's a spittoon. People spit in it. You know without- without even looking in it that's absolutely disgusting I'ma look in it. Yeah, it's full of spit. Regular spit, gross tobacco spit, chewing gum, and it looks like a few teeth as well. It's disgusting, and the smell. Even from a distance, it smells whole*stutters* it smells horrible. Look closer. You are now on your hands and knees peering into a filth-encrusted spittoon. I don't...I don't understand what is wrong with you. Wait, Is there something shining at the bottom? Get it. You reach your hand towards the spittoon.  Even before you touch it, you can feel the grossness in the air, Like a greasy fog enveloping the stinking brass horror. It smells like vomit trough at a mesquite barbecue eating contest. You hesitate. Never surrender. You plunge your hand into the awful soup. It makes a sound like "glop." Your skin is burning, your eyes start to water. Search. Your fingers make contact with something you pull your hand out of the Devil's tureen slowly, not daring to risk splashing the contents all over yourself. You appear to have gotten some kind of ring, probably some kind of disease as well. Congratulations, you got an item: Nasty ring. *unenthusiatically* Hurray *laughter* Did I put it on? I did! What does the nasty ring do? Though getting this ring was traumatic, you have to admit that it was worth it. I got muscle, mox-*stutters* Moxie and mysticality. Oh, it's so funny. Oh, I'm dying. I love this game so much, uhhHHH okay. *clears throat* All right, anyway, ooh, I should read this. Ah, there we go. Quickly memorize the entire book. After you're done reading it, you donate it to the local orphanage. Soon those orphans will be able to make their escape. Go, orphans, go! Ahh, I love this game. Okay, these guys are playing poker, or at least trying to. They keep looking back and forth from their hand and "how to play poker" card that the game came with, biting their lips and concentrating real hard. Good luck guys! *markimoo noises* Alright. You walk up to the bar and wait patiently for the bartender to notice you. While you're waiting, you see a sign taped to the back wall reading, 'Reward for lost mugs, 25 each.' The bartender finally notices you. "Howdy, cowboy!" Howdy barkeep. My name's Mumlfr. "What brings you to our little backwater?" Oh, the usual. I came out west to make my fortune. Not having much luck so far though. And you work around these parts? "Unfortunately, Boring Springs already has more people in it than jobs. It's more of an 'errand town' if you catch my meaning. if you're looking for a real job, I'd recommend talking the railroad people up by Dirt water. Okay The railroad? "The Manifest Destiny Railroad company, from back east. They're trying to run a line to Frisco, and having a heck of a time doing it." And they're hiring? "Oh I reckon they're always hiring for one thing or another. Big company." Dirtwater? "Dirtwater is...interesting. It's owned a far enough west they're still more or less exempt from the rule law. But not so far west that it's been burned to the ground by the damned cows. Lots of opportunity there." He pauses for a few seconds, lost in thought. "Yep, if I were a younger man, I'd probably head that way myself." All right. You mentioned errands? "Yeah, this forsaken berg is always fallin' apart in one way or another. The Hostler's always needing help since he hurt his leg, and that no-account Sherf ain't could certainly stand to have somebody doing his job for him." Anything else? "Well, I've got a goblin loose in the basement. Some cowpoke's in from the Gulch didn't wipe his boots off and got spores everywhere." I could probably handle a Goblin. "Much obliged! I'll unlock the basement door for you. Oh, and you'll need this." Weak fungicide. I'll take care of it. I don't know what kind of world we live in where goblins are the norm, but I'm gonna *stutters* Ahh neverm- I'm talking to you now. Howdy, I'm Mumflr. "Howdy Mumflr, I'm Horace." Nice to meet you. What do you do? "I'm the town Hostler." Don't I don't know what that is. I'm the town horse selfie? Yeah, gotcha. How's that working out for you? Oh these horses are just flying out the door the business is booming nice. No. I mean the horses keep running away I haven't sold one in ages. Oh is that why you're here drinking instead? Yeah, and me being in here drinking instead of watching those horses is probably how they keep escaping It's one of those vicious circle things well. I'm in need of a horse Do you have any left one kind of boring one's got four legs and a back to sit on? Come see me at the stable I'll be able to show to you are okay by then all right the woman glares at you. You should probably just let her drink Excuse me. Uh never mind. Who's the lady drinking whiskey out of a beer mug?

Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and welco-  no... I di- I- oh, I'm EUAEGH Why, I.. UAGHH I ca- UGH, I don't even have it... Agh God cock I'm not ready for- uh... You, you- HA! God damnit! God, just get in my hand, Ehh Welcome back to Fruit Ninja! Now.. Well FUCKING... Really? Ok.. Alright then. So, Fruit Ninja is a game that I played um, It's actually one of the last games that I played while I had the Vive back in my old place Um, and it's something that I left behind because it was so unbelievably frustrating But now that I got the wireless setup I think it's gonna be way better because I'm gonna be way good-er at it Cuz that's words that use good, so here we goOOo! Now I don't want to play classic mode. Classic mode is for dumb babies who- who like things old which is why people watch me! Blam! Okay, so let's.. That- Wher are y- where are y- hello? Aagh! Got 'em Well didn't mean to do that... WEUUAHU I got you. I got you. Huah HiYAH, oh-yah, oh yes, ya-ya woo! Here we go. This is the shit! That's what I like! AAAaAaghhhhhHHHHEY! YES! YES! YEEEAASSS! YEEEEASSSS! YES! EAUAgh-AY Hey! Ho! Yes, okay, well the music stopped now, and I feel a lot of- lot less excited about what was happening. Ah, didn't mean to do that, did not- oh, shoot! Shooty toots! I got two seconds!- Well, that two seconds amounted to absolutely dick diddly... But! Not- oh, that's terrible. Oh, that was an awful score. I did awfully. Aw. Okay, something tells me I didn't capitalize on my... Combo, but that's not why I'm here! The mode that I actually like is survival, because survival offers challenge and rewards skill, of which I have numerous amounts of- hang on one second - just shut up- there we go. Little quieter. Okay, alright, and as everyone knows, I have gratuitous amounts of skill. N- stop laughing. So the trick of this one yeah, you can't get 3 X- You can't miss three times, but you get bonuses depending on how you don't miss. WHOA! Hey, calm down there, Titty Sprinkles It's the first round. Uuuuuuuh! I'm gonna get you. You think you're gonna get me? The answer's you're NOT! And I hate you. Ooh, ah, get'em, get'em! Oh What up? Hey- yah! Hoy, yah! Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhungh Hey, yo, hey, yeah Yuh! Whoa- yeah, ah shit ah frick, missed one. That's okay because... BECAU- Oh well. That's not good. Oh Ha got him. Because every hundred you get a freebie Whoa Oh also that happens WOOO!!! Got a freebie yeah, yeah Yeah! Whoa. Oh shitty dicks Unh! Got him You can't beat me. WHAT~? Who the Frick frack a titty Winkle? Alright I'm gonna get you. This is the game that gets me frustwated Cuz I just like- I keep going for it no matter what I'm like always always Pushing myself to new limits cuz I'm so good at what I do, and I'm amazing. ...ebh. Hiya. I'm a ninja don't you believe me? About how ninja-ing I am? Hooao! What you got nothing? Oh, yeah? *soft orgasm* Uh, bjoink, not today not tomorrow not On Sunday! Eat shit. And by shit I mean fruit. Cuz I'd really hate to think- AUOGH! all this fruit was going to waste. You know- whoa. Hey whoa low blow! Asshole, oh, this is a lot of waste to be perfectly honest What how? On whose authority? Shit shit. Okay. Is ahh freebie Euie! Do a little dance cut a little fruit. Boink! Get down tonight, huh? no, okay, ah Stop. Being. A douche. Not today, I think I got all of that. Anytime I actually think I'm doing good. I'm actually missing completely WUH! WOOH! Kiwi! All right come on. I've got a whole lot more if you got a whole lot more on your end Let's see who's got more on this unlimited fruit planet. Hiyah. You know, we could solve all the world's hunger, but you guys choose to throw it at me, and I just have to defend myself Aiyah, oh, yeah Yes! Uh-oh- I'M BLIND! No! NO I went BLIND! No you deserve to die! No, I was blind... NOOOOO!!! Goddamnit I was doing totally fine. *sigh* alright come on. Let's see what you got, no? Pah... ouh- Got him Shunk! just throw them onto my sword Shit never mind alright. I'm gonna try-hard this one so no jokes. No jokes, everybody shut up. Oh, Oh!...Oh. Come on faster faster come on I wish there was like an extreme setting, not that I could handle that, I'd probably died right away anyway, but just 'cause- for my own ego. Come on, you think you can do this? You think you do- AHH! Where'd it go?! damn It. You think you can do that to me? The answer is yes obviously, but I don't like it. Wh- hence the complaining Who? What!? No, what the hell?... Damn you! No, God- really? Really, ah give me that freebie. I need it. Oh, I mean, I don't NEED it, but I quite obviously NEED it. There we go okay, can't miss one. AHH! No! DICKHOLE! DICKHOLE! Okay? Well I'm building back. Noh! Wha- No- NOOOOO!!! God dingus damn me to fuck hell. Why does it keep? Why do I keep going? I'm blind I can't see a thing. Why? Why does it keep going blind like that? It must be like the wireless thing. It's a little janky. It's not quite a hundred percent perfect. I mean don't get me wrong It's really cool. Well. What the hell. It's really cool, but also It's not perfect This is the one game on Vive that'll actually get me sweaty, so *sharp exhale* Probably just more from the anger than from the actual like athleticism of it. I'm doing worse than ever I'm never gonna beat that high score ever in my life WHOA! Whoa whoa whoa, Sonny Jim, whoa whoa whoa, eat a tick NGAUH! What the hell? My tracking went off. Ah! This wireless thing, it's messing up my score. It's really cool and fun and all, but my score! Whoa (x7), easy. Easy there, Sonny Jim. Come on! (x6) You think you can? You think you CAN? Well I'M here to tell you that you CANNOT! Woo! (x3) What? No. Yes, yep, yep-a-rooni. Nope-a-roni. Bee-omp! Wimpo! Flompity! A-GUAMP! Nooo... Wow, that Markiplier, he's so handsome and skilled and great at cutting fruit. He's a real PROVIDER! He's a provider of entertainment AND sustenance What a MAN! What- oh come on. What a man. No! (x8) Not today! I'm just getting to the good part. Where are you going? Where are you going, friend? Where are you going? Nahh! (x3) N-Oh COME ON!!! Whoa- how- what? dude, I'm alive?! how am I alive? I don't understand that entirely, but I'm okay with it. Hah. Aye-yai-yai. Blaugh... Ahh. H-NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
*grunt sigh* All right. that is that. I love this game, but I hate this game Do you understand the complex emotion that have to go through a man's body to be able to comprehend something of that nature? I think not. so anyway, that is fruit ninja. I like it a lot. Maybe I'll save this for a stream someday because this is just a casually fun kind of game, so thank you everybody so much for watching Let me know what you thought down the comments below and uh, as always, I will see YOU in the next video... Buh~bye!!! ["Crazy La Paint" by Minimusicman] 
[DETECTIVE] WHO DID THIS? It certainly wasn't me. No, no. Somebody, NOT ME, must have moved it between the time I was the last person alone with the body in the room and then stepped out for a few minutes to take care of some personal business that you don't need to know about! Could have been anybody... except me. [BUTLER] What the hell happened here? [DETECTIVE] The body's been moved. [BUTLER] On its own? [DETECTIVE] No, of course not. Unless it did, in which case we've got way bigger problems than a simple murder. [CHEF] What the hell happened here? [BUTLER] The body's moved. [CHEF] On its own? [DETECTIVE] We haven't quite ruled that out just yet, but let's not forget we've got a murderer. [COLONEL] Bully! Quite a storm out there, eh, chaps? What are you doing huddled in here in fear? [CHEF] We have a zombie problem. [COLONEL] Ah, Homo necrosis! The MOST dangerous game. Well, if someone needs to put the old lad down again, I'm well up for the privilege. [DETECTIVE] What do you mean by "again", and what do you mean by "privilege"? [COLONEL] I'm just saying, I've got plenty of... e-experience on the matter. [CHEF] So do I. [DETECTIVE] Yeah, that just raises more questions. [COLONEL] Well, I'm off to the grounds to see if I can catch a whiff of the old bag of bones, eh? [BUTLER] Wait, weren't you and Mark the same age? [COLONEL's maniacal laugh ends with a cough] [DETECTIVE] All right, I don't trust him. Then again, I don't trust anyone. Alright, lock this place down. Secure the front gate. I don't want anyone in or out of this place until we get to the bottom of this. [BUTLER] Locks won't keep people from getting out, sir. [CHEF] Locks won't, but Chef will. [DETECTIVE] Look, you're a real smart son of a bitch. Handsome, too. Beautiful, even. BUT, we don't have time for this. I think we forgot the most important question of all during our arousing game of whodunit. Why? Why? Come, walk with me. Why did he invite us all here? Why tonight? He said we were celebrating something, but he never specified what. It's almost as if this whole shindig of a hootenanny was just a ruse. Mark was my friend: had been for years. But then he went quiet. I knew something was wrong, I just never figured out what. Now I guess I never will. Look, I'm gonna level with you; you're my new partner. I've been working with him for years. Now I've been doing this for a long time, and I know something is wrong. There is a murderer— [thunder and lightning] —here amongst us, and we need to find him. Now you look like a trustworthy...somebody. I know we just met, but I am an excellent judge of character. Excellent like a fox. I smiled and fed them a line of bullshit. The truth was, I couldn't trust them any more than the other skuzz around here. But like my late partner once said right before he died, best to keep your enemies close. Wink wink. You don't look like you have a reason to kill him. And if you do... [laughs] Best to keep your enemies close, eh? Wink wink. So, the real question we should be asking is: Who stood to gain the most from Mark's death? Now, in my thorough analysis of the corpse's anal cavity, I discovered that in addition to being stabbed 37 times, he was also poisoned, beaten, strangled, drowned, and shot, in that order. Now, if you ask me, that's a lot of trouble to go through to knock off one guy, and it sure as shit is no accident. No. No, my friend. There's gonna be no simple candlestick-in-the-library solution to this whole...puzzle. So, we're gonna have to do the detective-ly thing and go through the victim's most private and personal possessions. Well, after you. [sighs] Looks rough, but I don't think he was killed here. Take a look around, see if you find anything, but BE CAREFUL. I've lost three partners before to bedroom booby traps. Make sure you don't tamper with any evidence! Lemme know if you find anything. You find a clue? [COLONEL] You're quite on the case, aren't you? Say, detective? May I borrow your friend here? [DETECTIVE] Yeah, sure. Don't worry, partner, I'll handle it from here. [COLONEL] Bully. Take a walk with me. I thought that it was about time that we got to... KNOW each other. Someplace far, far away from the prying eyes of, uh... anyone else. Come with me. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but...you and the Mayor know each other, right? He's a good man, that one. We've been fast friends for as long as I can remember. Now there came a time when I could have said the same thing about Mark, but.. Well, best not to speak ill of the dead. Oh! The pool hasn't aged a day! GERONIMO! [MAYOR] Have you seen the Colonel? I thought I heard him. I need to speak with him. I may have been a little short at our last encounter. Well, if you do see him, let me know. [COLONEL] BULLY! [COLONEL] Oh, life needs a bit of madness, eh, chap? Now, what were we talking about? Oh, yes! The grisly business inside. Well, I'm sure I'm not the first to say that our host had a great deal of enemies as of late. My prying eye might suspect that the people who worked for him might have reason to stab him in the back. God knows he's a tough son of a bitch to work for. Oh, the old golf course! I-I'll fetch my clubs. [MAYOR] Colonel? Damn, I thought I heard him. No matter. Would you accompany me? There's something that I would...very much like to discuss with you. Now, I know you've been assisting our... intrepid detective with his investigation, but... I have to bring some concerns of mine to the forefront. If we look at this situation logically, we can only assume that the killer who struck down our dear friend Mark was with us last night. And while I would stake my life on the innocence of the Colonel or yourself, can we really say the same of our beloved detective? Or worse yet, Mayhaps our counting skills aren't as good as we assume them to be. And mayhaps... in the shadows of this manor, unseen to any of us, lay hidden... ...a murderer. [Thunder and lightning] [Gunshot] [DETECTIVE] I don't know what you're playing at but you better lower your weapon, you murderer! [COLONEL] I bloody well won't, you're the one that assaulted me! For all I know, you could be the murderer! [CHEF] What the fu-Ooh! [DETECTIVE] Last chance, drop your weapon! [BUTLER] Master's prized vase... [MAYOR] Everyone, please! I know we're all on edge, but can't we resolve this amicably? [DETECTIVE] On edge?! This PSYCHO tried to SHOOT ME! [COLONEL] That's a bold-faced lie! I was merely doing some light target practice! [BUTLER] Inside?! [COLONEL] Well, yes, I couldn't go on the grounds now with that bloody chef in my way, could I? [CHEF] You're damn right! You should've remembered that, Private! Besides, you're not my boss anymore! [COLONEL] It's "Colonel" now. [DETECTIVE] Enough of this horseshit! You knew I was onto you and you were trying to whack me off before I could finger you! As the murderer! [COLONEL] I will not be called a murderer in my own home! [WOMAN] STOP!

Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and welcome (silently) Why...? Put it on. Ethan: Oh. Ok. *Tyler burps into his arm* Ethan: OHH Good song! Mark: Anyway Welcome to a very perverse game of truth. telling-ness. The cold. Hard. Truth. This is the Truth or Wet Challenge *lip smack* I hate that. This is the Truth or Death Challenge Either way What's gonna happen is. We've got Ethan here And he can't. He can't hear a word that were saying so.. He is completely ignorant to everything that we're gonna be doing to him. And uh... he has no idea why he came over here today He's sitting in that chair And we're gonna play a kind of game of 2 truths and a lie. Basically, I'm gonna quietly whisper into his mouth EYES. I'm gonna use my lips to shoot my information into his eyes. He's gonna try to read my lips and not only does he have to determine what I said. He has to judge whether what he
 thinks I said was a truth. Or a lie. Makes sense? If it doesn't you'll see real soon. Are you ready? Ethan: Good drums. Ready? Mark: Yeah. Ethan: Yeah. Mark: Ready? Ethan: I guess so. Mark: Ok. Ethan: Don't have a choice Mark: Alright. Are you ready? Ethan: Am I ready? You bet I'm not. But I'll do it. Mark: Okay cool. Do you know what's happening here? Ethan: Okay? Cool, so do you know what's happening here? Mark: Nice. Ethan: Yes. Mark: Nope *Kathryn and Amy giggle* Ethan: Nope Mark: Okay. He's got double layer protection. Not only does he have music blasting, but we've got industrial-strength earmuffs here that are meant for construction sites with loud operating machinery so I'm gonna come up with the truth or a lie, and he's gonna judge it as such. *Mark whispers* I grew up in a small town called Milford Ethan: I get three tries right? Mark: Umhmm... Ethan: Okay. One more time a little bit slower *Mark repeats himself* I grew up in a small town called Milford. Ethan: Ah! I grew up in a small town called Milford. Ethan: Aah! Wait! That's what you said! Isn't it? Mark: *whispers* And? Ethan: Wait you can go again. You don't have to do that yet. I grew up in a small town called Milford. That's all you SAID!!! WHY!!!! *Tyler dumps the ice water on Ethan* Aah!That's so cold! OOoooohhhh My ASS! It's going in my ass! Mark: Was it a truth or was it a lie? Ethan: OH! *Ethan and Tyler laugh* Mark: You idiot! *Ethan and Tyler continue laughing* *Facepalm* Mark: You deserve that one. *Ethan laughs* So he's gonna be in that hot seat Ethan: COMPLETELY forgot! Mark: Yeah! *Tyler starts laughing again* Wow! Ethan: Is that true? Mark: Yes. Ethan: I just know that's a place in Ohio. Mark: Yeah. So uh... The point of this is. Once he's able to NOT get ice dunked on him We rotate out who's sitting in that chair. And you would have had that! Ethan: I would have immediately! Mark: Yeah! you would've! Mark: Yeah! you would've!
Ethan: Shit! Mark: Yeah! Alright put it back on. Ethan: This is the worst! Mark: And he has to keep getting dunked until he gets it right so until that happens Who knows? All right, so now that Ethan was an idiot He has to stay in that seat But Tyler and I would get to switch and now Tyler's at risk of being in that seat next so- Tyler: Are you ready? Ethan: Am I ready? Yyyeah-
Tyler: I won a state title playing water polo Ethan: Uhhh I think he said something about water polo go again Tyler: I won a state title playing water polo. Ethan: I think he said, Oooh wait... a minute Sir *Ethan giggles* I think you said "I won a state's in water polo" or something along those lines. Which I believe to be true? *Terrified and painful screams produced from Ethan* AAAh NoooO Mark: I'll give it to him. *Mark Laughs* Ethan: I'm good?
Tyler: Yeah. *Mark Laughing* Mark: Are you ready?
Tyler: *shouting* I can't hear a word you're saying but I am ready. Ethan: he's VERY loud Tyler: *still shouting*  aAh thats cold ass, I got ass ice, ice on my ass Tyler:  I'm terrified How loud am I?
 Mark: Very. He knows so much about me, I gotta be very careful about this one. I worked summer vacations in school, working as a carpenter Tyler: I worked during the summer as a carpenter. That would be true Mark: *mumbling sadly* That's true.
 Ethan: fuck Ethan: That's okay, okay Mr. Man time to get your medicine Okay, Ready? *Claps to get Mark's attention* Ready? When I was young I had a lizard named Cody Mark: That was like, that was like a paragraph. Tyler: That's what yours was like! You can't hear me. Ethan: when I was young I had a lizard named Cody. Mark: Ahhhh Mark: When I was ten I had Uh- Uh, AAHHhh, UUUhhhhhh Mark: Llliiight house on Tooonggaa...False.
 Ethan: Incorrect Mark: NOooOooOOo Ethan: Incorrect Mark: Gah! Oooohhh *General noises of cold displeasure* Ethan: Good. Very good, very good. Do you want to know what I said? Mark: NO! Ethan: Okay *giggles* Mark: What did he say? Tyler: In college I played lacrosse In college, I played lacrosse Mark: *loudly* In art school, I played lacrosse? False?!

Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and I'm officially back from my hiatus. Now you may be wondering what I've learned over this period and the first and foremost thing that I've learned is how to be The best youtuber that I can be, but in order to explain that I need to show you something can you come with me? actually wait, hang on, take this camera and uh, just follow me for a bit. 'kay, don't look *low 'yehyehyeh' noise* BOOM! New car. I'm not-I'm not out of my mind here that's-like that's Right? Think of all the things that you can do with a new car like Hang on, I gotta get- I gotta get a map. Chica where's my map? Where's my map? Chica come on You wing 'em One, two, three Peter, Paul, and Mary What can you do with a car? What can you do with a car? Chica What can you do with a car? So you see, right? You see what I'm talking about? If you have a car you get... Respecc. You get lots of respecc. You can do anything for everybody. You can do people favors. You can give'em rides And then also like Okay, this is a more important thing like sure respect is whatever and you can go up to like... I dunno... Bakersfield, if you want to go up there and die. You can go to San Diego if you want to get swarmed at Comic-Con Oxnard, I didn't- didn't even know there was a city... and the most insane thing in my mind Is the nearest Cracker Barrel to where I live in LA, is four and a half hours away in Las Vegas. But if I got a new vehicle that can take me the distance that I need to go, I can take Chica and we can go to Cracker Barrel whenever we want! We can just go right.... We can just go! Right?! Cool! But not only that like things change *Attempt #1* *Attempt #2* When you have everything that you need, you can go pretty much everywhere so long as you have a vehicle right? So what do we need to do? We need to get a car yeah okay Coooool *brosqueak* So all this adds up to something that we know how to do All this is spelling out something very simple something that we already know We don't know how to do this So to get the answers that we need to know, we need to call on the one person that does know exactly what to do What we're going to be doing what we're doing. Here we are to do-what we're-he knows how to do- Tyler He used to be a car salesman before he came out to L.A So if i call him he will know what to do. He's a good man always reliable trustworthy always there for you. Tyler! Tyler: Yeah? where'd you-where's your face? Tyler: Uh, i'm driving out of a parking garage right now Oh..... Are you busy today? Tyler: I mean kind of but I can, hold on let me pull over cuz i got this thing very urgent thing had this whole life changing like conversation with myself about Tyler: Alright
yeah about how The only thing i need is a new car and uhhh.. the only thing I need is help doing that so if you're busy that's kind of like explosively detrimental to my cause Oh hi hi
Tyler: Hi there yeah Tyler: The funniest thing is, it came through audio-wise in the car so I didn't realize this was a Face Time call. I thought you were just calling me on the phone No, no i would never do that. Yeah, so uhhh you're not like going to a convention today are you? Tyler: Uhhh sort of Fuck. Alright, so we gotta go with plan-B Tyler's out so What's the next best thing? Tyler what's the next best thing? The next best thing for what? For getting a car. If you're not available I don't know how to do that on my own Tyler: I mean, if you're looking to get a new car the first thing you do anyway is research based upon what you need/want I want respect Tyler: Uhh that sounds like you need..... I don't know how to get that with a car Well then wha.... What... Alright fine bomb! Am on mah own so I guess we're on our own How do we get a car that can give me respect respect attractive older W/M seeking attractive female girlfriend roommate so Tyler's no help at all we knew that from the get-go We got to go on our own so Dealerships are fine and dandy but if we don't have a car how do we get to a dealership maybe Amy could get us around *awkward await* *Sarude - Dankstromae enters the motion* Fuck, she's not there we have We have-- if we think about like exactly what we need then everything else falls into place Right, so take for example like what does a car give to you? Car gives you mobility. Mobility. *trippy* You can haul, you can haul... you know like, u-haul, put me haul, we haul Cracker Barrel? Cracker Barrel. Respecc. Of course, thank you. Okay, for mobility it only really needs wheels. for hauling you need like a lot of cargo space for cracker barrel you need... ..wheels. For respect you need size. everyone knows that the bigger you are *MLG pen cap* Hey, pay attention. Everyone knows the bigger you are the more respect you have it's like it's like a factor of like dominance or something in testosterone like monkey shit if you're bigger like you get more respect it's why cats spread out real far, why peacocks have a big'ole tail That's why I have the biggest head in the world. *realization* What's the biggest vehicle that we got? a semi-truck right? No it's that land crawl if it takes space parts to The lawn pad that's the biggest vehicle. But i don't think i can get a license for that You need a specialized in for a semi too - i could do a pickup truck but i don't want to be a douche actually it's a fact in in Los Angeles if you have a pickup truck I know this from experience if you have a pickup truck you have To pay an extra fee if the back is uncovered because it's classified as a work vehicle and not a regular vehicle So if you're gonna have a truck and you're gonna cover it anyway why not have a van? *ding ding ding winning question* anyone in... the L.A area... selling... a van. they don't take that seriously?! My fans know I don't goof'em right? I didn't say oh wait van listen it's not suspicious I didn't they didn't ask me why i need a van... I just need a van! a white would a white one Why do they say i could not say a white one why is everyone Everyone's assuming I said a white van I didn't say a white van. What was so scary about a van? Are they scared of how much respect i'll have a minivan no that's not even a van minivans no! someone tried to build this shower in this one 120,000 miles It's four wheel drive which is handy for when we go off road hunting Bigfoot or whatever or go to a Cracker Barrel that's really off the beaten path Hup! Hop! *motherly instinct baps* Comeon! Hop! Hop!.. There we go... Wha'dya think of this? it's pretty good it's got a lot of miles on it but it's really cool it's got like wood paneling on the sides it's got a wooden floor it's got like a seat/bed in the back and a lot of storage space if it runs well that was gonna be pretty good right chica yeah get your leash we gotta go We gotta go Chica! We gotta go She's, so much for accommodating a dog so how long you been driving uber?

-No, you see. You get to sleep, I need to get out of levy. Thank you -thank you, five star Hi this is uh Mark. Umm... the guy who interested in the van. Oooohh ah that looks so cool. -It's a lil' dusty

There you have it? We got a van. That was easier than I thought.
Who needs Tyler? Yeah. I bought a van all by myself. I mean, you helped but... it was mostly me. I was doing the talking there. There's only one thing left to do after this... And you know what that is. *sick montage time* WE GOT A VAAAAAAAAN! WOOOO! It's alright, Chica. Good girl. We got a van! WE GOT A VAN, BUPPY! UP! UP, UP! UP! Good girl, good girl. Okay, wow. We did it, we got a van. We didn't need anybody's help. No Tyler, no nothin' You were of great help though. Thank you so much and now we can do whatever we want we can go around L.A, we can help people, we can take road trips, we can go camping, we can just do.. mundane bullshit It doesn't really matter... but thanks for being there for me So what should we do next? I-..I don't even know at this point I've got so many ideas but maybe I could get your help from it? And I think it's only fair that you get to name the van it was kind of your idea after all so What do you think? I was thinking like, "Shamu," or "Gwendolyn," or- or "Bertha," but I dunno. If you got an idea, let me know and thanks again. See you tomorrow Buh bye! *brosqueak*

So buckle up, turn up your volume in your headphones, turn out the light, and get ready to have the pants spooked off of you. Because it's about to get dank. And it's about to get dark. And it's about to get spooky. Why do I need to sprint? Why would I need to sprint? Oooooo. What is that? Nothing. Absolutely dick-diddly. (surprise) Oh, hey! (uncomfortable laughter) Even down-darker-deeper. Oh! Floor 1! (squelching) I don't like that at all... Okay. "No hope." Yeah, no joke. Okay. Alright, well, whatever's down here, it's not gonna be a match for me. So it might as well give up, go fuck itself... ...and get out of my face before I even get close to it. (growling){oh shit} Hi?! What did I just see?! OH, HI! (scared battle cry) Okay! Alright! That's not OOkay. That's not okay! (growling/panting) Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, what are you doin' over there? (surprised laughter) Wh... What was that? Why am I down here with it? Why did I need to come down into the cellar... ...when I was perfectly fine upstairs? Oh! Is this another way down? (high-pitched) OOOHHH! (confidently)I think I'm winning! Not a hundred-percent sure, but I think I'm winning. Oookay. What did I pick up? (metallic screeching) Oh, I picked up keys so that I could open that. I know that slinky-sounding keys... So you're just... Not gonna explain whatever the Hell was glowing in the darkness over there? There was two burning eyeballs? And its giant, luminescent body? And its... rather pungent odor? You weren't gonna say anything about that? Am I supposed to be looking for something? Am I supposed to be finding something? Is there something in the darkness that I need? And if you KNOW... Tell me RIGHT NOW before I punch you in the dick! Anybody? If you even HAVE a dick. Your big, round body didn't suggest anything to the "dickest" nature. So I'm gonna assume that's a "No," and I'm gonna carry on my way. HELLLLLOOOOO!!? See, I can't get a bearing on where I am because it's just a buncha... of convoluted hallways with no end ! {like Vanish?} If I know my thing about-- (roar) OOOHH HI, THERE'S MORE THAN ONE OF YOU! THAT'S a new predicament that I have to deal with and I can't sprint for very far because I'm out of shape! I ate too many doughnuts over at CAAMMPP! (huffing, growling) Okay, aright, you can stop huffing and puffing in my ear! It's NOT gonna do you any good! I cannot sprint for NOTHIN'. (laughs) I...this is like... this is like a... this like a... BASEMENT or somethin'. It's like a spooky cellar. {OH, HE SAID IT!} (mumbles) alright, I think I'm okay. (mumbles) I don't where I'm supposed to be going! This, it all leads into nothing. It's just a whole lotta NOTHING. (Mark turns into a prepubescent boy) Man, if I didn't know any better... ...I'd say that I'm running in CIrCles. Well, pfft... Found my way back to the beginning of the map. That is good for me. At least now I know that I'm making absolutely no progress, So I should just bend over and kiss my ass good-bye. OH, hello! (metal clattering) I need a key, that is obvious to me. (monotonous) Ooohh, happy day. I'm full of glee. {Ya sure about that?} (quietly) alright, ok. So I gotta find a key. It was PROBABLY in somewhere that I've been before but I didn't see it because I didn't know I was looking for one, whatthehellisthatSOUND?! Well, la-dee-dee, okay. Alright. Well, if we're just gonna be like that, then I'm just gonna ssuuuuuu.....ck somethin'. Hey, wait a minute! (laughs) Wait! I've solved the conundrum! (metallic clattering) (mockingly) I seem to be on the other side of the fence now. I guess that means I'm doing just okay! (laughs) Nothing, ain't nothing gonna be bothering me no how, no way. How you guys? You guys being bothered at all no way no how? So, obviously this game wasn't supposed to take itself too terribly seriously. It's kind of a ridiculous concept It's kinda silly because the enemies... aren't exactly... ...the most threatening of sorts. BUT! At least Grandpa was nice to me upstairs. I don't know why he shoved me in this dark, dank cellar filled with MONSTERS, but hey, I can always assume that he's looking out for the best for me. (mumbles) Man, this is gonna be flip-dicking-impossible. (mumbles) I have-- (snarl) Bbb... Butte-- (manly scream) Oh... (gross squelching) {There ya go, Mark! Just run right into the damned thing.} {Don't you smirk like that. You know you messed up, even if it was a cheap jumpscare.} Well... If that's how you're gonna be, huh? Okay, alright! I'll try again? (metallic screeching) I don't know if you're randomly generated, or if I have to find a very specific exit. ah WOAH. Hi, friend. Ohhhooo...kay, let's NOT do that. Let's not dance this dance. I can't go anywhere. I'm crapping my pants. HOkay! Well... (groan of relief) {Don't do that too soon...} Hey, I thought you changed your mind! {Told ya.} (sucks in deep breath) bRUHAAHHH (someone slamming their fists on a piano) (more gross squelching) At least I explode blood all over the screen... OOO! Wh-I saw the butt-ass of something that I didn't like! And that is a very rare occurrence-- (roar) HOKAY! I SAW THE FRONT-ASS END OF SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT LIKE! (angry gasp) hHEY! Yeah, I thought it was gonna be a dead end-- ooooo... (song-like) I think we got away from ittt! (manly scream) OH MY GOD! OKAY! ALRIGHT THEN! IF YOU'RE JUST GONNA DO THAT TO ME THEN I'M JUST GONNA PUNCH YOU IN THE DICK! IF YOU EVEN HAVE A DICK! Oooh, it's right behind me, isn't it? {yup!} Kay, maybe not. {Ya sure?} Oh... Alright, we're fine. I mean, we're not FINE because I can't find the frickin' way outta here. At least, I'M fine. I feel fine. I look fine. DAMN... I am fine. (roar) WOAH, WOAH, DON'T DO THAT! (incredulously) DON'T DO THE ROAR! Jeez, what kind of T-Rex-ass roar was that?! (snarl)
(mockingly) Alright, Mr. Attitude over there. Eh, you ever just have a bad feeling crawling down your spine... ...as if you know some horrible monstrosity is lurking around every corner? oooOOOOOooo! (creak) Never mind! Those were the pleasant tingles of success! I thought I was gonna-- (screams) OH, GRANDMA! GRANDMA, GRANDMA NO! NO I DON'T WANT THE COOKIES--
(moan) (Mark screams) (death scream) {Goddammit...}
(more squelching) Alright... If that's how we're gonna be... then I see-- (more manly screaming) (laughing) Fucking God damn it. Why? Why right out-- OH SHIT! I'M FUUUCKED! HEY, GRAANDMA!
(weird moaning) WH--
{STOP IT WITH THE SQUELCHING!} ...okay... This seems to be a predi-- PFFT! Nee (mocking) I'll just poke my head out. Maybe I shouldn't find me flien-- Wh-- (blows raspberry) Maybe I shouldn't talk out my ASS before I actually-- Ooooohh... I'm fuucked. (weird laugh) You better not come around this corner. I'm naked! You wouldn't want to see anything about that, right? Oooo, yes, you would. Okay So, I just got to find my way out of here... I just gotta keep an eye out... for the cellar door. And when we find the cellar door, that's when we know we're gonna be able to esca-- (growl) OOHP... nnNO nnNNOHO No, no, no, no. no, no, no, no. Uh oh! No no n-- UH OH! Is that Grandma? Oh, I have a feeling that is GrandMA! Gran-moo-millie? Oh. OH! It's NOT! It's a comforting BARREL... of FIRE! Maybe I can throw myself in it so I wouldn't have to subject myself to anything that's happening over here. What is THAT? Nothing. Great. I'm glad. Okay. I don't know where I am. WH-OH! Grandma, no. Please, Grandma, no. Grandma, no, no, no. Grandma, NO! GRANDMA, NO!
(moan) Grandmaaaa... What have I told you the-- AEHH! Nice lip! AHH Well that's not good. I'm fuuuubbed. I'm flubbed. Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo! Run, run, now! This is bad! Hey! Grandma! No! No! No! No! OooohhhHHOOOO How did I survive? (nervous laughter) (quietly) okay... alright. whatever. (panicked panting)
{Mark, that sounds wrong...} OH! I've made it. Great! I am so glaaaaaddd. (voice crack) What the fuck? I didn't think this game was actually gonna be scary! Geez. The way it was advertising itself just made it seem like it was just this ridiculous horror game and I was gonna play it and be like "Yeah, look at how stupid it is!" Geez, didn't know I'd be screaming for my life the whole time. Yeah, well, whatever. Best to get my screambox a good exercise every once in a while. (groans) I can't see nothing. Ohp! Grandma! Ohp... {It is at this moment that Mark realises he's fucked.}
Oh, Grandma! Hey! Woah, woah. Very stuck grandma. Okay, alright, goodbye! Yee, yee, yee! Nooooo! Noooor! NO, n--! NOOI! Noi! Noi. No, Grandma, stop. Stop, Grandma! Grandma, that's enough! Grandma, your animalistic sense of dread, it's just not... welcome here! {jumpscare in 3..} {2...} {1...} (scream) What the FUCKING... FUCKING HELL?! Oh my GOD! (laughs)(voice crack) My voice! AH! I am very much puberty! (high-pitched) OkAY! ALRIGHT! WELL THEN! I think I'm gonna end that one there. So that is... Pfft. That is a Spooky Cellar The Spooky Cellar is ridiculous, but scary.

Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and welcome back to Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator. now I have been playing this game in a way some might misconstrue as being illogical, horrifying and death defying But that's the only way that I can play this game and still call myself the king of Five Nights at Freddy's because there is an easy way to play this game you can play it with no risk always tossing the scrap back out in the yard but I - I don't play that shit I play the tough way. Because I take the hard road no matter what it is and I'm gonna beat this thing with all of the heart inside in my soul There also are some secrets inside the games themselves like this fruit maze game and this racer game have secrets inside them I can't play them right now because I have no play tokens, so I'm going to see to the end of the game right now if this is the end of the game I'm about to see [sparkly sound] and then hopefully, I'm going to be able to get to more of the secrets later or, get something done so here we go. I gotta go into this with a lot of concentration I know that it's not going to go well for me, but that's fine. Because I have the eye of the tiger and the ears of a hawk and everything is in my power to be - to be able to do this Because I know exactly when you're crawling up my own ass! and I know how to exactly how to get you out of there [computer noise] ugh [animatronic noise on right] ooooh hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey No. Stop that.

Lally! Lally, Lally, Lally, Lally. Hey, how's it going? Don't mind Lally, and me screaming. me screaming has nothing to do with Lally. It's got nothing to do with you so you get out of here. I heard something...I heard somethin-something... Heard something! Springtrap: "You may not recognize me at first, but I assure you, it's still me" Baby [overlapping]: "It feels like home" [Mark uh-ohing at various volumes] Ayiii! Ayiiii! I don't know which way to go! [Loud ad music] [Mark screaming] WACKY WART PASTE NO NO NO NO Hey, how's it going, you didn't hear anything about no wart paste, did you?

The goodNESS THAT WE HAVE INSIDE OUR HEARTS All of the goodness shining out through our- faces with light and shining brightness beautiful goodness. as far as the eye can see.

Voice: "Although you have, indeed, been called." Voice: "You have all been called here." Voice: "Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune." Voice: "A labyrinth with no exit." Voice: "A maze with no prize." Voice: "You don't even realize that you are trapped." Voice: "Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles" Voice: "chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near" Voice: "yet somehow out of reach."

[upbeat music] Narrator: "Congratulations on completing your work week! We apologize if your situation wasn't presented to you in a completely honest fashion when you first started"
He he heehe Narrator: "but it was important that your intentions and actions be genuine." Haah!
Narrator: "Here at Fazbear Entertainment, we value fun, family, and food," I bet you do.
Narrator: "but more importantly, we value our commitment to atoning for past mistakes" "and tying up loose ends." [Laugh Happily] "Thank you for your participation." "There is no need for you to return to work next week, as Fazbear Entertainment is no longer a corporate entity." "Please accept this certificate of completion." "Goodbye for now, and thank you for taking this journey with us." What??? Oh, I just got a pang through my heart. Was that the end of everything?? [credit music starts playing] Oh my god! Was that the end of everything?! Molten Freddy, Tutorial Unit, Cassette Man... Wow! I think that's really it! 'Cause that wrapped up a lot of actual lore, that gave actual answers. That was incredible! That was really fun--and this game is free, by the way! I don't know if I ever said that--this game, that I'm playing, is free! It's...[sighs] Scott! Wow! Scott! That's--I'm--I'm really, really touched. And heartbroken, too, because that's the end of it! And I think this is-- Yeah--this is--The End! I think this is... like, the end. Now I'm not- I'm certain there are other mysteries to be told, but I think this is, as far as the Five Nights at Freddy's story--like main story, probably goes. I think this probably wraps up everything. This-this ties it all up in a bow and... Man, there it is. There you have it. It's crazy. I guess that's it. Is there anything more? There's like--there-there also are the secrets of the-the minigames inside of it, like the various things. Even the candy robot--apparently that does tell you stories if you-if you do go into that. Now you could go through this game, and you could play it, like, getting more money with less risk, and that's always a possibility, but at the same time-- Aw, certificate of completion! What other certificates are there?! What other certificates?! I wanna know! Aww, I wanna know!! God... Uh, but that was really cool. I got to admit, that was really, really cool. It was something that was different from the whole Five Nights At Freddy's experience as we know it, but in a way, it fit so well. Like the-the simulator aspect of it, the weirdness, and the funniness, like... That's what it is. It's not like-- These games aren't, like, solely divided into scariness and uh- uh- thrill, and like mystery and theories, it's-it's a mixture of all of it. And that's what made Five Nights At Freddy's so magical in the first place, is that it was a fun, satirical, dry humor, and it-it-it also was extremely terrifying, and it's that perfect mixture that always made Five Nights at Freddy's so wonderful. And this game really captured it. Leaning more on the silliness, but actually leaning really heavy into the darker tones of it. It bridged this gap really nicely, and I really enjoyed that. But before I go, I'm gonna see what happens if I hit continue on this and see where that leads me. Is this...it's Saturday. Ah, okay, so I think I just go through it again. So. That's not what it is. So I'm gonna leave this at this, And, uh, maybe I will try to beat the other modes. But thank you everybody so much for watching, thank you for joining me on this journey of Five Nights at Freddy's, I know that Five Nights at Freddy's will not be over in the hearts of the fans, and maybe even Scott will make more Five Nights at Freddy's games in the future, but as far as the main story goes, I think that is a really nice conclusion to answer a lot of unanswered questions and get that out there. So. Thank you everybody so much for watching, let me know what you think down in the comments below, let me know if you want to see more of this and me to dive into the deeper mysteries of it, and as always, I will see YOU in the next video! BUH-BY [distortion] [creepy music, computerized voice] S A V E H I M [powering off noise] [triggered golden freddy jumpscare]

Ok, ok perfect Wade I know exactly where they are, you wanna see? I don't think you know (x3) You'll never know which one of us is which Choose wisely You have to… You have to guess which one is which Mark seems like the kind of person to go to the straight… ahead Okay, well why wo… Why would you want to kill one over the other –If you, if you, if you get it wrong, then we win –Yeah –Wade. Wade can we conference? –Yeah –I think I have a solution You can't bomb both of us at the same time Never mind, that was my solution Wait, I have an idea for a competition. How about this… Uh, I'll be right back, I'll be right back We'll be here Oh yeah, if you grab a penis, Mark can't resist but grab it That's exactly what my idea was That's cheating No. You can't.

I'll call your bluff It's a… It's a tricky dick Tricky dicky Oh God no Oh that's a girthy boy –What a boober on that –Mark can't resist I'm strong [Back to random ass noises]

Hello everybody ! My name is Markiplier, and welcome back to 'Getting Over It' with Bennet Foddy. I've calmed down.. I've relaxed. I've, gotten away from the game, and oddly enough, When I stopped playing after I was so angry, I actually started playing again. Just very casually because.. This game is fascinating in that.. It makes me exceptionally angry, but you can see.. I'm back to where I once was. It makes me exceptionally angry, but at the same time.. Not really. (err) It's..it's understandably like.. my fault. I know.. I know I kept complaining about how the controls were all borked and all that stuff But ee- it's understa- EUUGH-- wooAAAAH ugh.. It's understandably my fault. That doesn't mean it's any less frustrating.. But I think like.. If there's any lesson to be learned about it, is like that's part of the experience. It's what he's talking about.. As much as I still don't believe in the, the phyllis of all, philosophical Yammer slammer of whatever. woAAAAAAAH welp. oof apparently there's a way to get up there with that which I don't know how that would be true I'm just trying it because why not what've I got better to do with my life than this... hup Yep Man that that's a doozy of an order okay. Let me try to do it then not that way because I'm a little bit whuooo ah very scary very scary don't do that ah agh WAH Jesus sure does like to swing swong me wherever the hell it likes to send me as well wherever I end up wha? AAhhhh. ahhh. Okay, I didn't get the shortcut in fact it might be better of me just to like emphasize work on that particular whAAH There we are That particular shortcut because I am no better at getting this particular jump here Than I am at that, but you know we'll see what happens See what happens? Okay, that's an option alrighty then hm ouuuuu Alright, I'll take it I'll take it I'll take that to the bank. I'll take that to the bank Wow nOOOAHH Swing swongin swings Wong and I don't like the swing swong okay, back up here now a Yi, how did I do this before I I remember the way I did way I did it was I Shot up bounced off this wall. No why hey, how's it going? Oh? Yeah? Oh yah yah yah yah. Yah. Okay. You're just as frustrating I don't know. Why but it's only when I decide to record it that it's frustrating me whoa Whoa why how did you get under that I have no idea you sack of shit alright eh. Ya know Close closer to the truth Whoa did I lower my mouth? What what's going on the mouse sensitivity feels lower than it was before and I I don't remember Wait that's not the normal Wait is that that's not what that's not what it was right. That's not what it was right? Okay, WHOA whoa? Hey there sonny jim you cannot do that and that would be greatly appreciated Yeah like that then drop here go up here whoa like this Gentle as the summer mOON Gentle as a butter flip okay There we go Go right here nestled in there see the problem is if you go straight up You'll bounce but it you got to be a little bit out oo ah eEEH Whoa whoa whoa that was a lot of SLIIIIDIIIING Happening and I don't appreciate it Wha-whoa I'm climbing like spider-man okay here we go no yes Nope, nope okay up up nope Okay, see I've got better control of it.

It's fucking easy Jesus Christ, I did this already *get ready for the war cry* AHHHHH! Come o- WHAT WAS THAT?! What the fuck was that? Oh my god, yeah, I'll do it that way, but I I know it oh my god What is going on with this fucking mouse? I and yes, I'm blaming the mouse right now because the mouse is just being a fucking idiot. The rules are... If the rule- AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH! WHAT THE FUCK??! If the rules are si- OH MY GOD! Just fucking GO! And now I'm having trouble in the most basic shit! It doesn't make any goddamn sense! And I'm not- it's not like I'm taking it qui- What is going on with my fucking MOUSE?!!!! FUCK you! Do you work still? Do you fucking work? Oh, wow, it's still fucking works. Great. Aw, I just spilled a FUCKING DRINK! God DAMMIT! FUCK ME! I don't even know why I'm so mad I don't even know why. I don't. I really don't know why. I went into this episode. I was like alright.

It's like 10, huh uh AH NOOO GODDAMNIT WHAT THE FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCK *mark rethinks his entire life* It's so Fucking stupid And yes, I know there's speedrunners that can do it in a couple of minutes and like they make no mistakes going up And yeah, they've probably been practicing for a long time, but if anything they could say that the,
 oh God. Well that was that was It's just the inconsistency like that's the only thing that I really don't like Well oh well I Kinda kinda a little bit well at least it bypassed a lot of bullshit Let's see if I can stay up here, which I guess. I'm not gonna be able to that's my big prediction Yep there we go that's my big whodda' thought my big prediction came true Hey there we go whoa wait hang on no no no no I said there we go there we go Okay, Wow I got it apparently I think I think I know the trick to get up there now not really. It's not really a trick. It's just go launch yourself Whoa big boy big boy with the big attitude Whoa whoa whoa whoa easy easy easy there. What was that jeezums Ohhhhhhh ohhhhhh :O I just learned a fundamental mechanic about this game. This is why it's inconsistent. I had no idea *rethinks life again* When you move the mouse it returns *still in shock* Holy shit You guys don't understand how groundbreaking this is. Now I'm not saying that now that I know about this I'm gonna be suddenly good But this is the one thing of inconsistency that I was not getting When I move the mouse you see the cursor it returns To the head of the hammer That's what I was fighting That's what my hand is trying to correct. That's why oh Because I every time I land I'm trying to fight that movement When it automatically returns to the center. And that's why it follows the camera because if the position of the head moves, That makes so much more sense now again. That's not gonna make everything suddenly hunky-dory But it oh whoa it makes sense in my brain that if I don't wanna bounce I just stop moving the mouse whereas before I was trauma That makes so much more sense Whoa whoa whoa Yeah, hi yeah, okay, all right after a long arduous journey I have returned to my home Amongst the castles the the the the skyyyyyyyyy Yi Okay, all right somehow. I'm back here all right, so you need to go Mr. Orange Excuse you. You could almost reach it right there, so it's not even that high up But I got a swing out if I swing in, it's doom Whoop And there we have it okay, all right. Well. That's wonderful Yay, I'm not celebrating because I know that I could screw the ah screw this up at aaaany mooooo Moment Okay. Alright. Gotta make a move here ooo oooo oooo ah! noooooo NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO nooooooo oh no no no noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO (r.i.p.) Thank you everybody so much for watching That's all the time I got for getting over right now I've learned things but they don't help me. They do not help me. Nothing can help me Nothing can help me.

Hello, everybody. My name is Markiplier, and welcome back to Cuphead. So we're almost done with this game, which means that this might just be... where the end is! Inkwell hell. Why would I go there? Why did we and Mugman go there in the first place? That seems like a bad place to be. Hmm, alright! Well, into the casino I go. Ooh, hey! Yeah, I don't like that place. All bets are off! There's no option for simple difficulty.
You have to do this... Super strongy. "Well, lookie here," "you actually pulled it off." "But you've made me lose a bet and for that you ain't seeing the boss just yet." "We're gonna play a little game first!" That's.... Why? What, just 'cause you're a shitty person? Well, you're making this happen. This ain't my fault. Uh oh! Uhh, Yes? Wow! Oh! That wasn't a good thing was it? That.. Oh! Announcer: Good day for a swell battle! What?! Announcer: It's on!!! What?! Uh oh! That ain't good! Oh shit, okay? Well, this is weird. Ahh shit. Whoa, I'm not paying attention. Oh jeez! Oh wow! Okay, wow. Whew! This is gonna be a doozy. I can already tell, this is gonna be a doozy! How about I don't? What if I don't? Alright fine, I will... Health up! Oh! Okay, ahhh! Okay, all right. I get it. Is it like a... Is this like a... Rigmarole whole smash battle of a bunch of different things? Aw shit, goddamn it. I do not pay attention to that. Goddamn it. I'm not paying attention to the right things. Oh, shit, god. I've been hit by everything. Oh, fuck! Every single thing I got hit by, every single thing. Wow, that is ridiculous. Okay, here we go. Alright. Oh, hey, you're different. Oh, jeez, just as time as I learned something, I got to learn something else, huh? I see how it is. Whoa. He's dead now. Oh, I see what I need to do. That's horrible. This is horrible. I don't like you. I don't like you at all. At least you guys seem to have relatively simple mechanics. Oh, hate that. Please tell me that's all you do. Please tell me that's literally all you do. You've got no originality to you. That's it. This is all there is. Seems like it might be. Yeah, is this the only thing? Is this the only thing you got? Hey! That is the only thing you got! Hell yeah! Oh, yeah, baby, okay, oh jeez. Oh God, Oh, dice man. Don't do that. Don't do that. So it is a gambit. I gotta like-- I gotta-- oh, I see what I gotta do. Okay. All right, one two three, one two three, one two-- boink. Oh! Ahh.. I see. I see. It is a game. Oh, okay. I get it. Yeah, whoa, I don't like thi. Whoops, shit. I don't know what this is gonna do Yeah, I don't really like that one very much oh Hey, baby All right, well, I'm doing pretty good.

Ha ha, missed me. Oh, come on! I-I definitely balley-hooed that! I balley-hooed the balley-hoo out of that! I just moved my camera, I'm sorry all right there we go. Nobody saw anything right?

Okay. God. This is gonna be rough. Rough and tumble, but that's amazing. They-they built However many tiles there are bosses for this, like, wow, that is amazing. Okay, three or a two. Three (x5) Okay, at least I'm good at hitting the dice. But, somethin tells me I'm gonna bone it up. Announcer: It's on!!! Shit. Oh, goddamnit. Okay, I know I had my super there, but it wasn't a good place to use it. It was just, ah, it was really rough and tumble. Okay, if I get a three get a three, Three (x7) Okay, safe. I want a two. (x3) two-two-two Two! Got it. Aye-yai-yai. Let's hope the next one is something that I can use. I don't know if I got this one last time. I probably did, but, Nope! Haven't seen this one. Alright, gonna play it safe with this. Oh boy, play it safe, play- oh why?!? That is. What is-are you kidding me?!? I just happened to be standing in the way- Oh boy, this is awful. Wah! Oh boy. Oh boy, hate this! Hate this. Hate this. Okay. I'm gonna use this, but I don't know how well it's gonna go. Ah, sh-I got hit. I got hit again. I got hit a-fucking-gain. Ah, oh boy. That was useless. That was so useless. Oh, this is a bad one to get. This was a bad one to get. It's not that bad, I guess, but, Aw, jeez, it's still like-Ewahh! gross (x6)  very gross (x3) Don't like that. Gross gross gross gross. It's pretty much anything is bad at this point to get. God, I got hit twice there. Ugh, I'm so boned. Okay, gotta get a two, and then got to get a two. Two and two. Two, got it. Okay, then I just can't get a one! Okay, let's aim for a two just in case it's stupid Two (x8) Got it, okay. Announcer: This match will get red-hot. Now, go! What? No, no, no, no No way, I had that. Oh, my god, are you kidding me? Holy shit. This one's gonna be fucking brutal. Okay. Wow, alright. Well, three? three. Alright, I've done this one before, it's just the cigarette guy, yeah. There we go. Okay, first boss down. First boss down, I got my super. I should have changed out my super for the other thing, but, Alright (x6) Get a two. Get a two. Gotta get a two. Okay, got a two. Ok, this is fine. I'll try to do it, but I don't think it's gonna do much. But, might as well cuz what else am I doing, right? Oh nooo. No, no oh no. Oh, that's bad. Oh, that's bad. That was so stupid of me I imagine that this guy, this guy probably gives most of the players of this game the most grief. Because holy shit. This is set up for brutality. Oh god, okay, gotta get a three. A three, a three, a two, and a three. Three, three, Hoo! That was almost a two, that was almost a two, okay. Gotta get a two now. Two, okay, got a two. I've done this one- I think this is the cue ball. This is the cue ball, right? Just gotta dodge. Dodge (x6) Dodge like the dickens. (x2) Okay, dodge like the dickens. Dodge like the dickens. (x2) Easy peasy (x2) Off tempo. (x9) Hey! Okay, alright. We've got five health. Five. And there's a route where we can just get us safe And then we can go right into the last one, even though it's bullshit. We all know it. I know it, you know it. I just can't get a three. Two (x3) Oof, that would've been a one. Two (x5) No! No! No! NOOO! Oh, no. Oh, no Well. It's fine. Okay, cuz most of this is clear. Okay. That's not so bad, three, it didn't reset. Three, three, okay. Two, got it. Then a three.Three! Okay, then a two. Two! Okay, then a three, Two or three (x3) Three. Okay, all right then just a one. I'm pretty sure it won't loop me back if I do. I'm pretty sure anything at this point is gonna be one. One, one, okay. Announcer: This match will get red-hot! And begin! Okay, that's how you do it. Okay, that's one hilth-health point down. Ow, shit, god dammit! God dammit, god damn. He's just bleeding me dry. Nooo, no. No. Shit, I'm so boned Hey! Yes!!! Yes! Yes! Yes! FUCK you!! Fuck you! Get Rekt!! Your stupid hands can cry all they want! Fuck you! Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Ohh shit! eyeah!! Whew. Oh, boy, that one took the longest...so far, I think. Ugh, 20 minutes on that bad boy. Woooooo!! Oh yeah, okay, B! Alright, so. I don't think I'm gonna be able to beat the devil in this episode So I'm going to save that for the next episode. That was an arduous journey, but it was worthy journey So thank you everybody so much for watching. I'm gonna finish this up in one more episode. I wanted to dedicate a whole episode to it because I don't know how long it's gonna take. If that one took 20 minutes, next one might take an hour. So, thank you everybody so much for watching and as always I will see you in the next video. bye-bye *epic outro music* 
Hello, everybody. My name is Markiplier, and welcome to another World's Quietest Let's Play. Although, the elegance of with which I play these games, will be countermanded by the fact that we are going to be playing... Getting Over It by the eminent douchebag known as Bennett Foddy. Now as we peruse the world of Mr. Cauldron Man, keep in mind... I will not scream, I will not rant, I will not rave, I will not allow myself to become the debased asshole that you all know Markiplier to be. I will not be stopped in my quest Shut up, Mr. Foddy. Leave me to my own devices as I climb up this mountain of bullshit that you have created. You know what you've done to deserve all the hate that you receive, and yet you stand... like a titan among the mountain and you stare dow- -oo- *long exhale* I am entirely happy with my predicament because I am a paragon of virtue and I know exactly what it takes to be the one who succeeds when all others fail. And you will  seeEeEEEeeEEE *Dark is starting to shine through* *quantum detonation imminent* *croak* (Darkiplier 2k18) You will see the inside of your entrails when I drag them out of your abdomen and show them to you... Mr. Cauldron Man. If you even have legs, (I do) (Darkiplier) I'll be certain to rip them off, and replace your arms with those legs, for all the good your arms are doing you, right now. Excellent. *INHALE* *pained silence* *mark.exe has stopped responding* *toss* (Priest Donald from The Game has possessed Mark) This is a representation of my SINNNNNS, and you will be purged in the fires of absolu- *Mark stares in absolute disbelief of what happened* *Whispers* You will be purged in the fires of absolution along with all of your ilk... I will burn the heretics that you are harboring inside of your soul... (Darkiplier)*menacingly* I will destroy you. I will never allow you to survive. I will never *inhale* Ha ho ha he ha hoho I. Will. Just. Breeeath... Everything is calm, peaceful, rainbows, sunshine, and butterflies- *INHALE* PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT I am a deflating balloon of anger. I am a hot air balloon... of sass. And you will not prevent me *tiny inhale* from achie- *huge inhale* Fromachievingmyultimatevictory I will noOoOt allow you to be the one that tosses me from the precipice of... success. *Chica impersonation* *Wheezy voice* You see what happens when you obey me?! Success rains down upon everybody. The long, weary road of success... is paved... with failures. And I will not... be a ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
(Mark's becoming a deflating.. Air-Balloon...??) The tea is ready.
(Oh, a kettle. Heh. Of course.) I have seen your browser history
(Oh no) and I am not impressed.
(FML) *deep throating* I don't know how that happened, I could... *angry Mark sounds* I know an impossibility when I see it, and 'impossible' is written all over the face of this game. Spilling over it- OOOoooo0oooOOOO I passed a kidney stone. Please listen to me... once... more... you... sack... of... poopie... I'm a calm peaceful man with calm peaceful intentions, (don't lie Mark) who is going to get through this with strength of mind and strength of soul. (are you sure about that?) Nope. Nope. Nop- *INHALE* *humpback whale* (told ya) *cue Mark's attempt at going Super Saiyan* *Ah, he's even got the pose I see..* Nononono. I see what you are doing, and I will not allow it. I will take this patiently and I will take this graciously because I am a gracious, patient man. (we know that you are not that) I am the graciest, patientiest man ever known to the face (stop lying) of the aaaages. Hat. Help. HGGGH. Hat:Nope (Darkiplier) Hat, you've betrayed me just like everyone else. You will burn in the fires of my own Hell, (Darkiplier) and I will choose your pain to last eternity. HAT. Do not betray me. Get out of here. You will know everything that is- gUh- nn- MMMMM- (Darkiplier) I HAVE CLUNG TO DEEPER CONVICTIONS THAN YOU WILL TRY TO WREST FROM MY SOUL. *Spontaneously good at the game* *Spontaneously good at the game + Confusiplier* Uh... *Confusiplier* Right, *acts confident* just as I planned. Excellent, I have reached the mountain, the zenith, the aperture, the epicenter. Everything has (sudden phone ding) led to this moment, and I will not be dissuaded now by my phone, not by this... mountain, not by the things that are trying to stop me, nothing will- *chokes* get in my way, not this final zenith, this final moment, this one... unquestioning obstacle will stop... being... douche... and will obey. It will obey. (Are you sure about that?) Every undulating face... nnNnNo... nno... no... nHNnnn! (Told ya) *cue Mark's attempt to go Super Saiyan 2* (Silly Mark, you are not a saiyan) ("Goin' Down the Road Feeling Bad" plays to further taunt Mark into insanity) *Mark silently cries while Cliff Carlisle yodels* Alas, I leave you now, to go slumber amongst the ancients.. *faint sound of outro music* Thank you again, and as always, I will see you in the next video.

Well I was follwing one around D: Oh B: who was talking about it with this other management guy What'd he say?

(Offscreen: change *while giggling*) What attachments do you put on the end of your penis to mine so efficently That's a good question, Bill (M: change)  That's a good question Henry. (M: change *while laughing*) That's a good question *weird alien sound* (Offscreen:Mark laughing) I always wondered where this name came from but- B: to be clear.

I'm just gonna do a favor for you, though You said that voice turned you on too - I thought I was the only one do this thing we're down there You know sometimes you need to like clear some rubble and do what I do as I take my pickaxe and I rest it Right on the shaft shorten, and then you can sort of lean down and pretend like you're doing something basically fucking your pick-ax (Offscreen: everyone dying of laughter) Your two Husbands in a store waiting for your wives to finish shopping. Tim, I'm gonna be real with you E: (quietly) Be real with me My wife left me a week ago. I just stand here Remembering the good old times of waiting for her to be done shopping E: Tim As you know W: I know Tim I had no idea well, it's the truth Just I miss her and I don't know what else to do the only time we ever spent together was whenever we we were out shopping And we're out shopping She just left me standing in Walsh's shop, so I guess wouldn't listen which time together at all Yet I miss it So I just stand here hopin' another wife will walk into my life one day and be that cool shake my hand I'll say hey.

What see you the next one Bye bye bye 
all right hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome back to Freddy fazbear's pizzaria simulator sorry for the awkward intro I just didn't know when I was going live so hello everybody my name is markiplier as I said before which is probably not as important as I think it is welcome welcome welcome yes so we're gonna be playing five nights at freddy's well actually technically this isn't five nights at freddy's 6 I think it's been made clear by the developer that this is not 5 1956 but you might as well call it the six game in the five nights at Freddy's series now I'm not a hundred percent on that that's just something that I heard so hi hi yes I am a little early today which is better than being late which is my typical stance on how I do things so there's a lot of secrets in this game that have yet to be discovered I'm currently in my my old game after I've already beaten it what I got to do is I have to start the game over again and then start it over and over and over again but to do that I have to die so buckle up we're gonna we're gonna create as much noise as possible we're gonna attract all the animatronics over here we're gonna wing doodle on a triangle and fashion symbols hey hey hey boopity boop I'm printing some Flyers here you are come kill me who Whippany doodie booty whoa I don't know what's gonna happen oh that's a weird clown also like I want to discover oh oh no oh heck oh that's bad the gas again now I'm not gonna skip it I don't skip ads I want my YouTube critics to get revenue your birthday nah didn't that a big ol fuck you for you like one of these so alright so we're gonna be starting over lalala this whole thing happening we got the certificate of completion you can barely see it here it's it's just under my webcam over there but we're gonna be erasing all our progress we're gonna be starting a new game over again like this yes I'm sure cuz we got a lot of work to do it's a new day yes your time to shine yes it's time to take your career into your own hands yes you've saved money your whole life great now it's time to put all your eggs into one basket yeah take a huge gamble on your future yes gamble that comes with a 100% chance of success in some cases uh-huh what are we talking about we're talking about becoming a fazbear entertainment franchisee Wow right restaurant ownership and management roles anyone can do with a limited degree of success no as your it's a lot of money to invest but everyone's doing it and that means it's safe and lucrative with your initial investment you'll receive everything you need to get started including a small room some tables and electricity Wow but don't forget about the money you had leftover after buying your own choice package ah use it to decorate by a stage by attractions and animatronics all much much more okay now let's take a look at a few things that will help you get started as a fazbear entertainment franchisee okay jazz atmosphere ah making sure your establishment has an inviting atmosphere is essential to bringing in new customers okay entertainment having a lot of entertainment value in your restaurant Jesus do I have to okay there we got can't skip it okay so we already know all that we've done that before now what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be going through different avenues to get to the secrets in this game there are secrets in the items that you have to buy but the number one way to get you how much you had leftover after purchasing your franchise package great that should be more than enough no no let's get started I don't think that's more than enough are your palms shut up mute voice shut up shut up okay I'm talking to hope so this is where things have to be carefully planned so the first thing we're learning to do is almost joke but I need to be able to buy all the things that I need to get so in order to do that I need to have enough money so the first thing I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be getting the various things that are not risky number one not risky and not terribly expensive so what I need is do I actually need in it I don't really need an animatronic because I can actually make most of it I'm gonna buy the cheapest things just the barely bottom-of-the-barrel cheapest things I don't care about health and safety as much as I do about entertainment value bonus revenue of liability risk we don't want risk we want no risk cuz we're not worried about any of that this has entertainment value that is health and safety which I guess is good I guess why okay this had atmosphere though no whatever too late okay I'm gonna buy the single stage I'm gonna get one animatronic who do I want mr. can do now I want number one crate number one crate hell yeah tiny box Tim oh the pan stand was there or we got fifty five dollars so we got to be very careful I think the duck pond has an entertainment value which is good and I think that's more important I mean that's got an entertainment value but that's also got a lot of risk this has entertainment value bonus 25 that costs 25 if I get the other one then buy this one that'd be better than the duck pond I think yeah so I buy this the balloon barrel and then I get the fan spam done hey easy peasy okay so now we're gonna place these at the stage the bullet crane sorry number one crate I apologize all right balloon okay I can't do anything my play test is okay and I'm I'm gonna take the sponsorships wait maybe I have no idea should I wait should I take the sponsorships I don't know awesome I got balloon I got a loon we'll do that again okay anyway so we're gonna should I take the sponsors because what I'm planning to do is I'm actually gonna throw out all of the animatronics I'm gonna throw them back on the street I'm gonna just chuck them so I'm just gonna flip them out the door as soon as they get in in uh uh bonus dollars okay that's important okay so now that I have bonus dollars I can now buy something else no I don't think I can get any of these I need something else that I can get bonus revenue from who I would do candy cadet but I don't know if I can do that what about the how much was the sponsorship for 250 that's a good bit that's a good bit no yes no yes no yes no yes no yes no yes no yes yes yes no you guys have no idea I'll take them cuz I mean I can play with the sponsorships the sponsorships don't bother me I had every sponsorship when I beat the game and that didn't bother me at all but the money is important because I need to keep the money flowing so that I can get I like candy cadet candy cadet is good so I'm gonna get candy cadet cuz he's got some stories to tell me they think Gianna cadet playtest I own the candy cadet come get your candy here I have candy all day every day candy candy candy what happens if I just don't do anything you're gonna tell me a story what happens if I don't get candy is this a song that you got when you remember in the end of sister location when you were up when you were the purple guy and you're walking down the street and you were like hey not a care in the world I'm the purple guy walking down the street and everybody it's nothing okay I guess you gotta take the candy return to candy cadet again and maybe I will tell you a story that was 2000 points that's way more than it gave me last time hell yeah I mean oh yeah all right I own the candy cadet come get your candy here I have candy all day every day candy candy candy yeah tell me a story tell me a story ah - candy cadet again and maybe I will tell you so it's luck based oh there's a chance of telling you a story and that was only 1,000 so it's brand amused it's random ah least let me do one more cadet come and get your candy on your story I have candy all day every day tell me your story candy candy everybody hold on to your hats tell me a story tell me a story tell me a story [Music] yep dan turned to candy cadet again and maybe I will tell you a story wait no the points

[Music] huh or mm candy cadet again and maybe I will tell you a story so is random it is Rando it just happened to be going into pattern okay all right candy cadet I own the candy cadet come get your candy here I have candy all day every day candy candy candy I'm probably gonna blow all my money on this just to see if I can get earned not my money but all my play tokens on this just because I wanna yes return to candy cadet again and maybe I will tell you a story I want to try to get these stories cuz I know there are stories that he tells that is a fact one of the secrets in this game is that there are stories no I'm Adam wait oh I am the candy cadet come get your candy here I have candy all day every day candy candy candy okay alright okay alright candy candy candy return to candy cadet again and maybe I will tell you a story though is it shittiest amount of candy I've ever seen in my life that was so stupid you're so stupid game stupid okay I got one more try come on give me a story give me a story baby come high on the candy we don't want that story I have carried you all day every day candy where's candy candy alright everybody cross your fingers everybody cross your fingers everybody in you're in you're in chat if there's an emoji of doing this do that come on Corey please I swear the sweet glisten story give it a conditioned return to candy cadet again and maybe I will tell you a story wall that was bullshit oh you have to use all ten tokens well I don't have ten tokens I don't have that I started without it all right tomorrow I'll spend all that on that but right now I'm gonna get more I'm gonna get more stuff I can't do anything with those yet bonus revenue is good on that entertainment value entertainment manager from those that's good I'm gonna get those bonus revenue from gumball swivel lands I can't get any from that but bonus revenue is good to have in the future atmosphere oh yeah oh yeah 80 bucks oh yeah I'm not gonna get those got the candy cadet do I want to get the stage which one of these don't have any risk no risk no risk no risk girl why did I buy the ones with risk I mean net bear obviously who wouldn't want net bear but in my main game leg I can't believe I just went that way does it's terribly stupid a lot of things that I do seem terribly stupid but oh well all right mmm ooh that's big atmosphere let me go for these little way out let me go for big atmosphere pong go let me go for the bit you yeah can I get anything here I don't know if I can get anything here oh yeah these are too expensive okay these are just out of my price range sure the German brothers the fruit punch clown in the lemonade clown you know the one thing you can say about Scott Cawthon the developer of this game and all the five nights at Freddy's things is uh man he has an imagination of connecting things that you would never think to be connected like a fruit punch clown that scares patrons and is picks in German like this just those are just elements oh also bonus very very important pay attention the name of this little animatronic here it's name is healthy the names helping oh yeah that name is healthy that's help you right there that's so cute I'm so glad I made the first thumbnail featuring LP because I knew I knew help me was gonna be like the best of this one anyway so what I can do is I don't have enough space to place those down let me see how I'm working with space of what I got right now Oh Oh gumball so aliens isn't a space thing all these speakers and lights for a number one great freaking party for number one great okay so I got floors base which means that I can indeed get more stuff I don't think there's anything else here to get would there be sanitation sedation duck pond can do that that's pretty cheap and bonus revenue yeah yeah I'll do that why not and Stan number one cry no more cry I'd like to think it's tiny bucket stem up there it's the only featuring tiny bicep okay gonna get I got 300 left I can't there's no point in getting a stage because it doesn't add anything to number one crate so why would I do that but I could get the arcade cabinet and I could place that down yeah let me do that I can't play it right now but it's definitely gonna be better for the first night if I put that down and then more patrons are gonna want to be here okay duck pond and that and then I'm gonna add a coin slot - yeah coin slot - nice got it all right okay all right I think that's good enough so it's going to our first night there shouldn't be any animatronics here there could be or rest from us is now officially open yes so that doesn't mean your job is finished however you have a lot of work to do while patrons eat their pizza in the other room Wow from your terminal you have supplies to buy papers to print and repairs to make Wow once you've taken care of all the items on your to-do list why money for supplies and repairs comes out of petty cash so don't worry about it coming out of your pocket okay I got you covered the only money you have to worry about is if you choose to upgrade any of the equipment in your office right now on to other matters something to be aware of is that the ventilation system and your terminal are highly loud and may prevent you from hearing things in adjoining air vents AHA that won't be a problem if there is nothing in the vents however if you feel that something might be in the vents you have a few tools at your disposal to protect yourself you can shut off your terminal and the ventilation system at any time now decrease the amount of attention you are drawing today I'm not going to do that also shining your life directly into a vent will most likely prevent anything from jumping out now you also have three tools available from the terminal itself oh there's a motion detector an audio decoy and a secondary ventilation unit keep in mind however that you can only have one of these active at any given time Wow now get to it huh simply log off when you've completed your tasks for the day man you can go get some coffee I love coffee actually I don't drink coffee but I've got all this on the back so there if I play this right there should be no animatronics at all that's the idea there should be no animatronics at all right that's the idea so once I get this underway and once I'm able to get this get all like I'm gonna get the story out of candy cadet why was the light flickering there but once I get the story out of candy cadet in the next one there's also the the minigames in the game itself all the different products all the different things in there they have different things that have secrets in them the arcade cabinets have secret modes for the games like the the various different things that uh like the the puppet that you can actually buy you can buy the puppet if you get enough money and the only way that you're gonna get enough money is if you make this place profitable as all hell and you got to do that you like you got to do it to the extreme so I'm gonna do it to the extreme if I can I don't know if I can but we'll see place bulbs come on I want to go and dunzo I'm out of your job it looks like you're getting the hang of this that's me now let's just focus on getting you through your first week hey yeah it's a big party here Saturday oh yeah should view that day as your

[Applause] [Music] Wow no I'm not gonna do it not gonna do it I'm gonna do it okay all these animals have a little bit of risk do them okay so I'm gonna get this guy cuz that's a lot of bonus revenue and that's probably not a floor placeable as far as I remember and I'm gonna get this guy because he is a floor placeable but he's got a lot of bonus revenue okay yeah box up okay so you go right there oh what a fun place for the whole family oh I need the I wait you go right here yeah no wait you go hey I got this I got this you go right there you go right there hey you go right there okay so I got 470 more dollars I need to spend every single penny on it the good stuff let's see I probably should also get some health and safety stuff like this thing that's probably important all right I don't think there's anything on the first thing what else could the fruity mace I think that's all for the like easily placeable stuff wait why was candy condemned what the hell withheld liability risk of three that's that all marked down okay is fine I don't want that it's fine it's fine I don't want any risk here but yeah I'm wondering look cuz this is marked down but it doesn't have any liability risk in it I still don't trust it I just I still don't trust the man I still don't trust that it's I'm not right about that okay instead of doing anything else I'm actually gonna add coin slots to the things I already like okay so that's a little more bonus revenue there we got a little more bonus revenue here no turn in it okay anyway so we're good for oh I can actually add one more oh that's right because it increased the doodle Dan'l right okay here sweet okay so we got that everything's good so far we're out of tokens we've got a lot of good stuff going on here so if we yeah so the candy could dead no no about that but I'm gonna yeah liability risk is for lawsuits not necessarily the animatronics if you buy a markdown thing it's gonna be bad okay so I have a funny okay so anyway I'm gonna carry on next time I don't know if I'm gonna keep going on candy cadet but something tells me candy cadet is gonna give up with k2 kinetic nades we're gonna make this candy cadets dream okay this should still be nobody in here I there shouldn't be anybody in here I don't know why there would be shouldn't be it wouldn't be anybody in here right right there's there's no way right leftie oh by the way also secret lefty inside lefty is the puppet as far as I've heard inside lefty is actually like if you look at one of the rare screens with lefty on it that people sometimes get after they die or like they see a picture of the animatronics sitting outside of the pizzeria you can actually see in one of the shoulder joints is the striped pattern of the puppets arm going down into the frame of the animatronic like it does exist there and it is there and it's super creepy to think about because also in that rear screen is a poster of the puppet just like looking mad as all hell staring down at you so pretty uh pretty creepy and I don't know what that I don't know what the actual like what the actual or that because I don't know who lefty is but also the fun thing about this is like there's a bunch of animatronics here that are just barely offshoots of the various main animatronics and what it kind of does I don't know if this was ever official it's probably not official but it does lend some credence to all of the fan made five nights at Freddy's games it explains why there are so many different versions of it all existing in the same universe now I'm not saying that's a hundred percent canon but you know like five nights at candy's like five nights at UM at the krusty krab of all things like it's all offshoots of these because fazbear entertainment allows people the franchiser like what we're doing right now all these other animatronics in here they may have been in Fern AFT or various other places but these other locations that exists only in fan-made games can sometimes be canon under this premise and this idea so that's a thing that can happen I'm not a hundred percent sure about it but it's a thing so no no can I Slurpee out of this one also he said in the patch notes lately there was something else about there's a green man by a door and his hitbox got increased to be bigger I have no idea what that is the green man by the door which doesn't make any sense to me at all but by the lemonade Club wow it's done fist time pop soda get out of here all right I'm out of here so should I just keep going for should I just keep going for candy cadet I don't wanna I don't wanna look good god uh-oh who's this before you is an animatronic found in the back alley wow we are unsure of its origins I don't see it either you have to complete the main Chuck that bad boy back up me Alan Saturday you want them all to be in one place okay all right hell no no fish time story what about it racing game yeah I'm gonna get to the racing

kind of see a pink but it's candy cadet again and maybe I can't see to blow this I can't the bee does nothing what would the B do the B does nothing to this I can't after all that I can't have to pay my respects to it can't do nothing nothing I am the candy cadet yes your candy here I have candy all day every day candy [Music] maybe I will tell you a story it changed like Scott updated the game and it changed candy I don't like out sometimes just pause is there it's very disconcerting but he changed their candy because sometimes before it was like incremental increasing numbers of candy pointing to but now it's all like weird and different okay hey return to kanika diameter maybe I will s to slam this shit I don't know that's to to be to backhand this bitch out of bamboo last one last token we got we got this fuel can be here we got this all day every day every day every day every day we got candy every day if you just believe in the candy we're gonna start the Church of candy here who could have believed in the candy we got the the holy candy Bible we got it just got to believe guys we're gonna start a cult the cult of candy we're gonna move out into the middle of desert I'm gonna buy a big compound we're all gonna live there together as one and it's the name of candy - candy cadet again and maybe I will tell you a story alright we're still gonna go on the desert but there's more of an exiled type thing now we're gonna be get a build a big compound there together who wouldn't want that I'm I need more money I need to get like exponentially more money all your liability risks amen man these are so expensive it's so expensive oh she's got the liability risk on that thing god I can't afford it but that's hilarious yeah I need to get the security puppet eventually which is totally great great thing wasn't that in another game - that was a little security puppet I can't remember lefty are a good buddy lefty lefty okay music man L chip these these guys are great because they have pickles I've bought the pickles why can't I have the pickles what can I have the pickles oh I don't that good god I don't like that guy all right anyway I want to figure out how to get the pickles - that's gonna be definitely a thing that's gonna be happening but we need to buy some more reasonable purchases I guess whatever well all right I'm gonna get I'm gonna give this so that I can have more animatronics I mean I know I just need number one crate and frankly I'm tempted to only just buy number one crate but at the same time a funny feeling that I probably should go for something a little more God is there really nothing else to get there really nothing else to get that's yeah I really got to go for the animatronics all right I guess I gotta go there for the animatronics let's buy this thing because everything else is a huge liability risk I feel I'm I mean huge reliability risk I do want to get the Rockets but it don't want any risk I want no risk got you all risky I like it stop being risky all right we need we need some friends for Dumbo and crate all right you're good happy frog oh you're the happiest frog mr. hippo not that guy in pig patch all right pig patch mr. hippo happy frog all right cool cool cool cool number one crate gets the limelight in the singers position we got happy Frog backup vocals mr. hippo no vocals and banjo pig yeah oh yeah that's the good stuff all right so that we got that that's good that's great we've gotta get more oh we got exotic cupcakes I don't think exotic cupcakes is this thing that we can get here I like your candor but I just don't think that's possible what else we got no no I do like the latter Tower but no no I like that a lot but no what if I put some safety straps on it what if I put some if I put some safety straps on that bad boy it won't have no risk right yeah that's true right I'm not right is there a better way to go about that anything else I can get blue dirt no I can't get nothing else can't even get that yeah yeah okay yeah exotic butters they aren't a thing in this game nothing it's pickles oh my gosh pickles I can't even have them look at this I'm gonna put some safety straps on this bad boy you get out of here stupid balloons this oh yeah that's good safety strap no risk playing polish that's like yeah a coin talk to everything clean faucet yeah that's a good chef I'll get clean cause that will cause that cause that is there anything else atmospheric that I can get I've got fifty 1400 I guess I could upgrade to a larger floor plan let's do that then I can get the most amount of stuff on the ground including this guy polish pattern slide oh that paid for itself all right anything else I can get put on the ground here I get these boots on the ground I can put a safety strap on that that's always good everybody loves that everybody loves that no it really isn't much else no I can't afford that you know I'm gonna do that I'm gonna buy this I'm gonna put some safety straps on this ball every time I think of this is an actual ball minimally yeah I remember this that's terrible this is terrible this is a horrible irresponsible of me all right so we got no risk still no risk go way better all right we're gonna do this all right now for another uneventful night maybe let's see about that all right I don't know if we should go for candy again next time I want those pickles so I've won the pickle I want him I want the breakfast I bought the pickles want them anyway all right so we're carrying on here so one of the things the other didn't know about this game is it's it's it's really interesting how conclusive it was at the end of it I had like time to like look up other people's theories on it other people talking about it but the thing about it was the end of this game when he played through it it was super unbelievably conclusive like it was very much this is what happened we are redeeming for our sins we are playing the price for what we've done we believe in we believe in atoning for past mistakes like that whole thing and it was very obvious because if the designs may be different and I don't know if the designs are like a super choice or or like because fundamentally like the animatronics are different even spring-trap especially is fundamentally different you shouldn't [Music] there shouldn't be anyone in here there should be no one yeah there's no one there's no one in here I don't know what that was there's no one in here yeah okay but it was definitive right it was very very clear of what it was talking about it was done and it was like it was not there so there must be you know there's gotta be something to that so I'm not a hundred percent sure but I'm pretty sure that the ending of this game was supposed to be kind of like a come full circle wrapping up everything like it had an overlay of the first five nights at Freddy's game environment god damn it Marty get out of here stupid shit all right so it's gotta be something else before that there's got to be right there's got to be something else anyway so I don't know what other secrets we're gonna discover out of like I want the frickin stories that's all I want right now I just want stories but it looks like we may not get those because of the Ditka tree that it's all about but there is repeatable things that I can get in the arcade cabinet so the next time we go out in the main area I'm gonna get the arcade cabinets and try to do those things because those are interesting Easter eggs I know there's multiple endings I I do know there's multiple endings and actually I'm probably on pace to get one of the ones which is probably gonna be one of the bad endings but there are multiple endings I think there's a total of four five maybe are there five endings maybe even six I have no idea there's different certificates that you can get across the board for these things so I'm gonna try to get all the certificates in this live stream but I don't know if I'm able to do it because number one it just takes a lot of time to get through this game over and over and over again but hey we got time right then we got nothing but time all right let's log off here all right okay thank you can you please move on all right before you is an animatronic found in the back alley no we are unsure of its origins it is your job to complete the maintenance checklist before claiming it and salvage yeah if you choose to you can throw it back into the alley where you found it and forfeit payment please make your choice now yeah but throw it back OOP there goes so yeah don't forget Saturday you want them all to be in one place now I realize that prompt says don't forget Saturday you want them all to be in one place they're not talking about the guests they're talking about the animatronics the animatronics hey no one was turned away that's awesome the animatronics need to all be in one place that's why the ending hell yeah hell yeah I'm such a happy and safe place everybody loves to be here all right I'm not gonna go for candy I'm not it's just I'm not gonna do it I'm gonna do the uh the motorists Easter Egg so I believe it's on the last lap I don't know what the last lap is but I don't even know if I I may not have left facin I actually I actually did play this in in the in my main series of it but I don't remember if I left it in the actual game because I might have cut it out because I didn't think anything of it I I didn't get the Easter egg in this I wasn't playing it because I was playing it so I'm pretty sure in the third lap not this one to the third my bullet health skills are working for me I'm pretty sure so what I need to do is I need to hit Q slow down go over here or maybe it's the fourth lap I don't know if there's a fourth flapper [Music] come on where are you oh maybe the fourth line okay boom yeah so if you go fourth lap [Music] there it is their desserts yes this [Music] yeah [Music] yeah so I don't know what this means is the thing I'm not 100% sure what it means to be driving around here Oh juniors maybe it was that what they meant by the Green Man and hey hey hey hey hey okay leave now we'll go back that seems pretty final I'm gonna go back to I'm gonna go back to the the bar juniors I'm gonna go to juniors I'm uh come on hang out at the bar for a bit I'm pretty sure that's a bar all right hey it's me why didn't you look a little bit deeper do-do-do-do-do-do come on you know you can't be here don't make this more difficult than it has to be I don't know what you're talking about all right anyway sure okay I can't be I don't know what that's talking about but I don't know why I'm not welcome I'm a pretty jovial guy I'm practically Santa Claus I'm so happy and fun to be around and awesome and cool here we go again okay no not the house go back okay all right okay all right there's something else so something else here there's some else secret I'll look let's see okay all right okay going back and going back guys I'm going back all right hang on there's something to some secret here so some secret here in the back of the parking lot maybe somewhere around here background back can't go back here all right okay I think you guys might just be utterly confused cuz this is what happens when there's so many people in chat when when someone says go back they don't know like I have no idea when you mean go back to so down my explore in the house what I was going to the house me I was going to the haha all right guys hush down

the end of the road and the obviously final thing so obviously I had to go check to see if there was anything else because I'm thorough was that candy all right candy candy that's all old [Music] yeah war broken window interesting I'm just making a full loop around the house you got to cover all the bases before he commits to a decision whoa trash cans why do I have three why do I have so much

he'll be sorry when he gets back oh oh I guess we're done okay all right well anyway I'm gonna play this one now a slug can't believe I said that in my mind but I need a slug I don't like you I think the secret in this one is you have to just like number one you have to win we have to win like on the first try or something I'm super fast the outskirts first should I lost my magnetism damn it I ran out well I've got so much speed I just man I wasted the magnet yeah probably ooh I've never moved this fast before in my life damn I love some down there too oh geez god dammit of course I did this yeah because the question here sorry I'm concentrating with the question here is who is this little girl and why is she here and how do I get up there today of course why did I leave things behind

same oh I almost got stuck in that wall I think I've got plenty of magnet time give me a bit more magnetism the only thing you really need is the magnetism because you don't have to go to every little corner to try to find absolu that's sherry with a bone to me but I don't think there's any more ok where is more or more Mormon god damn it god damn it damn it damn it I don't know why I don't know what this is so hard is not that hard and it's not that hard I got this I got this I got this I got this [Music] I think the map wait is the map the same no matter what I think the map is the same no

words but there we are [Music] [Music] I gotta go all the way around don't I I gotta go the long way around don't I because I hate yeah apparently I hate being good at games you remember how bad I am oh man I wish for one day I could just like not do that like look at myself and be like I'll make today the day that I'm not gonna suck games but I can't do that cuz it was terrible to run through no matter what I do okay well yeah those are dead end that I just ran into that's great yes okay I think I've got just enough time to be able to smash this bad boy out here and it's second now [Music] yes yes yes god dammit of course 60 seconds and a lot of speed I got to do this manually but I think I got this amazing amazing that's me that's the definition of me I gotta win that like three times

get that one this is one the magnet and the speed would speed would be nice but barely everything's just tantalizingly far away all right well I'm gonna be able to win this one cuz I got nothing it's

magnetism next [Music] face he's going to make a big loop around the outside good stuff TM of course I'm in this nebulous area where I can't actually get what I need to get but nail this to the wall I

might go back to that okay so I got eight thousand five hundred I need to make more money that's nice gravity vortex I want that really badly but something tells me I probably shouldn't oh this guy's so good Orvil elephant prize king there's a lot of bonus revenue I was something new but I could save up and get the security puppet oh I could do that I want the big I mean I'm gonna get I'll be able to get the puppet next time anyway so I might as well get well I wouldn't be able to do anything from the prize Kingdom today but but he will get me more money next time so I'm gonna get the prize King just because it's a lot of bonus revenue and I have a spot for him okay boss what a slot on that no risk okay all right we're good to go all right let's get through the next one there still shouldn't be any animatronics as far as I know you shouldn't be I'll get the puppet next time next day tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow know what okay all right no don't do that scary anybody here yeah no Easter Egg yeah I know there's no Easter Egg I will get the puppet I will get the puppet I'm pretty sure next time around with the next sponsorship that I'm gonna get the next sponsorship is like $5,000 I'm gonna be able to get that and then I'll get a lot more revenue from tonight and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to get the security puppet for tomorrow I'm not sure what effect that's gonna

this how do they make art of lefty if lefty isn't here yet you know who made all this art what kind of kids were doing this cuz this is is it not good not good at all for tokens for puppet okay all right I'll save for tokens for puppet I'll save I'll save up I'll save it alt f4 to win okay all right well there we go all right it and you soften f2 where do you see if an f2 oh and the background of the one that I just the thumbnail here yeah I did that I like to use the fat staff to office I still say I still safe enough to was the best five nights at Freddy's game I mean the original will always hold that place in my heart for the story wise but as far as like mechanics mystery intrigue difficulty like I gotta go with five nights at Freddy's 2 there was nothing that was more intricately designed and also a good sequel to the first one like it really set the pace like five nights at Freddy's one was really good but if five nights at Freddy's 2 wasn't as good as it was then the series wouldn't be lasting as long as it is even today like there's just so much there yeah I just I it's just it's always gonna held a special place in my heart for all of that I've already done the midnight racers and I've done the fruity thing the fruit maze of death that that was I didn't beat it but I don't think you can beat it last time I'm pretty sure you cannot beat that last round because if it doesn't give you the power-ups and there's just no way to do it like you don't have enough time yeah I'll get there I'll get there have to is garbage how dare you how dare you how dare you if an app three I don't know fine a three I didn't like it as much I mean it was good it was interesting mechanics but I don't know it was kind of like a bait and switch because it was supposed to be like this ended to something and yet it didn't didn't feel like it before you is an animatronic found in the back alley we are unsure of its origins ensures your job to complete the maintenance check salvaged this is what I didn't see you do you can throw it back into the alley where you found it payment please make your choice now no I'm gonna throw it back this is Lefty I didn't realize that lefty was gonna be the last day I'm a tronic here ah because remember he's I got the sign who said I'm already inside you want them all to be in one place yep yep yeah I'm nice sister location no sister location was an amazing vibe that's a pretty name and it was great because it was such a departure from the typical five nights at Freddy's stuff and I like that I really like that unique mechanics for almost every encounter and just it was more like the gameplay fit the story which I liked a lot I don't know if he was like the best thing in the world but it was my favorite thing okay all right oh no are we gonna have enough yeah we're gonna have enough if I do the plate token stuff all right Lally's lollies got that lolis lollies okay prize game kind of want to test the prize King let's see what the prize King is all about yeah I don't want to grab your ball they do a few more times on that one oh I don't like this very clearly it's very clearly very dick like very clearly yeah that's not not good all right here we go prize king well this is disappointing this is very sad it was very sad okay here we go I'm ready go damn it what the hell is with the prize king what's with the prize King what this bullshit this is bullshit give me something prize King I fuck you - fuck you Brice gang just bullshit you can take your prizes you can shove them up your ass that's all you

doing it right now but yeah I can scream louder oh I can oh oh oh you sack of shit oh you're gonna be like this huh alright well do can play this game of persistency I'm gonna get you imma shove my whole foot how much is she she's normally $71,000 I made out like a bandit oh holy Shi look at her sassiness oh she looks so good I gotta put her in a normal spot she's normally in this spot ah look at her look at her yeah yeah can I get the pickles now can I get the pickles gonna get the pickles damn it Curnow get the pickles is that like a prize from prize king you can get the pickles from the prize king is that what you can do okay all right I see out it no I'm not getting rid of number one crate look at her look at her she's so good I got her Wow guys I'm really proud of myself if I did nothing else with the rest of my life I'm really happy that I Campbell doll my money away to get one damn chica who's probably gonna kill me well it hurts you so sassy got him in love oh I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love guys guys this is it I'm in love I'm in love oh do you think she likes candy kind of fish you like to candy all right I got a try I'm in I'm in a very tight spot because I think this might be the last night and I don't have enough money for the security puppet which was a grave mistake on my part so I should've saved my money but maybe you guys said that this gets harder so I want to see cuz then I can get a lot of points if I can get like stupid amount of points then maybe the hardest one give me a hard yes more more give me more give me more give me fuel give me fire give me that's what I desire please I want points I can take the most difficult game in the world I can do it I didn't give me difficulty please cuz I can do it with the minimal amount of boys I have buy everything for pickles what how in the world are you supposed to be able to get enough money to buy absolutely everything oh this is a problem ah I wasn't I was looking at Chet doesn't my bed I could do that I wasn't paying attention yeah I was gonna my bed egg baby has a secret oh I see there's anything that has a secret that's got to be egg baby Oh back stay back city center stage got a really shove them in no no no no no you get away get away get away get away get away get away get away get away no wait get away get away get away get away get away I think this is a little bit more difficult if I'm not mistaken this does seem just to be a hair more difficult which I like I want all the sweet points oh no it's the same isn't it it's the same the same dammit god dammit dagnabbit dammit dammit ok it's fine alright so I don't have enough money I just barely don't have enough money for the puppet I don't oh just barely don't ya she just barely don't I would love to I would love to markdown l chip Hey alright I'll chip alright whatever I think this is the last night so I'm gonna try I'm just gonna save my money and we're gonna see what happens I don't know what's gonna happen but we're gonna see all right egg baby has no secrets I don't know you guys I don't think I trust any of you guys yeah I don't think uh-huh I think you guys are all liars just every one of the only things you guys don't lie about is candy and that's all it is and I will do candy oh I will get candy soon I'll get it I promise I know it babies a scam obviously da da oh you need all the certificates to get the pickles okay all right I got you I understand what you're getting on about I see what you were talking about okay all right okay all right I will get that underway so don't you worry don't you worry up there don't you worry about a pretty little thing because I got that okay how in the hell am I supposed to be able to buy all of them that's the big question because I don't know is there some secret way of getting more money because that's like I know probably if you play if you play the right games enough you can get more money because you can get up to a thousand dollars every single time if you get like a 10,000 point game so there's got to be games that allow you just to make money hand over fist money money money money money but the problem is like the liability of some of those things they'll get you sued so then you lose money but is it worth the money more I don't know egg baby egg baby does not do all the things that you guys are claiming egg baby does I'm pretty sure I'm fairly certain egg baby does not do the things that you are claiming it does yeah baby baby we'll get you laid I'm baby will not know know edit game file for all the months I don't want a cheat god I don't want to cheat why would I do that get free money like babies a scam cheat engine yeah I'm not I'm not gonna cheat there's got to be a legitimate way to get it otherwise why would they be in the game cuz there's got to be a legitimate way to get what you need to get otherwise again why would it be in the game so that's all I have to say about that right right okay prai's king yeah I bet you could get but it would be you would have to be stupid lucky like Price King getting funtime chica from prize king is amazing like that's probably the only way that you can get it if you have the luck to be able to get funtime chica from prize king then yeah then I would understand if you were able to get everything that you needed to get but I don't think I have that it may not be Saturday wasn't there like one buffer day I think that was like one buffer day I don't remember I don't remember very much it all could be a be gives you insanity certificate I don't think that is the thing I think you're lying about that I'm pretty sure you're lying pretty sure ah two percent you're lying hey we don't even have an animatronic at the doors we're all gonna die ah yes sweet delicious visitors no one was turned away everyone was amazed young food young bonus money money money see I just don't see like if you're doing the salvage I guess yeah I guess if you were doing the salvage in addition to everything else then you could probably have another cuz the salvage is a lot of money that is being left on the table but I do have enough for the puppet Oh markdown do you say markdown you say oh that one I bet that one's fun but how do I get the security puppet point yes now where is the security puppet I have to place the security puppet down do I

ain't going nowhere all right all right come on see if you can slip by my watchful eye all right let's see that's two oranges ah twins are you all right you carry on you you lovely lovely lovely lovely scamp's all right anybody seen a green little bit see the green no you're not green oh you're not green oh you're not green you're not green either no no no no you're good you're good you're

I'm in the rain oh so I oh I'm shorting out oh that's oh that's oh oh oh [Music] so the kid died of exposure and then this animatronic went outside to try to save the child and died in the alley holding the child and as a heartbreaking that's what you do that to me what happens if you keep playing - is there anything that would happen if you kept play testing oh no it's the same shit god damn it Jesus Jesus all right yeah I'll do candy how about this was not your sign child I've been goof-goof something good god [Music] Wow all right candy cadet you're up I am the candy cadet come and get your candy here I have candy all day every day candy candy yeah yeah that kid probably became the puppy that's that's probably like to be learned and maybe I will tell you a story it's so weird god there's so many just kids dying in this entire storyline they're just spotted dead kids now maybe there's not so many maybe it's just the story of the same kid dying over and over and over yeah I have day yeah I know lefties the puppy yeah I know that candy go return to candy cadet again and maybe I will tell you a story I know candy candy cadet is here to help me on the candy cadet come on here can they have candy all day every day all day every day candy candy man we're getting like it's getting it's getting heavy like that's the thing about these stories is like sometimes good lady cadets again and maybe I will tell I don't even know yeah it's weird also candy cadet is a sack of shit candy cadets never gonna give me candy and I don't think there's any like I don't think the games been out long enough for people like totally pieced together absolutely every way to get every secret so it's like this is a lot of exploration give it to return to candy cadet again and maybe I will tell you a story yeah I've actually lost out on a lot of money by trying to go for candy cadet it this is my last joke ever I have candy all candy cadet if you don't do anything candy cadet I will I'm gonna destroy you I promise you that I pray you return to candy cadet again and maybe maybe you can shove it up your Robo ass maybe you could do that maybe you could do that well what else can we buy we've only got sixty three hundred I don't know if there's actually anything that we can buy still you get a floor could get a nice floor that'd be nice still can't get still can't get the pickles I've want those pickles I've wanted one apparently all right floor hey we got a floor hey guys look we got a nice floor look there's confetti on the floor now that was worth $5,000 right yeah definitely all right okay anyway yeah this was this is not worth the time all right we're gonna go ahead do it okay I don't know I don't know what kind of ending we're gonna get probably a bad ending man yeah I've tried it ten times I've tried it ten times on I've tried it ten times on candy cadet in a row it doesn't work that way it's I just don't think it's guaranteed okay that's the only thing about it oh let me just buy this equipment why not uh we're gonna get know what it's gonna be but I bet it's gonna be fun and fresh and happy and friendly yeah oh well anyway this isn't gonna be the end of the stream once I get to this one I am gonna keep going out I'm going to start again at least one more time and I'm gonna try completely different Avenue about things we've gotten some of the secrets for the items but I think in the next one I need to just go for the most money possible because if I can get those pickles then I'm gonna be happy and life is gonna be worth living but if I can't get the pickles then I'm gonna just go on a rampage make some animatronics and then destroy the world God turn off the computer then hold Z I don't think it did nothing it did nothing it did nothing just at the time you've never done whatever it's fine okay so we just gotta get through this see the ending and then we're gonna go a different strategy where I just try to get as much money as possible which just means that I have to get everything everything cuz I got to get all the money I gotta get all that money I gotta get that money I gotta get that money if I don't get that money I ain't gonna give no pickles weight is weight is pickles from buying everything or as pickles from getting all the certificates that's what I gotta know it's one thing is one thing and the other thing is the other thing and we can get all the certificates that I'm gonna be happy I'm a happy go bankrupt I don't want to go bankrupt I guess I could that is that is another way to end the game oh yeah I guess I guess the ways to end the game is you have the money or I did what I did I got the quote-unquote good ending the the true ending if you will with my playthrough um you get the the no money ending I wonder if there is there like a is there an ending what if I just don't do anything like I don't buy anything and I never place anything in my barren nothing nothing in my restaurant I don't take any sponsorships I take nothing do nothing what if I do that what if I do there you go I want to try that I know I know yeah yeah I want to try that just like nothing I want to get that all right I'm gonna do that after this cuz it's gonna reach the end of this whatever this is I might get another certificate but let's see what do speedrun ending I don't think that's a thing that can't there can't be yeah that's another ending but it is yeah yeah I didn't do shit whoa congratulations on completing the week unfortunately you did not meet your special obligations under paragraph 4 your employment is terminated we'll mail you your things and Dave oh well hmm ah thank you helpy okay what hey I am the Lord keeper what is that what does that mean I don't think I got that certificate from the ending I got I think wait okay all right I'm gonna try new game I'm gonna buy nothing I'm gonna buy nothing but I got the Lawkeeper it's a shut up shut up shut up I'm not gonna buy shop just sup shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up let's see how much cash you had leftover after purchasing your franchise package oh great that should be more than enough now let's get started there we go your restaurant is now I got all the Lord so I apparently I got all the lore so does that mean I unlocked all the secrets but I didn't get all the stories but apparently I did but I didn't get the stories thought apparently but I did with the stories okay I know there's an ending that has to do with like the graveyard but I'm not sure I'm not sure how to get that one how do you get the graveyard ending cuz I know that's an ending absolutely no that's that that is an ending because I've seen pictures of it how do you do that how do you do it certificate of mediocracy is that what I'm about to get I bet it is I bet it is mediocrity come on there we go all right candy at all what don't do all the tasks well I did the test Oh lor masters for doing the puppet that makes me that makes more sense that's you miss the secret in the car game no I got the car game I did the car game thing I did the car game oh it's oh the graveyard is part of the card game Oh what if you go back to the car game multiple times that might be it but I'll get that after I get really lazy I just got to sit through these sweet screens here oh yeah graveyard is in the car I'll take four for the secret ending okay alright then Blanca Blanca Blanca do I really want to go through all this to do the lazy ending I really do actually but it's like it takes like five minutes to do this every night it's just gonna take like 30 minutes in total just to unclog the toilets cleaning the ovens replaceable why can't I just log off and get the fuck out of here I just want to leave stop talking about egg baby just stop turn off the car turn off the computer and do what now and what do what now what huh my twat mmm training plus lore what get the insanity ending you guys I can't even understand you

me know what you thought down the comments below and if you want to see more cool videos where I failed to do what I set out to do I've got so many videos check about playlists or all organized go to my jail what not I don't even care just go see some cool stuff and check out here to the real playthrough so thank you everybody so much for watching and as always I will see you in the next video [Music] 
Hey guys, thanks for stopping by. I promise I won't take up too much of your time; I just wanted to talk about something that was incredibly important. And not only to me, but to every single one of you. Everyone that's watching this video right now is affected by what's about to happen to the internet. And uh, you probably know about it already but earlier today, the FCC Chairman (Ajit Pai) announced a plan to repeal and draw back a lot of net neutrality laws, and kind of change the way that we access the internet. And, that sounds bad... because it is bad. And I'll provide links in the description not only to information, other people talking about it, and ways for you to fight back on this, but also I just wanted to mention why it was so important because if some of you don't know... Like, "net neutrality" is simply a way of saying that the Internet is open and accessible to everybody. You're able to go wherever you want on the internet, you're able to DO whatever you want on the internet, you're able to have some semblance of anonymity on the internet without all the companies trying to track your every movement, and it's not perfect, but those are because of the net neutrality laws that we have right now. Now imagine... if these things were to come to pass, you go to YouTube one day, and you find, instead of your videos: you find this page that says, "We're sorry, you haven't paid for the Entertainment package of your Internet plan. Please pay five more dollars." What they want is to make the Internet a more profitable place. And that sounds bad on its face, but that's also just the first step of it. Like entertainment, you may think like "ah that's okay, like that's totally fine" But... ...if you allow something like that to happen, then, you put in the framework for information to be controlled. And when you do that you control what people see.. ...and when you do THAT, you control what people think. And I'm not saying this is gonna lead to a dystopian future where everyone's mind controlled and doesn't think for themselves, but it DOES ruin a lot of opportunities that people have; to be able to do what they want to do on the internet. You start down the path where this amazing thing that connects every single human on the globe together, and allows for the free spread of information wherever it wants to go... You lock down opportunities and ability for people to thrive; both for themselves and for our future generations! And I'm not even saying that you shouldn't have to pay for the internet... I mean you still have to pay for water, but there's no "Just Barely Clean Enough Water", and then the "Premium Water" for five dollars more that is actually not gonna kill you! But when you set up a system that allows corners to be cut and allows businesses to prioritize profit over people, that's when society starts to degrade and that's when innovation becomes stifled. Because it's not profitable for everyone to make leaps and bounds; we as a species are not defined by profit... ...like, we're just better than that. And I hope we're better than that. I want to be better than that. Bottom line is, the internet should be open and accessible to everybody. There shouldn't be paywalls that control what you can see based on how much money you make! There shouldn't be walls in general that control the information that you see, and, there shouldn't be people watching your every move on the internet! We can't allow this to happen. And, thankfully, there are ways to fight it. In the description I have provided tons of links to not only information about this that can explain it better than I just did, but also ways that you can fight back; where you can contact people that are making these decisions. They're all down in the description: there's ways to contact your Congressman, your Senators, your government officials... there's ways to write to the FCC, like, even if they want to ignore... ...even if they want profit, you can still make a difference. These systems are only in place because...we just decided it. The internet only exists because, we decided to build it! So we have to take charge and remember that this is so important, that we need to protect it. Because the internet's a beautiful thing! Because of how open and accessible it is, and I want to keep it that way! I want you guys to be able to enjoy whatever you want to enjoy. I want you guys to be able to do what you want to do on the internet, without someone telling you that you can't. That's all I'll say for now. Thank you everybody so much for watching, uh, if you can please take the time to try to make a difference. All the links are down in the description, there's tons of other people talking about it right now, and it's... incredibly important. So thank you everybody, so much for watching...and as always, I will see you in the next video! Bye bye! [Captions by Serrara Fluttershy, and edited by others listed below.] 
Mark: Balalallalallalaa. Tyler: I betcha you're smudging the hell out of the lens right now.
Mark: Balalallalallalaa. *Mark breathing onto lens*
*quiet wiping noises*
*Mark kisses lens*
*whispers* Love you Mark: Want to try to get through this video without saying the word penis? Hello everybody, my name is Markiplier, and welcome back to the Balloon Animal Challenge. I'm joined once again by Wingus and Dingus over here. Say hi guys. Ethan: Hey! Tyler: Hi I'm Tyler. Mark: Nah, that's Dingus. This is Wingus
Ethan: Hi, I'm Wingus. Mark: There we go, see?
Ethan: With a 'W.' So we're back with the balloon animal challenge, we've got more balloons here, and we've got more suggestions from- again? Notice how I stopped holding it like that.
Tyler: Oh!
Mark: There you go. Tyler: I just didn't want to squeak it! Mark: You keep going Wingus!-- Alright, so, we're gonna be making more balloon animals but this time, instead of making your favorite animals into balloon form, we've got a list of your least favorite animals, so OoOoOoOo! Beware if you have specific phobias of the animals that you're not gonna- you don't know but you're gonna see. Oooh
Ethan: It's always coming back home! *Mark and Ethan Laugh* *Mark and Tyler inhaling/sucking in air* Mark: We're starting with one, but here's the twist Look at that. [Ethan:Hey!] Wow, that's a helium tank so you notice these- Ethan: Aren't filled with helium, they're not.
Tyler: That's a lie.
Mark: I can't believe you lie to your fans, man. Tyler: There you go! Mark: WWHHOOOAAAA-
*Tyler laughing* Mark: We're gonna start the round with this one balloon but every other balloon that we're gonna need in this whole thing you have to run back there, grab one of the balloons around the balloon pile, and make another balloon.
Tyler: Ethan, throw those pumps away! *Ethan 'struggling' to throw those pumps away* Mark: Don't pump me. Ethan: Got 'em. Mark: Anyway we're gonna be using the helium tank to fill these up. So in order to do that we're gonna need a little more time than we had before. Before we had one minute- or something like that. Some arbitrary number that some asshole like changed in the last second But this time we're gonna get two minutes to be able to make these balloons into balloon animals. Are you ready Wingus? Ethan: *burps* Yeah-ya.
Mark: Are you ready Dingus?
Tyler: Sure.
Mark: So let's get to - ballooning. What's our first suggestion? *balloon squeaking* Ethan: Seagulls...
Tyler: Like multiple??
Ethan: If you want Amy, offscreen: It says Ethan: Okay, ready, [Mark: No] I'm ready
Mark: I'm not- wait. Everyone visualize what you're gonna make. Just visualize. Don't make it yet. Okay, are you ready? Three, two, one, go! *Happy music plays while balloons squeak* Mark: I'm scared again! I forgot. *Happy music and balloon squeaks continue* Mark: How much time we got? Kathryn off-screen: 30 seconds. *Music and squeaks* Mark: How much time? Kathryn off-screen: What? Mark: How much time? Kathryn: 20. *Music and squeaks* Amy, Offscreen: Time! Mark: Time! Hands -hands off! Hands off! What do you have to say for yourself, Mister? Ethan, with high helium-voice: Hello! Seagulls. The rats of the air! Coming in from the sea, if you will. Up here, we have: the wings! The feet! The tail! A creation, created, none other, than by the- L-Lucifer himself. Mark: Alright, so what we have here is an Atlantic seagull. Uh, not here native to the Los Angeles area You can see uh, the-the bill on the Atlantic seagull is very- not quite as Pronounced as the Pacific seagulls that we all commonly associate from the Hollywood movies. It's actually got large, loping ears to scoop air in through its ears and then flap out of its broad, very broad, Wingies here. The actually like interesting thing about the Atlantic seagull is that it has a rudder It steers through the air carving like an elegant gazelle of the sky Not the rats of the sky you swine, the Gazelle of the sky Ethan: I'm not the swine, its the 'gulls Mark: They're very Graceful creatures, and of course these are its trademark droppings. Cah-Caw-cah-Caw-cah-Caw! *Fart noise*  Tyler interrupting: Seagull droppings aren't white- Gah-shut up! Cah-Caw-cah-Caw-cah-Caw! *Fart noise* Cah-caw-cah-caw-cah-caw! the Atlantic seagulls' droppings, are white. Show us what you got. *Mark laughing* The snakes of the sky. *Laughter* Tyler: This is the head of the seagull with the beak it's actually beautifully done- um, if I do say so myself and, this particular seagull got stuck in a trash can um of sorts. A can that was left on the beach by us humans and littering so it is forever stuck and trapped and it's *Softly* dying. 
Mark: oh. Tyler: It's realistic because that's the sad truth Ethan: Garbage just like the garbage on the beach Mark: What are we gonna do with these balloons after we're done? You wanna throw 'em in the ocean?
*Ethan blowing up a balloon*
Tyler: Nooo. Mark: Alright well yours is garbage so it's pretty much associated that you would make that, So According to our panel of judges here- wait I'm gonna leave. Let's leave it here. It'll be like a gallery we'll, We'll leave the art here and then we'll just hope that some art critics will walk by and then judge them thusly Kathryn, offscreen: We're judging you now. Mark: Did you guys judge walking by last time? Kathryn, offscreen: No, I'm not- 
Amy, offscreen: No, we didn't.
Mark: Oh Ethan: Which one?
Mark: Which one? Amy, offscreen: Uhh, Mark's Mark: YEAHHHHHHH
Ethan: Well that was a bad choice. Mark: Well, it wa- hey, shh, wow. Don't criticize the judges. Respect the judges Tyler: I'm gonna take a gander and say that's the proboscis. You, DON't- hey don't touch its proboscis jeez *Mark flicking the balloon's proboscis*
*cartoonish POP! when Mark takes the balloon out of his mouth* Mark: That's the proboscis. Ethan: Yuck. Yuck. Yuck Mark, laughing: And there you have it! Ethan: That's the worst thing you've ever done Mark, laughing: Bla-dow! Mark, laughing: That's the proboscis. Anyway... *Balloons squeaking*
AUUHHHH...OOHHHH Tyler: Your pink Dingus is- your pink Wingus is attacking my red Dingus. Mark, petting Ethan's shoulder: Don't make fun of my pink Wingus
Ethan: Yeah, don't make fun of his pink Wingus. Mark: Okay, we got a new new one and we're ready to go *Everyone laughing* Ethan: THAT'S FUN! *Tyler laughing* Ethan: This brings a whole- this is what the- original idea was.
Mark: Yeah! Mark: Oh, that's so- *starts laughing at Tyler's balloon* *Mark continues laughing* AHAHAHO, HoHoHO, HeHe, HEHAHA- Okay. Tyler: Hey, mine dances like some- like a ballerina! Mark:NO! *All laugh*
Ethan: Sabotage!! Amy, offscreen: Your animal, is. Ethan: Frog...
Mark: This was a bad choice. *Tyler laughs* Amy, offscreen: 3 2 1 go! Mark: OH JEEZ OK ALRIGHT
*Balloons squeaking* *Happy music and balloons squeak during the 'creation period'* Mark: Hands off!!
Ethan: I didn't touch you! Mark: *balloon escapes Mark's grasp*: AAAAHHHHAHHHHAHAAA *Ethan laughs at his own idea* Mark, distressed: What happened??? Amy, off screen: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,  [Mark: UH AHH!!] TIME! Mark: Okay. Tyler?
Tyler, possibly imitating Ethan: Sure! So, as you know what the Frog baby tiny little tail butt, little doo-dad, right up-bu-bup here, Tyler: It's nice little, like, it's got like a wee butt thing Tyler: And this unfortunate frog ran into an accident Tyler: And his- he was born with his legs merged with his head, his front legs are merged with his head Tyler: so his legs are like little up here, tied to his head Tyler: and all hes got is weird legs and he just kinda scooches on his face Mark: Your balloons are so sad :( Tyler: ...So mean *Mark having spasms* Mark: Mine is uh Mark: I call it 'The Journey of a Life of a Frog' Mark: Right? Okay, so let's start from the very beginning of a frog's life. The eggs, chained many eggs together all in a spawning pool. Mark: Strung together, vulnerable, pink, fleshy. *Ethan's unsure disapproval* Mark, whispering: Anything could happen Mark: Could be lost at any- *Ethan knocks a balloon away* AHH! Ethan: Anything can happen Mark: That was sabotage, I'd like to point out to the judges that was very much sabotage Ethan: No, no, no, I was explaining how anything can happen (Sure~) Mark: Anything can happen, tragedy can strike... Ethan: Art- Mark: Art is tragedy Mark: OK *Ethan giggling* Ethan: It's drawn to you Mark: It's drawn to me, ok- Mark: SHH *blows air* *smooch* Mark: Ok- so Mark: As you can see... Mark: It starts its life as a tadpole Mark: Journeying from the small egg, growing until it reaches tadpole status Mark: AND then, it takes its first crawling moments out from the waters edge Mark: Just like reminiscing the very basis of life itself when WE crawled from the ocean as just small fishy-fishy!! Mark: And then Mark: When it gets on land Mark: It is... *awkward noises* Mark: Not born because it's already been born, but it's REBORN Mark: As a frog Mark: Here, the giant...head staring at you Mark: Here *flicks the head like a juvenile* Mark: I- *starts losing composure as he flicks the head again before putting it in his mouth* Mark: There Mark: We have *mwah* Mark: Going back to the egg *Laughter in the background*  Mark: It's an adult.. Mark: And it goes back...lays an egg Mark: The journey- the CYCLE continues anew Ethan: Dude you really know how to bullshit. *Mark and Ethan cackling* Mark: Look at this! *whispers* look at this... That's a frog. Tyler: It's a frog... Mark: It's everything that a frog is and more it's all that a frog could be Tyler: Ethan-
Ethan: Look me in the eyes. [Off-screen mumbling]
Ethan: huSHHSHshhh... Let me explain... When you think of a frog, what do you think of? Those big, big legs. And what about those big legs? That THICC ASS! ;) [Mark cackling] Ethan, laughing: As shown... As shown in this representation Need I say more? Tyler: Those STRONK glutes. Mark: J-judges... Amy: Ethan!
Kat: Ethan wins! [Mark sighs]
Ethan: Thank you, thank you. Would you like to inspect? Tyler: Looks like a frog! Mark: Th-that's clearly ass biased, even though I myself would vote for that Mark: Huh? Kathryn: If you put it through the hole, it could have been a big frog tongue. Mark: oohhh *blehp* That would have been a better way to go Ethan: I'm a fly, flying through the rain forest. Mark: I'm a frog Ethan: who thinks he's safe
Mark: hoping- oh- oh!- Ethan: Bah!! A frog!
[Tons of squeaking and Mark laughing] So, Ethan, uh, in his absolute ignorance Decided that he was gonna be a dummy and not get a balloon- and I mean like... Ethan: I'm waiting to see what the prompt is! So I can correct - choose the correct color I was explaining my-my theory. I'm waiting-
Mark, interrupting: Guys look at mine! Ethan: I'm waiting to see what the prompt is so I can...correct- use the correct color So the score is one for me one for Ethan - [weird burp-yell]- nothing for Tyler yet But there is every possibility that he can redeem himself [Quietly] What's the next suggestion? Ethan: 'Kay Amy: Three, two, one, go! [Mark groaning] Mark: No...No! Hurry up, you stupid asshole! Kathryn: That's time. Tyler: Mine's- mine's a long boi monkey, and as you know those baboons that have red asses have some blue accents as learned by the Lion King Um, with those profound lines up here-
 that you got it right there And this is its face. And then of course he's got to have his legs and the giant huge profound red  buttocks Mark: Question! Amy: That butt looks a lot like a frog. Ethan: Did you reu-- you can't Ethan: recycle
Tyler: There was never a rule about that! Ethan: You cant recycle. That's cheating- we have to use new balloons. Tyler: That was never made clear
Mark: That is- that is a- that is a rule Tyler:It was never said! 
Mark: it was never said aloud, but if it was said aloud in the last one then Then the rules carry over from last time
Ethan: I think that's a given. Mark: Alright, We'll leave it up to the final judges to make the final decision. I call this one Baboon in Winter. A tragic story if ever there was one. There was no food that fall, didn't have time to prepare left out, foraging on its own lost Galloping through the trees trying to make its way, the snow started creeping in, the cold winds bit to the bone *softer* Bit to the butt. Clawing its way through a river, seeing one salmon still left, not touched by bear. Ah! Can it get close? It's trying desperately! Ahhhhhh! Frozen, didn't make it. Family; starving back home. Red butt, now frozen blue A tragedy if ever there was one And- That lil' penis. Ethan: Ahh, You said penis.
Tyler: You broke the rule. Mark: Damn it! You were- we were doing so good. Also You literally all you have to do is explain what it looks like you don't have to give a backstory- Mark: Look! my art has so much more to it Tyler: I will say one thing Mark: God damn it Tyler: I- I Will say one thing Monkeys don't live around bears Mark: I said baboon! Amy, offscreen: The prompt was monkey, for the record. Monkey with the red ass. Mark: Yeah monkey stupid Ethan: All right, well mine Pretty basic to be honest. We've got the big-the big head You know, they've got to use their noggin. Next- next to humans; monkeys are some of the most smart species in the animal kingdom He's got big big head, he's also got arms to climb trees with and whatnot then You know it, we love it, that big-big, the legs... And the ass. I was going for- I know we were talking about the big /red/ ass but I think that it's a little bit more accurate that it would have a pinkish hue because it's closer to the skin tones of...the-the the apes and whatnot. That's pretty much my- 
Mark: what's the blue thing? Ah! Ethan: Yes an elastic band, to...
Mark:  Like a lobster, you gotta keep the ass cheeks closed Ethan: Nononono! Like uh, like it's workin' out- It's like working out the glutes, you know those elastic bands you use? Ethan: You know
Mark: No
Tyler: I see the kool-aid man. Ethan: Well see what you want to see art is subjective.
Tyler: I'd like to point out, mine's the only one with a red ass. Ethan: I mean- That Is also true, minimal offer. What?! *Tyler smacks his balloon* Why?! Mark: It's the leg thing! Amy: Yeah. He's doing the same thing over and over, that can't count over and over again!
Ethan: Well listen this one was Specifically to monkey with the red ass.
Mark: You've stolen this from- his family.
Ethan: Well, you didn't win. My monkey won, obviously, and I think everybody knows it including yourself. You're just too afraid to admit. What is the next prompt?
Mark: Wait hang on let me show you guys...so, you take the proboscis, insert it Anyway. Well what do you want a tied balloon, or a full balloon? Your next animal is That's the plan, plans, plan everybody. Girls: 3, 2, 1 Time. *laughter as Tyler dies a little inside* Ethan: Just a dude with a boner. *Laughter* Ethan: Explain. Mark: Yeah, I'll go first. Tyler seems indisposed, so what's the first thing you think of when you think of a kangaroo, right?
Ethan: big dick That's the first thing what's the second thing you think of when you think of a kangaroo, right? Its ability to kick. it's got huge footers. It's got crazy... It's got crazy like ahhh potential like right. Okay, so I wanted to start from Kind of like just feeling where the balloon took me. It's giving. It's doing that You know the emoji that goes *makes emoji face* you know that emoji So it's doing a little bit of that with his tongue like *emoji face* oh, yeah And then these are its ears, cause that's the other thing that kangaroo is known for, its big ears It's got a big snoot. Got big ears. Little sassy. And, uh... Great kickers. Mark: Yep. 
Ethan: I'll go next, uh, cause I think Tyler should go last. So when I think of a kangaroo I immediately think of the big old ears, big old ears Just like - kind of like a bunny rabbit, but an Australian bunny rabbit, and the next thing I think of is that big pouch that the little babies go in. Obviously this mother here hasn't had a child quite yet But, ah, 'tis the season Don't get too- *uncomfortable stuttering*  Don't do it. wait I'm not done So the big pouch for the baby to go in, the big ears, this one lost its legs in a *fishes for an answer* Jungle accident... Mark: Nope.
*laughter* Ethan: I just love the immediate denial, just "That didn't happen." So yeah, that's my kangaroo, hope that you take it into consideration it also, uh, doubles as a toilet. So, take what you will... Tyler: *quietly* That's mine... That's the pouch, that's it's face with big ears. And, it's hiding behind a rock... Ready to pounce and kick you in the face. Amy: *offscreen* What's the orange? Tyler: It's...orange cactus desert Mark: *laughs* The sunset on a summer's eve. Amy: *offscreen* We like Tyler's. *Complaints from Mark and Ethan*
Ethan: Even I wanted Mark to win! Yeah, wait, hang on, wait- Mark: *as kangaroo balloon* This is bullshit! I'm outta here! Wait this looks like something I made in Spore. Be free! *Laughter from everyone* Tyler: He's oh...HE'S A CEILING CRAWLER! Mark: So, Ethan won, he has two points. I have one, Tyler has one point. This is the parade of our creations Not in, uh, perfect harmony here, but I think it's good to end this one off with a little bit of a song. What should we sing? Ethan: *Singing with helium* Do you wanna build a snowmaaan? M: Wait. Fucking hell.
E: Sorry. Mark, Ethan and Tyler: *Singing with helium* Do you wanna build a snowman? Doesn't have to be a snowmaaan... E: *Singing with helium* Okay, bye... *Mark dies* (Subscribe to Markiplier) (Caption writers in the description) (Caption fixes by Phoebe, Me) (Extra fixes by Daydream)

Colonel: What the hell is going on? Where's Celine? George: She's gone, and so is everyone else. Detective: Wait a minute, where the hell do you think you're going?! George: Away from here! This place is cursed! If you'd half a brain, you'd all do the same. Colonel: Don't walk away from me! Where's Celine? Where's Damien!? Chef: I've spent 25 years cooking for these uppity fucks. I'm not about to die for 'em! I quit! Bitch! Butler: I know things seem far beyond your control right now, but such that it is for all of us here. I shall take my leave, and I implore you to do the same. Colonel I won't let my friends die in this godforsaken house! And if you all are too much of a coward to do the same, you had best leave before I kill you myself! Detective: Now you hold on a second, I've got more questions– Colonel: Get your hands off me! Detective: What the hell is going on here?! Butler: I know he's in pain and I know you might be, too... But we need to leave this place. There's only death here now. [music fades, distorts, sound of a heartbeat echos] (whispered) Hey! (whispered) Help! (distorted) Madness! (distorted) You wanna talk about madness? (distorted) Madness is stealing your best friend's wife. (distorted) Be careful. (distorted) Now this evening, it's not all about the poker; it's not all about me. (distorted) Can't we resolve this amicably? (distorted) Life needs a bit of madness, eh, chap? (distorted) Good to let the beast out every once in a while, eh, old friend? (distorted) I'm not gonna just sit around and let you drag my partner off to their very likely death! (distorted) I thought I told you to stay out of my kitchen! (distorted) A domain of evil this is... but in we must go. (distorted) You first... [music returns to normal, heartbeat remains] Colonel: There you are! I've been meaning to ask you some questions– What is this? The detective's been keeping tabs on us? The detective's been keeping tabs on me. And Celine! He's the one who orchestrated ALL of this! He DID this! Detective! DETECTIVE! Where is he? He took them from me... He took my friends from ME. He took...Celine. He took Damien! Where is he? WHERE IS HE?! DETECTIVE! Are you hiding him from me?! He can't hide forever. GET OUT OF MY WAY! DETECTIVE! Detective: You'd better choose your next words carefully, Colonel. Colonel: Only my friends get to call me by that name, and you, sir, are NO friend of mine! Detective: Well, you're one to talk about friends, you MURDERER! [thunder] Colonel: I didn't kill anybody! This is MADNESS! Detective: Oh, you wanna talk about madness? Madness is stealing your best friend's wife. Madness is squeezing him for cash to fund your own sick sexual exploits with that very woman– Colonel: SHUT UP! Detective: Madness is plotting the death of your childhood friend because you can't handle the– [gunshot, thunder] [intense, droning music picks up] [Gunshot] [Colonel, distorted] It was an accident! [crash] [slow, distorted] I swear... [Music begins, crescendos] [Heartbeat begins] [Distorted voice] Body: It's not fair, isn't it? [All sounds are echoed] Damien: He took everything from us. He trapped us in here with this broken shell and no way out. Celine: It's true. This whole time I thought it was the house but... I never thought he'd fall this far. Damien: And we played right into his hands. He'd been planning this for years and now that son-of-a-bitch is out there walking around in MY body– Celine: Damien, we CAN'T do this right now. Look, I know you have questions and I can't answer everything right now. Just know that Mark took everything from us from his twisted quest of vengeance. But death does not mean the same thing here. Damien: What Celine means by that is.. This doesn't have to be the end. You're trapped in here just the same as us, but your body... Broken as it may be, it's still out there. Celine: Mark's not the only one that can use this place to his benefit. The same way that I brought you here, is the same way that I can send you back. Damien: But you can't survive on your own. You're dead, after all. The Colonel saw to that. Celine You can't blame him. Honestly, he's a good man. But he's dangerous now. Damien: I know this all sounds crazy. Honestly, I don't know what the fuck is going on. But I know that I trust Celine. And if you trust us... Just...let me in. [flicker] We can fix this. Together. Celine: I won't force this on you. You have a choice here. Just know this is the only way that you can escape. Just relax. Damien: This'll work. I promise. [rumbling thunder] [creaking noises] Colonel: Oh no! No! It's okay. I-I thought you were dead. I-I-I mean, of course you're not dead! You're not—how could you be dead? I mean, I-I wouldn't have killed you. I-I didn't kill you. [Soft piano music starts] I mean, of cour–I-I... Of course! I didn't kill anybody! [laughter] I didn't- It was all a joke! Of course, it was all a joke! Were you in on this!? Did Damien put you up to this? Of course he did! Damien, where are you, you rapscallion? Where are you? Celine? Ah, it's time to come out now! AH! It was good, it was good! You almost had me! [Slight warped] Ha! Ha, ha...Celine? [Crackling, static noises] [Slight static persists] [Music ends on unfinished chord, fades out] [loud static] [short beep] [coughing] Detective: Colonel... [coughing] If you can hear this... You better run. [Radio turns off]

ow ow ow it hurts show better it doesn't hurt when I'm blowing you know that I didn't know and that's that's an intriguing thing I'm really I'm really gonna feel like I'm kind of being sabotage trite now I totally feel like this is full saboteur what I mean it's totally art but I don't I don't know there's not burrowing maybe it looks like the market needs to be pushed in further this game is crap Oh every time I stop blowing it suddenly hurts but when I'm in my in the middle of my art this is Garbo why is it not where's it not blow bow okay ah well I just wet it so that that ain't gonna help nobody here where ah good yeah hang on well please please please Pete I get one thing okay Erica nice nice this is good stuff good stuff mark thank you okay all right it's just groaning why are you ruining I don't know if I'm groaning how am i groaning you are who drips you dripped on me you dripped on your shelf okay that did not drip off it doesn't hurt when I'm blowing it only when I stop blowing it it's a breathing exercise fuck oh it was weird when I was in my art mold it's painful I got paint in the bucket got a lot of paint in the bucket good thing body paint is non-toxic oh I I actually wiped off a lot of them art so okay hope hope all right Oh would you like [Music] it's right here okay thank you so much for the $1,000 it's a big contribution [Laughter] [Laughter] [Music] okay thank you were there any other big donations okay all right what do we add actually [Music] awesome we've still got what time is it right now okay so we needed a judge oh yeah no no viewers at home judge a donation yeah I can't tell if I make a poll and there's a poll up there but it's for the final thing straw poll would be yes if you guys donate right now right in your comment section of the donation who has the best shirt right now get together yes it's a good name yeah the name of the person just the name of the person with the best shirt right now not who made the best shirt but it was currently wearing the best shirt and I gotta admit you got the right color scheme you got the right like unification this has the most like color and that's all over the place garbage at least mine's like kind of themed this I don't know but actually just you rub off yeah I need your art rubs off on others I just have that kind of personality the what good oh it's an evil face Hey no this is kind of cool looks like a stitch smiley face yeah anyway so if you guys can write the name of the person who has the best shirt right now that'll be the winner and then the person who loses bye see ya we come back to punish me oh yeah we'll come back to the punishment what we'll do Bob in this yeah righty-ho righty-ho oh yeah who wants to get us to win and where we go and what we do and why we're here and who I am and what shirt is the best for Q and save the children we love you always and no one will stop us from have baby shirts on sale to date that's a lie I really promise that thing here horn Jim say things we don't like thank you was there any me alright alright looks like I want what come on take a look we got some nice body paint through what you got you oh wait a second Ethan went and danger territory with his blows that's fine see I had the strategy of holding it in my mouth when I was blowing so whatever whatever okay all right all right I guess I lose then yeah look up for your love yeah all right I guess if we really care about these super expensive loved one bull shit all right so what donation total over yet whoa keep those donations going let's see what happens I love that there's paint in this now and a nice hey it's not too bad I'm gonna try and get the edge so you don't get it all over your head how oh I know what's an apple and what's ice the size no by the taste [Laughter] did you watch your eyes all right good okay you want me to go for another one yeah [Laughter] I'm sorry that might have been a good one you're honest at least girl actually I was hoping you get that hope hey remember don't see any use for games oh that is perfect for the next one actually okay don't don't forget your spaghetti duh duh duh don't forget your spaghetti is a game where I made this up like all these where we are each given a bowl of spaghetti and then the bull is taken away we have to hold that spaghetti until the end of the round all the way at the hour passes in the next game whoever has the most amount of spaghetti left not only wins that or they win that and then also the winner of the challenge is exempt from the punishment so whoever has the least amount of spaghetti has to Bob and the loser has to Bob so there's two potential Bob's in addition to all the other punishments that we have for the next one make sense yeah yeah all right so we'll be doing that in the next one but remember guys we're here to raise money for Save the Children work everything needs double I'm gonna hound you guys about this because we have a long way to go we may have raised fifty seven thousand dollars but that is only a quarter of the way to our goal and we have done technically a quarter of the challenges that we're gonna be doing today so we're relying on you guys to help us out I'm gonna be making a donation in between this and the next one I hope you guys make a donation in fact here's what I'll do since it's in the in the nature of matching whatever you guys donate from the time this stream goes off to the time it comes back on I will match in a personal donation what it will triple so whatever you donate in the next span will triple because not only will I be matching but the anonymous donator will be matching as well now that will start as soon as we cut off the stream for this one and then move on to the next challenge and then we will continue that and I will make my donation either before or just as we're going into the next stream make sense everybody yes okay so this has been fun I blame them for my failures as always but thank you so much we are not done for the day we have six more challenges that we're gonna be doing if you want to see them make sure to bring that notification belts are you gonna notification what we're going up I do not have my phone right now so I cannot tweet out exactly when we go up each time but we will hopefully rectify that solution so that you guys begin the notification there as well but thank you guys we got a long way to go it's gonna be super fun chika appreciates it and everyone here is grateful she's taking a nice I just had steak nap oh that's so sweet so we'll be back in just over 30 minutes thank you guys again we'll see you soon donate please whatever you do I'll match well baby it's a triple Oh 
Celine: What are you doing? Detective: Who the hell are you? Colonel: Celine? What are you doing here? Detective: "Celine"? How the hell do you know her? Butler: Madame, I'm afraid you've come at a very inopportune time. Something dreadful has happened here. Celine: I can see that, and I'm glad I got here before it got any worse. Chef: This is only the tip of the iceberg! And it's a big iceberg. Chef: How can I put this delicately? Chef: MARK'S FUCKING DEAD! Celine: What? Chef: Dead, like my hopes and dreams. Chef: And he's a flesh-eating zombie, too. Celine: Homo necrosis. Colonel: Exactly, hence the guns. Detective: That is not "hence the guns"! Butler: Stop waving those bloody guns around! Celine: Hol-hold on! Tell me what happened! How did Mark...die? Mayor (offscreen): It was murder. And worse yet... The body is missing. Celine: What? Show me. And don't say that word. Chef:  What word? Murder? Celine: Yes! That word! Butler:  Well, I mean murder is a rather accurate description of what occur— Celine: Do you not see the lightning? Detective: You sayin' it was lightning that murdered Mark? Colonel: Well, Mother Nature doesn't exactly strike me as having murderous intent. ...Unless you count that time I was sucked into the board game: Jumanji and I wa—! Celine: Stop, stop! Look, whatever's happening here is tapping into forces far beyond our control. Chef (quietly): murder. Colonel (slowly): Mur...doch? Detective: Malarkey. Butler: Marco!
[The thunder proceeds to be done with them messing around] 
Celine: Enough! Look. Mark's death is a terrible thing indeed. But I fear that there are forces much darker than anything we've seen here today. I'm well versed in the arcane arts, but if you, untrained and uninitiated, can summon lightning with a mere word, we're all in far graver danger than anything we could ever hope to face alone. We're gonna have to work together if we're gonna survive this. Mayor:  Celine, what are you proposing? Celine: We need to speak with Mark. Chef: I knew it! He's a flesh-eating zombie!
Celine: No. Colonel:  Well, maybe one of those smart zombies: homeo sapio zombifus. Celine:  No, no. I need to commune with the dead. Detective: That... doesn't sound like a good idea.
Celine: Well, it's a good thing I don't need your permission. Celine: But you! You've been awfully quiet through this whole thing. Chef: With those beady little eyes.
Butler: And wearing THOSE rags, pff. Detective: Maybe I shouldn't have trusted someone so goddamn gorgeous. Colonel: Oh, I'll pass. Celine: But I feel like I can trust you. I sense that you have a far greater part to play in all of this. Will you help me find an answer? Perfect. Come with me. Detective: Alright, that's enough. I'm not gonna just sit around and let you drag my partner off to their very likely death. I won't stand for it! Colonel: Well, I trust Celine with all my heart! I see no reason why an-any-any one should doubt her! Butler:  Well, I have to agree with our intrepid detective here. It just doesn't seem natural. Chef: I never liked this uptight asshole. He walks around with a stick up his ass. But I think he's right, something's weird. Celine: If it makes you feel any better, you guys can stand watch outside the door, but my work CANNOT be interrupted. Detective: Oh, believe you me. I'll be keeping a close eye on every single one of you. Even myself. Especially myself. Mayor: Wh—Celine? Celine, wait. Wait!
Celine: Yes, Damien? Damien: I... are you alright? Celine: (sighs) Damien: I know this news can't be settling well with you. Celine: I'm fine for now.
Damien: I... er... But all this talk of the occult! And—and Mark is dead, wait! Wait. I just didn't think you were the type to become mixed up with all this. Celine: There is more to this world than you could ever hope to imagine. I just had my eyes open to a small portion of it. Damien:  I... [Sigh] Just be careful! You too. Celine: Could you hand me my bag? Thank you. Please, have a seat. Now, I'm sure this must be unsettling for you, being thrust into this series of unfortunate events. But I promise—with your help, I'm going to get to the bottom of this. Now I'm not sure who would want to kill Mark, but something tells me this seemingly significant event is actually a footnote in a much larger mystery unfolding in our midst. I've never been very comfortable in this house. 
But something tells me... Now that my eyes are open, there are dark forces surrounding this manor. (Audio slows, distorts. Speech fades in and out)
Detective:  Keep your enemies close, eh? Colonel: I will not be called a murderer in my own home!
Celine: Stop! Colonel: I thought it was time that we come get to know each other, far away from the prying eyes of...anyone else. Detective: You're not gonna believe this. I can't believe this. The body—the body is gone. It's fucking gone! [Piercing ring begins to penetrate muddled noise] Damien:  ...Not exactly sure what we're supposed to be celebrating. I mean, it's good to have the gang back together, but out of the blue like this seems.. (???, laughing) Employers come and go, come and go. Some die, some don't. (Thunderclap, audio returns to normal)
Celine: What happened? Why did you stop? Did you see something? Someone? Draw it. What is this? This doesn't answer anything! You need to go back! Go back, now! Detective: What the shit is this? Celine: Get out! We are not done here!
Mayor: Celine, I think this is quite enough. Celine:  It's enough when I SAY it's enough!
Detective:  C'mon, partner, let's go. Come on! Hurry it up! What did she do to you? What is this? Butler! Butler! Butler: What? What is it?
Detective: This mean anything to you? Butler: Well, maybe...no, sorry.
Detective: Spit it out if you got something! Butler: Well...it could be our groundskeeper George, but he only works on weekdays. Detective: Looks like your friend here may disagree with that notion! Chef: Me?
Detective: Yeah, you. Chef:  Uh...I don't know shit, I plead the fifth, man.
Butler: Chef, if you know something, for god's sake spit it out! Chef: Okay, alright, you're twisting my arm, alright. George has been living on the grounds for years. Butler: WHAT?!
Detective: And you just now thought to share that information with us? For all we know, he could be the murderer! Celine: For the last time, stop saying that word! Chef: Look. George... just tends to the grounds, man. He's a fuckin' hermit! Detective: I don't care what the fuck he is! Mayor: Look, all this arguing is getting us nowhere! Just go outside and talk to this George and be done with it! Detective: Hold on a sec. You're not coming with us?
Mayor: I-I need to stay here with Celine. Celine: I don't need help. Especially from you!
Mayor: OUR FRIEND IS DEAD! I'm sorry. I just need answers to all of this. I already lost one friend today; I don't want to lose another. Celine: Fine, but I need to stay here.
Mayor: Fine with me. Detective: Fine, good, yeah, whatever, who cares. Alright, you're coming with me. Partner, you too. Hold on a sec... We're missing somebody. Who had eyes on the Colonel?
Butler: Well, he appeared tired, and...went back to his room. Detective: I'm sure he did. And with any luck, he'll stay there. Alright, let's roll out. Come on. Detective (offscreen):  Move it. Come on, partner, come on! Detective:  Lead the way, Cookie. Chef: Cookie? I'm not your Cookie! I spent three weeks at culinary school! I earned the right to be called a chef! Detective: I'm very impressed. Just tell us where we're going! Come on! Let's go! Detective: I think I see him. Hey! Buddy! Hands where I can see 'em! George: Hey, my hands are where they're supposed to be. Unless, of course, you'd like to dig the hole for yourself. Detective: What the hell are you doing here?
George: I'm the groundskeeper. I keep the ground, alright? I'd say look around. The ground is pretty well kept in this place, right? Chef: I'm sorry, man, this dick made me bring him out here.
Detective: You shut up. How do you not know about the murders going on in this house? (Interrupted by thunder) How do you not hear that lightning? George: Lightning is the sky's business! Look at the ground! When the ground starts shooting up lightning, I'll let you know! Detective: Alright then, smartass, why exactly are you digging that hole? And why shouldn't we suspect you for taking part in the death of your employer? George: (laughs) Employers come and go! Some die, some don't, some are murdered, some are not. It's not my business! I'm digging this hole for a burst water pipe, if that's alright with your gracefulness! Chef: See, I told you. George didn't do nothin, man!
George: See? I just did nothing. Detective: Forgive me for not taking you at face value. But we're all gonna come inside, we're gonna sit down, and have a nice lovely chat. And get to the bottom of this before I lose my mind, and start dabbling in murder myself! George: Now, you listen to me, sonny. It's been fifteen years since I've been in that house. And I am not about to break that winning streak now. I don't care how many murders there've been. I ain't going near that house! However, there is one reason. One incident. One manifestation. That will get me into that mad house. You had better pray to God that that reason never comes to pass. (thunderclap) THAT THERE'S THE REASON! Detective: Go, go, go! (Dramatic music) George: Somebody help me!

*Yaaaaaay* *laughter*

[What do you see, Jack?] W- Don't leave!
M- Welcome to my office! *clears throat* How are you doing? J- [???] I almost didn't see you, you perfectly blended in with the couch furniture [?] M- Oh, it's 'cause I wasn't like this - wait - cuz I wasn't like this. W- ARE YOU ONE OF THESE, BOB!?

[HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA] J- Wade is very popular in Amsterdam

M- They do, that they do. M- I *gives up* I-I am lagging everywh- Okay, welp, I'm glad I could help! M- It's just like every single step I take it's a connection problem. I don't know what's going on guys, M- I'm having trouble.
J- The game - the game's protecting you from yourself.
M- No!!! [Yes] M- Probably, but that's not... okay. I am floating above my body M- UUUUUUUUUUUH

What something in me Can you still do the exploit where you can climb with with things infinitely if you stand on them For you from your prison of Mark are we taking a bath together right now? I am not in the bath, but I'll say yes 
[COLONEL] Oh, bully! And here I thought I was gonna be the last guest to arrive. My friends call me the Colonel. You're welcome to do the same, should it please you. But, uh... ...after you. [BUTLER] Ah, bonjour! Welcome to Markiplier Manor. Your invitation, please. Very good, very good. Right this way. Good luck at the table tonight. I shall fetch you a drink forthwith. [MAYOR] Oh! There you are, old friend. How are you settling into your new office? Now I know it'll take some getting used to, but there's no one I would rather have alongside me to protect this great city of ours. Now, I'll see you at the table soon, but try not to rob me blind again. We'll catch up. [CHEF] If you're looking for hors d'oeuvres, I'll get 'em when I'm good and ready! And stay out of my kitchen! [BUTLER] Now, now. Let's not be rude to our guest. So sorry about that. Here's your champagne. Enjoy your evening. [MARK] Welcome, welcome, one and all! My name is Markiplier. Thank you for joining me on this auspicious evening. So good to be surrounded by such close and trusted friends. Now, this evening, it's not all about the poker. It's not all about me. It's about you. So drink up and be merry! Life is for the living! And who knows? I could be dead tomorrow. [laughter, slowly becomes distorted] [EDM plays through scene] [music distorts and fades] [alarm rings] [BUTLER] Ah, good morning. Hope you've had a good night's rest. I've prepared for you a seltzer with cocaine. Best thing for the morning after, if you ask me. [MAYOR] Ah, there's our little monster! You really knocked 'em dead last night. I haven't seen you go wild like that since our days at university. Good to let the beast out every once in a while, eh, old friend? Then again, I'm-I'm still not exactly sure as to what we're supposed to be celebrating here. I mean it's good to have the gang back together, but...out of the blue like this seems... Anyway, now is not the time to become conspiratorial. Life is ours to choose, as I always say. I have some work to finish, but I'll meet you at breakfast. We'll all catch up soon. [DETECTIVE] Did anyone hear that lightning? OH MY GOD! THERE'S BEEN A MURDER! [BUTLER] Excuse me, did you hear light—OH MY GOD MURDER! [CHEF] Did you—? MUUUURDER! [DETECTIVE] What the hell happened here? Who's in charge around here? Trick question: that guy. And he's dead now, which makes ME in charge. So you better listen up good, bucko. 'Case you haven't been paying attention, there's been a bit of a...killin'. And you're my prime suspect! So you better get to explaining right quick as to the what, where, when and why you happen to be here upon this man's death! [BUTLER] Sir, the body is cold. He's been dead a while. [DETECTIVE] (chuckles) A likely story! That I happen to believe completely. All right, you're off the hook for now, but I'm a detective, and— [CHEF] Oh, yeah? Prove you're a real dick! [DETECTIVE] Here's my badge. Asshole. Those are my old partners. Don't ask me about them. Fine! I'll tell you. Each one of them died. Each death more tragic than the last. A few of them even died in ironically hilarious ways. Which made it all the more tragic. But hey, you look like you're up to the task. You're my new partner. (laughs) That's what all my old partners used to say. Right before they died. All right. Hand me that fingerprinting kit behind you, partner. Thanks, partner. [MAYOR] What the hell happened here? [BUTLER] Oh! Mr. Mayor. I'm so sorry. There's been a murder. [thunderclap] [MAYOR] A murder? [another thunderclap] Who? [CHEF] It's Mark. [DETECTIVE] I'm afraid he's telling the truth. Mark's been...killed. [MAYOR] Why? Who would do this? [DETECTIVE] That's exactly what me and my new partner here are here to find out. [BUTLER] Um, excuse me. I feel like we should call the authorities for them to handle this matter. [DETECTIVE] Look, buddy, as far as you're concerned, I AM the authorities. The fact of the matter is, I believe the killer is right here amongst us in this very house. With that freaky lightning storm outside, none of us would get very far, anyway. So, in the meantime, we're stuck here. But I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. The rest of you, get back to your rooms, hunker down, and pray to God you're not next to be murdered. [thunderclap] [BUTLER] I'll...I'll check on our other guests. [CHEF] I'll get back to cooking. All this death made me hungry. [MAYOR] I...I-I need to talk to the Colonel about this. [DETECTIVE] All right, partner. It's time to get to work. Judging by the temperature of the body that I measured rectally, which is obviously the most accurate way to get the inner body temperature of a corpse. That's a fact, totally procedure. Don't tell anyone I did it. I am sure Mark was killed around 1:30 a.m. last night. So what were YOU doing at 1:30 a.m. last night? [EDM music] [DETECTIVE] I'm gonna ignore the strange fact that you sleep with your eyes open. But it checks out. So, we need to figure out where everyone was and what they were doing around that time or, at the very least, who saw Mark last. You need to get out there. See if you can piece together the story of what happened last night. I'll stick around with the body and run more... ...tests. (deep sniff) [MAYOR] How can you be so flippant? [COLONEL] Flippant?! I'm taking this matter very seriously. [MAYOR] Oh, don't give me that horseshit! I know you hated him, but...goddammit, he reached out to you! [COLONEL] Oh, what do you want from me? [MAYOR] Wh—I want you to care! [COLONEL] Just because I'm not weeping like a child doesn't mean that I don't care. [MAYOR] I can't believe you. You come find me when you pull your head out of your ass! Excuse me. [COLONEL] Damien, I don't—Oh! Ah! Good to see you again! You were quite the rapscallion at last night's festivities. But you're probably here to help the detective with his "investigation of murder." [thunderclap] Anyway. I'll help you, I'll tell you what happened to our dear friend Mark. [COLONEL, mockingly] "Oh, look at me! My name is Markiplier now!" "Forget all my friends or the people that helped me along the way; just look at my money!" "Oh, I need to pay people to be my friends! Ha ha ha! You like me? Too bad!" "Oh, glug glug! Oopsie poopsie! I can't hold my booze. Gotta go off to the little boys' room. Who wants to join me?" "I'm gonna go there upon my stairs. MY house has more than ONE staircase." "Oh, look at me and how great I AM!" "Oh no, I'm falling! Aaah, I'm dead." [COLONEL] And that's what happened. Probably, anyway. So, if you need to corroborate this story with anybody else, just be on your way and investigate the entire house. Go now. I'll be here when you're done. [BUTLER] Come with me. I need to show you something. Now, if you're looking for answers, there's really no mystery at all. There's not a single detail of this house that I'm not privy to, and not a single guest that I have not personally vetted. Now I warn you: what you are about to see is not for the faint of heart. A domain of evil this is... But in we must go. You first. AVERT YOUR EYES! I'm so sorry you had to see this! Master would be so displeased! If only he were still alive! (loud sobbing that gradually fades) [CHEF] I thought I told you to stay out of my kitchen! Oh. You're helping that dick with his little investigation, huh? Well, I might look like a sweet and innocent man, but some people with short lifespans might think otherwise. I can't imagine why, can you? Last night, after I got rid of all of the evidence... ...of that delicious meal I prepared, and wiped down all the fingerprints... ...from those filthy dishes. And sopped up all that blood... I retired to my room at 1:00 a.m. and left my little buddy in charge, like I always do. He sees everything. Why don't you ask HIM what happened last night? [MARK] Abe!
[DETECTIVE] Mark! Good to see ya. [MARK] Great to see ya. Look, I'll cut right to the chase. Chef, butler, good? [DETECTIVE] Chef's an asshole, but he's clean. Uh...butler, he's a chill guy, also an asshole, but he's also clean. [MARK] Well, I wouldn't have it any other way. [soft piano music, birds chirping] [MAYOR] (sighs) Look, I'm sorry you saw that argument with the Colonel. I lost my temper, and it wasn't right and...he must be in shock. The Colonel's an eccentric; it's his best quality and his worst. But he's my friend, and...so was Mark. I know I'm supposed to be a leader in this scenario, but I can't help but feel lost! I've known Mark for years, since we were kids! And he's just gone? I don't have any answers right now. I just need to be alone...to process all of this. We'll talk soon, but I need to think. [DETECTIVE] Hey! Partner! Get over here, now! Hurry up! You're not gonna believe this; I can barely believe this! The body: it's gone. It's just fucking disappeared. Look! 
-Mark Grunting- Maximum Effort -more grunting and panting- OoOh God, in heck -sigh of relief- Hey Hi Hello everybody, my name is Markiplier Boink! Chica hop on up here. Good girl Hey! How's it going? Am I even in frame? I have no idea I'm gonna assume "no". Stayyy -Rumbles from camera- OOOooOh! OOOh -More rumbles from camera moving- Chica stay there! -continued rumbling- Chica! -more rumbles while mark grumbles at chica- Nononono... Stay right there Hi Chica! 'scooze me thats my spot -strains from picking up Chica- Okay, so, uh quick update, ummm I finally have been able to get settled back in I know i got back in town... Chica what are you doing... -giggles from mark- -through giggles- Chica are you okay? ...okay.. chica you good? Alright Chica's comfy. Chica you're a cutie. you're a cutie patootie and I love you Hi. hows it going. Now you may have noticed that the videos over the past week have been super sporadic. Which is kinda weird considering I've been back in town for a full week. But last week I was working on a lot of different projects, that don't actually have anything to do with videos uh, and ALSO I was doing collabs with people Uh, I can tell you about one of them, Rhett &amp; Link, Im gonna be on good mythical morning, this Wednesday actually We did some cool stuff there, and I did another collab recently that I don't know if I can talk about yet and then I did one more, where I did some vocals for another random encounters musical If you haven't seen it, it's the Five Nights at Freddy's stuff that we did Five Nights at Freddy's the musical. The big like five part series that they created So I've done a lot of stuff with them in the past, including like Resident Enis and things like that But I've also, uh, we're working on the Cuphead musical, and I do a voice in that one Now that ones not gonna come out for a couple months Uh.. but it's just really cool because this year... I have a tonne of new things that I wanna do. And a-ah-I always say that I want to do new things But this year especially, I'm kinda committed to.. allowing myself to be in the right mindset. Not only to make whatever I wanna make but also allowing myself not to get bogged down on the things that don't really matter when it comes to making videos, because I've been doing this for about six years now I've--y'know I've run the gambit of the emotions of like 'OOH THIS IS NEW AND EXCITING' to 'Oh I miss the old days!' to 'OH YOU'VE CHANGED MARKIPLIER HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO US!' Y'know I've run the gambit of all the different emotions. And I'm to the point, and I said this last week, where I'm to the point where I'm in a really good space I feel a lot happier about creating things. And I feel a lot more comfortable, with experimenting about the types of things that I can do So uhh. *giggle* It's gonna be, basically in my mind, what I've come up with is This year is gonna be, 'the year of very weird videos' because, on- one of th- one of the things that I always do is I'm always inconsistent uh, in pretty much everything I do in life I'm inconsistent to the point of ridicule. I am ju--laugh- I am just so absolutely all over the place in everything that I do That no one can really peg down, what to expect next an- and that's something that I really wanna embrace this year, because Last year was the uh, Last year was like the year of doing a lot of big team projects Where I had, uh, all of us working on a date with markiplier, markiplier TV, who killed markiplier Lotta big projects This year, I wanna execute a lot of very small ideas very quickly Because I feel this, I feel this urge, to like do, random bullshit all the time I have this urge, and I may actually do it Where I wanna do a 24 hour livestream That's not for charity. It's just, for me to try to learn a skill in 24 hours. and livestream the whole process and just get the emotional gambit of, starting it, knowing failure, failing more, getting desperate, losing all hope and then at the end, like in the twenty third hour, actually making some progress at the skill and I have no idea how it's gonna go or even if I can do it, but it's just.. y'know i-it's just gonna be a lot of fun... this year. i-I think anyway Y'know I've been doing this for so long, that you guys have been with me for this wild ride where.. It's been both an emotional journey and also a ridiculous journey when you really think about it in the whole aspect of what I've been doing But.. I never want to stop making new things I- I- I've said it before but I run exclusively on "Fuck You" Energy™ Where, if someone tells me that I can't do something I will go out of my way, to make sure I can do that one thing. Or at least try my damnedest at that one thing If someone tells me that I can't.. I print out a picture of their face and I punch it repeatedly and then do that thing that they said I couldn't do I operate under the premise that, I don't know what I can't do. But no one else gets to define what I can't do except myself And I'll never stop trying new things, until I find the one thing that makes me really excited And then the next day that might be gone! And I'm on to something new That's what this year is really gonna be about. I wanna do more collabs, I wanna do more challenges, I wanna do more random bullshit I wanna do more, like, going to weird places, to experience weird different things... You know I wanna do, so much more. and uh, yeah. I mean that's it. Thats pretty much it because its so easy for me to go like I have this grand sweeping thing! and THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE GONNA BE NOW. but thats now what it's about, y'know That's never been what it's about. It's not about me, like trying to reach this new pinnacle of greatness. Its' just about me, everyday, waking up, and being like what do I want to make today What do I want to create today? What do I want to try to do today And so long as I can approach every single day with that mindset, I'll always know that I'm moving forward in life. I'll always know that I'm conquering the blockades that I put up in my mind. I'll always know that I don't have to be chained down to any one core concept Because, if you allow yourself to become chained up to one thing, then y-you get this... in the.. like... numbing fear of losing everything... y'know You become chained to these obligations that you don't really have, but in the end, those don't matter All that matters is, do you feel like you accomplished something new today. Do you feel like you chipped away at a big project today. Do you feel like you've moved forward in your life, today Plan for the future and reach for the goals you have. But also just tackle each day as it comes And thats what I want to do this year. I don't wanna really have grand sweeping plans this year. I don't have any huge goals that I have. I'm already a big Youtuber. I could be a bigger Youtuber someday But, all I know is that today I want to create something different than I wanted to create yesterday. And so long as I chase that feeling, like I'll always be making new stuff, and I'll always be surprising you with what I can make And uh, It may be inconsistent, it may be consistent sometimes. It may be, a series that I'm doing now It may be a van vlog that I'm doing later. But, it's all gonna be fun And it's all gonna be worth it in the end, because... I'll know that I'm improving and that's all I can really hope for -much more upbeat- So anyway!! I just wanted to quickly catch you up on everything. I've got other stuff I'm gonna be working on today I've got other ideas I'm gonna be executing soon. And it's just gonna be a lot of fun. So thank you everybody so much for watching, thank you for being here with me. And as always, I will see you in the next video. BUH BYEEE!!! aaAaaaAAAHH'kayBYE UAHAHAgaAAHaAgHH!! (Mark tripping and falling) Oah! Fuck I fell.... Hi... Bye... ...Ow...

Mark: And then I do die, but I've died lots of times and I've come back lots of times, it's great Mark: Beat death and that sort of thing Mark: So then in the end I take over the mayor's body, but that's not Darkiplier. Darkiplier is the mayor's Mark: spirit in my body. My broken bloody body. He wants to go back and he wants revenge. And that's the whole crux of the story Mark: Make sense? Yeah, cool, okay.

Amy: Yes! Kathryn: Ready? Dun DUN DUNNN Amy: My prized posse-I'm going to be so sad when I'm going to have to take this room down. Kathryn: You're gonna miss something and it's gonna be so well hidden that the next people miss it. Amy: Well, yeah, because I have all these- I have so many sticky notes in there like in encyclopedias. Kathryn: You wanna read some goodies for us?
Amy: Colonel colonel colonel colonel Kathryn: Do you have a good- do you have a favorite sticky? Amy: Uh, "What makes Gatorade that color and should we be putting in our bodies?"
I like this guy, it's really hard to see- but I had to do this twice. I had to shred it properly. and then tape it.
Kathryn: I saw that, he kinda broke. Amy: *Laugh* Whaat?
Kathryn: Amy, look- look at me real quick and think about that. *snort* Amy: I don't want to talk about it.
I had a bad night. I could leave a sticky note in one. Just murder. 
*Kathryn giggling* Where should we put it? 873?
... It's gone forever now. But now this doesn't say who did murder. It used to say "Who did murder?".
*Kathrine giggling up a storm* Do you have a pen? Mick: *mouthing words* What?
Pam: Busted! Ahhhh.
Mick: *eating sounds?* Pam: He caught me!
Amy: WHAT? *both giggling*

JIM: Noo...
Ethan(JIM): Okay.. Ethan(Jim): Jim. Jim. *Mark, Ethan, and Kathryn bust into a fit of laughter* 
*Slap* (ow, mark, wtf) The haunted house pop-up shop worked incredibly well, better than I could have ever hoped, but there's more that we could do. What is a pop-up shop really about? At its base level, a pop-up shop is a clothing store that pops up out of nowhere That's how it all started! way back in the early 80s or 90s or whenever the hell it actually first started - I don't know when. But it did! at some point some Mr. Pop-up Decided that it was time to go sell clothes on the corner and people went BANANAS for it. People went apeshit! But I can do one better, because if there's one thing that people said about me It's that I have no sense of style, no sense of fashion, Nothing about me screams that I planned anything that I did today. Anyway, we can make a pop-up shop And we can make a pop-up shop better than everybody else did... because we got a fan What does a pop-up shop need, and what do I need to get rid of? *Aggressive dotting* Clothes, it's an anagram: Clothes. Lose. Original. Taste. Hence... Everything. Sale! :D Makes sense? *yes mark* okay cool, and number two you need pop-up! People. Only. Purchase... Unsold. Products. Makes sense?? and then number three... *processes number three* *sound of marker on thy board* I need to let go. Let's. Emotionally. Traumatize... Get. Out. *visible sadness* We're gonna bring my clothes to the office *do you hear that? that's the sound of Extra Grande, Extra-Large* *falls* *closes door* *exotic movement* ding! *elevator music* Oh, oh, oh! Heh, heeh - whatever. *Mark yelling* *box falls violently down stairs* *goes to observe the damage with concern* Yesh! Here's some of my old clothes And the reason I'm doing my old clothes because I'm not gonna go out and buy clothes and try to resell it. This is vintage! This has history!!! This is a classic!!! I dont want to let go of it! :( Oh these are the pants from the Lonely instinct! oh, oh no these are the Bulge pants! ah GOD! *visual discomfort* oo, disco discomfort *sniffs* mmm... I did not wash that. oh, this was from the deer, uh the- the- the- thethethethe the- the deer man... video! oh *sniffs again and coughs*  oh man. *eww, mark* mmm, help meee... sort through NO! &gt;:(  Don't you dare, not even a little bit. It took me years to get this back... *Glare / Akward silence* Don't. It is!  It is what it is! I got this shirt for $5.00 at Walmart... *sobs* *whispers* I can probably sell it for $20. Oh, this is- oh theseee are the Lonely Instinct pants. Oh, hell yeah. I'm gotta put these on *Grunting* *Cough* Oh, the leather! what nOoW what nOW, Oh Lonely instinct indeed *slaps knee* I've lost weight since I last wore this... fits even better now oh no, no, no, nO, nOO oh God No, I think we got that no way in hell I'm giving away an elusive shirt. I think that's a good pile. Good enough, anyway *car door shuts* Alright, okay, so what we got to do, To have a successful pop-up shop, You need to have more than one person engaged, right? So we got to contact someone who might have some extra clothes that he's maybe grown out of because he's a big boy now! he turned 21, and he's a-a big bouncing baby boy that needs to be... *mark! no texting and driving* asked for some clothes! so when you got a big bouncing bo- h-hello! Hi! Hey! How's it going? we're doing a pop-up shop and... We're hoping that you... have some clothes that you'd like to donate to the car. Ethan: That's such perfect timing Ethan: 'cause I absolutely do Mark: Oh you do, oh perfect! oh great! Ethan: Does it matter if they're dirty or clean? Mark: We're gonna clean them maybe I don't know Ethan: Okay Okay, alright, well we're right outside your apartment *Ethan knocks on the window* Hello! Do I have clothes? Mark: Yeah, Ethan: Yeah where are they? uhh in my apartment Uh, I have soy sauce. I have cake! I have- *Interuppted by shuffling* Ethan: theseee.... *Music of Tin foil* Mozzarella sticks that have been there for... *Deep thought* A while. *sound of Mark eating mozzarella stick* A little hard.... Mark: ugghhh *disgusted face* You may not want it.. Do you want a shower curtain? Mark: no! Ethan: *quietly* okay Mark: Yes! Ethan: yeah! Mark: yeah!- Ethan: You have various items if you want Are you just gonna give me extra *Inaudible* room? You could have... this, which we used. That could be a very valuable item. ahhhh! this is from the uh Christmas Caaaan Wait- Can't wait! here you play with that one. *yayy, thanks markipoo* Mark: Hang out here for a bit *snow globe continues to play music* Mark: Is that a dead body? Having fun? I literally only asked for clothes. Do you want any Xbox one games? Mark: uhhhhhhh, Ethan : 'cause I dont. Ethan: I feel like there's more I could give you- nooo, we don't need it. We stashed for clothes, now we have stuff. Ethan: You want..- Mark: don't want! Mark: Already sayin' no! *Face of regret* Mark: *whispers* we should just leave- Ethan in the distance : Uhh... Ethan: Where you- where you going? Mark: no! Oh Ethan: wait, you could have more. Do you want a poster?? Mark: a what- Ethan: a poster... Mark: of what? Ethan: I'll show you.. *goes to get poster* *takes opportunity to escape* Ethan: No! Nah ya' don't need it. Mark: thanks, see ya! Ethan: hold on wait you forgot your... Mark: oh Ethan: mozzarella sticks.. *shuts door on a confused Mark* *slowly sets bowl down* Mark: No no, Chica, no Mark: *whispers* Let's just go *goes to get mozzarella sticks back* Ethan: :D *door slams shut* Okay all right, so we're engaged and we're ready to go. We need to move over, we need to clean this stuff. We need to filter out whatever Ethan got that is garbage, which a lot of it is. Stick to the plan. We gotta make a pop-up shop, and we got to make it happen good *Redneck Voice* Beep, beep beep beep- BONK! Alright, pup, you ready to set up shop? You ready to be an entrepreneur!! Launch day is always so stressful. *stress intensifies* What we need to do, we need to get uh The MERchandise and a good... setup so that people can browse at their leisure. We've got my clothes We've got Ethan's uh actual clothing contributions in this bad boy here, here put this out We got the Google shirt, set it up right there. I think in a rush We forgot to wash the clothes, but I think people want that *sniffs* Musk ooo, authentic dear man shirt- er pants *Slap slap* Ubba flap- classic- black- I'm caring less and less shoo and all this... junk. And then whatever Ethan has in this bag. What did he actually give us... pants? Why??- Why! Why did he give us bay leaves? Shirt, shirt, shirt. but all that aside, we need to advertise! When you look at this, what do you see?

Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and welcome to Sexy Hiking. Now ignore the quality of what you see here. When I was playing Getting Over It. He mentioned this game. This game was the inspiration for Getting Over It, so I wanted to play and see just how infuriating the original 2002 game was. Oh god. Oh god. Oh, it's even worse. Okay, alright. Nah Aaah Oh boy. Woahhh. Hey, how's it going there friend? Oh? Oh? I do not like you. *chuckle* Ooooookay alright, I see what's going on here. I see exactly where you got inspired to do this bullshit. Oh boy. Okay, hang on, pop, oh boy. Yup. Uhh, ohh Nope. Well there I go then. There- some- ohh. *weird squeaking noise* What was that? oh boy. No, goddamnit. Oh, you sack of shit. Oh, you're gonna be just as hard as the other one aren't you? How in the hell? Cuz you can't- you can't- you can't bring your hammer around fast enough. What? Whaaaat just happened? What just happened? AAAAHHHH I don't know what happened. Hang on, oh boy. So obviously this game is meant to be frustrating that much is readily apparent. But how frustrating is the question right? Yeah Cuz I literally cannot swing my hammer around fast enough to be able to get where I need to go, so I have to be able to... Well there's gotta be a way, right? Whoa, hey, goddamnit, son of a bitch. Alright, But at least this one is consistent, like, it's bullshit obviously, but at least this one's consistent, huh? What? I didn't do anything like that. I didn't do anything like that. *scoff* goddamnit I'm gonna get mad over this one. He was right, you were gonna be fumbling around the fucking tree in the opening goddamn segment of the game for ten hours. If you figure out the- woahhaaah Well, as you figure out what the heck you're supposed to do here. That doesn't make any goddamn sense. I can't it's some- Like it you ca- You can hurmph off You can hurmph yourself. Okay. Oh fuck. How are you supposed to hurmph and catch? Is that what you're supposed to do? You're supposed to hurmph and catch. Well, why didn't it hurmph? Hey, oh oh, I hurmphed and caught oh No- AAAAHHH ooooohhhhh- NOOOO Goddamnit. Ohhhhhh, it's only what I like. What if- if I was just flailing against madness here, I wouldn't be too upset about it. You know is the thing right like if I was just... Fuck. If I was just subjAAAHH, if I was just subjecting myself to impossible bullshit I wouldn't ever, I wouldn't care right? I wouldn't care. It's because I care that I- oh fuck. It's because I CARE so much That's why I-I'm an amazing person That's why, that's why I'm conversing. Okay, well you have to be just off of the edge of it hit that - daaahhhh ooh Hey, no. NO. NO. NO. NO. What are you doing? What are you doing? STOPP Stop.. AAAHHNOOO Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy up there Homer Ohh Easy there, easy there easy there e- uhh No, you know what I ain't gonna do that well why do I need to do that when I can do this maneuver? *With a cresendo of pleasure in his tone* Alright Alright Alright! Whyyyahhh Alright, we're making progress. We're making stupid progress, but we're making progress nonetheless Okay, ah I was I was just wondering if it was like an invisible or a horrible place. You know like... Cincinnati! Oookay, I don't know what happened there. That was not wh- why are you humphing so weak? Just humph it! Okay, there we go! Why can't you humph it right here? Humph it right here, right here. This is where you do it. No, don't humph that, just grab that! Ah, ah, oh, what are you? What are you? What are you? Are you a checkpoint? Please tell me you're a checkpoint, huh? "WELL DONE" *laughing from game* WHYYYY?? HEY Oh, God, I got done with the first level? What? Checkpoints? Well that can't be right. Well that can't be right at all. Uh-oh. Well this looks bullshit. Oh, yeah, this looks indeedy-do bullshit. God damn it. Oh, this is gonna be a sack of tits ain't it? Woooaaa- O-okay, how do you expect- Aaahh! How in THE heck? Aagh! Okay, all right, okay? Aagh, no humphing, no humphing right now, pleaaassseeee. Pleabse no humph. NOOAAHHH You just clipped through that like a sack of tits! Okay, no humphing, no humphing. God, this music's hype. (♪ Water World- Donkey Kong Country 3 ♪) No! OOAAAHH! Come on, you sack of shit! Oh, just back up your, gahh, I don't know what, backup your bullshit And just- take it to the state fair. ( God, my insults are getting worse and worse. ) No! NOOO! Come on, stop doing that! At least this one doesn't have the infuriating loss-of-progress bullshit! But, going an inch might as well be going a mile in this sack of tits! *extremely intense concentration* Am I hitting the top of it or something? Gotta humph away? God but if I humph away, I can't get- how did I get this the first try? This is always how it goes, I get something on the first goddamn tr- *gasp* Aaaagh! Come on. What are you doing now? Now I don't even know what you're doing. Okay. Can you just- why can't you just get there now?! What the hell? He's humphing at EVERYTHING now. God, why?! Why?! Just why?!?! Why is he suddenly humphing at everything?! Why?! Nooooo. How did I get this on the fir- how did I get this on the first try?! God-fucking-damn it.. WHY?!?! *extreme frustration* Why is that weak?! Why? Son of a bitch! This isn't even that- God, this- oh, come on. Just stay on the fucking ledge. Oh, why? I can't even get up THERE now? WHY? Why? Why would you be weak there? I'm not doing anything. Look, hands are off. *blep* D-don't ask me, because I don't have a fucking clue what's going on. Seriously? How did I get this the first time? How? I don't understand.. Oh! Just... barely there. Okay, let's try this again, but less stupidly, huh? See; I'm not doing that bounce. I am NOT doing that bounce, I'm not about that bounce. wooh Why? You clipped through again. Why does he clip through? I am well outside of your boundary bitch. Hoo- No, no, no, No! What? No! Come on! WHAT THE HELL? It just clips through. Well, that's not even fair! Well, that's not even fair! It's just a broken game at that point! Come on, 2002 developer! (or Jazzuo) Get your head out of your ass! And make this game- oh, fucking hell. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay Yeeeeeeaaaah, baby! yeah, baby. Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby. Okay, right, this is where things might get a little dicey. 'Cause, there's no way than I'm gonna be able to- oooh. Okay. I have to push off.. and grab the tippy-toppy of that. Maybe I don't, maybe I don't, maybe I don't, maybe it's- Maybe this is just a fool's errand to try to do that, but I don't think *concentration* I'm not gonna be able to- I've done this with the other branches that look just like this. Yeah, that's not gonna work. So, dooooooon't Okay, why did I go bouncy like that? Why are you bouncy like that? Woooooooahhh! *hermph* Okay. NOOOOOOOO! Come onnnnnnn! God damnit! God damnit, no wonder this game is fucking infuriating. No wonder everyone LOVES it, no wonder that guy LOVES it, no wonder Bennett Foddy LOVES this game. Come on! I'm obviously not humphing that! If you could- ohh, if you could just stop being a bag of dicks! Please. God, I just want to get to the top of this one; the second level, I want to get to the top of the second level, is that really so much to ask? Okay. That was weird. Apparently, that was his nodding "Yes." *imitates sexy hiker* "Yes, it is too much to ask, you sack of shit." Don't even- no- Why? WHY?! It's YOU shaking! It's not me! It's you- why does he shake? It's li- it's like some weird juxtaposition of: 'if you do it- if you hold too long, the MOUSE gets all kinds of confused.' Why... that made no sense? I think it's- I think it's- you have to hold the mouse as far away from like your actual WHY? I WAS NOT HUMPHING. You are humphing up a storm. Good God. You shaky bastard j- WHY? WHY? Why the hell do you choose to be a stupid idiot?! You could be a smart pants, 'cause you only are pants; you have no body! God- Oh, fuck OFF with you, Jesus Christ. Oh my God! Are you kidding me? See, this game, It's not as It's not as like, painful as the other one (referring to Getting Over It); the other one had stakes, like, you made progress, you did it! this one is just a sack of shit! Like that's the only thing that's- Oh, god. That's the only thing that's bad about this game Is that it's a sack of inconsistent shit, and it's probably broken. It's probably a hundred percent broken. The reason Getting Over It is like emotionally scar- Oh fuc- *ungodly belch noise* -k off The reason why Getting Over It is emotionally scarring- Why can't I get- I am as gentle as a fuckin' butterfly right now. The reason why Getting Over It is so emotionally traumatizing is because you do make all this progress- Why did you just phase through that? Why did you do that? -and when you make so much progress, and it tortures you, because it shows you what you could have done like- Ohh- Come on! Alright, I'm only gonna give this a few more tries. I'm only gonna walk straight into hell a few more times guys, I'm only gonna put these bees in my eyeball a few more times, and then I'm gonna- then I might even find out You know? I just I just want to know- maybe it won't sting me in the eye like the third or fourteenth- *slightly triggered* Oh, no! It stung me again; the bees that I put in my eyes! Well. Let me hear- Let me climb up this mountain Let me, let me dip my balls in LAVA. Let me just do that. Let me see if that- I don't know it hurt, like it burnt them off the first time. Maybe it won't happen the 17th time. Maybe, maybe it won't let me try that. Oh, God, let me try- oh, God. Hey, you know, Getting Over It scarred me bad enough. Why don't I play the original progenitor that's probably even worse than it? Oh, yeah, that's probably a good idea. Fucking hell, g- Oh... Ahh God, it's getting to me. It's getting to me. It's getting to me. It is getting to me. It is getting me. It is getting me. It's got me. It's got me in its grasp! It's got me in it's hammer-y grasp! Stop that, whatever- whatever that is, just don't do that! All you have to do is NOT do the shaky! I don't get that. See look, look, look. Look, I don't know why it's choosing to be shaky. See, I'm far away, it's not as shaky. Get closer? Shaky. Far away? No shaky. Closer? Shaky. No- Nooooooo! Come on. You shaky piece of shit! It's like a- it's like a random number generator on how many bones are gonna disappear and reappear in his body. Fuck. Okay. Well. You know, see; what I don't get... is... sometimes you go big jump, sometimes you- s- You know? I don't know. I- fucking hell. Guys, I don't know. I'm gonna stick my head in the lion's den just a few more times. Just a few more times! I want to know how it feels on the thirty second time the lion rips my face off. I just wanna know, I just wanna know how it feeels. Just slide right in (that's what she said) There we go. Now just slide right in- No! Just slide back in, slide back in, slide back in, slide- Slide back in! It's- it's literally all you gotta do, is slide back in. Slide in- No! What the fuck- fucking- fuck! I'm done. I don't need to put myself through this bullshit! I don't need to stick my hand in a gorilla mating patch! I don't need to rub poison ivy on my- *trying to control himself* penis. *sigh of defeat* So I'm not gonna torture myself 'cause I don't need to. I don't want to play this game. Getting Over It made me want to keep playing it. This game? No. It's just an exercise in futility because the fucking game is broken as shit and doesn't work. So if you want to play Sexy Hiking, it's free. I'll put in the- for some reason- -if for some reason you want to torture yourself. I'll put Sexy Hiking in the, uh, description below so that you can- -absolutely RUIN your day. Just- -if you want that, just go for it. You know what? I ain't even gonna question you. I'm trying to phase myself through this wall here, Hang on- Wait- I think he's- I think he's on to something. "Piccolo, I can't see him!" "Don't be stupid, he's just moving fast!" God. It just rejects you. It just rejects you. That's all it really is. Anyway, I'm done. So, thank you everybody so much for watching! Let me know what you think down in the comments below. And as always, I will see you... in the next video. *signature Mark outro* Buh-bye! ♪ MiniMusicMan- Crazy La Paint ♪

Hello, everybody, my name is Markiplier And welcome to Dream Daddy. Now, this game is... *in-game music* ♫ Dreeeeaaam daddyy ♫ Sorry, I just got caught up in the music there for a second. This is the first time I loaded it up so I haven't heard that music yet. Uhh... *laughs* *laughing* Is that dad tips? Oh, that's so good! "Do what you love and the money will come" Aww! That's such a good tip! "When changing a tire, make sure to tighten the bolts in a starfish pattern" *laughing* Okay! That's good advice! So, before I get started, I wanted to say that this game is made by Vernon Shaw and Leighton Gray. Now, Vernon and I, we go way back the first, uh, time we filmed Hot Pepper Gaming together But also, this game is produced by the Game Grumps. And there's tons of other people that also had a hand in it. Anyway, I just wanted to give a shoutout to the people that made this game because, It's one of the first games that came out to, uh, er, from the let's play world, in a way. Yeah, see! Made by the Game Grumps Produced by the Game Grumps. So anyway. Oh. Hi, daddies. How's it going? *starts laughing* This is the one video, this is the one series where it's acceptable for me to say the word "daddy". Now that doesn't give you the right to. I can't stop you if you do, but just, If we're gonna get through this we need some base rules here.

Hi. My name is Markiplier, and today, I'm going to be telling you all about the wonderful world of slime. Now, slime is all the rage these days. The kids love it. They're making it in their backyards in their basements all by their lonesome. And I wanted to share with you my very own recipe for slime. All you'll need are a few simple ingredients you can get in any department store. You've got Elmer's glue, shaving cream, the special ingredient Borax, and some warm water Now these ingredients combined into a wonderful concoction make the wondrous material of slime. And it's as simple as this: you start out with some regular old glue. Pour that bad boy into a bowl. Now, if this is taking too long, and you're not getting enough volume out of your squirt Just pop the lid off and pour that bad boy right in. That's a nice glob. How about little for Daddy? *spits glue out, making pained choking sounds* You're gonna need about.. this much glue. All right, makes sense? Now, once you're done with the glue *Knocks over glue bottle and stares at it in scorn, throwing it away* Once you're done with the glue, Then you move on to the shaving cream. Now, it needs to be thick and foamy The foamier your cream additive. The more foamy the slime will be. No. You just take it, shake it up real good like... and blam. You got yourself some slime. How about a little for bepis? Chica come here, come on. *Holds out cream and licks it with Chica* That's good. Om nom nom. Good girl. All right. We got our two ingredients here. We just need to add a little bit of what's called.. borax, which has a bonding agent called boric acid Once you put that in there - you don't need a lot, just enough to give it a nice dusting, and hopefully this doesn't combust. Which would be amazing! Ordinarily you would use a spoon for this because this is going to be extremely caustic to your hand. It's uh, these ingredients when they're mixing together, They're extremely acidic, so it's not recommended that you use your hand and mix it. That's really coming together! Alright, now that's a good consistency right there. Very malleable. If your ratios a little off, just feel free to add or remove as necessary. Now, the last step Uh, in order to appease the Dark Gods, is you need to take your knife, any old knife will do even a kitchen knife so long as it's sharp enough, and then just cut the center of your palm, and, uh, Let that seep into the concoction while you whisper the words of power very tenderly *Deep, distorted, echoed voice* They shall rise. They shall consume. All will be lost when they rise from the darkness of the ocean. Madness opens up to everything. And then, you have your slime! Some nice, foamy, slimy substance. Look at that - it's so fun! That's good stuff right there. Alright, so there you have it. You have some lovely slime for your whole family to enjoy, and we all get to enjoy three years of peace, before the Dark Gods consume us all. Thank you guys again for watching, my name has been Markiplier, and as always, I'll see you in the next one Bye-bye! *splat and thump sound* *silence* *gasping for air* *Music* Now you may be wondering how these ingredients can combine together into the ectoplasmic nature of slime. Well it's as simple as *messes up on speaking* I'm gonna start all that over again... The kids are all about slime these days. It's not just about... dabbing I hate myself. Now you may be asking yourself "What is slime?" Or is it pronounced "sli-may?" No. It's not -
fuck. Hi. Amy: *off-screen* Be funny! Shut up, I got this. I'm sorry I didn't mean to tell you to shut up.. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry. Okay. Now if you don't know about slime or haven't watched Nickelodeon in the past 20 years It's all the rave with the kids these days. They're making it for themselves in their own backyards, in RVs on them *messes up, babbling* Amy: *off-screen* All the rave, or all the rage? Kill me Just kill me

Hello Everybody. My name is Markiplier, and uh Ignore my face, I was getting emotional I was spending, uh, my evening doing my normal activity Of crying gratuitously Um But, in all seriousness, I am going to be unapologetically emotional in this video So if that is not to your tastes, then Buckle up, it's about to get teary-eyed in here Um, and I know this is a weird video to post after I just kinda, like- Threw everyone for a loop with that last video I, uh- And, and... I realized, after I posted that one That I've never been happier to make videos Which is weird, considering I am saying I'm- I'm extremely emotional But, yknow If there's one thing that I am, it's always open and honest with how I feel at any given moment, and And The way I feel In terms of making videos, and the way I feel in terms of talking with you guys Y'know, that's changed and evolved over time, but the one thing that I've always stayed true to, or at least I've always tried to, is Y'know What this means to me I mean, y'know, I haven't gotten emotional in a video since probably, like Close to the 8 Million Subscriber Milestone video, and And after I posted that video- Cause I was thinking of, yknow I was sitting around my house and I was just like, "Ah, what am I gonna make today?" And then I shot it, I edited it, and I posted it, and I was watching all the reactions that was just like constant screaming like "Agh, not again! I'm not even over Who Killed Markiplier! Oh God, you can't do this to me!" And, I love that I loved it; Not because I was messing with people, but because there was There was, like, real emotions out of it, y'know? Because, after I posted that and I was walking around my house I was thinking out the story of where it was gonna go, and I was like "Oh man, if I- After I post that one, I could do this and this and this And, y'know, I can make this other story" And then, I started thinking about Everything that I've made Up until this point in the six years that I've been making videos, and I've been I was thinking about Y'know, where I've come from and the road That That took me to this point in my life where I'm able to make whatever I want And even when I'm not 100% happy with what I'm making, you guys are so understanding that you give me the opportunity To take a break And to step back, and then come back at it harder than ever before And And I remember every day that I made videos I remember every single video that I've ever made I remember the people that I've met on this journey, I remember the people that I've lost And everything- Every single moment in my mind Coming to this point where I am Where I'm so lucky to be in a position where you guys look up- Where you guys look up to me with Hope, and You look to me for guidance And I try my best to be able to provide that to you, and I try my best to Provide entertainment to you, and I try my best And this weird ride that I've been on, especially this past year This past year has been such an emotional Like, growing point for me And again, I'm not crying because I'm sad. I don't want anyone to ever think that It may be sad memories that happened in my life, but I don't regret a single one of them Like, past mistakes and everything that's led to this point, those Those moments made me who I am today And they're gonna make me who I am in the future, and And if anything, like The one thing that always gets me Is, I remember the person that I was before I started doing YouTube And before I started forging my own path And before you guys started believing in me And, I remember I remember that the one thing, the only thing that I wanted And I didn't expect anything else to come out from it, but the one thing that I always wanted Was, I wanted to be proud of myself And I never expected that millions of others would be proud of me too, y'know? That is, by far The greatest gift I've ever been given in my life Because I don't know where I'm going, y'know? No one does Everyone who has ever lived is flying by the seat of their pants And we're all doing fine You're doing fine, I'm doing fine; I'm doing more than fine I know it doesn't seem like it right now with tears and snot running down my face, but I am So unbelievably grateful, and so unbelievably happy To be where I am, and to see how far I've come Because Like I said, I remember every moment in my journey to get to this point I remember every single thing Every video I've done, every feeling that's caused, every person I've met Every life I've impacted in one way or another It isn't about the specific things that I do in my videos, it's about the fact that we can all take a moment and take a breather And we can enjoy a silly moment together And we can love something for the sake of loving something, and not because of what it's done, y'know? We can explore the u- Y'know, we can explore the unknown together and we can be afraid, and we can be vulnerable and we can be open And that's fine And we can take the time to discover who we need to be Yknow, people will constantly criticize you no matter where you go, and people will constantly try to break you down, and it does not matter Because no one can know you more than you I can't even know you I want to know you If there's one thing that I know It's how I want to feel so much more Than what we see through the screen And, y'know, I joke about it sometimes I do And it's all in good fun, but I always realize how serious Like, the statements that people make, y'know How people say that I saved their life, y'know I don't take that lightly Because, I've seen that in the eyes of kids I've met through the Make A Wish Foundation I've seen that through the people that I've met at conventions I've seen it On the internet, I've seen it on messageboards, I've seen it in the gifts that people give me Not tangible gifts, but like- Real, emotional gifts Cause I don't place value in things, I place value in people And I joke about me getting emotional on camera, I don't care Because it's true And it's honest The only thing I've ever wanted to be is proud of myself And I I can never thank you guys enough Ah god, I've been rambling for a while My point, eugh My point is, I get emotional And I'm open and honest with you guys Because that's what matters The connection that we have The connection that the community has, the connection that we instill in others And, this journey that we're taking together and where it's gonna lead next, I have no idea I have no idea where it's gonna go next But I can't wait I can't wait for the next video I can't wait for the next adventure, I cannot wait To see what we're gonna make next So, thank you everybody so much for watching Again, sorry for the late night upload and sorry for the scare, uh Unfortunately, there's more on the way because I've got a plan and it's It's probably gonna change mid-plan fifteen times, but I can't wait This is the greatest gift any person could ever ask for Despite all the pain, despite all the hard work, despite all the struggle and the internal, like, learning of myself I'm grateful for every step that I've been able to take, and I'm so glad that you guys are here with me And just know that if an idiot like me can go from being the least confident person, who never speaks out for himself To who you see in front of you Which may or may not be an improvement, depending on your metrics, but- If I can do it You can So thank you everybody so much for watching And as always, I will see you in the next video Buh-bye! Bye! Bye guys Bye

Bennett Foddy: If you've deleted your homework the day before it was due, Bennett Foddy: As I have, Bennett Foddy: Or if you left your wallet at home Bennett Foddy: and you have to go back, after spending an hour in the commute, Bennett Foddy: If you won some Bennett Foddy: money at the casino and then put all your winnings on red, and it came up black, Bennett Foddy: If you got your best shirt dry cleaned for a wedding and then immediately dropped food on it, Bennett Foddy: If you won an argument with a friend, Bennett Foddy: And then later discovered that they just returned to their original view, Bennett Foddy: Starting over is harder than starting up. Bennett Foddy: If you're not ready for that, Bennett Foddy: Like if you've already had a bad day, Bennett Foddy: Then what you're about to go through might be too much. Bennett Foddy: Feel free to go away and come back. Whuh? Wait What?!
Bennett Foddy: I'll be here. Huh?! Are you tellin' me I'm about to have a Bad time?! Bennett Foddy: Alright, thanks for coming with me on this trip. I don't like this Bennett Foddy: I'll understand if you have to take a break at any point... HEY! HOEY! AAHAH! Bennett Foddy: Don't worry, I'll save your progress, always.

From this vantage point I've got so much potential SWONG- Oka- EH SWONG Noooe. You're not SWONGIN' Hard enough Okay Alright it's like "Spank the Monkey"   Gahh! Oh ho ho!! OH Ho Ho!! What Crazy Island is this?! Bennett Foddy: This game is a homge to a free game that came out in 2002, titled 'Sexy Hiking' WHUH NOOE! Bennett Foddy: The author of that game was Jazzuo, a mysterious Czech designer who was known at the time as the father of B-games. Bennett Foddy: B-Games are rough assemblages of found objects. Bennett Foddy: Designers slap oooooOOOOOOAHHHHHHHH Bennett Foddy: and they're often too rough and unfriendly to gain much of a following. Bennett Foddy: and they're often too rough and unfriendly to gain much of a following. Bennett Foddy: They're built more for the joy of building them than as polished products. Are they now? *Chuckle* AH OH Goddamnit.. Okay, alright. Oh kay. uuuhhhaaaa.... uhuhHUH...ah, ack.  huHUUUUUUUHHAHHHHHH Okay, well Oh boy. Ah, I was right, the burning hot Fire o' RAGE in my heart is gonna git me through... THIIIIISS uhahhAHHHH NOO *concentrating Markiplier* No ooh awhh.. okay...? Bennett Foddy: Oof, you just lost a lot of progress. Bennett Foddy: Oof, you just lost a lot of progress. Bennett Foddy: That's a deep frustration, a real punch in the gut. *tosses away his blanket* Oh, is it? Oh, is it now? Oh, is it? Oh, is it now? Oh, is it a punch in the gut?! Oh, is it? Oh you don't know nothin' about gut punching, mister You don't even HAVE a gut! You're just in a frickin' CAULDRON!

Made it thus far And that's good. noo Made it thus far and that's good. Made it thus far and that's good. Eh! Got- AHHH!
Bennett Foddy: In a certain way Sexy Hiking is the perfect embodiment   Bennett Foddy: of a B-game.   Bennett Foddy: In it, your task is simply to drag yourself up a mountain with a hammer.   *Mark groaning*
Bennett Foddy: That act of climbing, di Bennett Foddy: In the digital world or in real life has certain essential properties that give the game it's flavor.
*Mark moaning sadly* Bennett Foddy: No amount of progress is guarunteed; some cliffs are to sheer, UH
Bennett Foddy: Or too slippery. Bennett Foddy: And the player is constantly, unremittingly in the danger of falling and losing everything. EUUHHH!! AH! AHHHAHA!   NOOOOOO I WAS THEREEE NUH no stop! Stop moving! OOWUUH Oahhhhh   WHERE AM I? AH. NO. STAHP. BARRELS HELP ME. OHH GOD OKAY ALRIGHT *Panic breathing* Like a monk. Ahhhhhhhhhhh. Gentle as the moon glows. Gentle as the summer breeze Ahh Oh yeah Bennett Foddy: Anyway when you start Sexy Hiking-
EUUGHHHAHHHHHHHHHHH EUGHHHHAHHHHHHHHHH Bennett Foddy: You're standing next to a tree, which blocks the way to the entire rest of the game.   OOHHH OHHH Bennett Foddy: It might take you an hour to get over that tree. A lot of people never got past it. Bennett Foddy: You prod and poke at it, exploring the limits of your reach and your strength, Bennett Foddy: Trying to find a way up and over. Bennett Foddy: And there's a sense of truth in that lack of compromise. Bennett Foddy: Most obstacles in videogame world are fake- Bennett Foddy: You can be completely confident in your ability to get through them, Bennett Foddy: Once you have the correct method or the correct equipment, or just by spending enough time. NOO AHHHHHH Bennett Foddy: In that sense, every pixellated obstacle in Sexy Hiking is real. Oh! HUH NOOO WHADIDYOUDOOO?!! Bennett Foddy: Uff... Sorry about that! Oh NAAAOW HOLD ON HOLD ON HOLD ON!! HOLD ON!!! HOLD ON HOLD ON OH! OH! OH!!! Oh NUUUHOH! *Hyperventilation* Hoh mah god euhhhh ACKHA! AUGHA! AUGH! Ah. Eh, Wyah! WAh! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Bennett Foddy: Oh no, it happened again. Keep on trying, don't let it get to you. I'M LETTING IT GET TO ME SIR! Uhh Thunkle. Thunkle Thame ooh nyaaao ye don't I'm gunne get yeouu I've Really got the HANG OF ET YEOU GIT ME?! And mah amayzin HUMOR? Hoh boy nooooooo hup BUPP-EH OOH YES Wait YES I'm on to something I'm on to something I'm on to this! Eh Ehh Ohhhh Yeah. Oh yeah OH YEAH OH Dopamine is RUSHING  through my brain OH THAT FEELS GOOD How you gonna make it Feel bad?! OOH NOOOO *Screams at his watch* Ehh Oh ho Whoops. Wrong way. Wrong way. Ah ah... Uh Nooo! Why do you keep doing that? NO! No Stahp... NO!! STAHP WHAT'RE YOU DOING?! WHAT'RE YOU DOING?! STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND DON'T DO THAT THING THAT YOU'RE-- NOOOOOO!!! NO NO NO NOOOOOO!! NO! NO. HOW? AND WHY? Did you do that thing that you just did?!! *Groans of relief* *Groans of relief* EUH! Okay. Alright. We're Good. We're good... We're good, we're good. EH! OOP! Okay. This is not where we're SUPPOSED to be. But I'll take it. You like to make sudden movements don'tcha?! BENNET FOBBLEY!   Bennett Foddy: and that makes the game uniquely frustrating. Bennett Foddy: But I'm not sure Jazzou intended to make a frustrating game Bennett Foddy: The frustration is just essential to the act of climbing Bennett Foddy: And it's authentic to the process of building a game about climbing. ooh ooh AH! WHERE AM I GOING? NO! Bennett Foddy: A funny thing happened to me as I was building this mountain: Bennett Foddy: I'd have an idea for a new obstacle, and I'd build it, and test it... Bennett Foddy: and it would usually turn out to be unreasonably hard. Bennett Foddy: but I couldn't bring myself to make it easier. Bennett Foddy: It already felt like my inability to get past  new obstacle Bennett Foddy: Was my fault as a player, rather than as the builder. Bennett Foddy: Imaginary mountains buld themselves from our efforts to climb them Bennett Foddy: And it's our repeated attempts to reach the summit that turns those mountains Bennett Foddy: Into something real. Are you being philosophical here?? Are you being philosophical while I'm... STRUGGLING MY ANUS OFF?! Okay. Noe. AYYUH Nope nope That ain't it. That ain't the one. That ain't the way. EUh! UH! Bennett Foddy: When you're building a videogame world you're building with ideas, Bennett Foddy: and that can be like working with quick-set cement. Bennett Foddy: You mold your ideas into a certain shape that can be played with, Bennett Foddy: And in the process of playing with them, they begin to harden and set.
 *Mark Groans in frustration* Bennett Foddy: Until they're immutable, like rock. Bennett Foddy: At that point, you can't change the world- not without breaking it into pieces and starting fresh with new ideas. Just gotta Puuuuull myself up. Using sheer... Friction-y friction! Oh you're are an obstacle. Ohh no. Oh o- oh. Eeh. Aah. Okay. Alright. Rethink this. Gotta think through this EAH! AUGH! YES! YES! NO! YES! NO! YES! NO! YES! NO! YES! STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHP No... I just Wanna... Very Carefully... Very carefully... Set. My. Ass. Down... Right... There... *Inhale* *Exhale* This is where I could lose it all. Oh, See? See?? See, It's a little- it's a little off kilter, so I need to make sure I'm where I should be. And then... SHOOP! Ohp. Bennett Foddy: For years now, AHA!!! AHA!!! Bennett Foddy: People have been predicting and that games would soon be made of prefabricated objects *Victory point towards the screen* Bennett Foddy: Bought in a store and assembled into a world. Bennett Foddy: And for the most part that hasn't happened, Bennett Foddy: because the objects in the stores are trash. Bennett Foddy: I don't mean they look bad, or that they're badly made, Bennett Foddy: Although a lot of them are, Bennett Foddy: I mean they're trash in the way that food becomes trash as soon as you put it in the sink. Bennett Foddy: These are made to be consumed and used in a certain context   Bennett Foddy: And once the moment is gone they transform into garbage Bennett Foddy: In the context of technology, those moments pass by in seconds. How. How? How do I?? Wait. 
Bennett Foddy: Over time, Bennett Foddy: we've poured more and more refuse into this vast digital landfill that we call the internet. Wait. Bennett Foddy: It now vastly outnumbers and outweighs the things that are fresh and untainted and unused. Bennett Foddy: When everything around us is cultural trash Bennett Foddy: Trash becomes the new medium, the lingua franca of the digital age. Bennett Foddy: You can build culture out of trash. Bennett Foddy: But only trash culture. Bennett Foddy: B-games, B-movies, B-music, B-phiosophy. EUHHH Bennett Foddy: Maybe this is what digital culture is. Bennett Foddy: A monstrous mountain of trash, the ash heap of creativity's fountain. *woman screams* NO *Screech* NO NO NO
Bennett Foddy: *calmly in the backrgound* A landfill with everything we've ever thought of in it. Bennett Foddy: Grand, infinite, and unsorted. OOWHUH UUUUUUHHGHHHHHH. UUUGHH. OOHH I don't think I've said a word in the past few hours It's just been NOISES. AAAAAAAND AAAAAH WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?! UHHHHHH
Bennett Foddy: This thing that we call failure is not the falling down, Bennett Foddy:  But the staying down. *weird whale noises* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Oh my god omigodohmigod *Babble* Oh my god omigod (x5) I hate Ohhh.

That's how strong he is, this is how strong I am. *Focused* Okay... Hah? *Dies inside, Sreaming outside as mockingly cheerful music begins to play.* NNNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

Discarded, forgotten, unrecycled. Bennett Foddy: Muddled, rotten, and untitled. Bennett Foddy:  Everything's fresh for about 6 seconds. Bennett Foddy: Until some newer thing beckons, and we hit refresh. Bennett Foddy: And there's years of perservering Bennett Foddy: Disappearing into the pile, out of style. Out of sight. Ah.

Wade: Can I push you back? Mark: God, I don't know how- Bob: I killed- I killed him. Mark:  Ah shit, I don't know how I got killed there that was really stupid of me. Alright Bob:  Yeah, sorry. I thought you were like okay, but we fell through that roof- Mark: Yeah. Bob: I took like so much damage Mark: Yeah, I did not expect that - I like lost all my health on that fall and Mark: *groans* Mark: and then, then like I- I- I Mark: Should have just gone up behind him 'cause he didn't see me and I should've just gone up behind him Mark: But I, shot him like a fool just to do a play-by-play of how much I sucked I hope this makes a lot of sense to you guys Bob: Oh, I'm with you. Wade: Yeah. What the hell do we, uh, do now? Mark: Okay- Bob:  Wade, you've played pubG, like a lot, like I know you have. Wade:  Yeah, but, I mean- Bob: This is the same as that except it's just a different game. So you get guns- Mark: Yeah Bob: shoot at people with those guns- Wade: Okay. Bob: Oh fuck, you found the fucking thing without trying to find- Wade: Oh, it was on the roof. / Mark: Oh yeah / Wade: I got blue juice Mark: Yeah / Bob: Drink it / Mark: Drink that / Bob: It gives you shield / Mark: Yeah, so there's chests and you can always hear 'em by the Mark: *hrraauurrarrg* sounds. Wade: That's true / Bob: Yeah, that's just like regular Fortnite. I remember that Mark: *deep mhm* Bob: My god is anybody else getting just like the worst performance ever right now? Mark: No, I got you buttery smooth, baby. Wade: No, no I always get good performance. Bob: Janky and- oh it's cuz everything's on epic. Cool. Mark: *odd unamused laughter* Wade: Oh, yeah, all my settings are probably there, too. Mark: Oh, yeah, mine are, too, probably. Bob: Medium / Mark: Let's go- let's go on... highhh Let's do that. Wade: So should I start harvesting materials or focus just on guns- Bob: There are people here, so for now we should try and find chests and loot guns Mark: I can't- I can't see the map so I have no idea where- Bob: We should probably try and find these bitches to fight them and so we can just get like mark back cuz... Wade: Oh, can we get him back? Bob: No, I mean just die and then get mark back. Mark: Yeah, good luck. Good luck with you. I was a fool. Bob: Life is meaningless without him. Mark: Thank you! That's all I- ooh! Is that a guy? Bob:  There's a guy over here by me, Wade. / Okay, I'm comin'. Bob: There's another guy to the right right outside to the right to the right to the right shoot him Bob: Shoot him, Wade. Wade: Oh, this is first fire. Bob: Please shoot him.... continue shooting him. Mark: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Mark: You guys really cocked it up didn't ya you really boned it. Bob: I killed the guy that killed you Mark: *slow laughter* Bob: I'm just saying that's pretty cool. Mark: Whatever. I'm just saying. I'm not saying I didn't cock it up. I'm just saying that you guys also cocked it up. Mark: Together we're like three cocks in a blanket. You know like just... Bob: The cockiest blanket that's ever cocked. Mark: Cocking it up all over the place just- Mark: Slammin' our sli- Yeah. / Bob: Oh, that's a good sound yeah. / Mark: Thank you. Bob: That's what I like /Mark: alright cool. Cool cool. /Wade: That is good. Wade: That is pretty good. Mark: Yeah. I hope that gave the proper illusion of the cocks and the blanket that we are Mark: Hey wait, why did it turn me to the asian guy? Mark: You guys seeing this? *collective hmms* Mark: Something- /Wade: Maybe it knows something we don't Mark: *laughter* Mark: The biggest secret of our collective lives is that I've been Asian this whole time *more laughter* Wade: *gasp* What?! Mark:I know I know I mastered- Wade: Take that back! / Mark: It's true. You know it- Wade: NO! /  Mark: Look into your heart, Mark: you know it to be true. Wade: No! Mark: Alright. Where are we going? Wade: I don't know. Bob: I like tomato town. Mark: alright, let's go to tomato town. Let's do this / Jump right now to Tomato Town, my friends Alright you got it, I'm going / Like right now? / Hopefully this time we- Like I'm already gone, baby We landed in a- we landed in a place that didn't have any of our uhhhhhhh... our... allies in it, so HOPEfully, hopefully this time we'll actually get some buddies of ours OHHH, baby, baby, baby. / Okay there's- there's two- yeah There's two other people coming down. I don't know if they're our teammate, we won't be able to tell Circle back for that brick house on the- there, they're going- oh, woah, oh no- they just- Oh, there's a guy- one of them is going to the brick house Shit! Okay. Uh, welp good luck everybody I guess I don't know what we're gonna do- / Are we still going to the brick-? / I dOn'T kNoW / Just no- just land together. Just land- why are we going to the brick house? (?) i'm here Okay, I think they might have been our teammates because it seems like we got some people here / They're our teammates I see Green Arrows over them- / awesome awesome awesome Awesome. Awesome. Okay. / Oh yeahhh, that's / So- yeah, we're with our teams They're our teammates or they're really clever enemies who painted green arrows over their heads, and they're like "wAiT" / Yeah- *laughing* "wait..." / *laughing* In like a minute they're just gonna be like "Alright fuck 'em" / *laughing* "fuck em! Literally fuck em! Now!" / "Don't kill him. Just whip your dicks out!" *laughing yet again* Is that what this 50/50 mode's all about? Yeah, man / Yeah, it's, uh- 50/50 on whether you're gonna get fucked... / Yeah pretty much / ...is the full title that they didn't tell you about / yeah There's no real way to like sugarcoat it, / Okay I like our allies, but they took all our stuff. / I got guns Why didn't you get guns? I've got A gun and it's... not good. / Yeah I have like a common pistol. / I got a pistol and a shotgun. I've got a common this / that's okay. We can move on where's the circle gun okay? actually
We're in a good place cuz we are right where the circle is gonna be So keep an eye out 'cause then there might be a horde of like enemies coming to this town But there also might be a horde of allies / I didn't even hear any chests Were there chests? / Uh, I didn't hear any / They've all been opened as far as I can tell / huhh Well / We could go over to brick house, I guess. I think someone did that too, though Yeah / Yeah they did / So where do we wanna move to? Well / We could go to Wailing Woods OooOoh, great. Well, to the south of here are some mines that sometimes have stuff in it But they seem to be swarming that I'm gonna go over to brick house- just see if there's anything that was like looked over Kay, we're gonna head south No, I'm going over to Mark, Wade. /  Okay. There's a tactical shotgun right here whoever needs it, yeah Yeah, usually like / That guy hasn't finish looting it yet? / It's it's there's one in there in that door / It's probably just like a regular It's probably just not oh. It's a green. I guess it's not horrible. / Yeah I got three grenades / People sometimes pass over stuff easily. I'm gonna see if there's anything hidden in the roof / Do we need building materials? / Yeah, so you collect building materials by Smashing stuff up and you build things Obviously / I just didn't know if we needed them in this mode / Yes / Yeah, you're gonna want- you're gonna want a pretty good supply of building materials Yeah, so wood, all sorts of shit, brick- like, once you get good at building like you're very fast about it I usually set up my, uh, my wall to be a windowed wall right away Hey, our friends are engaging. You guys wanna come help? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I only got a pistol and a shotgun I've got a submachine gun, but it's suppressed. / Oh yeah, I see you- wait.  / I'm gonna push I'm gonna push this way. / I'm building something real quick. / I'm, uh, running with Bob Okay / I assume there's no reviving people in this / Yes, there is / you can get them up like pubG, but you can't like revive Behind me Bob. / Yeah, you shooting that guy? / Where? / There's a guy close- there's a guy close right there, Mark. Woah, woah- I didn't know you guys were over there Okay that guy's dead on the hill. / Oh my god. There's so many enemies over here Yeah/ I'm- I'm running away. I'm gonna die. / Get- get back to my fortification right here Yeah, I'm gonna run back to Mark, Wade. / Build walls behind you as you run And it'll- it'll help like just with, you know, not dying. / Oh fuck! Ah! Help. Build around me. / I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. / They're pushing me! AHHH! / Oh no, they're- yeah, they're def- Oh my god. Y-y-you're boned. Yeah, you're boned. Sorry, you're- you're very boned / Well... cool. AhhAHh! NOOOOO! Remember me! I got one- I got one down. Where are the other ones? *singing I Will Survive* Oh my god, there's three more coming over that hill. Oh my god. / Whoa whoa whoa whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Ah shit didn't see those guys Oh my god, those guys just like fucking swarmed us Yeah, that's what happens like if the whole team is there then it's just oh, it's just carnage No! Wade, no! / Wade, are you still alive? / No! / No, you're- / Finish him! / OooooOOoOoOh Shiiitt dude *lots of laughing and screaming* Seven enemies are just like... "woah, what's this guy doing over here?" / *laughing* "You just laying there, buddy?" Alright, I'll go back Yeah, but you can see like you can see like the fun of the game So I would recommend like when things like that happen definitely uh Hauling back and just- / Don't charge in / just fortifying Bob you were a lovely pink lady for like a split second, and then you went like you switched to an asian person I was like, I was bae penny Yeah, let's, uh, maybe go to retail row Okay, that's a little bit further well a little- little bit Nah, we can get there / Well, no that's good. It's good it's further because it means less people / yeah something like that seems like everyone automatically just jumps to the very first town and *laughing* Oh, we're jumping. Jump, Wade. / Oh, I pressed F crap *laughing* PubG loser / I gotta get used to this Which one of these things is retail row okay, it's this / the big- / yeah the far one / ...one We got other people coming to retail row / I hope they're friends / there's a lot of 'em I'm gonna land on like the right side over here. / I'm gonna. Yeah, right side Yeah, I'm gonna be in like the second building on the right / yeah, second building I'm gonna go for the roof short of the basketball court. Is that the one you guys are going for / ...Wait Yeah, yeah, yeah / Teammates here! / Teammates! Ah, Hell yeah. I'm gonna go further then, I'm gonna go back here. You're not a teammate / Uh oh You okay? / there's a non-teammate here / Run! Run before they get a gun / he's in this house. I'm- I'm above him, but I'm trying to GTFO Wait oh I found a chest No, this mine. Get the fuck off of my stuff. That's right fuck off. You asshole. Alright. Where are you guys? I'm coming / I went further / I'm west of you I'll be there soonish Man these guys cleaned this place oUT Where's the enemy? Where's that enemy guy? / He- he was in this house. I haven't seen him- ah! Hi friend Enemy, enemy where? I'm in / No, no, no he's a friend. He's a friend. There's an actual friend. / Okay. / Oh Just the way he said friend made it sound like- / Yeah *laughter* / HI FRIEND / He walked around the corner pointing a gun at- No give me a- come on bud. Man, this guy's taking all the guns and shit I don't know how you drop anything or else like when I find something. I would give it to you I only have one gun though, so / I think you can drag it out of your inventory when you're when you're holding alt but I'm fine. I'm gonna push further in towards Wade, then. / We're doing surprisingly well / I got a friend over here with me, right now Yeah, we've got a lot of teammates in this area, so this is actually fortuitous / Whoo, that is stressful You don't get to know if they're teammates when you're dropping though, so you're kind of like- *stressful noises* / yeah Oh! Seven teammates, thank God / yeah exactly, right? What a stroke of luck / I could be dead or it's just teammates. I do hear shooting. Or running / Yeah, I do too I'm not 100% sure where / sounds like it's coming from... the west? It seems like we're winning because we just killed a few of them, but / Yeah / Yeah, they weren't Jimmy poop holes Not Jimmy poop holes my favorite poop hole *laughing* / Alright I got a gun, thank God Good I don't have a lot of ammo, but I got some gun I'm gonna meet up with you guys I'm I'm nearest Wade, so that's where I'm headed. Alright, you guys find anything else? No guns, I'm harvesting up (?)- / I got a chest, but the chest only had a white m16 in it That's fine, an m16 is a really good gun. In my opinion it's the best just because it's like balanced and Good range shit blah blah blah dick a tree yada yada / What, is that the car exploding? That beeping noise Yeah, when you harvest a car it like like a car alarm goes off Okay, I guess I'll just keep loading up on bricks and stuff. / Where's the circle? / It's right Yeah, it's right on top of us. Yeah, and lots of allies is good What'd that car ever do to you? Kill it! / Fuck that car / Alright, I've got a- I've got a good bit of metal. / What's a good bit? I haven't played this game in so long I've got like 200. 200 usually is a good number cuz there- everyone else also has a bajillion things I can just let my team carry me you're saying / yeah Pretty much / this town has been scavenged to all Hell so / Yeah, uh, Bob, Mark and I are toward the west side of town now We got more teammates coming up from the west side as well Looks like we're converging the big team this might be this might be good for us. / Yeah, I see four guys west side coming Like north west of town and you guys have five guys trailing you right now plus me / If you guys need They're all out here in the wilderness / If you guys need smg's there's some smg's over here I would like that just to have like more bullets to shoot / yeah 'cause all I have is one gun still They're still in this- / Are they like right on you right now? Yeah, usually actually what will happen is uh Teammates are actually pretty nice about this They will drop guns that they don't need / There's, um, there's an SMG, a pistol, and an m16 here Bob. I took one of the SMG's. I might take an SMG / Okay, our guys are pushing north. / Where are you at right now? / I was just on the roof / Oh, you're right next to me. He was in that house that we were at Yeah, I was just checking the roof to make sure no one got it, but someone did... of course. It's 39 to 27 They've lost a good bit of people so it looks like we're gonna have the advantage. By no doing of our own! / Good Yeah / Yeah / We're good! Hey, we- we landed. *laughter* yeahhhh I have 200 stone AND wood / Niiiccee / Look at all these boots on the grouuunnddd There's so many boootsss *laughing* Did you see the new Brian Regan special? / That's from his new one, right? / Yeah, oh god I love it. / I have not / It's really funny I just don't think I've ever seen a Brian Regan anything / Really? Ohhh man / You are not mY FRIEND ANYMORE WoaAAHHH Alright, well I'll just go this way / Alright then You should just watch Brian Regan Oh shit, someone shooting someone / It's the guy on top of that, uh, building in the depot I'm sure the depots been claimed and like tall heck But I'll run through it just to see / but which who is he shooting who / yeah, I see like built uh Stuff all over the place / There's dudes up in there. / Ohhh / Man, it's hard to get loot in this shit If you land near enemies, you die. If you land near your friends like nope there's nothing left anywhere *laugh* have fun with your There's more submachine guns in here. Do you get more ammo if you pick up more submachine guns? Uh, I don't think so I think each one comes with one clip in it But I don't know if that counts as more ammo for you to like reload into your other gun, so / Yeah / Yeah Alright, it looks like the engagement is happening north for some reason. They must have all gone to Anarchy Acres That's my only guess. / Oh, we're in the... new circle, though. We're on the- / Oh yeah. We're on the cusp Yeah, I'm gonna go over here and see if they're coming because if they are in Anarchy Acres they're gonna be all charging from the north What the hell is that? That's the storm. / That's a drop, no that- / Oh! *odd noise* Behind us if you look at 195 there's like a balloon, that's like a care package. / Oh, they do have drops in this game AaAaHhH! That's so nice! Mostly, I think the care packages in this game are like this- uh, building materials But I think they do also spit out like a gun or some blue juice or something / That'd be nice Sometimes / Yeah, I don't like being without a shield out here, but- oh do you need some? Oh? No you- whoa / 
 Whoa Where are we at? Someone's shooting What? What are you shoot-? / The sky / Woah What if we just- What the fuck?! / Whoa, what the- / You can shoot the balloon and make the care package drop faster. / Ohhh Oh my god, guys- / Ohhh Iggy Azalea was in our room. / THE Iggy Azalea? / THE. THE Ziggy. / Who the hell is Ziggy? Why don't I know things? / I don't know. I'm not culturally like- / that wasn't- / significant is not the word Everyone's rallying to the balloon. Wait what the fuck I just saw- / I'm not culturally relevant. How do I know things? Yeah, everyone's rushing south. I don't know why.  / Let's do it. / Oh, we're down 30. Oh my god Our team is dropping like flies all of the sudden. / Yeah, I- They must be going for the balloon. / Don't worry. We'll get there after it's all over. We were up like 39 to 24, weren't we? /  Yeah Yeah, they're here. They're here And building walls, so just start random spam building is that what you're saying? / I mean if you want yeah, that's it's definitely a strategy Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Oh Jesus Christ / Whoa / What?! / They seem to have rocket launchers. / Yep. That they do. Okay, they're Yeah, they're building up a storm on the other side over there I think they got the balloon, which means they probably got the heavy ordinance / Well, that's our team right there. / Whoa, there's a bush. Yeah, the- / there's a bush back- / Woah, whoa whoa whoa. Yeah, whoo these guys are trying real hard. I'm a field oh for God's sake get the revive. I'm a field medic OOooOh Oh, that's my building you just snip sniped. / Oh my god these revives take forever. / Yeah these snipers are no jok- ow! Owie owie owie these snipers are not joking around here No they're not Why don't we ever find- / Oh shit! I just got sniped! / Okay, coming coming coming Coming. Which direction, do you know? / I don't know. I've got walls around me though, I'm fairly safe. / Okay. I don't know where that came from though. I got bandages. / I got you. No one built a door in this thing I've got a med kit. Is there a way I could drop it for you? Uh, let me- here- let me / I think you hold alt and try and like drag it out of your inventory you can drop it But I don't know. / Here, let me- let me-  I can- / Here you go, Bob. Are you on me? / Yeah. I know there's- / Oh yeah, thank you. Yeah, either one of those is good.  Uh, I'll keep- / I'll use this. / Okay. Jesus Christ. Yeah, this is where it gets scary. It's a fucking war zone. Yeah. / Oh my God. Yes Jesus Christ This is like a world war two battle scene in the form of a hilarious looking cartoon. / Yeah, I was gonna say The whole world is like *explosion noise* Fall bitch fall bitch fall bitch fall bitch. YEAHAHAHA got one. He was building a staircase to nowhere and I just blasted him. / Are they all south of us? Yeah, they're all south Not enough ammo? Oh I had the wrong gun out this whole time?! / Guys- guys are using- Guys are using my stairs OW! OOH OOH OOH! OW! You all right you all right? / I got snip sniped from uh- / Yep, that'll happen. Alright. Okay. You guys believe in me? Because I've got an insane strategy that I do sometimes. You guys want to follow my lead? Uhhh You ready? / I'm just having fun existing and being alive, but okay. I'm just what I do is I just run and I build walls in front of me, and I just kind of like create this Ah shit! Someone's hitting me from- ah! From my left from my left. Where the hell did that come from? / They're way to the left Oh jeez. OH jeez. I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead. Ah shit! They're- they're- yeah, they're definitely on the left in the trees I believe. / Oh, oh there was a sniper shooting me. Yeah, those are the guys that are picking all of our- yeah, I'm all the way dead. Yeah, somewhere to the left farther left than those guys I knocked one down! / Yeahh! Yeah you knocked him good! / Nice BOB! Nice nice nice nice nice. / I am out of good ammo. / That's all right. There's a lot of corpses in the field I'm gonna move up to our Allies' position. / Oh I knocked someone down! Yeahh! / Yeah, Wade. Good shit, Wade. Damn. These- these- these- the other team really pulled it out of their ass to get this like underway like wow holy shit. / We're losing right now! / I want inside! Yeah, I don't know how that happened, but they really really pulled it together. / God these snipers are so snipey / Yeah It's the people in the trees to the left. I know that for a fact Yeah, oh shit. Oh god. They're fucking- it's the apocalypse in here! / Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo All right, you guys got this! / OH WHAT?! UH OH I just think I just took a- that was a pistol!? Yeah *screams* OH GOD! / Those are definitely rockets! / Come in here, Wade. Come in here.

I fucking love this! / I KNOW, RIGHT? 'Cause, you'll get like shitty matches where you die like right away, but then you'll get the matches that are just like *SCREAMING* / NO IM TRYING TO FINISH HIM! I'm trying to build us one more cover. Okay? / Oh look at all that ammo that guy dropped. Oh tempting Wade, right? *screaming* HEY HEY I DID THAT *Mark laughing* Where's their ammo? I need ammo so bad right now. All over the field but good luck getting out there. / *screams* WADE I BUILT THAT WALL. I BUILT THAT WALL. / I'M GOING TO IT / I BUILT THAT WALL *laughing* YEAHHAHA! / Seeeee Mark protected me! / I did even in death. I protected you. I feel VERY secure right now. / *laughing* I'm coming, Wade. Don't worry. / Wait, if you- wait, look behind you look behind you there's a series of walls that I built to get to that point you see how that goes? / Hey Wade, how's it going? Yeah I do *mixture of screaming and laughing* Oh no, guys! Behind us! / WE NEED REPAIRS!!! We needed the tools! / I think you guys are done for. You guys are done for. It's okay, Bob. I'm behind wall #2! Wow, who's-? / Oh, Bob, you're down?! / Who's the hell is building? Wow- oop, welp. / Ohhh, we're gonna die now. / Oh yeah, there- ahhhh Not by shi- shi- shi- shoo- What is his name? / Sie_tv you inn-alliterate... idiot. / *mark laughing* No!

Yeah, they flanked the shit out of us *collective woahs and laughing* Oh no. / Is all of our team that's alive, down? I think there's one guy still at the depot / There are two guys still operating. Yeah, we- what we should have done is we should have probably fortified the depot itself that would have been smart Bucky bots has this don't even worry about it. / Yeah, Bucky bot built like- it was already up there Fully fortified. / Oh hell yeah. Oh boy. Oh shit. Oh, he's gonna explode now. / Bucky bot is doomed. :( You got this Buckybots! They're- they're just gonna slowly destroy your entire fucking place. *laughing* Let's see what's going on with Tenable Acorn. Ah, I see. / Get him, Fuap! Yeah, Fuap knocked out RandisBobandis.

alrigh alright hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome back to subnautica let me do that again just in case it was a little too early hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome back to subnautica how are you all doing this wonderful wonderful morning in the wonderful wonderful depths of the ocean that we currently are in right now how you guys doing yes welcome welcome welcome this is going to be the final episode of subnautica but i got a lot of things to do before I get to the final episode of subnautica but or more specifically before we finally leave this godforsaken planet once and for all and we never have to see the depths of the ocean ever again which would be wonderful if it only it could be true then maybe it's true I don't know hey welcome welcome welcome yes alright so where we stand right now in the terms of subnautica is we currently have everything that we need to be able to get the gear going get the hatching enzymes I actually need to make those right now I'm pretty sure I can make them in my base right here right now but everything that we need to do that is right here we've got the rotten bulb bush sample I hope it doesn't need to be fresh but if it does I can get one on the way over to the place that I need to go and we've got the iStock seed the sea crown see the ghost weed seed and the fungal sample now this should be everything that we need to be able to make the hatching enzymes and if it's not well then I'm just boned eternally and forever I am always 100% bone but it's not bone right there so we finally have the hatching enzymes we've actually done that before but that doesn't mean that it actually took place because that was before the official release of the game hello hi yes so here's how it's gonna go I'm gonna go down to this see Emperors container and I'm gonna go get these hatching enzymes underway I'm gonna be cured and there's a number of things that I need to complete before I actually get to the end of the game number one among them is there is apparently a cute and adorable little creature companion that I need to get that's located in one of the de Ghazi bases I believe it's in the one that is in the depths of near where mr. Pfister is right now and if I go down there I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find it but if not oh well but I'm gonna explore that after I get this done now in order to do this I think I'm actually going to just take bubble butt over there and I should be able to dodge you I don't know if the depths are good yeah it'll probably fall it'll probably be fine ooh you look a little damaged there let me just fix you up a squeeze or two can I get it not working all right whatever I'll do it later all right so delightful so we're gonna go and we're gonna cure ourselves at and effectively we're gonna cure the entirety of the ocean here every single thing that is infected in fact I would love to be able to see if those things can be infected as well like those things just covered in an enormous like coating of green pustules actually I don't know I want to see that but I just wonder if that's even possible I haven't seen if there's like a a Reaper Leviathan that could be infected with the disease as well just a bunch of stuff that I don't want to I don't I have to endure so I'm gonna take dashing enzymes what is that what did I just see down there oh it's probably another vent okay all

here we go tentacles came within reach neither appeared out of nowhere you shall receive light in one hand the jagged piece of scrap metal in the other she meant a butcher that beast or die tryin the last I saw her she has a metal launched in its neck as the monster did its best to shake her contorting off into the darkness I'm certain she got her wish one way or another then I thought I saw a light deep below me I hope maybe part of Swamp clear I followed it no I wonder whether I saw anything at all our oxygen is low the habitat is gone I can't see the sky something surely has the scent of my blood how fucking bad-ass is made uh oh my god I don't think you guys understand Maeda literally with a c glide and a piece of not even a knife not even a normal knife a c glide and a piece of metal lodged under a huge crack in which I'm sure was the C Emperor or a Reaper Leviathan and stabbed it in the neck just with the C glide and a piece of metal I wish I was a third that badass Maeda over that is the most incredibly hardcore thing I've ever heard of in my entire life I wish I wish I was that cool oh man and it's sad cuz I know I never will be I'll never be that cool my god that is redonkulous is that actually a way out of this oh there were sealing compartments oh oh shit no I'm out I'm out of jump oh okay we're good we're good scusi bouche we're out we out II whoo and if I'd

like right over here somewhere oh well not important but yeah that is like I am not that cool I am not that cool I check one of the previous episodes that I've been playing to this I scream like a little baby every single time I even remotely hear a Reaper Leviathan let alone see one whoa oh hell yeah give me that course Oh drill that quartz baby Oh drill baby drill and I think yes it goes right into my eight off that is good stuff oh that's good this takes a while to drill though and I like how long it takes to drill all right well thank you Shawn Lyons I was wondering if you'll ever play raft insult simulator slime rancher or stardew valley again I I guess I wouldn't mind I do like streaming a lot more than I used to in the past I do want to do more streams in addition to like the normal videos that I do like the videos being like highly edited stuff but for things like this where it's just like hanging out and playing a game and just having fun together I do like the the social aspect of streams and it feels like you know you sitting on the couch again and you get like you get a lot more like instantaneous jokes and feedback from when you're doing like this like like you guys with the strange conception that there's this enormous alien gun that got us here in the first place laughs you know I'll have you know as a weather balloon this shot is down to first place not a gun but it's a it's fascinating like a lot of those old games that I played you know it may not work out well for a video series because I like the video serious like videos are something special that you put a little extra work into or put a little extra pizzazz it's like more of a print ok no more of a presentation was like a livestream this is fun you have together all at the same time and and you know I'm streaming more on Twitch I'm streaming on here cuz I just like I like that aspect and there's there's different things that belong with one another and I would like to revisit a lot of games that I haven't given I you know it's funny if I don't think there's a single person here that would remember I highly doubt it if there is please let me know but uh way way way way way way way back in my channel way back like this is like the first few months I played a game called condemned crinimal criminal origins which is a horror game and a very good horror game that I was playing through and it was a lot of fun and I I got to like episode 13 of that one and I what happened was my computer crashed and I had to reinstall windows and I lost the save file now this is years ago this is like six years ago I don't know if there's anybody here that would even remotely remember that I don't even think that game is uploaded to this channel anymore that was like old channel stuff only I'm not 100% sure but it's like I never finished that game it's like stuck on episode 13 and it's just like whoops well that didn't happen cuz I didn't feel like playing through the whole game again and I always said I would come back to it now if you want to know about of a markiplier promise that's probably where it started because I threw why oh god I am now oh god okay alright well then that what happened okay okay all right everything's fine everything's fine hey look I got a message waiting for me let's see what it is but it's 500 meters straight out we'll make for the rendezvous and keep you posted out signal location uploaded to PDA I don't think I really don't think that they're alive III don't remember what whoa hey Oh what that's such a cool animation Hey look whole fish Wow all right anyway this is weird still I hate the ocean but look did I mention to you guys I freaking hate the ocean I hate I hate the ocean thank you no thank you all right anyway we got stuff to do so we're gonna get we're gonna get back to our base over there and I don't think we need to worry about I don't think we need to worry about them I'm pretty sure we've already experienced life - I knew what I'm gonna do I remember what I'm gonna do I've got a cutie here I've got a cutie over here I got the cutest cutie good the cutie all right so I'm gonna take care of this cutie cutie and that means that we are well on our way towards getting that rocket but we're gonna have a special friend with us for this endeavor someone said it's gonna pop up in just a second so was it I was I was talking about empty promises and I fell into the ocean as if the game was reminded of how Zachary swickle thank you so much for that Sean line said I remember that game could you please do another star D Valley Stream I want to do stardew valley because they're actually coming with a multiplayer version of stardew valley I'm not a hundred percent sure about that but I remember hearing that somewhere so I'm probably certain that it's true if it's not that I'm a big dumb dummy and that's all that matters but right now that doesn't matter because we have some courts which I'm gonna turn into glass because I'm pretty sure where's my builder tool there okay it's an interior dooble dang er there it is okay glass and titanium that's easy enough but I don't know if Evan of quartz on me right now but I'm gonna I'm gonna give this I don't know how long it takes to hatch that is the thing I don't I don't I'm not all represent sure how long it takes a hatch but we will see all right I hope I have enough ports for the glass yeah anyway so as I get this done how you guys doing let me see something here thank you - one second there we are thank you - fazzy panda

cuttlefish a small gray colored herbivore the cuttlefish displays high levels of intelligent curiosity and attachment strangely the species has not been encountered in the wild and the scan specimen had to be artificially asked within an alien containment unit in the absence of wild specimens little can be known for certain about the cuttlefish lifecycle it is possible that the environmental conditions have changed forcing the species to the edge of extinction and leaving its eggs in permanent stasis it's also possible that cuttlefish has been genetically altered or even imported to for five or six be from another world behavior we do know that the cuttlefish is an herbivore which displays highly sociable GU I'll call you Calvin mmm Calvin the cuttlefish as was observed in earth dolphins before their extinction this creature seems to understand the concept of other minds the prime Minotaur of true sentience in attempts to communicate with a series of troops and troops suggests the cuttlefish is capable of understanding to follow simple commands in addition to assessing the emotional state of individuals around it and spawning in-kind most of connection between living creatures is an essential component of psychological health oh my god that is too freakin cute I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I could die right now I'm gonna die I'm gonna die and I'm glad those

Pfister I really do mr. solo all right did someone tell him about the gun is real yeah they tried they tried look I get the whole conspiracy thing it's it's not worth it's not worth it sorry guys I got this alright subnautica is my favorite series of yours by the way pay attention to the credits says Dale okay I will I'm gonna let the whole credits play because it's a fascinating thing like in the what it's been like two years three years since this game has been in development and early access like this game is one of the few games that really really LEDs lend some credit to the whole early access concept it's it's and I don't know who the leadership team on this but it's just really really fascinating that they see it's really heartwarming to see what what people are willing to do like as far as just putting their their their time and effort into building something and always adding on top of it no matter how hard it is to go back and redo some of the work which they have like the team in subnautica is like redone so much shit in here and it's just really heartwarming to see like what they'd been able to do and how far they've been able to come it's really cool and I wish that more games were able to do this I wish that more games took the early access thing like and made something special out of it like I know minecraft was one of the first ones and that's like another example of like doing early access right and I know you guys probably have suggestions of other games that have done early access correctly but man it's just really it's really cool to see how far this game has come and also like it doesn't end with this like I know that they have other planned like additions to the game like they're gonna keep going with it and like the main story that they wanted to tell it has come and gone like with this game and it's just really cool to see like I just wanted to like say that real quick because I know I'm talking about all the piss and whatnot and joking around and this game is super fun to joke around with and it's a very good vehicle for just like hanging out and having a conversation but you know it's really cool to see and and I applaud the effort of any game development companies and tries you know that hard to make something special because you don't see it very often oh wait alright what did I need I've aerogel that's right I need something Ruby Ruby that's what I needed not the show the thing the thing that I need rubies I have rubies right over here because I farmed up a bunch of them when they needed it Ruby all right let's

that's big that's big I didn't know how big this thing was gonna be whoa this is so big all right what do I need for the next round I need the fuel booster crystalline sulfur kyanite I think I have both of those ion power cell good thing good thing I grabbed kyanite while I was I was still there all right we don't know anything yet we don't know anything yet well I don't know anything yet I'm incredibly stupid we don't know we don't know if we're gonna leave Calvin behind we don't know that we don't know that we don't know that so might as well not panic and it's fine it's fine it's fine hey Calvin come here hey Calvin hey Calvin here we go Alvin Alvin didn't get in my pocket okay we don't know anything yet we're not know anything yet we don't know anything yet we don't know anything yet we don't know anything yet propulsion cannon yes yes the the the propulsion cannon yes I can pick Calvin up and then throw them into the ship yes propulsion Ken yeah that might work okay yeah okay sure yeah no three kyanite no just three three three [Music] I need four maybe there's someone big-box berry hang on everybody hang on a second no oh no I had C crown no no that's the secret I dropped off three three Oh No there was a gel sack in there Oh there's only one place to get kyanite it's all the way back down oh no oh that sucks oh that sucks so badly why didn't I get one more kyanite I don't have a depth module oh no oh no oh why is there an eye washer an ion cell in there ah God break my balls oh wait maybe that's some rare stuff sir maybe a UH oh we got some rare OHS oh this looks promising there's a lot of piss in that one oh shit Oh proposed to Cannon Hey that's handy dandy whoa a cyclops efficiency module that's handy all right so that's nice come on one [Music] did I miss did I miss it did I miss it was it there where that's a diamond that's not kyanite did I miss it no it's not there that's diamond break my balls where's kyanite oh god just kill me kill me kill me kill me just kill me kill me just straight-up stabbed me in the neck just kill me okay just kill me all right kill me just straight-up stabbed me in my neck kill me I pissed myself thank you to everybody that's been donating through super chat queue me kill me drain me of my blood all right okay there's a chance there's a very slim chance there's a very slim chance it's very small but there's a very slim chance I believe I can get a kyanite at like just barely 900 meters kill me kill me so hard Oh kill me all right if I'm to be if I if I'm to believe this correctly I believe this is actually a landmark to the blood kelp zone that's gonna lead me down into the depths of hell I should probably take care of that but then again I did shout kill me so I'm gonna I'm gonna shove this entire Spade fish in my mouth that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna shove this entire Spadefish in my mouth my if it's crazy fuck ping comic alright and I'm gonna save real quick cuz I'm about Tess's propulsion Canon on this isn't alright this might kill Cal this my it might not be as good as I think it is hang on yeah wait I'm just gonna pick Calvin up just gonna butt delicately alright hi Calvin don't mind me Calvin hang on I've got Calvin he didn't happen it didn't happen it didn't happen didn't happen everybody shut up didn't happen it didn't happen didn't happen didn't happen didn't happen

never never talk about that ever again let's just never talk about that let's that didn't happen guys it just didn't happen weird there's a gap in my memory didn't happen it didn't happen who'da thunk 'old that definitely did not happen no no no guys no no I didn't kill Calvin that's not what happened you guys saw something different that's ridicul blanked out for a second you got in the world where there is a gun and you guys just went absolutely crazy out of your mind but stuff this in my gob to shove this whole Spadefish right in there plump yum delicious how about you two mr. Spade fish alright everything's fine these guys good eating's oh really oh that's alright see fine it's good you know why because I wouldn't do that I just wouldn't nope that's not I wouldn't do that no stop pressing f to pay respects cos Calvin is fine and alive Calvin is alive and fine Calvin's fine Calvin his fuck we all saw Calvin is fine in fact even if that did supposedly happen in your weird world where that happened no no no no Calvin's fine in that weird world if that were to be the case I didn't see a dead body nobody saw a dead body and everybody knows in any show TV show movie and let videogame unless you see a dead body they're not dead so I don't even know what you're talking about because number one that didn't happen number two nobody so yeah you can take your conspiracy theories and just shove shove them hard anywhere just feel free go go to shove town with that because it didn't happen did not happen in any way shape or form and you're crazy for thinking it did you know don't want you to worry about a single thing ever so just let me worry about what you're worrying about and everything's gonna be just fine right right no stop pressing f is fine Calvin this is redeye critic said you can't fool me you killed job don't think that you can be the judge of anything you guys are watching this like Minh this supposedly live okay yeah this is live whatever but you know don't think anyone can prove whoopsies I'm stabbing you now apparently all right it's fine you know what yeah you guys had your fun your silliness we all had a good laugh at my expense fine nothing to stop pressing f ed didn't know yeah I saw nothing nothing happened hey I don't remember ever seeing this live plot actually yeah I don't remember ever seeing this light bud have I seen this one weird no it's new new PDA flotation devices failed we're flooding evacuate wait I can reconfigure the o2 system to act as a bilge pump it's working okay good news we're alive and we've stopped sinking bad the oxygens going to run out in 30 minutes and with 500 meters down what do we do we'll have to use the remaining juice to send a distress call and build whatever gear we can then we find a way to the surface yeah I'm guessing they didn't make it that's just my hypothetical guess here alright so now that now that we got that out of the way I know this is this is definitely the one that leads down so I'm just gonna go down we're gonna find us some kyanite you guys are gonna stop being silly and stop being silly all right stop being silly and we're just gonna we're gonna have a good old time everything's fine no no no no no you know we all have fun here we have fun it's a fun time you know I just fancy so I guess this is the way that they wanted me to go to go down to the Lost River which is all well and good like it fine enough spider-man okay huh all right what do you want from me guys do you want me to admit it y'all man admit it and at best it was manslaughter it was cuddle slaughter it was Calvin slaughter that sounds worse but you know that's what it was it wasn't premeditated okay admittedly I did like stare at them pull them close hold them in the propulsion cannon and then okay all right this it's it's awfully suspicious all right it is suspicious I will give you that it is very very suspicious I would it's it's like it's enough it's enough to to raise an investigation I'll give you that I will give you that it is definitely conundrum as' oh god it's not it's too deep what the kyanite it's over there and I need this guy to be able to get it oh no it's gonna be just a hair too deep isn't it okay I think I can navigate this I think I can fix this if I do this right I can land on there cuz it I believe that's just below 500 meters 900 meters I'm either gonna blow up mr. Pfister or we're gonna get this kinda excuse me well we're gonna get this kyanite baby we're gonna get this we're gonna get this kind of okay all right I don't think it's gonna work but this is the only method I got cuz I I bet I bet I would have had enough I bet I wouldn't have enough I I bet I would have had enough to be able to get what I need news I bet I would have enough and I think it'll last long enough to be able to get it and get out especially if I'm able to vote this way especially if I'm able to get just enough I bet if I land on right on the tip of that vent there that's gonna be in the right range okay all right this is where we're gonna save because it's gonna get dangerous I got to get down there I know there's kyanite on the way down I know there is and I know you have to drill it you have to drill it there's no other way you have to drill it so if I can combine the two hoop I can land on that tree I can definitely land on that tree the very tippy top II of that tree something I can handle okay please tell me I can land on this Oh very close almost there hippity-hoppity whew okay it's fine okay I know let me scout it out first let me scout it out I know that this guy and I down here I just don't know how far down it is and I believe no shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh come on wow it's hot it's too hot I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine Oh No ouchies that's real high Oh Howie okay all right well I have myself I bet it wouldn't have even taken all that much material to be able to make the freakin depth module for the freakin wait no is it this piss shit piss and shit oh I'm just gonna go for it it's gonna be a bad idea but I'm gonna get it go oh I don't like that sound oh hey how is going buddy okay it's fine it's fine it's fine I got this I got this all right I got this okay where is mr. Pfister there's mr. Pfister all right let's see how quickly it's gonna kill me let's do this in and out super speedy like all I need to do is harvest it I just have to harvest it here we go all right we're fine okay I just gotta get to it and crack it that's all I have to do I have to get to it and crack it that's it come on grab something you bastard grab something take kyanite kyanite come on limited time hey get out of here I'm not infected anymore oh shit come on where the hell well there used to be kyanite all over the place here why suddenly no kyanite where the Frick frack where the where's the freaking kyanite where is it where is it no where is it why is it not here it used to be all over the place we're gonna die we're gonna die we're gonna die I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I am on a diet I'm on a diet I am on a diet I'm on a diet is how I die is how I die okay night there there there I saw it I saw it I saw it oh come on come on you laggy bastard come on you laggy bastard come on oooh just crack it never gonna crack it yes just one just one sweet kyanite there it is there we go okay it's in there let's see if we can get up in time oh I don't know if I can repair faster than the damage is being done but I can try okay take a break breather get the thing back up okay what okay 32 all this that's bad hey scary scary scary I don't think we're gonna make it I'm gonna try to repair it why am I going I haven't going backwards why am I going backwards why am I going backwards wait wait wait wait wait what what what why what is happening okay all right yes that made no progress why okay I'm gonna try repair it but try I bet I don't know if I can repair faster than I can I can okay okay okay and I'm gonna take I'm gonna take the kyanite out of here just in case okay all right this is the most stressful thing that I've ever seen in my life okay that should be enough what my jet isn't really oh my jet hasn't recharged yet okay that's fine sure we'll go with sure you charge recharge recharge recharge recharge recharge okay hope let's get out of here try to find some elevation I don't like the squonk did I get turned around did I did I somehow can dude I honestly really god fucking damnit how the hell did I get turned around how how did that happen how in the hell did that happen okay I gotta get out and repair again I'm gonna hop out prepare

entertained cuz that's what this is all about right just too entertaining you guys I know I know those beer bullcrap I know because I endured it oh my god alright the Bonefish best use you scary oh my god the lag is so real you know they did optimize this game a little bit but it's still not quite so good especially when you're loading between a lot of biomes now I got to get back before I starve to death oh yeah I did it I did it I can't believe I did it either you know I can't believe they moved the kyanite that far in but you know what I am just too damn persistent I will not be thwarted I will not be turned away at the door I will get what I came for or I will blow everything up and kill Calvin I know Karen I know I know I know ooh this is food the gel sacs are food that's good food good eats good eats good eats all right good eats kidding man I tell you what I tell you what this has been I'll save the game that's bro oh I'll yield to your wisdom ooh lag God the game is super laggy right now that's how you turn around it just flips you around like that huh hey hey how's it going I am stressed beyond all imagination I just need a second to take a breather thank you Giga

the on cat demos Cat Cat evil Morty Sean McLaughlin Thank You Larry Moritz Viet Camrose Chandler as your shaft app maze them with legend of the lethal Titan thank you all for the super chat I really appreciate it I'll read in more details soon all right PLAs steel Power Cell enamelled glut and then we'll glass I'm just gonna steal this Cyclops shield generator out of the Cyclops that's all I'm gonna do okay but I just need an amble that's fine that's okay at least that's predictable and just punch one of the one of the Raptor bastards in the teeth I'll drill it out of them our right Karen if you say so vital signs stabilizing okay so we just need to make the plasteel ingot and then we're good to go oh yeah yeah okay why are you yeah you're freaking sick I can't do anything to help you go get some poop or puke from one of the sea Emperor babies I'm becoming a natural bear grylls why by drinking so much of my own piss is that what it is man proudest moment I'm gonna use you to

mean that that's not Calvin cuz it is that's definitely Calvin all right what did we need for this plasteel ingot and Power Cells yeah all right all right let's just uh this is me okay I've got that I just need the lithium where did I put that stuff I I put it in a lager herbai hush hush er hush your beautiful faces everybody hush your beautiful beautiful faces you're all wonderful and beautiful but it's fine alright anyway gotta make this and then I gotta I gotta eventually make an ample glass I don't need it right right now so let's at least get this out of the way for now just another power so how did it cost to make a Power Cell ion powder cell ion battery oh shit I gotta make an iron battery oh well that's not so bad I think I have all that I got the ion cube I need gold and silver okay silver nope gold and the ion cube which is where the heck nope they are okay no I need two of them that's right I need two of them I got that gold another gold another silver we're about I keep doing that uh we're about good to go art one of these do but there we go alright and we need the silicon rubber which is right here gotta keep doing that and okay so we got that we're good to go got everything we need who'd leader leo Thank You Chandler eyes let's see there were so many easier ways but it worked are you talking about getting the kyanite yeah probably but you know I like the way I did it it was death-defying you made me seem very brave made me seem extremely brave watch I just I just like I'm driving bubblegum like back to the base and I just slam right into Calvin just like straight up thunk bump well there goes Alvin how it's hit my own ass oh darn Melvin now it's good to know about Malvin help Melvin did what Melvin did good be good to know all right boink whoa that's a big boy that's a big boy that's such a big boy look at that big boy look it down big boy gun on Island on on an island wait okay wait all right are you guys saying that this gun is on an island all right okay Worsley island guys where's your Island you know that this game is called subnautica right it's about being under the ocean you're gonna see any islands here okay guys yeah you did your best you did your best but you're not gonna pull a fast one on me I know exactly what's going on here you guys you guys think you guys think I don't know oh wow man you know you would have

don't know about that thank you wall is going Caleb's Alice use the propulsion Canon on the scrap that works almost every time what am I doing with this scrap do I just throw it at him go shoot him with it that's not what I do I'm gonna assume that's what I do that seems about right I'm gonna do that I'm gonna shoot a scrap Adam hey buddy come on over here come on over here wait Wow not necessary come here whoa hang on here take this take some of this take this oh he took it okay I don't know oh oh oh it works almost every time I'm out of here I'm out of baby I'm out whoo Thank You Caleb's Alice that is worthy of getting a name on a locker if ever there was one Caleb Hollis Thank You Caleb Caleb Caleb everybody give it up for Caleb okay so I got with that now I can make some enameled glass if I still that glass ami which I don't of course I don't all right the most difficult thing that I thought it was gonna be all right oh I didn't even make another plasteel that's right all right two of those actually two of those an ingot oh I'm out of ink it's but I'm not out of titanium that's for sure okay make an ingot let's make a plasteel more good oh and an analyst plasteel and i think and a computer chip I think a computer chip is the only other thing that we need yeah just a computer chip okay so that just requires some table coral which is nearby i I depleted that deposit of table coral over there so I gotta find another one come on where's the goddamn table core oh there we go all right all right let's do whoa hi are you staring longingly at big box Barry oh you're the one that big oh okay so you and big box Barry you got it on could you get out of my face I just feel like you're not in the right right you know what since I'm gonna leave soon you guys just have a good time I guess you guys just have a good time I guess I mean that's all that I really can hope for at this point so congratulations any gold what is gold and copper wire right you have table core in big box Barry I'm aware what I have in big bucks Barry but I don't need it I got table coil right in front of me right now yeah all right dad later - did Lily do you all right so I got that I have everything that I need then right yeah yeah I do yes I do yes I do I do have everything that I need all right okay all right then let's go for this bad boy let's do this this it's time

about that good dude dude guys guys it's here dude it's here it's here oh there's another planet Oh guys whew hydraulic systems Oh communications array Oh auxiliary power unit oh oh oh wow can't believe I built all this wow wow wow activate life support prepare time capsule who put up the primary CPU oh oh oh couldn't save oh this is a good one okay all right boot up the CPU toot-toot and Neptune you're a beautiful sounding prepare the time capsule Oh image on a pan wait here uh take all of my piss [Laughter] does it up ugly and here lies the bargain player hey he came to this rock with nothing but his wits and a full bladder he leaves the only thing that mattered to him so cool that's so cool alright yeah I see what you're saying as he were saying yeah III know what I should

platform is still active oh the quarantine enforcement platform yeah why didn't you guys tell me to turn off the quarantine enforcement platform that was an important detail why did you leave that out of that you didn't tell me to turn off the guys I rely on you for so many things you didn't tell me about the quarantine enforcement platform why didn't you do that everybody knows the quarantine in Florida meant platform is on that mountain there God and that's not an island that's a mountain these guys come on I rely on you for one thing and you let me down every time you let me down why don't no one said turn off the quarantine enforcement platform God guys why don't you warn me about these things fine okay I'll go turn off the quarantine enforcement platform yeah okay all right you can't you can't do it it just doesn't work doesn't work doesn't work you can't can't take wait what Oh Oh [Music] I'm ringing one leaves just in case I need it wait maybe I need to make like artifact I don't know I don't even know if I have that recipe I don't actually Thank You Me At su-85 have told me to do that Oh Khalid I barely met you and I definitely didn't murder you and I know you're probably better off here because you get to live in an environment that's friendlier to you I didn't have any water on the rocket so you wouldn't have been able to go anyway oh so cute god damnit Kelvin all right now I'm gonna go turn off the quarantine enforcement platform shoot Calvin to space with the propulsion candidate something something tells me that that's that's quite a bad idea oh oh it's sure oh it's so cute my god that is cute my god that's cute all right I'm okay I'm okay I'm gonna stop being a little baby about it I'm gonna stop being a little baby I'm gonna turn off the quarantined enforcement platform oh man miss foxy Calvin shall live on shadow 386 don't forget to customize your rocket let's see you know even if I could bring Calvin with me it wouldn't be right you know like it wouldn't be right because this is Calvin's home I couldn't care for him as well he's he's a big boy he can survive on his own Calvin what it good good oh I guess I forgot that I haven't been here since it was like still in development oh yeah yeah Wow I have not been it whoa where do you lead with a Hecht but that does this portal lead wait a minute have I forgotten something here oh it probably leads to the C Emperor's temple down way down below how do you turn this thing off again I've completely forgotten I'll take that thank you is there even a way to turn it off here or is it somewhere else I cannot remember guys is this is this here or is this in the Emperor area what is that whoa what's that why are you shaking I don't like that Oh Oh scans indicate this device contains enough potential energy to destroy the entire planet along with most of the soldiers unfortunately it has malfunctioned okay alrighty then okey-dokey then ooh there's a pink tablet over there I might

here with me thank you so much for just enjoying all this thank you everybody for enjoying all this thank you everybody so much for enjoying this series like I know we're coming to a close here and I want to figure out how to customize a rocket and I'm gonna get one last thing from my base to put in the rocket but yeah this is it's really something special like this really is this whole thing was something special like this whole adventure like conquering not conquering I'm still terrified of the ocean but acknowledging my fear of the ocean you yet forcing myself to dive deep down and just kind of like explore this horrifying world with with this real sense of danger and wonder like this real sense of it and going through the journey of the fact that I've been playing this game for about two years now like that's that's something incredible and it's something really really wonderful and and I I know you guys are saying like there's probably a way to take Calvin with me but you have to understand that wouldn't be the right move it wouldn't be the right move it wouldn't be right to take Calvin with me on to this adventure because in the rocket like Calvin can't survive there I don't have an aquarium for Calvin Calvin here now that the ocean is safe and he can live in the ocean here it's not safe safe but it's safe enough that he can survive here like this is where Calvin should be Calvin shouldn't be with me sometimes it's important to let go even if you want like it's for what's best for Calvin and not for me and what's definitely not best for Calvin is a propulsion gun right to the face but that's another story entirely and that didn't actually happen but you know it's just really fun like to go through all this and to to play this game and like see everything that's here and to see like all the wonderful things that came out of it and to know that like this this brought so much joy and the reason I wanted to finish this off in a live stream is because I wanted to be here with you guys to experience it all at the same time and and even if someone's watching this from the future which I know people go through much my series all the time boink got it people go through my series all the time like over and over again and you know but I wanted to experience this with you guys like directly because something important and I wanted to finish it off right and find these last few things without being rushed like in any way and you know what Karen I'm gonna miss you the most Karen because apparently Neptune has a different book Karen I love you Karen Karen I love you but you made that happen one last goodbye from Karen you sack you sack of shit you sack of shit oh my god [Laughter] latest scan wait why don't it scan this thing oh whoops scan that into oblivion apparently oh jeez oh man oh there we go yeah I got stuff to do but yeah besides all that silly this yeah goodbye Karen Karen with a K Calvin with a C this is good you know it's

this is it Oh Calvin let's do this oh hi you should move probably - one time capsule jettison [Music] a portion approaching orbital debris debris field clear performing gravity turn maneuver oh wait look at that island wait what is that island there's another one Oh note is that the Aurora no there's confirmed destination coordinates there's more islands on this nearest interstellar phase gate engaging ion Bustos and three two one whoa that was big wait was that whoa shit oh thank god damn ah been going wow holy shit what is a wave without the ocean a beginning without an end they are different but they go together now you go among the stars in I fall among the sighs we are different but we go together [Music] [Music] but yeah what was that I thought there was a huge huge land mass

it's really something special like to see it come all this way I you know when it first starts out you never think that it's actually gonna come that far I didn't but this is why I wanted to wait until the final version of the game came out before I tried it like to actually finish the game it was fun to be able to like do this oh look at all the production babies I look at you like it was fun

brain okay I don't like any of you all keys perfect there's my car keys here's the nightmare dishes is the doll your sex doll Oh think Oh think that dolls my sex doll and if this person in this game if that is the way that it is oh we got a lot more to be scared about that way originally funked everybody everybody everybody calm down everybody calm down you're being a little you're being a little crazy I appreciate it a Boosh better fix it before I leave why so I can waste power alright who's there no one all right let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go look no again why that's not fair okay clocks clocks right clocks okay looking at the clocks by oh no no see I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy okay someone said use the pictures I don't wanna go near those kooky scary skeletons fine okay we got this though we got this it's all good it's all good guys it's all good we got this if you think the weed oh god this you are wrong and we got this so hard ha ha all right whose idea is that whose idea is it to use the paintings or whose idea is it to any of this whose idea is it to anything here whose idea is that to fix the fuse before you leave whose idea is it to take a nice relaxing shower in the most disgusting water imaginable I don't know whose idea it is it's not mine and I don't want nothing to do with it I should wash the dishes before I go indeed I should indeed I should okay oh yeah we got this we got this everything's good everything's yep we got this we got this we got this we got chicken stop moving don't why is it there's a lot of moaning happening behind me originally I thought it was chica but it may not be okay use the painting using it using it as hard as I can use oh no the dab fuse they broke right no no I'm not gonna look what do I do who are you what do I do okay all right guys give me a breakdown give me a breakdown of give me a breakdown I get that the doll you stare at I get the clown I forget what the clown is but I think the little like gangster doll you have to you have to like turn the light back on before it gets you because that's like from the first game the tall guy what do you do what do you do you have to take him out to dinner that doesn't help anybody I'm not gonna take about today I don't care how dapper he is in his suit you know that guy's looking a little gray his skid turns gray you know I think it's darker I will play the evil within to with a clown no movement okay clown no movement that's right foul no woman would jump out the window that doesn't show him chica these don't not helping at all not helping give him a kiss no I just wanna give him a kiss don't look at him that's what I did I didn't look at him I swear I give him the sword I know send Jim after him this is not helping he's handsome I don't care how handsome is okay all right now where did I put my car keys all right let's see show them the pictures be to blow these you banged a horse that that is not anything to do is what's happening here and frankly I'm just concerned turn the lights close a door behind him I suppose that would help now that's actually tangible tangible help there I think that's good I gotta do my dishes reset the fuse box that might be good that might be good okay I'll try the fuse box and if that doesn't work scream at him Stoneham nope punch him in the ass Boop his snoot I don't I don't think any of these are helpful ideas and I think you guys are all just absolutely not not giving this you're all here I think you guys are just goofing me pretty hard okay nope don't do that okay so falcon punch him nope no think so there's nothing to be done with the books I think that's like that all right it's fine it's fine nope no oh okay we're fine damn it show him the eight pages Oh God turn up on that was not the same guy that was not the same guy that was not the handsome man that I thought was gonna be there that was someone very different that was extremely different that was not that was not that was not what I was that's not what I thought it was gonna be those that was the opposite of give him a smooch no no fart fart on his balls I'm gonna assume 100% that that's not not the right strategy I I think I think that's pretty much pretty much guaranteed to be not the correct strategy there if I had to guess if I had to think about it real hard like no not gonna do that hug him ya know I've been doing that hugging him has been like my number one strategy and frankly it's terrible advice through and through all right lick his face give him a cigarette no when I kick him in the nuts now that actually actually might do okay key card is behind the cabinet someone said that's the clown that is not the clown the clown isn't found is like much shorter than that from what I remember if that's the clown then I'm getting no no no no stop showering and doing the dishes okay you know what that's good advice I'm gonna do that all right so something about cabinet ooh whoa whoa whoa whoa I shouldn't run with these but I got him okay ah new developments okay choose wisely and fail why did that ding-dong she's wisely or fail oh okay ah interesting enlightened quotes you must see the answer to no the answer is there some kind of puzzle here with these paintings I don't know there's the keys though okay we're onto something here more than just our scares hello sir alright so what do we got going on Oh oh-ho yes please Oh another book no notebook nothing okay so there's a lot more in this place to use than I originally suspected and if I can use that to my advantage then we're gonna get farther can I run with this no I can run with this scissors why can't I wait I really can't I can run with the scissors so what no huh oh I dropped the scissors okay well those are lost forever to the void but oh maybe in my room there was more cabinetry in my room wasn't there nothing there that's not a book yeah okay huh interesting okay I'm onto something run from the tall guy okay again I I don't seem to be able to get very far from him but I will try this one time is key okay so these are all him so these are definitely all hints Oh a bottle over there watch out demons I'm gonna open your brain a can opener yeah yeah give you a lobotomy fuck oh all right fine bash out of here illegally deal Liddy anything in the fridge no nothing what's the point I'm not gonna wash the dishes washing the dishes seems to be the one thing that gets me dead all right time is key choose wisely all of these they're talking about something but I don't know what what are they talking about cabinets dishes it's all part of a big plan nope don't do that I don't like that nope okay so something about time something about time so these keep resetting the yeah they all are doing the same exact song and dance Emily's outside huh interesting yes welcome welcome welcome everybody this is something okay all right okay so they're all saying five does that mean something okay no I don't like that oh shit okay ye so the clocks paintings on the wall I've been trying to use the paintings on the wall but I haven't been able to see anything from that because if there's something that the painting is on the wall they don't change but Maio are you talking about like the the the the small ones the square ones it might be maybe maybe maybe not maybe I'm crazy I'm probably definitely crazy but I think there's something to this oh there's something to this alright so I suppose the dishes before we go there's something here so you must know you must see the answer to know the answer if these are hints all right and if I was choose wisely or fail oh oh oh oh oh five yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes I need a key card I need two key card I got a girl I'm leaving I'm leaving I'm really really leaving I'm leaving I'm leaving I'm leaving leaving leaving can I go home hey Emily hi do you want to play Emily I keep having that same nightmare huh what say what now two to one join me in another delicious shower I don't like this at all I like this the opposite of what this is oh I don't have that hole in my house anymore I don't think that's a good idea I don't I don't think any of this is a good idea yah hmm I'm gonna go shower oh it's fine stop crying oh you just have so much trust over what you're seeing in front of my face are you honestly saying that you you're just okay with everything here and if I take a shower and I do the dishes everything's fine jump-scare list there's no jump-scare list you're watching this with me you're watching this with me why do I keep having that strange dream I don't know maybe dumb chika how's it going what's going on Bob chicas over there just look down the whole time I don't think that's a good idea give it a good spoop I don't know everything looks normal calm down that in horror games when everything looks normal that's when you should be the most apprehensive I should wash the dishes before I go sure okay yeah okay all right then chica can't save us chica can't save us from this no no spoofing poop trust us it's fine now I don't trust you at all I don't trust you even a little bit what I do oh yeah yeah yeah yeah where's da go da goes down there but we'll get the dog Oh in a second just let me uh let me figure this out okay all these scary ass dishes they're just a goddamn nightmare

breaking ha ha there we go okay so unbridled horror I have no idea what this game is about all I know is that the game quite possibly is spooky so let's get into it can I control it with the controller oh that's in Russian anybody hey does anybody speak Russian in the comments right now that knows what this says if you do write it in the comments below and hopefully uh hopefully that will help oh boy I don't know why it's turned blood-red that's that's that's not good that's not good okay so it is not a controller game like the other one so I'm gonna do WASD a letter excuse me how do i I can't move on oh I can jump wait is it no yeah turn this off excuse you I don't want to open the game bar there we go okay well there we go there we go okay we're good all right so okay ah so I got a flashlight and it's got ass temporary time thing It's Made in the Unreal Engine if anyone cares about that sort of stuff I do oh that's a squall key door those are bloody handprints hey I wasn't done with the door there what what what did I lose my opportunity to go through the door here we go again into the spooks she could look like she was looking at me so concerned that it's loud that's a clunky thunk chica why are you staring at me like that chicas giving me the weirdest stare right now that I've ever seen in my life hang on I have to like I'm gonna take a small video this cuz it's just super weird cuz she looks happy but she's okay so chicas just staring at me right now and I don't know why she's just like cheek are you okay she can you okay okay there's a little tail you're all right pop you're right pop come on okay good girl what's going on you okay pop oh no hmm oh she's alright I got into this yeah anyway so chicas just looking a little shook maybe she doesn't like me like screaming in terror she times sometimes gets a little worried for me it's okay Bob good girl good girl that's a good girl okay I'm fine just a little more squeeze her in there oh poor little bump she cares about me she's like why is master screaming why is master so skilled normally master is brave but today no brave aah why why why why is that in my house why is that in my house at all and why why why is that they're locked oh great okay so what do I do about that what Oh what am I supposed to be doing I can't open it yes I can oh there we go ah okay close that close that Matt yeah I open the bottom on there crouch or something no damn it okay so if there's got to be something else in here that allows me to get out right and why is there a bloody handprint on that one I just don't know all right clunker stonker you anything to do with this flashlight whoa oh I guess I'm just not existed or is this just actually another hallway is that wait is this one of those moments where that's actually the hallway here or is that completely different I don't know that's weird okay well I can't go back why is there a window here weak that window doesn't make any sense why is the window on the interior of that something's weird here but this is light so what do I do Oh goobie alright so there's got to be something with the handprints right because there were handprints going up the wall and then there's handprint right here I can't rotate this or anything so there's got to be something around what is it though what is it where are those going all right I'm pressing use on pretty much everything I got over here but there's just nothing to see and I can't go back so what do I do someone please tell me what do I do things don't make sense in this world and yet I'm lost I can't even open this drawer that's supposedly looking like it's important because it's got a handprint on it I've got these weird snow painting here what's going on right there's got to be something

grandma Emma okay alright grandma you stay you stay good okay it was grandma all along I would not be surprised at that idea okay everything seems to be fine [Music] well that loop was uneventful Oh can't move oh it crashed okay is that the end oh you can't end it like that oh come on oh don't do that gosh darn it oh god damn it don't do that oh don't do that oh god damn it Oh Frick that was such a good game but that was a demo of that game that was called unbridled horror and damn it that was so good oh man I'm disappointed but I've got more game for you here I'm not I'm not over yet I've got more ready just in case those ones went a little shorter than I imagined if you guys remember you remember a game that started a little thing called be to blow and the sequel of this game came out about two years ago and I always meant to get to it and I played the demo I did play the demo of it but I never actually played the full game now think back to where B tableau first came from dungeon nightmares and dungeon nightmares - is here and it's been here for a long time and I always meant to get to it and this is one of the other reasons why I like live streams and being able to have more time to do this and not worrying about like recording than editing and then uploading when I can do it all in one we can just shift gears and go straight in to dungeon nightmares - which is exactly what we're gonna be doing now III don't know how much different is gonna be from the demo but dungeon nightmares was so terrifying hey night terrors pav Warnock turnus I get those all the time the disorder of sleep characterized by a dream of Terramax flying dimensions far worse than a typical nightmare yeah I suppose the problem with night terrors and what makes them scary let's see this burger like blam oh I got no candles I can't be to blow when I have no candles water baby [Music] you walk into a dungeon that's terrifying and the first book you come across it's a horrifying tale of walk that why isn't moving oh I don't know oh it's very creepy yeah that was that was exactly what I was gonna say yeah that's that's very creepy not sure what to do with it but you come across a book that's water babies and a world of girls what the hell is going on here this is used for drinking is used for drinking it can't be blood who'd have thought it was blood how do I know it's blood just cuz there's blood in it doesn't mean that people drank from it making a lot of assumptions here and they don't like it present m4 map got a map oh that's not cool oh yeah this is definitely different than the demo that I played and I remember nothing I remember absolutely nothing about this game what do we got here a little pretty pocketbook oh it's upside down there we go January 20 2008 I will end this tonight even if it means killing myself II Fitzpatrick okay II Fitzpatrick just don't drag me into your plans no idea what to do with a useless bits of old metal but god damnit what happened to my treasure collecting that was my favorite part this was used for drinking blood what about this who's this body used for drinking blood oh boy oh no the chair the terrifying horrifying chair alright that's our way to go back here nah it's all a dead end okay there's got to be some candles here somewhere somewhere in this horrifying place is exactly what we need oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah okay all right I thought that was bad oh yeah that's right that you can't sprint forever I forgot about that I forgot about that oh good blood on the walls oh I forgot about that oh that's not good okay that's fine though I know it's no bueno but we'll get to it we'll get through this together with the power of love and friendship and love also love lots of love we'll get through this ah no we won't cuz we'll reach a goddamn dead end oh my god are you kidding me Jesus please be nothing nothing okay yeah I will be playing evil within - yeah that is next on my list of stuff to play I will be doing a full playthrough of that as well and yeah okay so far so nothing which is good I'd rather have nothing than a whole lot of something but so far so nothing which is good I guess he's waiting for me to get a candle or it's waiting for me to actually like make some progress in this game whereas right now I'm just being a big old idiot and not getting anywhere but nonetheless trying my best here getting pretty far if I could just do what I need to do blood for Gabby's skulls roasting on an open fire I'll get a chest ah good open this up do I get treasure nothing absolutely dick diddly I get nothing oh god I can't even take the Bulls anymore imported from China Oh what do I care I don't want to know what's inside why don't you wanna know what's inside oh wait I made it I made

Hello, everybody. My name is Markiplier and welcome back to Dream Dad Now we just got done with a beautiful date with Craig. It went wonderfully. We got a kiss on the head. It was awesome. While I'm doing my afternoon word jumbles. I hear the mail truck pull through the cul-de-sac. I wonder if we got any coupons today? The nice mail person slides a couple letters in a large yellow envelope through this slot, takes a couple of tries for them to get in. Hey my coupons. I take a closer look at the large yellow envelope. I lightly knock on Amanda's door, she probably has headphones on. Manda! She yells through the door. WHAT! I have something for you. I'm kind of busy right now. Can you come back later? Okay? Just thought you'd want this big old envelope we got from HIA. Immediately Amanda pushes her door open. HORNE institute for the arts? I mean if you're busy I can come back. FATHER PLEASE. I handed the envelope which she tears open with her teeth. That's probably bad for your teeth. She doesn't seem to hear me and spits out a piece of the envelope.S he pulls a letter and unfolds it. The suspense is killing me. This is her dream school, Amanda's face is unreadable. I can't believe this. Oh honey, it's okay if you didn't - I got in! It's that old joke, ha ha. oh! I got in! Amanda tosses the letter aside and gives me a big hug. Congrats sweetie. That's amazing. I'm so proud of you. She pulls away and looks at the letter again. Oh my God I really can't believe it got in. Well of course you got in. You're a great student, you nailed that interview and your photography is incredible. Wait, Dad. I know this one's really expensive and it's so far away. I think for a moment. HIA was one of the most expensive schools that Amanda applied to, I know she's had her heart set on it for the longest time. It'll be tough. We're gonna make it work. I don't even know if I have a job or anything. But maybe if I start working we can do something with that. Really? Of course. Amanda hugs me again. Thanks Dad. Okay sweetie, we're celebrating today. Dinner, your choice. Wherever you want. Wherever? Amanda I walk along the bay side,tearing into our foil wrapped burritos from nearby food truck. You could have chosen anywhere in Maple Bay, cost was not a determining factor. Please dad. I know - you know I'm a simple gal. Just give me a 'rito with a view I can't say I'm mad. Amanda and I sit on a patch of grass and watch ships sail lazily through the bay. And the dorm is right near a bunch of cafes. And there all these little galleries nearby, and there's a discount if you bring your student ID - Amanda slow down. You're gonna choke on your 'rito. I know. I'm just excited. Did I mentioned the students get their own studio space once they're seniors ? And we all get the professional photo editing software for free. It's nice to see Amanda so enthusiastic about HIA. But I wish she wouldn't do it between bites of her burrito. I thought I taught her to chew with her mouth closed. I wonder who my roommates are going to be. You take a survey online and they match you with someone who's - with a similar major and interests. I bet we're gonna be best friends. Greg and I were a good roommate can be a lifelong friend But don't even get me started on bad roomies. Oh, no. I'm just kidding We didn't have a bad roommate our only other roommate was a puppy. - Craig brought home one night We spent a semester Fabricating the story about her new foreign exchange student had a really bad cough that sounded exactly like a dog's bark are Carl RUULED They let you have animals in the dorms but u  you need a note saying you need one But I could forge one I think I'd get a rabbit or maybe a snake or maybe both with the snake eat the rabbit though. Oh boy I think I'll leave that all up to you. I'm so excited. I'd only disappoint her, but I need to be real for a second So you know I had THAT talk with Mr. Vega I didn't tell you about the dumpster fire did he? What no I don't want to put a damper on the good news But I need you to knock it out of the park these last few months of school Okay, if you really want to go to horns. We need that scholarship money. I know you can do it Okay, I promise I'll try harder I pat her on the back think you can handle a 14-hour drive to come home for the holidays There's going to be some treacherous ice roads to cross. And don't even get me started on the paranormal occurrences Well, it'll be worth it. If I get to see you. my eyes immediately well up with tears Dad don't cry Sorry, I'm just I'm just proud of you. You're all grown up and your such a good person...(incomprehensible mumbling) Dad stop you're gonna make me cry too It's too late honey. It's happening. Dad I can't get tears in my burrito my rito It's gonna make it taste sad pull the man in for a hug and kiss around the for love you kiddo Love you too. Pops. Oh Team Iplier away, ohh. OH Dad.

Ever since the first time we hung out I've been trying to get up a little early for runs. I don't think I'm gonna be embarrassed as last time Maybe I'll even be able to catch up with him now Tap out a message. I'm on Dad books. Yo, what up CraAAig? Been training on the run game. Ready for round two. Oddly enough, I have also been training on my run game look at for miles Dude! Of course! Emojis!

What's that? Oh? You run, and then you get brunch. Oh? Right Greg and I agree to meet at a time in the morning And I have a chance to spend the evening hanging out with Amanda So we doing pizza tonight again can we do like salad night You want a health kick oh?

Fine. Don't worry about it craig will forgive me. Maybe yeah Craig will forgive me Committee spill out the committee isn't back with this finding yet. There's a multi-year assessment on Several bureaucratic levels well Amana picks up the phone and stares at me unblinking as she dials hi Yes Can I get an extra large pizza with chicken bacon extra cheese and tomatoes and a couple of the garlic sauce cops man?

You're gonna be able to keep up with him pet no Probably not we laugh anymore ah ah then he's probably healthy in the name of carbo-loading I call him night early so that I'm ready for tomorrow When I first started running in the mornings, it was pretty hellish now that I'm a few sessions And admittedly has become a little bit easier despite. It always ending Give me dry heaving over a trash. Can that what the runners is just dry heaving I lace up my tennis shoes throw on a t-shirt from the writers summoned I went to 20 years ago and head out the door a time a jug kraig is already outside with River strapped his chest And that babies getting sick. He's dressed head-to-toe in color coordinated running gear wow I look like a total slob next to this guy. I think anyone would look like a total schlub next to that guy. Hey, bro Morning Craig Rivers gonna be running with us. Yes, you can we're taking it to the limit aren't we kiddo? We've laid oh I know what you that means craig hands are stuffed toy. Which makes a smile ear to you That's Arnold the capybara sometimes is the only thing that'll get her to stop crying Oh, I've been there man a stuffed panda that she carried around everywhere She would have a tantrum if we even tried to wash it. It's gross Do you even running lately every morning for 30 minutes? I'm basically an elite athlete at this point, huh? Well, I'll try to keep up where we added. I think that we can do a couple laps around the park okay? That sounds reasonable, then we'll do some hill climbs up a slope Okay, I can probably handle that double closed it off by doing some wilderness survival hike running to increase our agility that will jump off Into the Ocean to swim with the Sharks punch you dick. It'll be all right cool Buh go through the Sahara desert for about thirteen fortnight's I will have a good time over there traversing off as I malayan mountains I'm suddenly struck with the overwhelming need to crawl back into bed. That sounds okay to you, right? I usually like to throw sometimes Murder Sprints in there But I'll go easy on you since you're a beginner so murder Sprint's you say I know what that is and how nice that sounds that? That sounds like something. I'm able to physically do great. Let's get started Okay, cool Greg and I finally arrived at the park a few other lone joggers make their way around the perimeter and river waves Enthusiastically of everyone we pass so a lot more peaceful in the morning's aside from bird chirping and river gurgling away in the stroller It's pretty quiet Roller stroller Patroller where's said Stroller all right. Good warm-up Let's start the show Wait Greg reaches into his bag and toss me a water bottle. I fumble it, but thankfully don't drop it.

Oh There we go you bet Greg takes me to a separate portion of the park here where there's a still Steep climb that seems to go up forever. I strained my eyes to see some other joggers at the top So what do we do now? We run up the thing that? That looks like a lot mark There's two things you need to know about this hill one. Don't stop running till you get to the top and two? It points to the top of the hill. That's not the top okay, now it's good time for the aw ah I finally reached the top of the hill after making My way past what I originally thought was the top of the hill once there hunched over to my knees and gasps for air My lungs are like daggers poking my ribs. I can feel my heart in my ears Yeah, river. I'm having a moment, please oh Greg looks like he's taking a beating as well, so we use human or quit your arms on your head and stretch out your elbows It'll help you breathe better. I do its craig says it feels a little better But I'm still in agony, and here greg tossing me the water bottle again a hydrate like my life depends on it Thanks, dude, but now I'm gonna work you feel that lightness in your head.

What's wrong sweet pea you want to play with Arnold greg looks around us Oh boy, man down. I think we loved Arnold River Keeps whaling I've abandoned my child Kind of fine dude should be simple right we just got to retrace our steps Remember River house having it at the bottom of the Hill great And I jog down the path the searching high and low for the stuff Capybara which Craig takes the time to explain to me as a large rodent native to South America Get to the place where river might have dropped it, but it's still nowhere to be found Looks like we've got a mystery on our hands I have to get to the bottom of this I suspect foul play looks like this is a prime case for world Renowned detective equally error the newest a blare Dude, it's time for a bro venture a pro venture We high-five and decide to jog back to the park to see if we can find any lead So it looks like there's a couple more places you're checking some bros around here. They'll get interrogate some good wait Who's good? Cop who's bad cop? Take it out for a second here from your back I think that with your stature and overall resilience you would make an Intimidating bad cop but on the other hand you do have an adorable baby strapped to your chest So that softens the edges of it all valid points I think you'd make a great good cop because you're congenial attitude and willingness to try new things But then again see now you get when there are too many commercial breaks during the show So you have the potential to be a scary bad cop I don't have to Watch meet Helen three minute segments of five minute commercials in between loud commercials are too. Loud. I drive every driver Hey case in point. Let's play a Moment-by-moment. I'll be bad. Cop So where do you protective? Oh yeah, go to the woods? Good boys. Let's go to the woods Don't know why? why are we in the woods we make our way to the oscars of the park there are a couple of benches by the dense tree line looks like Roberts been here all by himself it also seems like the perfect place to look for clues Interrogate Robert Robert Excuse you Megara hair oh, hi.

Anyway a dead deuced where we should go next God go to the Fields we wander out of the grass field the center of the park during the whole lot to see but there a few figures camped Out on a blanket And the grass could hold any number of Secrets madame Carmencita Soccer-Mad and his daughter carmen see the spots out from across the way she's sitting down the dad on son a green patch grass we jogged over ah Hey, bro we just sat down for a picnic once and snacks and I think to increase my glycogen reserves uh uh Have apple slices.

Don't let them win. Shake off the thought I saw a couple of squirrels over by that tree I don't know if that helps but if you want to see some cute squirrels, you should definitely check it out Thanks for the hot squirrels tip Tip Carmencita night well we better get moving got to find that capybara before the river as a breakdown Good luck let's get some apples for the road.

Oh all right fine, men check out the squirrels cool squirrels What did the suspects say the squirrels would be tree uh-huh there? They are? Yeah, Carmencita was telling the truth is some rats squirrels river seems Happy this may have bought us some extra time all right any clues see can't seem to find them while I'm looking Craig calls me out from across field mart hi. I jogged over craig is kneeling in the grass inspecting something I approached my herd my throat as I leaned over craig. I see it. This is Arnold I Put my hand over rivers eyes. No one should have to be subjected to this senseless violence my God Or what do this? I don't know I think we might be dealing with something Beyond our grasp I can't look at this anymore turn around trying to wipe the image of stuffing strewn across the ground from my mind How we're running out of time? We may already be too late? Bagged and tagged it let's keep moving back to the field Clock's ticking dude, we're going next This is the big Kahuna. Ain't it.

I could get back You know silky dough. Thanks for your help Robert go deeper into the Earth visit This is the one let me say just in case of work to the purge in Which I stare into the depths of the forest who knows what could be in there Are you prepared for what we might face in there? Not at all on second thought. I think they might be able to smell the fear on me Maybe we should give that in a minute to dissipate seconded the woods. Oh Wait, no hang on. No that's not what I wanted yeah, I'm ready ready partner, bro you know, but if you give Rivers to stop crying I don't care let's do this we'll start down the path into the woods keeping their eyes and ears peeled for any sign of Arnold Words anywhere, the silence is unsettling the sun can barely peek through the canopy. It's colder here Suddenly we hear voices. I want to do it You're gonna do it last time I come to a clearing where I find Kristen Christina kneeling over something Right there criminal Scum for your tiny hands where we can see him? Kristen and Christie just stare at us you heard the guy put your hands up, okay in the middle of something here. Yeah Can you come back later you kids doing cutting stuff up?

I worked up brunch. Give me brunch I have a strong philosophies on Brunch You see the first thing you do is divide your brunch is between boozy brunch and upper-class and the most is eggs Benedict brunch and Grimy brunch, then give me a coffee and bacon cheesy hash Browns brunch There's time in a place for both, and I think most of life is figuring out which one Some kind of brunch dad are you mark God give me a grimy brunch every any day?

She's so cute. How you? done Hey, kid Middle school is gonna be real tough, but if you make it through then you can make it through anything The weight just walks away after winking at Craig seems like you're the most eligible Dad and Bachelor town Okay, so anywhere. Here's the thing about brunch You don't do business during brunch brunch is a time for rest relaxation and restoration with those that you love While we're having brunch at a traditional ebro time the most important thing to remember is that brunch isn't a time?

I don't know what British speak means! *Mark gets drunk* Corn, cookie, and pretzel soup. Naturally artificial. Is it a never-ending loaf of bread? Oooh my God it iiiiiis Oh my God! It never ennnnnds! French Bot: It is a 1984 vintage. Eh? I wish to have it prepared. Mark: Ew! It looks delicious! What happens if I put olive oil in a cup? Would you like that? I mean you're French,
you wouldn't know the difference, huh? *INTENSE MUSIC* Waiter Bot: We got three bots out here to ordered the special... Mark: I'm going to be exactly uncreative. Sriracha on a potato...

["Not much seems to be known,"] [narrator: "But I think I got a good lead so far. A couple of days ago, I was sent something in the mail,"] Uh-huh? [narrator: "And I was told what was inside may be of interest to me."] Uh-huh? [narrator: "Finally, after sorting out all the rest of the junk mail I got,"] Uhhh? [narrator: "I opened this one, and to my pleasure saw some very intriguing things inside."] [narrator: "On the outside was a note that said,"] [narrator: "This once belonged to my grandfather,  who worked at Fredbear's." [narrator: "He disappeared soon after and this was all that was left of him."] [narrator: "New information is always great, and it's even better with a story attached."] [narrator: "I rumbled inside the letter and to my amazement, I found a key to the entrance of Fredbear's Family Diner."] [narrator: "I'm thinking that the person's grandfather may have worked here as a night guard or something, by the chip attached to the key."] [narrator: "As of right now I am planning on visiting the old establishment soon,"] [narrator: "and see what I can do with what was sent to me."] [narrator: "If anyone has any clues to who this grandfather character is, leave a reply below."] [narrator: "I really am interested in knowing who this person is, really."] [narrator: "Max Donovan,"] [narrator: "paranormal investigator."] All right, well, you're gonna die! I know that for a f- whaaaa? Investigation 1- these are so well-made! That's the thing about like all these-

There's a lot of love that's been put into these. Look at this shit! I got a backp-  [narrator: "Nope, that won't work."] I didn't try anything! ["Nope, that won't work."] Okay, alright, whatever you say! I am outie! Okay, but there's so much, like,  love put into these games, It's shocking. All right, let's go into here. I'm probably gonna die... [chuckling nervously] Choose the keys, I guess? Hi-yah! That's really cool. [markiplier reading] "The pup-" I didn't read that!!! Where am I?! Who am I?! Why are you?! Who's there? Hello. Okay, what have you got for me? Ohh. Well that's a comforting sound. Ahh. Ohh. Okay. Dive headfirst into the fan? Okay. That's an option. What is the growling?! Huh?! Wanna explain to me what the growling is?! Huh? Hmm. All right. Mm-kay. All right , I don't know what you want, but I'll wander around this place. Ahhh! Oh. Whyyyy-? Wai-, whoa, I see someone's doing kung fu back there! Wait a minute. Is that just - is that just the dust cloud, or am I seeing something going wibbity-woobity in the back? I coulda sworn I saw someone going wibbity-woobity. Alright, time to go forward, I gue- [sudden steam escaping hiss] Why- FUCKING STEAM! God dammit! You sack o' tits. YOUUUU sack o' TITS! Oh, you're a big bunch o' ass! All right. Fine then. Got blasted in the ass with steam. I don't think that key's gonna work- [narrator: "Nope that won't work."] Shocking. I know. Who'da thought it wouldn't work? Man, this is cool! I've got to admit this- this is legitimately cool. This is really cool! Huh-? Heard the thumpy. I'll try this here. I don't know what this is. It worked, apparently! I don't know. Oh, OHHhhh! It's a flashlight. Ahh. [chuckling] Well. I got myself a key, and now I am going to use it here. It's so awesome. It's like a point-and-click adventure game! It's so cool! HEYYYY. You don't need to be so thumpy, ya door! Uh, whaaa... It's quiet... Oh, there we go! The comforting noises of madness. All right. Hello... How about a flashlight? K-chunk-a... [narrator: "Nope, that won't work."] All right, that won't work then, apparently. OH THAT- All right! I think I fixed it! Not a hundred percent sure, but I think I fixed it! All right, let's go down the- I DID see something going wibble-wobble in the- HI! [distress giggling] Can I shine you with a flashlight? [narrator: "Nope, that won't work."] All right, I guess this is normal! Ah yes. I love this. It's my favorite show! Hello... Oh. Oh, it is my favorite show! OH! Oh. Okay. [increasingly agitated] Why hi. Hello! Hi. What am I doing? And why?! I'm not sure. I don't... I don't fully understand... What I'm doing here. Okay. [unsettled chuckling] Nothin'! Just fiddle-diddling with my flashlight. I have no idea. [squeak] Okay? I... What is- what am I- hello? All right... Hello! How ya doin'? Welcome to the... all right- [Loud screamy jumspcare noise!] Ahhhhh! [laughing] Wh-a-a-a-at? [still laughing] What did you want from me?! What could you have possibly wanted from me? What was the POINT of that?! I'm a paranormal investigator! I don't watch a puppet show! Mmm. Aahhhh. Okay, so the answer is, gotta... flash 'em. Wh- h- hey! I s- [Loud screamy jumpscare noise!] [laughing] Wh-h- I just... don't get it! That's all, just- I don't get it. I just don't get it. All right, see ya! See ya, have a good day! Have a good day...

Okay, so I'm supposed to peekaboo the puppets, but not the puppet... The puppet-suh, but not the puppet. All right, thank you! I don't know. This is a good show... it's a great ... show... I got nothing else to say besides how good the show is... It's really good. Love it even. All right, well, you keep peek-a-booing me. I ain't gonna change! I'm just as handsome as I was before! Okay, peek-a-boo! I see you- Okay, all right... I see... Hello? Hi. I'm fine. My name is Markipl- Oh, okay. All right. Hi! Hello. My name is Markiplier. I'm- [sigh] I'm...

All right, we did it! All right! Good job everybo- [phone ringing] Ohh, hey. How's it goin'? [phone ringing] Ohhh kay, all right... [answering machine noise] Well, hahaha... [answering machine voice: "Hello there, new night guard, and welcome to my establishment!"] Okayyyyy... [answering machine: "(laughing) I'm just messing with you, Henry!"] [answering machine: "I'll give you the quick rundown on how the animatronics and the building systems you requested actually function."] [answering machine: "First up you have your cameras up front."] [answering machine: "Activate them by pressing SPACE on the keyboard in front of you."] [answering machine: "You can press  S to exit back out."] [Markiplier sound] [answering machine: "I took the liberty to go into some state of the art tech for us here."] [answering machine:  "A screen that can detect your fingers' locations with invisible lasers..."] [answering machine: "Pretty fancy stuff. "] [answering machine: "Anyway,  touch a ??? on your buttons to switch cameras."] [answering machine: "Any room with a green triangle can be selected..."] [answering machine: "....even the vents."] "Now you also have your alarm and air-refresh buttons." "For now you'll only need the alarm." "Pressing it will signal a bright, loud, and red alarm to ring in whatever room you have selected on the camera." "You can ring the alarm near your office by using the left shift key." "Now onto your animatronic buddies! Courtesy of me, of course." "Fredbear is up first. I gave him the role of power management, basically." "If he noticed a lack of people he will go into different rooms," "and try and find guests or staff members." "And if he decides the place is completely empty..." "He'll shut off the power." "Not something you want NOW, is it?" "Now, all you have to do is lead him to you." "He'll go after any noise. So whenever he's taking a break to take in any sounds or signals," "try ringing the alarms in nearby rooms," "leading him toward you a couple of times." "Once he's close enough, say Party Room 1," "then ring the alarm near your office." "That's the shift key, remember?" "Bonnie, however, is a bit of a different beast." "He'll wander around looking for intruders." "Normally, if you wear your guard uniform, he'll read a chip inside it and not register you as an intruder." "Howwwever, you didn't exactly..." "...fit..." "the last guard's uniform, so until you can tailor yourself a new one, just try to avoid any contact with him." "But if he does manage to enter your office, try..." "...and stay..." "...completely..." "still." "One of his parameters for checking if someone's human is if it moves." "Thusly, if you stay completely still, he..." "...probably..." "won't register you a human," "and thus not as an intruder." "All right!" "Hope you got all that. Good luck, and I'll see you tomorrow!" Okay! I don't understand any of it, or why. Why do I need to bring them to me? Why do I need to bring them to me? I d- I don't- Who is there? Oh, is that a poster? I don't know what's happening. I- I'm very confused! Sir? Get up! Call 9-1-1? Hello? Can you help you? All right! Can't do that. I have no idea what I'm doing. I- I literally have no idea- whoa, hey I can mo-o-o-ove. I can move! All righty then! That's not good. Hey! Uh... Ring rong! Oh, that's... weird... [imitating steam noise] p-sshhhhh Oh, they're 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠. I don't know what that 𝙢𝙚𝙖𝙣𝙨. [Distressed noises] Fire in the kitchen! Hello? Mmmm. Okay! All right. Well, I might be boned. I might be. I might be expressly, completely boned. Ooh! Hello, hi! Ring Rong?? Hello? Hi! Oh, that's weird! I'm not the free-roam, you guys are the free roam! Oh that's real good. That's real good. Well, hey. [Animatronic clanking in background] Oh, hello! Oh, excuse you... please back up. Nope! Uh-uh, nooo, nope! Nope! Uh-uh. 𝓝𝓸𝓹𝓮 [Giggling] I'm gonna go with a big ol'- All right! See ya. [high-pitched] Oo-kaaAAAYYYYYY! All RIGHT! 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐝 I- A- [powering down sound] Oooooooh... [whispering] welp.  𝒔𝒉𝒊𝒕 [whispering] I don't know what's happening. Or why. Oh! Hello! [Music begins to play] That's a problem. That's a big problem. That's a problem, and I'm gonna thunkle a solution to this problem. But can you give me a few more minutes? 'Cause I can't come up with no s- s'lution... Anyway Just gonna accept my fate. Gonna accept my fate. Look at ya. Yup. I am dead. Probably dead. Very dead. I'm dead now. All right, well, see ya. I'M BRACED. I'M SO- [jumpscare scream] [sighing] Ahhh.... Damn. Damn, son. Where'd you get that? But anyway that is all the time I have for Five Nigh- Final Nights 4. I gotta move onto the next game here. Oh, boy. [music box in Freddy playing] Oh boy. [still playing] Yeah, seems about right... Oh, it's All Star! ♬  Don't stop coming - fed to the rules and I hit the ground running - didn't make sense not to live for fu- ♬ [Windows error noise] [Giggling] Wait, what? What? "What Dayshift at Freddy's 1 ending will you continue from?" [Giggling harder] I don't-! What?! I had no idea what this game was, so I have no idea! I'm just gonna pick random. I would like Gnarl- Oh soapy sounds real good. Man, I should have played DSAF1, I guess, but nah, too late. Ohh. [Quietly giggling] Hi! Hi Phone Guy! [Phone guy stammering] No... [Mark reading] "Welcome to the new and improved Freddy's!" [Mark reading] "Thank you for responding! Most people don't want to work here after what happened at the old location." [Mark reading] "Are the rumors true?" I don't know what rumors, but are the rumors true? [Phone guy stammering] [Mark reading] "No, nothing could be further from the truth!" [Phone guy sputtering] [Mark reading] "Fredbear wasn't even in Reno on June 24th. That is propaganda spread by those Candie's Burgers and Chips asshole-" [Phone Guy] "Oh, wait." [Mark reading] "Wait did you mean the last location? Oh yeah. I guess so." [Phone guy stammering] [Mark reading] "Essentially we're hiring you here to work the day shift." [Mark reading] "You'll be wearing mascot suits, delivering pizza, cleaning up messes, all that kind of stuff." [Mark reading] "You ever work in one of these joints before?" [Mark partly reading] "I worked in Colorado... I worked at Fre-" Why? Why??? Hah- This is really in-depth... I am out of my element. All right... [reading] "I worked at the sister location filled with doggos." That sounds like me. [Phone guy] "Well, you know..." 
[Mark reading] "I'm terribly sorry. I don't know what the company was thinking the la- that time." [reading] "Let's put only random doggos in a location!" [reading] "All it was for one doggo to start barking..." [reading] "We had to ship the leftover doggos to as many locations as possible," [reading] "meaning we kinda have random doggos roaming around most locations." [Phone Guy] "Well, you know." [Mark reading] "You seem to know what you're doing! Our grand reopening is tomorrow, you know..." [reading] "Today is a trial day of sorts to make sure the robots work and most of them don't catch fire." [reading/stumbling] "The trans- the trash file - the trash pile may combust." [Phone guy] "Uh... whatever."
[Mark reading] "So..." [reading] "Would you like a small tour so you can see what you got..." [reading] "...around the day shift?" [reading] "Just a short tour, all right?" [reading] "Sure thing! I'll only show you the most vital stops." Now let us depart! [reading] "Welcome to the show stage! This is one of the areas where you can perform with our brand new robots." [reading] "That chicken looks oddly... promiscuous." Eh, I don't wanna... say nothing about that chicken, but uh, [lip smacking noises] [reading] "Yeah, if you ask me the company is asking for troubles," [reading] "giving a robot those hips." [reading] "Imagine if foxy had hips like that..." [reading] "*ahem*" I don't wanna imagine that. I don't wanna imagine that at all, actually. I don't wanna even closely imagine that. [Phone Guy] "So..."
[reading] "This is the Prize Corner!" [reading] "Our groovy clerk Matt will exchange all tokens you give him for cool prizes." "Isn't that neat?" "Another thing you've got to do here is wind up a music box over in the Prize Corner." [Phone Guy] "These things happen sometimes."
[Mark reading] "That white-" [reading] "That white circle on the top-left of your screen indicates how urgent it is that you wind up the box." "If you let it wind all the way down, IT comes out." Uhhh... "W- What is it?" "Oh, that doesn't matter." All right... "All that matters is that you don't let the box wind all the way down." "Please. For everyone's sake." All right. "What is that noise?" [Phone Guy] "These things happen sometimes." [Mark, reading] "That's the mangle." "Basically too many people yiffed the damn fox." "So we made it less sexy, but someone keeps tearing it apart." "I'm pretty sure it's Dave." "I'm too lazy to put it back together," "and the company can't afford a technician." "We spent all of our moolah building these terrible plastic abominations." "So we sorta just use it as a take apart-put back together attraction." "It's easier than actually trying to talk to Dave." "Believe me, it's easier." Is Dave the purple guy...? [reading] "Wait... the restrooms have cameras in them!" That's... "We've gotta put them in there! Ever since what happened in Seattle." "Seriously, who knew that Freddy could do so much damage with just a urinal and a blow-torch?" [laughs] I don't want to know that story. I really don't, actually. "Now that we're in the office, we can start our job interview!" "So what's your name?" All right... Oh. Ah! Okay, sure! My name is... my name is... Fr.... Free... Free.... My name is Freemp. Freemple... Freemplton. I'm sorry, I misspelled my name. My name is Freempltn. I remember that name from Colorado Past crime and related activity we're both aware of what I did We are both aware of what I did with oxy Oh, yeah, look the plastics is the past is the past is the past? But frankly the newer plastic models might be too fragile for that especially the trash pile. They are literally They're literally made of dildo material though Yeah, I told them making robotics out of plastic and latex was a crummy idea do you have any medical issues? We should know about ah There's blood sometimes I cough out battle pieces. I have the gown, I'm Sexually attracted to robots look just keep your smacking No one keeps free Putin smacking wepper and free Putin's briefs You know one and yet won't pay yo seems urines acceptable medical condition now Since you've worked for freddy's you've already signed our contract.

You are fair and just I Don't feel good about myself. No, I don't I don't feel good about myself. No oddly enough No, I think you're I think your summary reason of my existence is absolutely correct if I if I had to imagine what would be? Written on my gravestone. It would be you sick fuck so I think I'm gonna leave this one there. That is God it's like five minutes of fuckboys really is Anyway, that is day shift at Freddy's and that is only Game two of this adventure, so uh huh oh? Very nice, okay Oh Okay, I didn't know what I was looking at it was purple guys sitting at a table whoa Hi welcome to the party. Okay. All right. Well. I guess that's just Alright, let's get into this. Are you sure new game fairly sure This is weird this is so stylized I Don't know what's happening. Is that a dumpster? Is that a back alley somewhere is that important there seems to be some purple pants and shoes hanging out of a dumpster? Not a very elegant way of hiding a body, but you did your best I suppose 12 next earlier 12 Oh Eee, okay alright, I don't understand. Hello? Hello, hello? Whooa, okay Alright, control in front of the computer... [Phone guy, distorted]: Hello? Hello, Hello? It appears I've found you. It's worth a try so Your name's J - Joh, John? I think it's John. Well my name is Peter, and I'm a former lifeguard for Freddy Fazbears, and as far as I know, you've never met me, but you're just as deep in this as me. Every survivor I can find can help us to get out of here, so  I'm gonna try and keep you alive John I can't protect you, but I might have some useful information on what to do if THEY wake up. By they I'm talking about your uh, your "childhood friends." Now before you start questioning me. How you could meet them after they were killed back in the 80s. There's a pretty simple answer You're dead John. No. I'm not joking. I'm unsure of how you died But I know that you definitely made a mistake by doing so. I think I should probably explain myself here So so let me hurry up You might have already noticed that this place probably looks familiar to you There's a good reason for that. This is Fredbear's family diner, kind of To be exact it's an eternal purgatory your memory shaped the place so for you it probably looks like a mix of wherever you last worked or lived in Freabear's. On that you're pretty well You could have done a much worse look for this place in your head, but that's trivia You don't even know what you do need to know is that this eternal purgatory Could potentially be escaped from and then I have a plan on how to do so however Assist me on this. It's not quite ready I'll explain it to you tomorrow, but for now it's an important step for you to look onto the office table It's a fan that is located next to you and get the audio tape that is in there out of it You will need this if you want to escape from here However, it appears that we are really running short on time, and I should really hurry and explain What to do against your friends if any of your friends come to your Security office you're gonna experience them from a more hostile side See I currently don't know exactly what happened to them, but I know something really weird must've happened to their spirits. They're Pretty messed up and broken and I don't think they're very mentally stable See what I noticed when encountering them earlier when I was still the only normal person here Was that upon putting their side on me? The only way to make them wander off is to hide from them Now the only way to really hide from them in your case probably is just getting out of sight from the door through here So if you see anybody in them run somewhere that as far away from the doors as possible I don't think anyone's active tonight, but I could be wrong. There's this really weird daily cycle of activity So I'm going after that. I might have gotten it wrong a little so don't rely on too much on me And I think that's everything for now I'm not entirely sure if your friends would be hostile towards you, but I can't throw the idea out I don't think they'll be able to remember you at all really all the early one is Dammit, I need to go right now or Orleans gonna find me I'll get back to you later Mark: Okay, alright. I don't understand anything. That's happening here I am 100 percent lost and I just don't know and I don't know and what was on the table What were you tal- I collected the tape. Okay. Alright. That doesn't sound good Why? Hello Okay, alrighty, then I don't understand What happenin. hmm Alrighty then... This is weird. I'm dead? I'm dead. I'm? Why is that? There's nothin? huuuaaa [Mumbling incoherently] I don't like that Ooh, whoa, hey, whoo, hey, whoo, hey, okay- Hey, oh! Hi! Fred-mangle. Mangle-Freddy. Oh! Okay, all right. I don't understand anything about that, but I'm dead,okay? I'm dead and this is purgatory? This purgatory??? Ohhh uh oh I saw that [panicked stammering] [door creak] [Panicked stammering, this time Louder™] Hello? Friend? Ooh... Okay. Alright, well, alright, then I am fine. Everything is fine Ooh, ahh Okay alright I Oh, uhoh That's not good. That's not good. Oh boy. That's the opposite of good. I don't like any of this. I- I have sworn that I saw... Uhoh [Panic] No no no! That's not what I wanted! Ohh, no. Ohhh Ahh Okay Hey, hey, hey, hey, watcha moving around heavy metal for? You doing something to Foxy over there? Huh? You doing some you shouldn't be doing? Eugh My purgatory- That's not good, so What's the point- uh oh, you know what- oh, no, that's... I saw you on the thing... I don't like that So what's the point of looking at the cameras? There's no one there after me? euhh No no no no That's not what I- that's not what I- hey, that's not what I wanted oh Oh Okay alright, I'm not gonna complain about it. Yeah, you've unlocked characters... characters This is really well done. This is pretty- pretty impressive. It's because they need what inside of you My theory on why these ghosts turned into animatronics And that's someone or something made an attempt of manifesting them into physical bodies out of thin air It sounds impossible, right? Yeah. That's the thing. Whoever made the attempt failed. Most likely horribly. That's why all these characters look so weird and broken so in order to fix themselves They possibly need a way bigger plasma source, and I think that's where you come You're an unarmed adult ghost which makes you a potential meal for them. They don't see us as humans, John. They only see us as a chance for survival Can we really blame them for it? Question leaving a message not actually talking to you Dude yourself together bro well moving on I think only one character is gonna become active tonight and that is the bear character I cannot identify I have no idea. What exactly he is, but it appears as a manifestation was someone fruitful He seems to be glitching in and out of existence Which is why I dubbed him "Am I Real?" Clever, right? Yeah... Not really. You really need to keep an eye on that guy though or else you're gonna run into massive problems If he's fixed and clean you're absolutely fine. If he's broken, on the other hand, watch him for a few seconds. He should turn back to normal. If you don't keep him normal. He's gonna really hurt you Now remember that plan I mentioned. Yeah, you do. This plan is a still a work in progress. And I don't have everything ready yet, however. I'm pretty sure that there's more audiotapes like the one you, hopefully, picked up from the recorder yesterday 
- uhuh And they're going to appear in a different camera every night If you see it click on it with that now the old computer in your room, and you'll probably obtain it now I'm leaving it up to you. Don't waste too much time listening to this. He might already be active. He? Hi, Bonnie! Ok bye, Bonnie. oh excuse me all right, so I need to look in the in the in the computer monitors for these things? I need to look in the computer monitors. Is that what you're saying? so how- How does that work exactly? How does that work? Hi Yoy? Yoy?! Yoy. Yoy?! Yoy. Yoy. Did you say yoy or yoooooooour? Yoy? Don't know what yoy means. Yoy hoy meenoy. I know what Yoy hoy meenoy means I don't know what yoy means. I see nothing. I see a whole lot of nothing. It's a whole lot of nothing. Just a meehoy menoy here. Did you drop your hat. Is that a cake? Is that for me? yoy meenoy. Alright well. anyway You have good day now - OH - OH - ah Okay, thanks for the heads up. Thank you for that for the alert I don't think yoy, yoy is not a- uh oh. That's not good. I should probably look, huh Probably look, huh Looks I don't feel good about looking. Oh hello. You are you doing me few shooing? Homie homie me no homie, homie annoy Me boy, you mean oh, I don't know where that Goddamn tape is I just don't know oh hi oh That's not good. That is the opposite of good Okay, well, I don't know. I don't know I don't know I Don't know I'm looking I'm not seeing though. I don't see nothing oh, I don't see nothing Okay, well there's bad. Oh oh Hi hello, okay good ah that's not I'm not gonna look at that Mmm Okay, all right, then well. I don't the doorbell okay. That's gone now. All right everything's fine apparently barely, everything's fine Whoa? No, not that not that that's not what I wanted. Oh, oh I win Yeah All right, let's carry onon why not? Nice hello, hello. Hello, who's that? Okay, I'm back. I'm gonna hurry. This time mostly cuz they're probably pretty active right now now There's this big mess of parts and stuff Dez appeared only after you first arrived It appears to have four lamps in it and for some reason. It's full of sharp teeth It looks like something straight out of a goddamn horror attraction of the u.s. Anyway, once it's assembled all of the parts. It is going to appear on your ceiling whoa I think the best way to just keep it away is to look at donuts up there so make sure to do that it Dislikes being watched yeah Oh, yeah Remembers a plasma source issue the old plasma source that was used to create these messed up ghosts is uh it's still around here If it's there play dead Instantly look at the ceiling and do absolutely nothing until you hear it walk away That's pretty much. The only way to keep it out get it. It doesn't like other ghosts It's pretty interesting it appears to want back what's theirs? well, I'm gonna leave you to it and don't forget about collecting the tape I Can't find the tapes. I don't know where they are. I don't know what you want from me. What about what about my plasma? I don't know why it wants my plasma. Huh is it trying to sell me hmm? Don't like any of this yeah, oh Okay, all right. Goodbye, then. I don't know what you why am I supposed to look at the ceiling so much I'm supposed to play dad So it's like the same mechanics for two different things, but I don't know which ones which Well like it like none of this okay? Hi, okay, well that's not good Mmm. All right. That's weird Okay, that was really weird Mmm. That's not oh no not that no I didn't like that Most but Please don't take my goo you took my goo. Didn't you you took my goo? Ah? Yeah, it was a ghost ghost ghost ooh there. There's a ghost ectoplasmic goo all right that is Dormant abbess that is pretty good. No. It's different. It's definitely differently a lot of these things the the fascinating thing about it is they? They all come from a different perspective of the same genre And yet they all take some really unique Interesting ideas to it very good I like and by the way I didn't mention it, but all the links to the games are available in the description down below So if you want to play any of these you can and should they are down there all right next up jolly three Oh That's cool. Oh That's so cool. Oh That's so cool That is really cool. That's not gonna line that is really cool. All right. Let's do this. I'm ready I'm ready. Please scare me so good. Please scare me No Yeah Damn oh Good god That was one hell of an intro Not bad not bad at all not bad Alright, uh hello. Do you hear me? No. I do not all right, so you should be facing the main security office Doesn't know a security office, huh? It's more of a control room if you ask me mm-hmm. Okay. You know what to do I don't get in it's more facts and get out pretty simple, right well Not if you don't know what you're doing. I don't know what I'm doing I Don't know. I don't know Wow Wow I don't know what I'm doing oh oh oh oh okay, I Love in front of you. I love you excrete gas that fry animatronic circuits Oh Now you know This little link screams gasps. There's enough supply for them Yeah, if you run out of gas you open up the camera and click the little red icon you thought by corner This is the maintenance screen. Yeah a bunch of things you need to keep track of Is gas supply? Once the gas supply is empty. You could refill it by clicking and holding the refill button when you excrete gas You will lose oxygen and your body will try to intake much faster temporarily And this will cause the oxygen supply to go down for this, but they'll automatically fill itself But these applies mango broken and you'll need to fix them to face gaston click Repair to automatically repair it now you may notice these spinning fans in the screen heat room in this building has fans These fans may break from time to time and you'll need to fix them to fix a fan click on the room But the broken pane and click the button repair fan now the poem is You won't know what band is broken The facility used to have two feature where you know what fan is broken but That means you have to go to every camera until you're on the road with the broken fan If you don't prepare them your vision may go slowly dark these fans excrete oxygen from outside But don't worry your vision will completely don't All right, I think that's it for tonight I don't know like what we're doing Oh Hi, hi Hello, hello Well, I'd like that alright. Well. This is wonderful That's not good oh Boy alright I don't know. I don't know Panic I'm panicking should I panic it's panic iguana what to do? Oh, no. There's another animatronic out. I don't know what that matter On the way to me will and that just a wonderful Okay alright, okay, I think I understand so when they get to me when they get over to me I need to use the gas to be able to disable them, so I need to know which ones coming I Said boys dress it up. I cannot jump it up I am crying to cash it up I am I Think that's bug I Have no idea Wow Wow What the hell What in the heck am all right, okay? This is this is legitimately cool This is super well made and I can already see that there's a lot of depth to it And there's a lot of reason to look at the camera because you want to know which fan Is gonna be the one that's gonna cause problems for you? Yeah, yeah, that's true okay, so Both of these guys are still there. I need to make sure that my gas supply is always full and Ready to rock and then I need to keep an eye on which fan is the one that's lowest So that I can always stay ahead of the curve seems like this one this one this one are already low all right hello Hello, okay. Good good good. Oh my god. This is regarding Nicolas Okay, I just wanna I may not even be able to beat the first night I may not be able to beat the first night, but I'm gonna try my damnedest to be able to do that Man this is just so much stuff that you need to look at it's just like camera after camera after camera and there's so much Stuff happening in the backgrounds of each camera like what the hell is that shit? I mean these are obviously slightly different animatronics than what we're used to and Top a lot of work has been put into this. No joke about that. You're still there. You're still there my gas Supply is apparently good Where do I even see the time? Is there any location with which to see the time because I don't see that Oh 2 a.m. To a 100 That sounds low or maybe it's the same speed. It's always been, but seeing this minutes tick by like that is move fun No now they're being really easy on me All right, well, I guess I shouldn't complain okay that one's almost dead It looks like this one's about to fail which is okay, cuz I know which one No not that one shit shit, which one which one which one oh, no wait, that's a different thing Oh Shit oh shit, I don't know what that is I Can't breathe okay I don't know eyes are broken fan. Oh Oh, I saw a shadow some oh. Oh okay. That's what I needed to do Ah Aha I want to mention There's something very different about this game compared to a lot of five nights at freddys fan games like if you told me That this one was made by Scott and I didn't know it I think I'd lean towards believing it because it has has this sort of polished feel to it from the sound to the music to all the different variety of rooms to the tightness of the mechanics to the the punchiness of the actions it Kind of does lead me to believe that this is really high quality stuff Hey, there's even Scott Caan's a little symbol over there This is legitimately high quality stuff that should not be overlooked it is legitimately quality I've said legitimate ly like ten bajillion times now, but this is good. This is really good Yeah, and I imagine that this is an animatronic that is gonna get up at some point later on who knows when Who knows when but it's gonna happen because there's three pathways that I can see right here And they all lead back to this room here So I just got to find out how to be able to beat them, and then I'm gonna be happy that fans low Fan fan fan fan fan fan and that phase real low on my break It's all gonna Bryce I knew it I knew it how did I know it that's different sounds fair? All right, we're filled we're full. I'm very full oh hi buddy. Hey, but in ski are you doing over there? Hey one of those fans in the break. I know it Right there goes which one there. It is there it is I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Okay. I got it all right. Where are you? Where are you, buddy? No, don't wave of me. I don't like that. Okay. God. This is a panic This is a kind of panic that I haven't felt from a lot of these fan games like like that's that's what I really love About that the five nights at Freddy's thing is like it gives you this sense of panic like especially in the beginning face when you don't know what you're doing gives you the sense of dread where you're just totally at a loss for everything and anything Oh God Right, but it's fun so far so good the fans are doing good I Don't know which one's gonna go down. This one's pretty low Are you there you are you're getting closer now when you get in here. You're not gonna be doing All right Huh I don't need to be so quick and spastic about it. I really don't but Okay, I'm gonna try my best shit fans gonna die right when I don't need it - That's not Everything's fine Everything's fine everything's fine. If if they're high, okay. I've got my gas I've got my ass And you're gonna turn into glass when you come in here. I've got a fist made of fuck and I'm a blue eyed fuck shit wait wait now Well the thing you didn't need my fist made it fuck alright, okay, did you back where you were supposed to be no oh Hi, hello you didn't go back as far as I thought you would You don't want to know what I'm gonna do with this fist if you come in here Yeah I know you can imagine all the ways that this is going to impact your day to day life But to be perfectly honest. I don't care about that right now. This is time, right? Okay, that doesn't sound good oh I don't want to go that way just something First okay, why why have I do that why am I do? Remember find something and get out quickly stay for too long and you're dead Got it. All right Why do I have to do this why can't you be on scouting duty dark? Ones Try finding the password-protected safe that I can hack into I'm trying my best man. I've got plungers you want plunger. I got done to plunge I got lots of plunge I'm trying to find him yes Try hacking into one of those oh I see We have to hurry I got this yeah What? I can't hack them safe. I need the safe port number, and you know anybody gets added through you Quickly phone isn't you a program? No. I don't want to do this It's welcome to the grid mm-hmm if you use your mouse to left-click on a box you'll create a pathway at right now If you get left clicking on the box you'll change the arrows direction Okay, I did it going whoa ah I heard a thing that's prob mm Nope, see don't don't like that. Don't like that at all I Do that I'd really don't want to Don't like that I have a bad feeling about this I Knew something was wrong whoa oh my god Holy shit, all right, I'm gonna leave this one here Holy shit good God Good God Mike cool That was amazing like I'm not I'm not being hyperbolic about it. That was legitimately amazing that was really really well done That was astonishingly well done. That was stupidly well done, and I didn't even scratch the surface of it That was so good That was like five nights at Or those like sister location on steroids that was ludicrously good man I Didn't think there was gonna be any of these that I was tempted to play all the way through, but this is one of them Easily easily, this is one that I would love to play through my god That was so good anyway. I'm gonna leave this one here Huh and I'm gonna move on to the last game in this series, so this one is called Bubba's diner now I don't know if this game is more serious than the other one I have no idea if this is a silly one or a serious one, but I'm gonna play it nonetheless I Don't know who Bubba is Bubba's diner was originally created on scratch as a way to occupy its creators boredom The Dining area the one you're at right now the toilets on your right to private party rooms right in front of you Back room to your left and the basement over in the party hall feel free to walk around and get to know the location but beware Time is passing you have until 6 a.m.. To conclude your task tonight You have only one use the printer while watching the location when you're ready go to the room on your left That's where you'll find your office, huh? So it's kind of like pizzeria simulator kind of thing going on here with Bubba An ax can I have that Can I have that I need that for stuff and things I need it to compliment my fist which is very good at one specific task All right What do we have here? Oh? Aha Windows 95 While you wait for the printer, what's the cameras in test animatronics? Yes test the program to go over this more noise That is where there's more people we let them walk around during some parts of the day the kids love them Anyway use the sound displays on the screens to make noise and learn them your room is noisy, too If you feel uncomfortable with the animatronics staring at you just getting away the different today. Have a good night way tomorrow Just kick them away Kisum what do I do - boy? They're moving? I don't Like that print some holster worn dot JPEG. Oh boy Oh boy press s to back ok alright ok I don't like this. I don't like this at all I Don't know what I'm doing, but I feel good about it. I don't feel good about this Oh, hey, whoa? Hey? Whoa whoa? Whoa whoa? That's right outside my door. I don't know what do you? Hide mm-hmm, that's not good well alright Well um something tells me there's something behind me hmm I Knew it. I knew that Anyway, it didn't seem like I was able to kick them back or kiss them back, so I don't know what you wanted from me Just get no way What does that mean? What do you mean get no way? That doesn't make any sense. What do you mean get no way? that doesn't make any sense it makes oh that makes ya get no just I don't don't get no way ah My ball I'm dead alright. I don't know what you want me to do. I can't do nothing Oh, whatever What happened why I don't know what what are you doing what I don't know what is causing them to go away ah Why I don't know What do you were? See that's the thing like this compared to the last game. It's funny This the difficulty curve of the last one seemed harder. There was a lot more things to do and yet this one I'm having more trouble with and it's more frustrating the other one I died a bunch But it was more satisfying because it felt like it was my fault Here, I just don't know what I'm doing I Think I'm maybe I'm starting to get it man, I don't know cuz I think if they're by my door They got to go back to the employee area, right Or if they're by my door they got to go back to the main lobby area if if I lure them there But it's not working with this guy see he's just coming in the door. No matter what new or Me homey no indeed oh Me horny Okay well, that's a difference so what does that mean? I don't even know if it's gonna be enough Cuz I think I was just gonna get behind alright. Oh yeah there he is he's right by my door god dammit, okay? I'm so close come on. I'm close. I think I don't know no I'm fucked No, I'm not Father knocked I'm the opposite of Fabra knocked eyed. I'm not fucked all right. Okay, all right, okay? What do I do this task is done? All right? Okay, okay All right, I'm all done here well So that explains that I guess I think Oh confusing where am I now what am I doing? Why am I looking at this is this supposed to signify B being at home? Do I need to look at something is this a loading screen? I don't know what it is. Is it a puzzle. Yeah? Yeah, no I'm not bored yes, and a little hungry Yeah Yeah, okay, all right, I approve of the promotional material, I think I Guess I'm done. Now. Okay. I'll carry on with my life, okay or the games gonna crash What is at the end of it? Why did you go to big screen curiosity? I spend half hour writing these facts Okay, all right. I don't know what that means Yeah, well you may know the location that means that you know where to go when they ask you to for today you got two Tests the first wanted to go to your office again and print more stuff the second one though isn't such a pleasant task You see we're having some problems with the toilet over in the men's bathroom Yeah, clogged toilet of course you paid to be the guy that does the kind of stuff that nobody wants to do the handyman for short Move these arms repair yourself and set some classic music you're about to move crap out of the toilet All right Have a good night. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm gonna go do that. I guess if I have to all right Danger why would you say there was danger? I have to do the other task first Why do I have to do the other task? That's stupid? Okay, I'll do the other task. I guess all right here We go can I get one of them in the toilet toilet toilet go to the toilet go to the toilet? Yes? yes, yes, I've boned you ah Yeah, get rekt Oh Did I win What happened oh god my voice is almost completely gone now what the hell happened I? Have no idea what happened. Oh, ah what what is he? Bubba's diner where fantasy and dreams come to life come do life. They don't just come to life they come do life ah Okay, that's not a lot of money. It's good. Good amount of money, but for a diner Oh Yeah, that's no good. That's no good. It's no good. That's not good. That is not good anyway My voice is just about shot, but thank you so much for joining me for five five nights at Freddy's fan games Let me know what you think of these games one of them Jolley three had a lot more polish than the others, but it doesn't mean that the others didn't have their own certain charm And I hope you guys enjoyed me compiling it in one video I certainly had a lot of fun playing this and contrasting them against each other And I think the video as a whole is better off than it would be if I was individually playing these games now I don't think I'm gonna play any of these games to completion in a video series unless Maybe jolly three, but just because that was so damn cool, but let me know anything down the comments below Thank you everybody so much for watching it if you want to see more videos like this big ole compilation new videos Let me know down there as well. Thank you everybody so much for watching and as always I will see you in the next video buh-bye! (printer noises) Chica, what's happening? What's goin on? 
hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome back to getting over it with Bennet fadi now this is the destroy my channel challenge it's one of those things that I just came up with because I'm an idiot but here's the deal if if if if if if if I curse any curse word any curse word at all anything swear word doesn't matter if I curse in this playthrough you have to unsubscribe from my channel that is the guarantee if I curse you unsubscribe but on the flipside if I make forward progress you subscribe I don't even care if it's a subscription back it's you who if I curse you unsubscribe for my channel but if I make forward progress you have to subscribe and if you're already subscribed then wait until I curse and then re subscribe okay alright no I'm fine I'm fine no no no this is how it's gonna work I all you need to agree with me on this one trust me I know what I'm doing maybe probably not but I'm in a good place right here no no no no this is the only way it's gonna work you gotta believe me you gotta believe me if the stakes are gonna be high enough to motivate me to get through this game I have to do it with calmness in my soul and this is how it's gonna work that's why it's called the destroy my channel challenge so if you guys are ready we're gonna do this but in before people are just saying I'm trying to get out of 22 nudes tasteful nudes at 20 million subscribers doesn't matter this is the stakes right here if make forward progress then I'm gonna get like closer to the tasteful nudes but this is it now I haven't cursed yet but if I curse at all you must subscribe okay all right I am the comest I've ever been in my life nothing could possibly nothing could possibly get in my way yes like the calmest butterfly making forward [Laughter] problems on that there Mouse okay all right like the gentlest but cheerfully all right okay all right everything's fine everything is fine because I you you you you - Philippe in the wind earth circle I've made forward progress guys this is officially forward progress okay so if you're just joining if you're just joining here's the deal this is called to destroy my channel challenge I haven't cursed yet but here's the stakes if I curse you have to unsubscribe for my channel that's the deal but if I make forward progress you subscribe so I can lose subscribers on cursing but I can gain them back with forward progress so it's rewarding my own success yeah oh yeah I don't think I can grab on to this can i Yee this would be a terrible idea [Music] [Music] alright okay I just got a make I don't know but I have a funky feeling monkey screams don't count as curse monkey screams ain't no curse okay right Oh ah that's a slippery Rock duty fruity okay we're fine okay ah all right I don't I don't know how to progress from here I just don't know if I don't know how I don't know how to progress from here I don't know I don't know how to do it I don't know how to do it ah maybe no that'd be a bad idea okay I haven't sworn yet I haven't sworn I haven't sworn haven't sworn swear on me mum anger is fine anger is perfectly fine it's just swearing that will destroy my oh yeah by the end of the Simone I'm gonna have negative subscribers who okay I think I have to leap for it that's it seems like the only conclusion here I'm pretty sure that I have to leap for it but I'm not a hundred percent on that one I'm just guesstimating I almost made it I almost made it I almost made it I almost made it don't leap why wouldn't I leap I have to leap there's no other way right maybe there's another way okay I'm gonna try something here I wonder why I wonder nah there's no way now yeah there's no way I can set myself on that so I just gonna get into the I just got to get into this corner here that's all I want right now right in that corner yeah okay that way okay so maybe maybe there is a way to nuzzle in here if I'm just so no there's no way there's no way that ain't happening that is Nate happenin having cursed yet okay I I almost had it before so I just got to do that again I can nuzzle up to here but this is as nozzoli as it's gonna get for me damn it yeah that's his nozzle as it's gonna get so any forward progress has to be made from here okay if you're just joining me once again I will reiterate the rules because I have a funny feeling that it might apply at this point oh no monkey screams don't count so it's called the destroy my channel challenge because if I curse if I curse and every one of you is agreeing to this by participating in the stream if I curse you have to unsubscribe for my channel now I haven't cursed yet but if I make this jump that counts as forward progress and then you have to subscribe that's the deal that we're all making here understood okay so

game is so fun by itself the experience doesn't need to go ruined by cheating that is the opposite of what needs to happen see I'm not I didn't do any of that I didn't do any of that that was just the game deciding to go a million miles an hour nope nope you're gonna go up whether or not you like it you're gonna go up yeah yep yep yep there we go no see that was down oh hey right that's a new

[Music] nope no see up-up-up is the way you're supposed to go not down not down not down think wow okay did you see that cuz I sure didn't Oh up o2 up Wow Wow just wow all I have to say about that as well whoa okay I'm must be in a Twilight Zone because I am doing things that the game is do I'm not the game is not doing what I'm doing ah no please I'm begging you I got through this so easily before see you you think you guys might be thinking like oh you don't need to move as fast I swear I swear I'm not moving as fast remember I had to switch Mouse's I had to switch my losses so suddenly this mouse bit more sensitive bit more provocative I'd say hey okay well pushing off is an option wow wow oh whoa whoa that was rocket speed downwards rocket speed how does it do that I just don't get it no see what hmm it's I'm gonna just do this don't oh yeah wait yeah okay alright just gonna turn that down a smidge because I am getting some effects here Wow okay no please please please I'm begging you I'm begging you please please please Oh No options options options this is things that can happen apparently see I don't get that snap to it like ah oh oh please please I don't get the snapback I know what it is now but it's still it makes no sense for a control it makes no sense why would it be that way okay all right okay all right who's stuck in the toilet again nope don't want that that's happened to me before and I didn't like it that much whew Hey okay that's cool maybe I just need to stop raging against it and start going with the flow Wow see I didn't do that didn't do that didn't do it had nothing to do with that I had nothing to do with that oh wow wow wow wow but anyway when I need to do is I need to start accounting for that and just being like it's gonna be like that all the time except it's not accept no no no no no no no where am I I don't there's no way to get back I could try to get on that lamp but I don't I don't think that would serve my fun remember guys this games fun this game is super fun and I still have not cursed again Wow okay oh okay all right Kirsten Stewart ah grab see it didn't do go horrible swing there but it did Oh a swing there which is fascinating it did a swing like that's what I just don't get it does it am i just moving my mouse wrong because as soon as I'm done like as soon as I'm done I don't move my mouse anymore like I I'm it works many times where I was just like once I'm done with the movement I don't move my mouse unless I'm trying to chain up a move but maybe there you go again being super super super speedy on what you're doing why why why are you so speedy I don't understand I am not moving my mouse that much at all stay right there get farther up on it Wow what why oh my goodness gracious oh my goodness gracious oh my goodness gracious okay okay we made it back we made it back okay calm and collected there we go there we go everyone calm and collected ooh bouncy bouncy bouncy bouncy bouncy boy bouncy boy okay Oh Oh what Wow do I really slide off of that one Oh what I am silent because if I open my mouth I'm going to lose my entire channel in the string of curse words that I will omit so bear with me as I let the rage subside which is an I impossibility in the face of this game [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] why I'm not going spastic you guys are seeing me I'm not doing anything differently I'm approaching this as calmly as I can this fun fun game this fun fun game okay all right all right okay all right okay happy thoughts are flowing through my brain happy happy thoughts happy thoughts at how happy I am and how happy I will be once I get past this one point in the game if I could just only get there which I will cuz I believe in myself that's what I do [Music] what I will be so happy when I finally finally get past this one part which is gonna happen cuz I believe in myself I believe in myself I do I really truly honestly do I do well I do I really do I really do believe in myself I believe in myself because I am a winner I'm a winner I'm a winner who wins it winning I'm a winner I'm just a happy whoa what was that maneuver I'm just a winner I'm just a happy oh yeah oh that feels good oh that feels good oh let the dopamine flow through oh okay now this is gonna be the calmest gentlest ascent you ever did see because I am the the man with the plan okay now you tell me you tell me right now and don't lie to me what's the best way to get past this one point what is the best way to get past this point is it to launch myself which I don't know if I can reach or is it to try and climb up this part here as sheer as that is as sheer as that is as sheer as that is is it better to do that than to try to jump launch yourself okay all right that's what I thought that's what I thought that's what I thought that's what I thought okay use momentum so I've got myself right here and I'm just gonna okay so right along this lovely path here whoa hey whoa whoa okay that's that's fun Oh hmm I have to fast launch no way really if only I knew how to do that if only there was a way [Music] No whoa [Music] what [Music] okay all right okay oh why would you do that why would you scare me you scared me you scared me you scared me you scared me ah dopamine dopamine rush again do not launch okay do not launch you know what I'm gonna try that don't launching route because that's what I think is a good idea is know what what why why why did it push why did it push why did it push why did it push gosh golly jiminy Christmas why would you do that why would you do that other than to betray me Bennett fadi you are the one who is betraying me Burnett body I will find you I will find you no slippery slippery like like a Dalmatian and Lube slippery like the night's clean film losing sanity quickly aren't I gentlemen and why would you do something of that caliber losses grab and now we will get to the part where we launched okay we have slipped in like butter on a knife mmm delicious well what I will add whoa hey whoa now you don't need to be so shaggy mister you just need to be classy mm-hmm using sanity is part of YouTube it's part of it wow that was quite a grip on you mister man why why I ask again to nobody but bride why why why why why why why oh boy ah I live I live ah man man someone said turn off mouse cursor I don't even know that's not gonna help is it [Music] what what No No all right okay okay I don't know if that helped at all I don't actually think it helped it all but psychologically speaking maybe it did I don't know I could use a lot of psychological help in this game anything to make me believe that I have a chance okay please I just need to get back to where I was so not too strong [Music] ooh [Music] whoo-hoo it died yep that broke so now I don't have a chair that's nice back up come here Cheerilee you thought you're out of the woods Cheerilee huh fun fun fun chairs dead now turn down mouse sensitivity then I just got to relearn it all over again how about zero no oh yeah zero that's the good that is the good stuff why is that more sensitive it shouldn't be that sensitive anyway oh that is slow going whoo now that is very different who that is oh that is raucously different launch a but I still launched good that's nice what well that's now that's just weird because the sensitivity is down yes but the actions of launching are just as good now doesn't that tell a story about this game that was different Oh weird very strange very strange I don't hate it even that I can still do that pretty quickly all right oh hey friend okay all right okay whoa hey won't help me if I do things like that okay whoa whoops not what I meant oh no we don't oh okay all right bouquet bouquet bouquet okay Oh bouquet bouquet bouquet bouquet bouquet there's hope this just the tiniest bit of hope not a lot mind you not a lot of hope but tiny bit bouquet yeah cuz the launches are still snappy but the control is much better much better oh well that's a delightful now I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get this now because my calibration is all off but ok ok ok all right okay so the answer is I have to launch myself I do I'm pretty sure I do I almost had it a few times and I'm probably gonna fall anyway like that's just my lot in life so might as well go out with the best possible effort I can right yeah let me get a bit of a steeper launch for that just just cuz I don't want the head of the axe catching on anything or rather my angle be better okay here we go whoa hello alright but I'm not as infuriated as that because that was 100% my fault I'm never mad at a game oh whoa hey if it's my fault but this new sensitivity this is way better this is way better this is way better like I am NOT gonna lie this is way better it feels more consistent feels like I actually have control like I actually am doing the things that I want to do instead of the game deciding to do something for me now the game still has moments where it's like I'm gonna bounce here like right there but you know at least I can know that my spastic flailing afterworld way afterwards is gonna do last to destroy me whoa yeah all right then still gotta get used to it this is a it's a learning curve of itself but overall whoa still better than what I was dealing with yeah I just don't think I don't think I launched with enough woo hoo just yeah I don't think I launched woo all right well back here launch with enough space cuz I I tried to launch with whoa ah see low sensitivity I didn't I'm oh I see oh god that was my fault that was 100% my fault because I did swing enough because I'm still getting used to the sensitivity level whoa whoa whoa I will change my mind if you send me back to the beginning I will chew up I will oh my god I have to relearn this god that's the bad thing about changing your sensitivity you have to relearn rope whoa you have to relearn exactly how much of one Mouse movement does what see ya oh no ya see that wasn't that was my fault again cuz but at least I'm feeling like it's my fault I'd rather have the feeling that I'm doing this than the game boning me over which the game was oh really okay that's the game boning me over come on Oh see I can't oh the new sensitivity oh come on come on nope not that much okay I gotta relearn everything now okay there we go got that all right okay everybody hold on to your pants everybody hold on to your chairs I'm coming into town you know people are gonna quote my chair destroying habits started when I was back in 2012 when I use Jo oh whoa hey wow wow God okay I hate it I hate it I hate it ah God it's like uh I don't know how much to use Oh Frick it's almost too low you know I think it is I think it's mouse acceleration Mouse acceleration is my least favorite thing in computers I always turned it off I think this has mouse acceleration turned on which is super inconvenient whoa new note the bounce that bounce what ah gosh goopy goopy goopy in my pants II win see win see gooshie goopy ah why did I have to change things no oh alright well that's I meant to do that [Music] try trackpad tuning what does that mean ooh I hate that I hate wait ah but wait is that one to one it's one to one it's one to one it's one to one it's one to one whoa it's one to one oh wait so am I am I fooling myself hey it is that's one to one I don't know if I like it but that's what I was talking about that that bunk whoa hey I don't know if I'm gonna like this ooh yeah don't like that don't like that no no no don't like this I hate this oh maybe I don't know it's hard to tell it's like it's like each time I change something I have to relearn it whoa maybe whoa I guess oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa why whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hate it hate it Oh hate it hate it hate it hate it I hate that hate that hate that hate that hate that hate that okay turning this up a bit just a bit good God worst thing ever life is terrible in the neighborhood life is terrible in the neighborhood I hate life life hates me we hate life life is hate full of hate it's full of hate but we all hate each other equally whoa we all hate each other equally which what makes us makes us able to live as a society oh boy I don't like this at all no I don't like this at all no I don't like this at all no I don't like this at all [Music] relearning everything is crap okay you know what yeah methinks methinks if if it ain't broke which it was but if it ain't that broke don't fix it too much okay I will make forward

yeah I just don't have the confidence to do it that way do not jump launch you guys you guys just you guys just have no idea what to do and it's just nothing okay come on try something I don't think it's enough but can i hey no there's no way you can't say oh hey yeah you can't set yourself on that but maybe I could launch myself I lost myself up there I might all right I'm gonna take it slow Oh

definitively forward progress at this juncture oh yes oh yes oh yes okay where am I headed okay was with that okay so I need to I got to go straight up and then okay straight up not clip that grab yeah just like that okay is there like to pass here is this just means a lot to me that you've come this far endured this much every wisecrack every insensitivity yeah every setback you've forgiven me is a mingling gift I have not me I've not forgiven you add a halt I have not even remotely forgiven you not that is not what's happening here forgiveness is not in my nature sir mr. foggy okay well I'm here now okay at least that's not deathly at least that is not definitely that is fine I am okay with that I am okay with that yeah oh Shoom Shoom okay this is gonna be this is gonna be impossible but at least I don't have the threat of annihilation set before me now I know that this is just setting the stage for future annihilation but you know that's that's something I'll deal with on another day right now I just got a bask in the glory of how I've actually managed to succeed which is amazing and I'm not a hundred percent sure how oh okay woo hey let's just let's set down to whoo hey whoa let's sit down sure jump oh oh right on it right on it oh wait this is getting dangerous if I miss oh jeez oh jeez if I'm it oh if I miss it oh okay I don't think I will I don't think I'll miss it I don't there's really no way that I could miss this right just sit down yeah I could get this cuz we're oh and there's more okay we've officially reached scary territory Oh No okay if I okay good thing I didn't spam anything we have the same taste you and I it's not ambition its ambitions opposite and obdurate mission to taste defeat you'll feel bad if you win so I put this snake in for you [Music] you know I really really really want to ride that snake I'm not gonna lie I've never wanted to ride a snake more in my life than I do right now but I am gonna take the wise choice because I have bled too much and I have a funny feeling that's gonna send me pretty far back if not all the way I'm not gonna do that all right oh this is this is gonna be a pain in the rumpus ha oh oh oh no it's gonna make me right if if I somehow fall and ride that snake I am going to be so mad I'm gonna be the most mad I've ever been in my life if I somehow fall and have to accidentally this bucket is gonna be the death of me really I had that bucket I had that bucket by the short hairs okay there we go ooh do not ride that snake ooh do not ride that I don't like this at all uh I'm gonna try to set on the bucket but I don't even know it if I set on the bucket am I even gonna be able to launch off the bucket do I have to like swing the bucket oh oh no I don't believe that this is a good thing for me oh no I don't like you at all nope don't like that okay if I fall I need to do anything but put my hammer to the left if I put my amer to the left it could catch the snake and that's bad I'm pretty sure I have to swing swung with this I'm almost 100% positive that's why this bucket is on a rope those scared I've never been more scared in my life I'm so scared dang it that was dang that was not a curse oh boy oh man I've made it so far I did not think in a million years I was gonna make it this far whoa I don't like this ooh oh man I never ever ever ever thought I was gonna make it this far because I mean just you you guys remember what I was like not thirty minutes ago I was I was a heaving mess I was distraught thinking that I had destroyed my channel huh you guys thank you for playing along with me too the rules make it fun the risk uh-huh and even though I like to play it safe the risk oh because I mean I do kind of understand where Mr Fogg is coming from I'm never gonna be able to get this bucket I do understand where it mr. fatties coming from because I like I really do like starting over I like starting over incredibly it's one of my favorite things to do whenever I play games like oxygen not included or factorio which I've been playing in my spare time like I just oh I love taking the concepts that I've learned and new game plussing I love the concept of a new game plus I'm never never ever getting this bucket by the way this is not happening really Oh got you oh I had that this bucket is gonna be the death of me [Music] ooh no I just felt the snake looking at me and I was very scared you know what I'm not gonna touch this I'm gonna see what happens am I just gonna fall off or it yep okay I fall off eventually if I do nothing that's a certainty laughs I need just need to stop hitting it with my head okay that's that's an option I don't think it helps me at all nope dingus ah maximum ooh that's a good one okay so how do I get like that this oh oh oh wow oh wow oh wow wowie wowie oh wow Wow Oh oh my oh my oh my Mamma Mia here I go again uh uh-oh that's that's not gonna grab is it that's that's not gonna stay grabbed is it okay if I push off straight up very gently and try to get one of the hooks above it I think that'll be better for me okay forward those forward progress though so you know what the deal is okay all right I'm never gonna be able to do that bucket thing again boy there we go right here left-right push okay that's not as bad as I once thought it was hey I wonder if am I supposed to go top right because if I am i might just barely be able to make that worth a shot I guess cuz I don't think it's gonna end in my death if I miss it so let me just angle and launch ah ah ah okay this is a sheer cliff how in the world do I do this 100 how how how how would you be able to is this the right way do I go the other way what do I do to the right to the right oh no oh no no no oh no oh no oh no no I'm scared how how how do you do how do you do this [Music] there's no way there's no way there's no way there's this little this legitimately oh how do you even how do you even could even begin [Music] okay all right you can set yourself down oh that's nestled in there oh that's nestled okay oh oh oh this is so impossible there's no way ye oh ye oh ye oh ye oh ye oh ye oh ye oh ye fast oh you gotta go fast I don't like going fast I don't like it okay I guess fast is the way I think not well your hand moves the hand I may not follow nor the man nor the man's hand in this yearís will his intent the embodied resolved in his ah Bell assent [Music] [Music] I'm done I'm done thank you for protecting in the destroy my channel challenge I'm done I gotta go I'm so heartbroken I think I'm about to cry but thank you I ended on a good note I made forward progress which you guys know is Corden's to the deal I I swore a few times but in the end I made forward progress so if you believed in me that means that you subscribed as a reward and that means the world to me oh oh that's that hurts so bad but thank you everybody so much for watching and as always I will see you in the next video bye bye

Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and welcome back to Unforgiving: A Northern Hymn. We just came face-to-ass with a giant troll, and it didn't go so well for us, in fact, We might be mentally scarred about that,  but now that we got our brother back we're gonna be able to sneak our way through these trees and get our way through- Uh, Oh Oh No What are you talking about? What could possibly be wrong? Ooh- The hypnotic ass of death, okay, alright, okay, alright.  You lead the way, bro! I'll follow you to the ends of the earth - and then I'll probably die but besides that- Oh, where'd you go? Geez I wasn't paying attention Oh, wow. *chuckles* Wow uh, *chuckles* Uh- It's- uh it's quite a walk you got there, bro. You're, uh, you- you're really working out those glutes I can see. The quads are burning quite deeply, but I dunno bro. I mean, maybe it's friendly He seems awfully friendly Munching on whatever the hell it's got there. HEY! HEY BUDDY! ya doING great. :D I mean you smell really bad AND UR FAMILY PROBABLY HATES YOU AND NO ONE WANTS TO BE AROUND YOU And you should probably INVEST in some DEODORANT You know personal hygiene is obviously not high priority for you, but you're doing great keep it up, man I'm proud of you? not really. I don't know- oh, thanks for waiting, bro Yeah, I can see that walk didn't get you very far mMM Oh boy that guy is ugly, and I don't know what he's munching on But it's a slice- wOW I was going fast all of a sudden Oh should I be not- okay, alright nevermind. It's time to run, I guess. Okay here we go then Thank you Bro For giving me warning about that one... now where the hell are we going? Is the question. Like how did he survive on his own? I barely know how I survived on my own, in fact if I remember correctly, I didn't survive on my own Oh, now is the time- it's safe for flashlight? You sure about that- Oh, hi Wait there's more than one? Yeah, no joke we gotta keep movin, but wait, what is it? *Mark tripping over words* Have those been different ones that I've been seeing or- I thought it was the same one ah So we're running into a distinct problem If there's gonna be more than one of those big tall thingies because there's also other monsters in the woods And I feel like you should be worried about that- you know I never understood how trolls reproduce so And and you know what I guess I don't want to find out their den of- uh oh, we're going in- We're going into their den of pleasures as I was about to say. Yeah, bro. I ain't too sure about this either I'm sure we'll be safe in there This obviously looks like it's made by natural occurrences and not by a giant troll biting its way through the ground Oh, can you imagine just a giant worm with a troll head just like blasting its way through a mountain? *Sound of disgust* No bueno, no bueno. Uh oh- Hi, okay. Okay Thanks, bro Man, I love hanging out with you. Sure do love our vacations where you kidnap me somehow mysteriously near a- A horrible troll infested Island. That's my favorite type of the day that we have together. Oh no, the bridge is out. Well, who built this bridge? Because that's the biggest question that I have right now There's a ton of infrastructure on this island And it had to have originated from somewhere. Are you waiting for me? Really, bro? Do I have to go? All right fine. Slide- Aw man my butt is taking a beating in this game I am sliding all over the place- Oh, hey, how's it going there? I guess you don't need to slide then. Yeah, it's so bizarre like the elements that are in here are obviously from a time when industrialization was a thing. There's like mining equipment, there's rail yards It's not exactly modern for like the time period where we all have cell phones I'm assuming that this game is set in modern times, but there's still an element that's missing Like why is all this here? Where could they have been possibly going that there would have been human civilizations that didn't know- notice the giant naked trolls walking around completely big floppily swinging all over the place And no one noticed like not a single goddamn person noticed that there were giant rolls and also shadow monsters In the marshes of which people built bridges And it was like a car thing and a big old box train that moved across the ocean Like those are things that didn't just pop up people built those along with their sacrifice books and what not and what have you *loud in-game growl* AH THAT'S NOT GOOD You don't need you don't  need to tell me! Bro run faster. bRO. Uh oh Whoa hey! That's no good Should I look back? WHOAHHH I SHOULD NOT LOOK BACK Okay, all right. I- I'm aware of that, bro. I'm aware. How about you go faster, you douche? I'm going. I-I am! Currently going! Yes, that's exactly what I'm doing. Why would I, bro? Honestly- Oh *Loud snapping/crushing sounds* Was that the sound of my brother's bones snapping or was that- Okay, this is the most horrible thing I've ever seen What? No! Uhhh What do I- Ohhhh, what do I do? OhH Why- Oh my god- Why- No- what in the hell was that all- Why did I do that? Why? Oh, oh my god. Why am I doing this? Why in the world? Why am I do- Why? Why? Why? Why did I-? Why did I do that? Why? Why? For what reason did I pull out his eyeball and his tongue? What Swedish tradition is that? 'Cause I am not following that- I have no idea Oh, I have- I have no idea. I am at a loss I am completely in the dark. This whole situation- I don't know what- I can't- Why can't I move anymore? Well, I can't- Suddenly I can't even move, my mouse is dead, that is the answer to that question. Excuse me, I have to- But I'm still gonna talk about what- why What- What in the world it's in and why- I have no idea like why- I can understand like mercy killing, but I guess I left him to suffer too long and then he died anyway And then I didn't help him and so and in my madness and my grief. I like I pulled out his eye So I could build like a bone effigy to- to keep him in my heart I guess?? I don't know if that's true Ayeeee Ayoouuu Ooh-ahh Muuuuaaa That's- that is a level of I'm not sure. I got get a good a USB cable to charge my mouse. I just- oo it's wireless mouse This is gonna- Is this long enough? I don't even know I had a longer one. I don't know where it went- okay alright Carrying on, game on, all right. Okay? What does this say- "Quarantine! High risk of infection!" Okay, alright. Well, I got a tongue to protect me and my brother's always watching over me Because I got his eyeball That's what I got His eyeball Okay, it is dark. I can't see shit What is that fire on the mountain? What is that ? Is there a volcano over there? Ay yi yi. okay. I'm over it. I'm over it. I've- I've recovered. I mean. I haven't recovered recovered, but I've recovered enough that Well, I mean no I haven't reco- I don't think anything is gonna make me recover that- I've played been playing horror games for years and that that just I think that That finally messed me up.

and we are a lot yes hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome to the November charity livestream we're here to make breakfast for you I want to introduce Tyler hello I want to introduce Ethan hello and I want to introduce myself and everyone who's in this room Amy Evan and Catherine over there on main control yeah whatever what's the first time you've ever had that kind of reaction no just look at her she's yeah she's yeah she's she's she's kind of a wild card that might accidentally take down the whole street yeah that's what I'm mostly concerned about because there's a lot of wires around here that we've got everywhere and we could possibly have a hazard here but more importantly than anything that we've already talked about and we'll talk about on the stream even the children this is our bombing for punishments holiday board so here we have a number of very mysterious punishments that we're gonna be enduring mostly me because I'm a jerk but I'm gonna be doing a lot of these punishments and we have this lovely bucket of apples and ice cold water we'll be putting more ice in this water as we go along but every time we get punished or we have to do a punishment which will happen every $10,000 raised we will someone not sure how I'm gonna do rock paper scissors rock paper scissor in it or is it like if we lose the thing or what what we'll do that without it but that is an island oh we could Rock City Paper Scissors or we could just cycle through so it could be like oldest to youngest or vice versa I don't like that your first to be punished yeah that was your first mistake gosh alright so we're gonna be having a lot of fun here but we are raising money for Save the Children and our goal this time is really really really high it's two hundred thousand dollars which is higher than we've ever had before it's not higher than we've ever raised before but it's the highest goal we've had through pure monetary donations so Tyler can tell you more about this and we'll be talking about throughout the stream certainly there are a number of ways to contribute as you can see on the till to five page we actually have a lot more information this time you can go to the schedule you can see exactly what we're gonna be doing every time we're live we're doing a different activity there's gonna be different punishments and during the breaks we're gonna have a goal for the next time that's gonna affect us in the next time we are alive the other thing there are incentives if you go to the incentive page there are shirts they're actually an older design that we had left over and in storage for a few years yeah that and they're all organized by size and all you have to do is donate 50 dollars and roughly forty three of those dollars will go to the actual charity itself in the long run because there is some shipping costs to that and that's the only thing that's getting taken out is that shipping so if you go through that be sure and pick the right size and then the charity itself is Save the Children I'm in the bottom corner I think it's said that corner is at that corner it's one of the corners there's a package oh it's up here uh-huh alright well it's up there on that package is for every 50 dollars it will fill completely up and you will watch it as it fills up and every 50 dollars that affects 4,000 babies that gives them life-saving vaccines that gives them medical supplies and medical check-ups that they need as they that they develop whether it says an infant or when they are first born and Save the Children is a huge big organization that reaches over 120 countries including the US they provide education they provide life-saving medical treatment and they definitely come into action during crisis because children are the most at risk when crisis occurs they protect them from harm they do all kinds of stuff all for children and families with children and the reason today that we are the goal is 200 thousand dollars which is higher than we've ever had the goal is because we have a very very very very generous anonymous donor that is willing to match the donations up to two hundred thousand dollars so if we hit that two hundred thousand dollar goal that means we will raise a total of four hundred thousand dollars for Save the Children which will be awesome so let's do it yeah so everything you do is double this time around everything that we have here is going to be doubled so even the actions that you take if you can make a donation if you can share the stream if you can't tell people about the tilta five-page if you can go out and let people know about the stream that's another possible donator who whose donation is going to be doubled during this stream so if you can please let people know about that if you can please let people know about the stream about the event that we have going on about the organization that we're raising money for it will do an incredible amount of good and we'll be able to have some fun all day because every ten thousand dollars that we raise we will be doing another punishment and overnight we already raised seven thousand dollars for charity so look down the description for tilt fi comm slash at markiplier all the other information there if you're on mobile there's other ways to reach the donation page just check around do whatever you can and please help share it on Twitter and Facebook wherever you can we'll come up with a stream hashtag soon and let's have some fun so this is the lot live markiplier makes which means

where's one right there but I'll get the other one yeah so are we doing this thank you so much for being with us here we got a long way to go but once again I will say we are raising money for Save the Children and if you don't know about Save the Children I've got some information about it their goals are very simple they hope that no child dies from preventable causes they hope that all children learned from a basic quality and education and they hope that violence against children is no longer tolerated and you'd think that those things would be simple like everyone in the world could agree to that but even in the world that we live in today like there's there's so many children that need help because in 2016 alone Save the Children helped more than 185 million children in 120 countries and that's including the United States so it may seem like this is a far-off problem but even in our in in this country that we live in right now even like first world countries where things should be civilized and people should expect certain things like there's children that suffer and don't have enough and don't have the basic things and if we don't protect our children then the future generations that we have and we don't we don't like instill in them like hope and give them the tools that they need for the future then I don't think that like we will have a future because we just need to remember that we are here only to make sure that the next generation is better off than we left it so please help and donate to this cause we have a $1000 donation from wait wait wait we

'"When your legs don't work-'" (Chika sneezes and distracts Mark) '"When your legs don't work like they used to before, and I can't sweep you off of your feet, will your mouth still remember the taste of my love? Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy. Baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23. I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways, maybe just the touch of a hand. Well, me? I keep on loving you every single day I just want to tell you I am. So, honey now, take me into your loving arms, kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, place your hand on my beating heart. I'm thinking out loud, maybe we found love right where we are. When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades, and the crowds don't remember my name, when my hands don't play the strings the same way, I know you will still love me the same. 'Cause, honey, your soul will never grow old, it's evergreen. Mm, baby, your smile forever in my mind, in memory oooh I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways maybe it's all part of a plan Me? I'll keep on making the same mistakes, hoping that you'll understand. Baby, now ooh take me into your loving arms, kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, place your hand on my beating heart, thinking out loud. Maybe we found love right where we are, ooh la, la, la, la, la, la (quiet humming) So, baby, now take me into your loving arms kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, place your hand on my beating heart, thinking out loud. Maybe we found love right where we are. Maybe we found love right where we are. Maybe we found love right where we are.'" (to Chica) "Was it that bad?" (laughing) "Good girl." "Oh who's a fluffy pupper?" "This is- uh, um, that this is that secret project that terrifies me. Uh, it may not seem like a lot, I know. I know it's got a lot of mistakes, and I know there's a lot of stuff I can improve on, but um by my own standards, this is a big step forward for me. I haven't preformed musically in, uh in front of people since high school, and that was a nightmare. So, this was a big psychological hurdle to even get to this point, where- where I've only been taking this seriously for about three months now. But this is what I want to be doing on the tour. Like- uh, if you want more tickets, we added second shows where it sold out. So check out markiplier.com or, um, go to the link in the description below, there'll be stuff down there that'll show you. I mean, not the whole tour we also have a comedy show that we're doing with it. But this is- uh- this was a personal challenge for me. Because, it's one of those moments where I know my weakness. And my weakness is this, like performing in something that's not just me going on stage and talking, which you guys know I can do till the sun goes dead. Um, but when it comes to performing like this, knowing it's not perfect, and knowing I'm not great at it, it's...um, I don't know. I'm really proud of myself. I think that's cool. Don't expect my channel to suddenly change into only covers. I- I do this because it's a good challenge for me and it's a great expression of creativity. And it's something that really, really drives me. And where a lot of my life I have improved myself substantially, this is one of the areas that I have let myself regress. So, I don't want to shy away from it just because I'm afraid of failing at it. I want to pursue it and I want to hit it hard and I want to show you guys. I want to present this to you because that's what it's all about. That's what youtube's all about, like showing you me, where I am not perfect. I can, at least, improve a bit. That's cool. So anyway, let me know what you guys think. It's- There's- it could be bad, could be good, I don't really care, give it to me straight, I am my own worst critic anyway, so it's not like you guys could be any worse. I want to know what you guys think. I- I think this is fun. I want to do what makes me happy. And right now, this does. Even if it aggravates me to no end when I'm wrong. But, it's cool. So, thanks for watching guys. Write what you think down in the comments below. As always, I'll see you in the next one. Buh-bye!" (strums guitar) 
hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome back to the evil within - now this might be the final episode of this game everything seems to be on fire and that's probably a problem but we might be going back to an area that we've already been to before which means that we're gonna be backtracking over places that were not on fire and now we're on fire now I'm thinking of those those fires armies that were spinning in a circle may have had something to do with all this but anyway hello everybody my name is markiplier hello hello hello yadda yadda yadda let's get going we don't have coffee I just remembered damn it's dammit toto dammit toto did I talk to Hoffman about all this I think I talked to Hoffman do more things with my mind every time I see him he uses my own nightmares against me that sounds like him he's a master of neuro linguistic programming and in here the linguistic part becomes irrelevant why talk when you can get strained to your mind he almost had me but I searched inside myself and there was someone there someone who told me what I needed to do I know I can take him on now yes I can see that you're ready how did you we're all friends we're all friends here she didn't try to save me don't feel guilty we talked while I try to save her she told me about the plan she wanted it to succeed she made a decision to get you she knew the risks and did what she thought was right she said that she owed you for what very quiet game volume just mad Esmeralda is the operative who took Lily from your home oh wait I know what's going on I know I think I know hang on one second let me doodlee do ah how about ah there we go burned it down that better she's felt better ever since that's why she joined Myra that's why she risked her life I was wondering why that was it was quite for me too but I thought it was just on my head Bastion she didn't have a choice at the time and she did everything she could to make it right okay cool I can't hate her she sacrificed herself with a plan she made her immense all right so thankfully they were uh they were caught they were watching mccollins subtitles there were subtitles clearly where were the subtitles you know starts with a Q sounds like subtitles okay here we go there were subtitles that you could read all that very important stuff so Theodore's an asshole Esmerelda's a hero or Toto rather and now I got a new gun okay alright oh no I feel bad though no I feel okay I'm gonna put this at five and I'm gonna put the sniper rifle at seven so I don't accidentally use it because I have a bad habit of doing that oh well I guess I could just hit the middle mouse button and mouse over it's not really like it's that hard but I don't even know if I have any oh I do look at this thirty bullets that are gonna go to nothing cuz I know this gun is worthless it's goddamn worthless but also I need to get back into the mirror because I need to talk to the nurse about all this because the nurse would probably have something to say and I think I got one more slide as opposed to everything else so maybe and there's only two slides left in the world and I'm hoping that there in this next area because I want to find him I want to find all of them yeah I just saw that's just saw comma those bird mentality yes fashion what are you thinking about Lily everything that's happening in here is because of her everyone wants her like she's just some object to be owned mmm she's the real victim here poor thing doesn't know what it's like to live a normal life all these years with Moebius have probably destroyed her innocence hmm I hope so her youth was stolen from her she didn't get a chance to go to school to have friends all the birthdays and holidays she missed it's heartbreaking to think of what she's been through Lily was always so precocious so smart observant she had this way of looking at you or you knew that she understood you not just what you were saying but what you were feeling too I always knew she was special but I thought it was just because she was my daughter I keep referring to her in the past tense it still doesn't seem real to me that she's alive and in here [Music] I still think Kidman I don't think Kidman look suspiciously suspiciously like someone we know now let me see if I I'm gonna be scouring for this last two slides so I'm gonna be looking all over the place and I'm gonna miss it probably very obviously oh thank you for the group thank you yeah well okay let me see what I got here boink do do do do do do do do do all right come on come on come on nurse nurse we've got a problem nurse nurse nurse please things have gone kind of bad and I gotta go I got stuff I got go deliver some soup to somebody named Theodore nope not at all nurse no no no I can all right what did you get for me since you're preparing for something you're afraid Oh mm I'm only afraid of failing if I don't succeed mm-hmm then you will have sacrificed yourself for a good cause if I sacrifice myself there's no one to finish this sacrifice means you've lost sometimes sometimes it's what's needed to complete the task at hand well let's hope it doesn't come to that I think I think the nurse is doing some epic foreshadowing right there I think it I think it might come to that pretty sure in fact that it might exactly come to that all right let me see if I can take these finally smoke bombs oh I haven't had an opportunity to use my smoke okay so what other combat skills could I get no I didn't because I'm not about that shut up see this would be super cool but I don't think I'd ever have 75,000 shut up shut up all right uh yeah recovery that'd be nice I'll speed recovery from Ridgid yeah that'd be nice okay got that okay good oh yeah sure okay was this total l-3 generated from near-death yeah running I like running I do like stamina but I can't afford those so I'm gonna hold off all right see ya goodbye farewell fare thee well all right I wonder if the shooting galleries opened up a bit more maybe a cuz I got a new gun got a new gun from a very sad reason No okay fine then all right buh-bye now buh-bye okay I'm out of here all right Oh somebody if somebody made a Hibou ski compilation on Tom Lydia yesterday and I reblogged new super fun it's just there's the amount of times that I say a boo ski it's a whole area I'm hilarious is what I'm saying I'm unbelievably hilarious it's exactly what I'm saying I'm great today thank you combat little more what are you talking about don't combat me oh yeah well you out of your mind what are you out of your gourd you think I do combat no get out of here go your silliness okay we got to get back Abu ski wait are we even going this way Sykes Sykes yes okay yes yep Sykes you're still in here are you

think it was this one [Music] combat Oh pish posh pish posh this Paki oh don't bring me any of that bullshit need combat for boss fights does it look like I needed combat for boss fights I've gotten so far with what I've had so far I don't need no combat for no fights what are you talking about get out of here with this go away okay so in here oh man where'd all these new supplies come from that

know why some from the first game right I hope they're still be bandages on it no no ohh anyway got my coffee I'm gonna go let's get out here okay so if I look at the map I bet everything's on fire outside judging by the temperature yeah so there's something over there Oh sanctuary hotel that's where the art was interesante ha oh I thought that was gonna be huh brewski oh that guy's praying oh I wouldn't have done it if I didn't have to Kidman I'm gonna finish this once and for all I'm gonna save Lily I have all the tools I need this time okay it's important that I know what's going on in there so that I can help you again I do I'll be in touch I'll get you all right whoo hey what what okay thought I already got you but I don't something tells me that's not Liam Oh potatoes over there dumb tells me that might be someone else is burning up some zombies who'd have thought that lighting zombies on fire would convert them over to your cause oh but I see what you're reasoning with oh that makes logical sense to me also I'm on fire anything in the bushes okay so I'm gonna make my way and kind of comb through the city a bit see what I can find hitter and tither maybe you have to go back to the theater I'll try to make my way back there eventually but I'm gonna try to go for what I need first move I in this place is unstable oh your mistake not being on fire in all the time all

thorough because this is probably gonna be the last episode so there's probably gonna be the ending of the game I just want to make sure that I have every opportunity to give all these slides I don't

now all I need to do is comb the rest of the area make my way over to the safe house with sight see what he wants he's plugging sending it back out again just in case in case I'll get everything I need it's like it's weird it's like there's two different like organizational objectives here there was originally low normal okay there was like the the corpses that were being collected for the purposes of the photographer guy Stefano Valentini and now there's like the corpses that are being gathered for the per of Theodore and like it's wildly different structures but you can see how their mind kind of influences them up in a way I mean I don't really see how a giant exploding zombie is part of Theodore's you know vision for the future but you can kind of see some influence coming through there storage room key okay how many supplies sweet oh hello ah am I stuck Oh Billy Billy what's it what is that what okay all right that's a doom action figure that's so cool that's so cool like that that's good all right storage room keep found in the corpse in alleyway this small key opens the storage room near the post plus office okey dokey where is the post plus office storage key that's so cool the doom this is made this was published by Bethesda who I think published the last doom and I believe the game is made on a modified version of the it'd engine of which that is last step thanks a fence post plus an office was a post post office was that the post office is Etha said is that it I think that might've been the post office over there so I gotta go back to that but I'll go back to that after I talked to Sikes because then Sikes might send me over there anyway so I might as well give him a chat hey lady lady later today little hoodie lit all right doodlee do okay I believe that lady lady the end of the world but I'm still feeling happy do do I see something I don't know if it's worth getting I left goop on the ground of there I'll get it later did I leave I don't think I actually made a kill over there so I don't think what did I just get I have no idea oh well that's something that seeing me mmm that's peculiar okay I'm off you can't catch me if you blow up I'm gonna die Kosuke no health big ol no health over here wonderful Oh such a good maneuver such a good maneuver oh well did well did okay I gotta go back in here all right Sykes what do you want boom alright tykes bikes bikes what is it sorry what's so urgent are you dead in this totally safe safe house hey Sykes how's it going you know before I go I'm gonna open this box who you think the other box has stuff in it again I bet he do who is that a silence handgun just in case it didn't go in here well too bad I'm too smart for you you're here I didn't talk to you on Sykes I'm sort of busy here hey you're the one who told me to call you before I left you found your back door check it out ah looks safe Congrats you'll have to show me how to use it if I need to get Lily out later fair enough but here's the deal I'm gonna need you to help me get out of here first okay phew I don't know anything about how these computers work Sykes that's not what I need help with I hacked the servers to access a restricted area of stem there's a pod in there that I'm gonna use to get out of here problem is the power's out there are a bunch of those things in there too Dam collapse is affecting the deepest parts of stem you get the power back on and clear the place out for me I can get the hell out of here again what's in it for me I'll show you how to use the pod before I go how's that okay worth a try I guess thanks man call me when it's all clear okay I gotta tell you I was surprised to hear from you tell me about it I've been lying low to solve this backdoor thing but I stuck my head out there a few times things are going nuts what's happening out there there's a maniac who's trying to take over Union you were smart to stay in here otherwise you might have ended up flayed and tortured sounds grim think I'll pass what's worse is that the guy wants to get his hands on lily well if this plan works out you'll be able to get her to safety once you find her okay a guy like you end up in Mobius in the first place a guy like me what are you trying to say I'm saying that you've got heart and a backbone seems they prefer their operatives to be either cold reptiles or unquestioning followers you're neither what did you think I meant nothing never mind you know I actually searched them out to try and join wasn't easy either they know how to hide their tracks why would you do that they're only the most powerful organization in the history of the world do well I wouldn't and you don't consider what they do to be criminal hey it's only criminal when it's enforced you know what they say quis custodiet Ipsos custodes right sure wait for it alright ok alright then cool well that's nice but I'm not gonna do that now because I got other stuff to do here and I don't want to make any final steps towards any sort of ending until I know exactly what I'm dealing with and I got a mysterious key so I'm gonna take that one up alright that's what we're gonna do am I still on tour no no I'm not still on tour it's the volume still low I'm trying my best here yeah there we go that's about as loud as it can go literally that's as loud as it can go but uh I know that uh I know that some people need to hear things oh okay I just want to make sure that was still going all right Sykes you don't die I'll be back I gotta go let me shave but uh I'll be back you stay beautiful all right okay cool all right how about uh baboo but a little it have to okay pradier did it did it did it Oh hear that music I don't want to hear that music we gotta go okay okay so let's take the back way back way is covered by zombies okay oh that is a lot of zombies you know what I might not want to go the back way oh boy man there's a lot of these things oh oh well that's a problem haha sweet manoeuvre you can't catch me I'm the gingerbread man all right Nick snog well we got some normal zombies which I'll take over the flaming variety oh well that was weird oh my hands gone that's peculiar I'm suspecting something come on you weird wormy bastard I can't I can't duck for cover else I'd ambush him right here but oh that no no no you're not getting away not that easily I think that one might have suspected something well I'm out of here buddy Lulu dude can I roll across this hood please tell me I can roll across this hood nope suppose a big negative on that one big papa oh you can't find me I'm in a bush I'm out of stamina got a brush dirt off Oh hey watch it were you flinging that thing sir ma'am I don't know okay we got to make our way back here okay

that at all all right interesting Oh interesting okay all right got clear all those things out huh let me just use one of this bad boy actually ah that's the good shit okay where did you guys go they're all in there right they should be all in there so I just gotta take care of them all and then I'm gonna get through and see what's going on with this story here dude dude dude dude easy whoopee oh you guys both shouldn't have your back turned like that that's the mistake secret hole in my sneaky hole this is what I call my surprise hole I popped my hat on go boo and then you never know what happened to you I mean you'll you'll know because you'll die no yeah let's see that would have been a mistake one of those miss stock is come on Dora come on I got free appetizers here all-you-can-eat buffet Oh soup womp womp all right so I got two more over there again with their backs turned mysteriously a very very very convenient for me very very convenient okay you stay right there your friend won't know a thing okay Tom app your friend and it all better run to mysterious substance Gil oh he doesn't even know it was like what was that it was all a soupy blur I don't know Robert look where is what I can't believe it I'm flabbergasted I'm just completely at a loss oh I'm not at a loss anymore I know exactly what go down Oh come here come on little closer ha oh no what was that it was all oh shoot Lieber all right there you go little poodle got that all right so that's done I think it's all clear down now that would be the last one right I think anyway he could take care of that Sykes that lazy sack of crap he could have done that all right Sykes it's all clear for you all right do I got to go back and tell them or is there another place over here research and development no I think that's pretty much everything right that would be everything right ooh no I got a column from in here okay Oh better call Sykes better call Thanks who you gonna call sex oh okay oh the green soup you inject into your brain to upgrade you're not combat skills literally anything becomes wouldn't been able to do it without you I know sure this is gonna work no but staying in here isn't gonna do me any good anything is worth a try at this point huh okay it's all set right when you bring Lily back here there's a timer right here turn it a quarter rotation and then you just press this button it'll give you 60 seconds to climb into the pot you both should be able to fit in it together I don't know Sykes I got a bad feeling about this look man I know what I'm doing okay maybe you should hold off on this help me find lily and then we can all find another way out of here I feel for you man I really do but I'm doing the best thing I can do for you by getting this pod operational okay if you say so wish me luck Sebastian no apparently no luck for you wait this doesn't make sense but their bodies in the real world are still in the pods in the center of Mobius how are they gonna sneak out when they suddenly wake up okay I left you something in there for helping me now I've got a bad feeling about this see you on the other side Sebastian that was not what that did what see you on the other right that sounds like death sounds a lot like death and dying okay goodbye yeah he's gone I wonder if it worked left left so in there in there in there okay in there did it work --sykes okay alright that's has been declared a failure despite a 25 percent success rate the decision has been made to discontinue research one in four test subjects made the trip back successfully the other three simply cease to be we believe that the other have been lost in an uncharted sub level of a dream within the dream twenty five percent chance of success I'm not gonna risk Lily's life like that what hope Sykes is out in the real world one in four chance maybe he'll get lucky what what well that wasn't there before no that wasn't even something that I could read before because I remember I went in this room and I looked all around it this was not here before this was not on top of that box that wasn't there before that was only meant to be read after the fact that's on four sites I bet he met whoa another shotgun twice the barrels twice the Buckshot twice the damage oh well I do like to use it up close and personal so to be perfectly honest that's kind of my style if I just get real up close to the uh the UH the flamethrower guy and I just give him a double-barreled dose full of this that's some good stuff you know what I'm saying so I keep that one on my hotkey and I'll keep this one in the middle maybe that's what I should do you know just keep the the hotkey ones the good ones and then everything else I can deal with elsewise but that's good right I think it's good yeah ok all right well Sykes probably dead let's you know I you know I ordinarily I want to be optimistic about those things with sex's probably extremely dead problem and probably not even daddy's probably in that lower level but yeah I'm not gonna risk I'm gonna risk Lilly like that yeah all right ok we're done here sorry Sykes but thanks for the slide projector hope you didn't die all right now I got a double-barrel dose of soup I just fill both chambers with soup I'm like right up next to a zombie they're like no please don't all right Roy Roy and I'm like ah two cans of Campbell's right now go it right there let's go be out go does Sykes is dead you know I honestly wouldn't know I have no idea I don't know no no but I'm gonna I'm gonna take care of this I'm gonna take the take the flamethrower guy out for a nice lovely soup dinner and it's gonna be great it's gonna be great I was gonna love it he's gonna he's not a little bit but I were gonna love it all right let's go look at the slide lady hello Eddy Katie Katie Katie Katie Katie and what's this one all about alright only one left woo you around Kidman stem this is twice now it's failed a machine that puts you inside other people's heads who decided it was something anyone needed I don't want to know what's in another person's head I learned that the last time potential to enslave everybody you mean I don't know about that don't tell me you buy into that whole unifying mankind thing Vic or Mobius either way nobody should have their hands on this technology it's too powerful and power tends to get abused well what happens with if everyone's united in stem who's gonna feed their like normal bodies who's gonna do that who's gonna keep that alive cuz he you know still a human vice don't need to eat input why are you look good he's for me this time huh what is it you want me to follow you what you want me to sit in the chair yargh Oh congratulations Sebastian you have almost completed the inner journey that you began so long ago you have faced down your own demons you have risked a great harm to emerge triumphant but there is still a memory that you've refused to confront what do you mean so the nurse is the cat this will help you the nurse has been the cat the whole time little weird already then but okay there's a last one I thought that I thought it was gonna be more of a hunt than that all right all right nice hey nurse cat nurse cat you're less cute now that I know that they're the same like red band in her hair that's what they were showing okay all right okay Oh Joe Joe no Joe Joseph oh my partner Joe Joe under all this time there's something we've never talked about Hey not what who Joseph I never had the opportunity to make amends about that things were confusing after beacon I should have tried to get answers about what happened I mean I know what happened don't worry I can't follow you for what you did but I still blame myself for his death why not you'd prefer that I blame you you're the one who actually killed them no I couldn't I saw you shoot up Kidman but what what no it can't what happened to him where is he you bet we're gonna talk later Joe Joe Joe Joe Joe Joe he's alive I knew it I knew it I knew it hmm I knew it I knew it Jojo is this Joe Joe's desk is this way is this Joe Joe's desk Joe Joe is it your stuff but these are sweet

think Joe Joe's been stuck in stem I bet he's been surviving this whole time because Joe Joe is a freakin badass if he he can survive a freakin harpoon through the brain I'm pretty sure Egon survived a few years inside a stem that's the Joe Joe I know No Oh Joe Joe oh I should upgrade this thing it's like I got so many upgrade parts why not I'm so happy I've never been this happy in my life oh so happy you speed that's good I've got so many Parts I might as well move to to get bad why would I want that up me dad that bad I mean I've got a lot of high-grade weapon parts but firing rate with

here he must be in the lower level do you think that's that's where people go when they die in stem do you think they go to that lower level that you can't escape from it's like hell or heaven but for here you think that's it do we think I gotta go down there maybe lilial get out cuz she's lucky and I won't oh oh oh I'm just gonna go with this here because that's all I really want yeah I'll switch back if I need some longer range but that'll be very case dependent but Oh Jojo please come back tell me you're okay oh please god I've got so many guns on me boom alright where are you at

now we just gotta finish this fight after making this uh after we make this like that's it I've got all the slides and that's all I really wanted because I just wanted to know that Joe Joe was alive oh and now I'm happier than I ever could be so let's finish this like let's legitimately finishes I gotta go back into uh gonna go back in the world to get the workbench to be able to finish it but that's it that's it got what I need it right what oh I need to I need what excuse me what what what I don't have enough bullets for that whoop stupid bitch oh you poop was there another one or something oh there is oh you you I don't like you at all and you know what I'm gonna this guy this guy this guy thinks he can pull it faster Dan he I don't know about that whoa I don't think I did that I think he knows I think he knows guys he knows he knows he knows guys guys who knows that hurts you donut and get one right here knock all right in your nose holes oh boy oh geez that didn't slow nothing oh ye ah that hurts you okay I don't know how many it's gonna take to kill you but I'm just gonna keep firing that's uh how do you do the fireball things Oh Clank OH I'm gonna execute you I'm gonna ask you oh no no not cook the dog no I don't think so okay well out of that I only got one of these but maybe I'll it'll pretend like it's a double bar I think I can maybe I can do under these vinegars nope that's a negative okay well no that's not okay I'm out of that I'm out of that time for the machine gun no I don't think so and you also need to take one of these bad boys let's do a little bit of that hog yeah that's good stuff all right okay well he knows how to take cover barrel crew scary eerie see this is why Toto couldn't kill anything with this thing it's fiddly week and I'm officially out of everything how where have I gone whoa cool mist apparently can I please please can I please can i oh it was right there I saw it I saw it it was right there it was right there it was right there it was there it was there I saw it there this is so hard ah got you this time ah suped you're right in the kidney give me that shit give me that shit give me that shit that's it the last piece I need all right cool got that go why am I even using this I don't even know if Theodore is gonna be vulnerable to fire this is this is like this took all of my ammo so this better be worth it if it's not worth it I'm gonna be so pissed imma be so pissed and it better have unlimited ammo that's what I guess it because I don't know I'm gonna craft up more flamethrower ammo cuz they seem to have unlimited ammo why don't I get unlimited ammo so I got say about that that shit alright here we go got it oh yeah there we go there we go this odd weapon can be used to quickly fill an area with flaming fluid it's heavy and cumbersome enough to restrict movement fuel will be loaded into flame there immediately upon crafting cue will stow the flamethrower on your back allowing you to move more freely okay okay [Music] ah sneak kills that's why you all are saying upgrade my smoke uh okay I find it known that I would have done that oh yeah Moke becomes poisonous oh that's that's really nice okay anyway but but but maybe if I go outside I guess you couldn't equip it in the safe house I guess I want to burn down okay okay ah no nope there there it is oh come on to Papa come o to Papa if you want to get fire why why this the why though why though I'm confused wait was that always there before did that always that always collapse I can't remember I wasn't looking at it alright the ones to get some flamin hot soup I don't know I have an accident when I'm holding this like see I'm I don't have an accent when I'm not holding it but suddenly when I am holding it I have two accent you want some hot soup it is too respite see I don't know why that's just weird it just like has to be that way ah you want a little taste of their flaming soup let's see the range on this bad boy okay not quite at ranch birth ah you're unfair now solve your problem that was shockingly effective for that guy alrighty then weird but okay don't know why like literally that shouldn't have an accent but it just does I can't help that that's just what my brain goes to it's like one of those nervous tics that you just can't control get the flamethrower you got to talk in that accent it's a fact alright anyway let's get over to where we were gonna go Thank You ooh more weapon parts yes please any more of those I need to upgrade my smoke bombs because if I'd have been doing that from the beginning I would have been able to do more sneak kills because but I'm dumb all right ha ha I wonder what would happen if I went all the way back through the marrow to try to go to like the original places I don't even know if you could but I'm just curious about it if you go to like Liam safe house like way way but could you even go I don't know if the marrow is like closed off now I think it might be there might have been something that was just like completely shut down that you couldn't get through do anything over here there was something over here before over here now oh yeah I wanted to go back to the theater before I actually move on because I wanted to see if there was anything at the theater waiting for me God the three of you it's like odd numbers of things come out here all right Oh big guy I something tells me the flamethrower ain't gonna work too good on these guys right here but come on come on come on come on oh he's out of range for supermoto I don't think he's within range whoo I'm gonna go with a no on that one oh why Ben oh boy oh boy oh boy Wow okay that's unnecessary Oh big boomer boy last your friends please yeah keep charging that that's gonna work I've got nothing I've got so much nothing whoa dudes me pardon me okay we're good ah looks like somebody needs a little dose of souping oh I can't even crowds will not do this but that's all right you want some soup hot soup coming your way all right gun powder please yes please all those things give six gunpowder that's a whole shotgun shell might as well excuse me would you like some soup can I hit you with this over there well yes I can all right that guy just exploded all of a sudden those weird yeah you better whoa bush save me bush push save save me Bush bush please good you you have to higher tolerance for the spicy suit all right I'm just gonna get this last guy cuz I'm spiteful okay that's a good shit okay got those guys down I'm just gonna check the theater real quick because I bet I bet there's something there there would be right maybe I mean if you think about it if you think about it you remember how I killed my own my own version of me that was trapped in here like I did right I did let me just grab this real quick and that was super weird at the time but when you think about it there's another guy out there why are there so many of those guys and whatever but when you think about it in relation to everything that's they're talking about here this weird sublevel of stem like the levels of stem that they're talking about almost inception kind of like dream within a dream kind of things you know the principal is still kind of the same time is all wishy-washy chat every teen and Steve every teen oh no oh yeah but it's weird like the whole thing that where there was a part of me that was locked down in there what does that even mean a part of me locked in stem how did I like how do I feel that how does that affect me like across time and space like stem somehow reaches I mean I know stem is like is Wireless component to it where it was able to be like projected into people's minds or people's minds rather were projected into the stem system but moreover how after I beat ruvik and kind of destroyed the system how was it part of me still stuck in there like that's the fascinating thing people can be trapped in here like death like whatever you want to call it in the normal world of where you know what happens after death in here what happens after death maybe you get trapped deeper down than you think you know what I mean maybe people don't really die maybe I maybe all the deaths like you know I'm destiny like uh you uh you you die but you respond like that's part of the story maybe that's maybe it's similar here you know what I mean yeah I don't know more bullets not that I'm gonna get more bullets I've never even found bullets for that thing it's a good just got a crap tomb but now am I gonna do that when I don't have enough supplies alright anyway also I want to say they've done a really really really good job in this game of balancing how much ammo they give me versus what I need you know what I mean it's always been crisis but I've always had just enough to get through each obstacle and I can really appreciate that because that's a hard thing to do in a game like difficulty curves are hard and especially like I get better throughout this game like where I am now versus the beginning I'm weight higher skill wise Claire Hoffman they done with your tweaks okay I'm sending you the coordinates yeah but maybe maybe something in here is kind of the same but yeah Amma's been really good and the gameplay has been super fun I've never been bored whoa well here it is okay alright then you know what what is it it's a portable field stabilizer O'Neill must have been working on it before Theodore changed him it creates a small area of stabilization that should keep the fire away how small its circumference is about as big as a safe house big enough to protect me good how's it work drop it on my back tough part it's a prototype so it's a little temperamental I have to operate it ah you carry on is for it to go on the fritz while you're in a wall aflame I can't let you do that it's too dangerous so is staying here if you can't get inside besides I'm sick of hiding the only way we're gonna get through this is if we work together it's the only way to save Lille and what if you need emergency psychoanalysis ah who's gonna help you then you know just what to say to convince me Hoffmann of course I do I'm the team psychologist the team psychologist you might want to prepare for this let me know when you're ready to go okay well I prepared about as much as I can prepare so I don't know how much more I could possibly do thanks for the bag of supplies you're much better at scavenging than I am Hoffman's Journal this handwriting is hard to decipher but with effort you manage to read the most recent entry Liam transforming was horrifying yet fascinating it with far beyond our linguistic programming Theodore's words did more than influence Liam they physically torment transformed him no wonder Theodore wants to control over stem it his am flight is already formidable influential prowess the things he could do in here Sebastian personality isn't as weak as Liam's was but he still suffers from unresolved trauma Theodore will no doubt try to use his new abilities to break sebastian down I just hope that he's strong enough to resist oh oh I am sorry for reading your journal you're looking right at me so I'm assuming you knew that I was reading that hey is there any more soup in there I hope so hoping not a bomb yep okay got the few huh I Whangdoodle this machine so hard I got the fuses out of it waffle ooh ah that's a skull that wait let me get a good closer look at that one let me reload mmm here's my sniper rifle yeah let me get a closer look at that yep yeah let me look into that I can't look Oh trust me when I say it's probably a skull Wham any more skulls in there nope how about you you got a skull all right cool okay all right see you I'm gonna check upstairs real quick and then I'm gonna move on because I think that is all there is to this right now and then I think we're gonna get to the end of the game I'm pretty sure we're gonna reach the end of this game you have that painting not there anymore good but yeah nothing else no aah I thought there might have been like some color commentary of what's going on here all right here we go the real deal the real spanking a moonbow real wampa dee dum patty the real Whangdoodle flaying doodle let me go in the mirror first cuz I just need to craft up whatever I can I'm gonna use all of my crafting mats that I have left I must save one last time but is it I think this is it I think this is it it's not it then I'm gravely mistaken in its a problem but I think this is it maybe what else when I craft I don't know if I can upgrade anything more like I don't have any of the rifle bullets so what's even the point and I guess I'll just get him as I go along but Mike this is upgraded to maximum capacity the shotgun could use more firepower I guess but I don't think I have enough to get the smoke bomb there cuz that might be nice but I don't know how much use it'll be yeah I need I would need 550 i 410 I might have another opportunity later I'm gonna hold off on the upgrades I'm just gonna spend all my all this and the flamethrower poom bolts need those all of those lamb ok explosive bolts good they're good they're good there I've got one in the air I'm just gonna crap me up some handgun bullets but that's about it that's all I can do kind of like seven it's gotta be sparing about that try to soup as many people as possible and then we're gonna go hey nice guy final words of encouragement finally we're final words huh yeah yeah final words how am I ever good okay maybe not final words maybe this isn't the final thing because if it was the final thing then you would think that you would have some kind of like final finale okay maybe it's not the final thing maybe I'm this left I'm being an idiot maybe I'm being a big dumb do if you do okay maybe I'm being a big dumb doof okay I'm being a little overeager beaver okay but either way I gotta go for this I wish I had some coffee oh well I'm gonna do what you gotta do hey lady I'm ready Sebastian yes I am yeah I'm ready all right II often let's do this let's do this lead the way okay that's me I don't know if I'll be able to sneak with you uh holding that thing I'll try my best I'll try my best I'll try my best Wow flame okay I'll have to carry and operate it from here it should protect us from the fire but it won't stop those things in there from trying to kill us okay don't worry I'll take care of them I've got seven bullets to my name I got him you think I don't got him oh I got him look some magic yeah now that I

too kindly to anything happening not looking so good let me help you please yes hmm another sacrifice has gotten you this far damn it why did she have to die my question exactly I've lost them all the tragedy but they died honorably one can only hope the trade-off is worth it right it has to be otherwise they died for nothing I can't bear to think of that then you owe it to them to see this through to save her so that their sacrifice wasn't in vain yeah you're right your wrongs do this I need all the help I can get at this point yeah all the help we can get we can do this there's nothing wrong with being oh shut up every to every time every time whatever alright I'm gonna get more of aid skill because that's what I want I want to not be hit now I'm gonna get more way down before I spend my blood well should I get combat I'll never get enough for that does this face the fact I'm never gonna get enough for that but I might get enough for this the bullet cascade Tama ammo go for that next I just need 15,000 more but I don't even know if I'm gonna get enough for the end of the game but we'll do it we'll do what I got to do honor of combat skill no no way do I look like I need it

point I'll probably get e Audi but I don't know we'll see how it goes goddamn okay huh my heart's going like a million miles an hour just because of that last point was it wasn't because it was scary or anything but it was so stressful like it's so stressful like I know what I'm doing at the time and yet even thusly I gotta just wham bam thank you ma'am well please tell me there's a mirror in here somewhere nope okay when I have become the core oh and built this new world in my image reality will soon follow Moebius have already created footholds in all aspects of society and they were foolish enough to implant themselves with ticking time bombs inside their minds they consider themselves wolves in the rest sheep but I am the herder waiting to call the wolves when they're not looking once Union falls to me Mobius his days are numbered okay all right then you think they're gonna allow that why should why would you write that down why'd you write all that down that's the biggest question that I got right here all right okay so given the new knowledge that I have about the length of this game which is great cuz I love this game I'm having a tough time but I'm not failing that's the thing it's just taking me a little bit longer so thank you everybody so much for watching remember to pay respects for Hoffman is dearly departed and I really appreciate you guys being here I will get through this maybe not in the next episode but possibly depending I will be streaming tomorrow at 8 a.m. and there will be a new video coming out today at noon and thanks again for watching and as always I will see you in the next video buh-bye 
Hello, everybody! My name is Markiplier, and welcome to the "Gauntlet Of Ire". Now... From what I've seen, and what I've been told, and what I've read about this game, it's supposedly quite difficult. Now, I don't know how true that is, and I don't understand if it's going to be THAT bad... But I wanted to give it a chance to see - oh easy mode or hard mode. well I mean, what's the point of playing a rage game if you're not gonna play it in hard mode? Oh, it's locked. Oh, ok. So I got to do easy mode first. Okay! Alright. "Idiot-proof" Uh-huh. Okay! ... Uh! Oh! Alright. Well, this doesn't seem so bad. It's a beautiful game! You gotta admit. Okay... alright. A little - Why did you slow down!? Why - Why'd you slow down? Why would you have slowed down? It's obviously not idiot-proof if i got through because I'm no idiot. I'm no fool! Uh huh... Wait a minute... oo ee uu nOOOooooo uh Well ain't that a sack of shit, but that's alright. You know. I don't like the music going into this because it... suggests ...that I'm gonna go crazy... Okay Why is- no! What? Why is THAT like THAT? Why would that be like that? Ok... Yes, I know how to play. I guess I don't necessarily need to land on all of them. I can jump over some. Yeah! ooo Oooooh, so dicey. Wait, you're not like that now. Oh there you are. uu-NoOO!!! AUGH! God! I just gotta jump over that. Alright, easy-peasy. I know how to play the game. Thank you very much. I feel like I'm in preschool. Like, something about the primary colors and the fact that I'm rolling the ball down a...straightaway, it all kind of bring back to the idea that I'm just an idiot child, and I...DON'T...NOOOOO!!! (ping of death) What am I supposed to do??? How am I supposed to be able to make that jump? Like am I actually supposed to get through this? Why am I communist ball? (Really, Mark? -_-)  (So.. Everything Wrong With Gauntlet of Ire?) That's the things that I don't understand about this... Can the music please change? That's all I ask. Just a little bit of variation between everything that I got going on. whaAAaa How are you supposed to get through that? How are you supposed to get through that, huh? I mean I could j-ehhh, I don't think I could jump over that. Yes, "Idiot-proof", I'm aware. I'm an idiot, and it's not idiot-proof. I get it. (To be fair, Mark..) It's...it's different. It IS different. It's different every time! But only slightly! Enough to infuriate you! Ooh, making the jump! NOOOOO ....How uh.... ..How would you do that? No. No! Why.. Why..? Wh- WHY!? Why did you do that? Why did you do that? Why did you do that? WHY? Can I jump on my graves...? Is that something I could do? Can I dance on my own grave, please? That's something that I'd much appreciate in this scenario. If I could just.... uH.. ..make this-YES! Why? Because its different! ITS DIFFERENT! Wait- No! WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! IT'S DIFFERENT! You changed it! You changed it... You made it random.. Why would you make it random? That's the most infuriating thing that I- *DONG* I-!! What are- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! What does 'get donged' mean?! Why would I 'get donged?' It's different! Why are you different? Why is it different? That doesn't make any sense! Usually its something that you could learn, and get better at, oh- *DONG* I got donged... Why don't I just jump over that? Uuuh.. I can change while I'm jumping.. Okay.....alright... Silly billy.. Uh oh.... (x2) got ya, I got your number now Oop- oopa doopa doopa doop... Oopa doopa doopa doop...! A-oopa doopa doopa doop! Oop- Uh oh uh oh uh oh- EURGH Ah, too far! NO- not far enough! (maniacal laughter) I got you. I got ya got ya. I got ya. How would you be able to do that anyway? Well of course you do this! Stupid idiot. What do you think I am? Exactly what I said you were? Shut up! Also, you're ugly, and I'm handsome! I'm gonna jump on that...! I'm gonna drop on that...! Okay. We're good Oh, I don't like- the visuals are breaking my brain! I am NOT GOOD! There we go, easy peasy, lemon squeeze me!  Training wheels come off? Okay! Impossible? Says you, that's I'm- ha-..? oh.. wha...? Ha- ha- what what What- what- how? What- how'd you- this doesn't make any sense! Whady- What are you- what are you talking about? Huh, ah  just kill me kill me kill me -

Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and welcome back to Doki Doki Literature Club! Okay! Alright! Everybody hold onto your horses 'cause I got the poem of your dreams right here. Alright, who do I show it to first? Hey Monika! EEEEEY Monika baby! Hang on I better save on this one. It's a genius poem. Can't let the genius go to -- HEY Monika! Hey come here! I should start with Monika. Yesterday she seemed eager to read my poem and I want her to know I'm putting in effort. Puttin' in effort, Monika! "Hi, Morp!" Hi, Monika. "Having a good time so far?" Sure, okay. Ah... yeah. "Good, glad to hear it!" "By the way, since you're new and everything.. If you ever have any suggestions for the club, like new activities or things we can do better.. I'm always listening!" And then I'll ignore you. And punch you in the face for daring to change my beautiful club. "Don't be afraid to bring things up, okay?" Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Of course I'll be afraid to bring things up. I'm much better off just going with the flow until I'm more settled in. "AAAAAnyway.." "Wanna share your poem with me?" It's kind of embarrassing but I guess I have to. "aHAHAhahaHahahAHA!" "Don't worry, Morp. We're all a little embarrassed today, you know?" You know, I don't trust you. But that's okay. "But it's the sort of barrier that we'll all learn to get past soon." Yea, that's true. I hand Monika my poem. "...Mhm. Great job, Morp!" "I was going 'OoOoh' in my head while reading it." Not out loud though, I would never do that. "It's really metaphorical." "I'm not sure why but I didn't expect you to go for something so deep." "I guess I underestimated you." Hey! Sure! Was it the vivacious? It was probably the vivacious. It's easiest for me to keep everyone's expectations low. That way it always counts when I put in some effort. "HA! That's not very fair." "Well, I guess it worked out anyway." "You know that Yuri likes this kind of writing, right?" "Writing that's full of imagery and symbolism." "Unlike Sayori, who likes simple and direct words to describe happiness and sadness." "Yuri likes when readers are left to derive their own meaning out of it." "It's very challenging to write like that effectively." "Both allowing people to get something out of it just by feel.. Or letting them deeply analyze all of the nuances." "It can take years of practice-- which I'm assuming Yuri has at this point." I never really asked though, I'm sure I'm nowhere NEAR her level yet. "Ah, don't worry so much about that." "You do your own thing." "Just keep exploring and learn by trying new things." I'm sure I'll end up trying different things a lot! It could take a while before I'd feel comfortable doing this. "That's okay!" "I'd love to see you try new things." "That's the best way to find the kind of style that suits you!" "Everyone else might be a little bit biased towards their own kinds of styles.. But I'll always help you find what suits you the most." "So don't force yourself to write the way everyone else wants you to write." "It's not like you have to worry about impressing them or anything." "Ahaha!" Okay, I don't like this. "Anyway, you- you want to read my poem now?" "Don't worry, I'm not very good." You sound pretty confident for someone who claims to not be very good. "Well, that's 'cuz I have to sound confident." "That doesn't mean I always feel that way, you know." I see. Well, let's read it, then. Ah. "Hole in the Wall" "It couldn't-" What kind of hole are we talking about? "It couldn't have been me. See, the direction the spackle protrudes. A noisy neighbor? An angry boyfriend? I'll never know. I wasn't home. I peer inside for a clue. No! I can't see. I reel, blind, like a film left out in the sun. But it's too late. My retinas. Already scorched with a permanent copy of the meaningless image. It's just a little hole. It wasn't too bright. It was too deep. Stretching forever into everything. A hole of infinite choices I realize now that I wasn't looking in I was looking out. And he, on the other side, was looking in." Beautiful. "So what do you think?" Oh! [kissing noise] I've never been so excited about a hole in my life! Oh it's a beautiful thing! Hmm. It's very freeform, if that's what you'd call it. Sorry, I'm not really the right person to ask for feedback. "Hahaha, it's okay." "Yeah, that kind of style has gotten pretty popular nowadays." "That is, a lot of poems have been putting emphasis on the timing between words and lines." "When performed out loud, it can be really powerful." What was the inspiration behind this one? "Ah. Well, I'm not sure if I know how to put it." "I guess you could say that I had some kind of epiphany recently." "It's been influencing my poems a bit." An epiphany? "Yeah, something like that." "I'm kinda nervous to talk about deep stuff like that because it's kind of coming on strongly." "Maybe after everyone is better friends with each other." "Anyway. Here's Monika's writing tip of the day!" "Sometimes when you're writing a poem or story, your brain gets too fixated on a specific point." "If you try so hard to make it perfect, then you'll never make any progress." "Just force yourself to get something down on paper, and tidy it up later." "Another way to think about it is this." "If you keep your pen in the same spot for too long, you'll just get a big dark puddle of ink." "So just move your hand and go with the flow." "That's my advice for the day." "Thanks for listening~" Alright. Cool. Alright. Who should I show my poem to next? I don't know... I don't... How about no one? Oh NatSUUKII! Sayooori? Natsuki. I haven't talked to you yet. Eeeey, waddup? "Well, it's about what I expected from someone like you." What?! Excuse you! That's a little blunt. "Well, excuse me." "It's not like I said that was bad." "It just didn't evoke any emotions." So basically it's not cute enough for your tastes? "Do you want to get smacked?" I'll pass. "*sigh*" "Well anyway, I guess I need to show you mine." "Not that you'll like it." "Eagles Can Fly" "Monkeys can climb Crickets can leap Horses can race Owls can seek Cheetahs can run Eagles can fly People can try But that's a-bout it." Aw, that's beautiful! That's beautiful! I like it. I really like it! I actually like it. "I told you that you weren't going to like it." I like it! "What?" "Just be honest!" I am. Why are you so convinced that I wouldn't like it? "WELL-" UUUHHH- "Because!" "Everyone in high school thinks that writing has to be all sophisticated and stuff." "So people don't even take my writing seriously." But isn't the point of poems for people to express themselves?" Your writing style wouldn't make your message any less valid. "Yeah! Exactly!" "I like it when it's easy to read but it hits you hard." "Like in this poem." "Seeing everyone around you do great things can be really disheartening.. So I decided to write about it." Yeah, I understand. "But the other nice thing about simple writing is that it puts more weight on the wordplay." "Like I set up for a rhyme at the end, but then made it fall flat on purpose." "It helps bring out the feeling in the last line." So you did. I guess more went into it than I realized. "That's what it means to be a pro!" "I'm glad you learned something." "Didn't expect that from the youngest one here, did you?" Yeah, I guess not. I decide to humor her with the last comment. I don't really care how old everyone is, but if Natsuki is feeling proud then I won't take that away from her. Aw. How about Sayori? Sayori! Hey Sayooori! SaYaOwori! "This is a good poem, Morp!" "Are you sure it's your first time?" Of course! It's not that good. Am I the kind of guy who would be writing poems in his spare time? "Hehe, I guess you're right." "You're pretty terrible." "But that's why it impressed me!" "Well, to be honest.. I was afraid that you wouldn't do it seriously." "Or that you wouldn't write one at all." "I'm really happy just that you wrote one." "It reminds me of how you really are part of the club now." Not to mention the fact that I'm standing in front of you in the club room? Eh, well of course. I'm not really into it yet, but that doesn't mean I'll break my promise. "See?" "It's like I said before, Morp.. Deep down, you're not selfish at all, you know?" That's a backhanded compliment... "Trying new things like this for other people.. That's something that only really good people do." Thanks... I guess. I'm not sure if Sayori sees the full picture of my motive here. Then again, I can't deny that she's part of the reason I joined. Knowing how much this means to her and all. Yeah... "and I'm gonna make sure you have lots of fun here, okay?" Oh! Yeah alright. Hang on, wait. I gotta save again. I don't know why, I just gotta save. [laughs] [laughs again] I-- I-- sure. Okay. I can't really see you as being cranky anyway. You got it Sayori. Huh. Interesting. Alright well it's just Yuri left. This hasn't taken a dark turn yet, but I got a funny feeling about it. Ugh. Her mouth just grows exponentially and she has to keep that shit contained. You've got great thumbs after all. Alright so you're a ghost, is that what you're saying? Your're a ghost. I get it, I see it ghost girl. Okay. I know. I get it. Ah Morp very stupid! You need to understand this about Morp. Morp very a dummy. Eh? blooh! [weird mouth noises] Are you a ghost? Your thumb felt very solid. Your thumbs... You got real teaching thumbs. Okay! Alright. Morp liked it! Morp liked it a lot! Which yours was not. [orgasm/mouth sound] [weird sound] [continues making odd noises that may be confused with certain sexual sounds] [throat sound resembling "huh?!"] UUGH! EEIY! [sound resembling a deep screaming sheep] [laughs] Uh-- wha--? Natsuki! My boobs have been the same size! DDUUUR! Hang on, I just gotta save. There's conflict here. UUGH! UUUH? UUuUuUGH?! Oh! Oh boy! Okay, conflict! Hang on. Alright, I gotta think about his one. Uh. Put on my thinking pants! Oh wait I'm not wearing pants... MREH. MMH. Mm. M. NNAlright okay alright. Well. Okay well Yuri's full of herself. Yuri's full of herself. She's being a little uppity. Being a little up... itty... Natsuki was defensive off the bat... But Yuri was dismissive off the bat. That's the two juxtapositions here. Like, neither of them were right. I mean they're right in their own ways but obviously I can't take a side on it. Maybe Sayori can help me... Sayori! Help! Please! Heeelp! Help! I really don't care what their opinions of me are! UUURF. UGH. Be-- Because Morp's so hot! [laughs] Big and beautiful! Oh! Monika! Why do I have a funny feeling this is going to take a horrifying turn? Ah! It's all your fault! It's your fault Morp! It's your fault. I might be in love with them! In DA club! [laughs suggestively/creepily] Whap whap. Righty-ho! Something's not right here... Something's not right... HA! POOF! Poof! Poof! Gotta go with poof! POOF! Uh... analysis. Uh.. PLEAsure... Um In-- No-- Ah-- Lazy. Uh Sssspecial! Uh Vitality. Um Uh. Eeeessence. Uh BUNNY! Um Uh Unrestrained. Um PURE! Uh Uwuwah... Tenacious... INCONGRUENT. Uh PApa. Um, ah, Adventure! Uuuhahhh... Socks.

BREF Uh, disown. Uuuuh SUNNY! Uuuum um Boop! boop! Boop! Boop! Boop. Boop. Got it. Okay. Alright. I don't know where this is going. Hehe, you're brain real simple Sayori. What the hell? A cookie! I'm gonna save real quick... Just something doesn't seem right... Something doesn't seem right about this. I just dabble in a few Beethoven's and some... [trails off into mumbles] ... Motzart's... [breathes in] Anyway... [burps] OoOOOOH EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY Aw.... I've felt that feel many times. Okay. I tried it out with Yuri... With our thumbs almost touching. You'll make me feel WEEEEIRD. Ew. Morp just meant that Morp hasn't seen you at your full power! Well it is called 'Parfait Girls' so one would surmise that baking was a predominant feature in the thing. Yeah. Oh! How adorable! That's cutesy. That's a cutesy wootesy. It's not, I swear! "I guess it's fun sharing something with--" someone you like. Oh, oh, "Something you like with someone else." Sorry, slip of the tongue. A little 'froity and floop'. I think that's what they call it... MER. I don't have any friends. Oh you really don't have friends, that's sad. Geez. Like you! You loser! Me am loser! You am loser, we am losers! Right? You get it. Someone who is an even bigger loser than I am, if you know what I mean. Your life long dream. Morp coming and reading your manga. Your dream come true you're welcome. But Morp pretty sure it does! Okay. OKAY EVERYONE! SHUT YOUR TRAPS! DING DONG BING BONG Time to read your poems! Here Monika doth decree that it's time! To do the reading of the poems thusly that is now! You all ready? Get to your-- your ready positions I guess. Right hang on. Excuse my butt in your face, I just had to strike a pose... I'm-- ah-- a grown adult. I don't wanna know. Uh, I do like that face! Oookay that's too normal. I don't know why. But somethin'-- Something's off. Something's off, I can tell! I have an intuition about these things. But I'm all out of time for this episode so thank you everybody so much for watching Let me know what you think in the comments below! Write another poem down there if you would. And uh, I will read them. I haven't had a chance to yet, because I've been recording a lot, but I will read those poems.

Hello, everybody. My name is Markiplier, and welcome to I wanna run the Marathon. Now, I wanna run the Marathon is a version of "I wanna be the Guy", and I wanna be the Guy is a game that's gonna make you rage your intestines out.

Oh... Tit my sprinkles... Oh God Alright, run. Run, Markiplier, run. This is a terrible place to be- AAHHHHH Sorry, just need to get my vocal lessons out of the way Man, you ever just remember how much you suck every day? Day in and day out? You're just constantly reminded that you're just a garbage human being and that everything you do is always gonna be trash so why even bother in life? Do you remember that, do you ever think that guys?  You ever look in the mirror and just are recognized by nothing? except your own failures as y- ohhh -as you go through life day by day, being reminded of all the things that you didn't do right in your life?  You ever- *cries as he slowly loses his sanity* This is gonna be a loong night by the way, so everybody better buckle up You better get some goddamn snacks because it's gonna be, ohh, it's gonna be a major overhaul Before I get out of here, ooh yeah *orgasm of sorrow* *random accent* Like a gentle butterfly oof, I slam myfelf- faith- fathe firtht into deeaafth...

Ay-ay-ay-ay... one of these days I'll get it in my brain for the timing of this. Nope, not that time. You know, I said one of these days; that day could be infinity time from now, when I actually learn my lesson. Ohh, if I could just get my brain to work, you know You know some people say you only use 10% of your brain? I'm operating at a cool 2%. It's basically like the consistency of milk inside my noggin, and it's just as delicious *whispers* oh god dammit-- Ohhh God I hesitated, why did I hesitate? I just need to not hesitate on that one moment. That's all I got to do Aaall I gotta do-- ohhh oh You're-- ffffff Frick. You fricker.  Ooh, yes, okay! Uh, ooh!  Tricked ya I'm just gonna... tricked ya-- ohhhh! Ha hah! What am I doing here? What am I even doing? What- how are you gonna mess with me next, is my answer.

Oh really? Okay, alright y-- Ookay, alright. Oh What's weird about this game is I start to become dissociated from the character, like for some reason my brai- ughh, my brain isn't quite like translating that this guy is what I'm controlling. For some reason every time I respond, it like throws me off. Ohh man, just to give another excuse to how my brain doesn't work right. Now how in thee hell... Does it expect me to do this? Okay AAH!

[Tape] If you are playing this tape, that means that not only have you been checking outside at the end of every shift, as you were instructed to do, But also that you have found something that meets the criteria of your special obligations under paragraph 4. [Mark] *worried* Hm...
[Tape] Follow these instructions, document response times, then safely secure the space before leaving. [Mark] Huh?

It's time to take your career into your own hands! [Mark growls weirdly] You saved money your whole life. Great! Now it's time to put all your eggs into one basket, and take a huge gamble on your future. A gamble that comes with a 100% chance of success in some cases. [Mark] Purple Guy! [Narrator] What are we talking about? [Mark] NNOHOHO!
[Narrator] We're talking about becoming a "Fazbear Entertainment" Franchisee [Narrator] We're talking about becoming a "Fazbear Entertainment" Franchisee. That's right! Restaurant Ownership and Management. Something almost anyone can do with a limited degree of success. Sure, it's a lot of money to invest, but everyone's doing it. And that means it's safe and lucrative. With your initial investment, you'll receive everything you need to get started. Including a small room, some tables, and electricity. But don't forget about the money you have left over after buying your franchise package. Use it to decorate, buy a stage, buy attractions and animatronics and much much more. Now, let's take a look at a few things that will help you get started as a "Fazbear Entertainment Franchisee." Such as, Atmosphere! Making sure your establishment has an inviting atmosphere is essential to bringing in new customers. *Mark laughs in the background*
Making sure your establishment has an inviting atmosphere is essential to bringing in new customers. *Mark still laughing* *Mark still laughing*
Entertainment! Having a lot of entertainment value in your restaurant will ensure that costumers come back. [Mark] Okay! Bonus revenue! [Mark] Oh! Coin-operated games and attractions can generate additional revenue during the day. [Mark] Yeah!
[Narrator] Which means more money in your pocket, ready for reinvestment. [Mark] Okay.
[Narrator] Health and safety. There may be times where you purchase something of questionable quality, and we don't blame you. Cutting corners is just good business. But there are steps you can take to ensure you don't get sued for it. And that brings us to... Liability. Being a thrifty shopper is smart. But be aware that buying things on sale comes with a certain amount of risk. Aside from the daily risk of lawsuits, There's also the risk that something might be hiding inside whatever you just purchased with that steeply discounted price tag. [Mark] Wha..? Of course, that would only be a serious danger if there were something outside that's been trying to get in for months now. *Mark laughs nervously*
We are not confirming it to be the case. *Mark laughs nervously* This concludes the amount of help we are legally obligated to provide. *Mark laughing*
This concludes the amount of help we are legally obligated to provide. Remember, you are now the face of the newly rebranded Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. *Mark laughing*
Remember, you are now the face of the newly rebranded Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Remember, you are now the face of the newly rebranded Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. [Mark] That's me, baby. [Mark] That's me, baby.
[Narrator] Wear that smile with pride and let's make some money. [Narrator] Wear that smile with pride and let's make some money. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for disappearance, death, or dismemberment. [Mark] Ooooh... Okay, alright, okay, okay...ah. (Mark mumbling) Two-Step guide to restaurant management! Use Catalog Mode to purchase item, animatronics and other supplies. Use Blueprint Mode to place [trails off unintelligibly] Okay ! Alright ! Okay! Great ! So, it really is a pizzeria tycoon !
Let's get started ! [Mark Laughing]Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you cute little piece of shit
[Narrator] Let's see how much cash you have left over [Mark Laughing again] 
[ Narrator] after purchasing your franchise package. Great. That should be more than enough.
Now let's get started. [Mark] Alright
[Narrator] On your left, are your product catalogs.
[Mark] Wow
[Narrator] You can unlock more expensive catalogs by simply purchasing items for your pizzeria. [Mark] Whoa Use the arrows in the bottom right of the item window to browse the products for each catalog [Mark] Wow When you're finished shopping, click the button labeled "Blueprint mode" to place your items.
[Mark Oohs and Ahhs] You can switch back and forth between catalog mode and blueprint mode as often as you like. 
[Mark laughs quietly] before opening your doors to the public. When you're ready to open your restaurant for business for the day, click the button labeled "Finished" in blueprint mode. Give it a try and do some shopping. [Mark] Wow Wow, ok , Alright It really is! Oho, look at this! Look at all this, stuff-- a fan!? Hell yeah! *Giddily* A pick--a--duck! Oh, aw, "Bucket Bob" unavailable, but I want "Bucket Bob"! "Bucket Bob", ah, "Bucket Bob". Oh my go-, "Mr. Can-Do", "Mr. Hugs". *Mark Laughing again* *Mark Laughing* No. 1 Crate Pan Stan Paper Pals, I'm going to buy them! Oh ho ho hell yeah Paper Pals! There's a liability risk on that one, Mr. Hugs is a little dangerous, been thinking...ohhh this is amazing Oh yeah, hang on We got to get the fan, that's uh, that's uh, that's a must. I love the duck pond, that's like a gotta have and then a stage. *Mark happy singing?* ok, alright Well, let's place this garbage *Mark Laughing* then we will deal-- oh my god, oh my god Yes, yes, yes! Sponsorship offer? *Reading sponsorship* "Fiztime Popsoda Have a poppin' good time with Fiztime Pop". Fiztime Pop inc. is offering to pay for advertising in your establishment----- Accept. Yes, yes, how do I do that? I don't---*Mumbles while laughing* How do I do that? ok I don't have an animatronic All right that's where that will go Faz-Rating has gone up No risk, absolutely---- Play test [Soothing, cute music]
[Various "oho" and "ayy" sounds from Mark] I got good, Point, I think. I got a lot of points
[music continues] [music cuts off suddenly] They were staring at me, I don't like that. Ok, alright. Well I got a whole lot of nothin' *Mark chuckles* Whole lot of dick diddley Alright, well Ok, alright, good, great Ok!
[Narrator begins speaking again] Your restaurant- [Narrator] Is now officially open. yay?
[Narrator] Awesome. [Narrator] That doesn't mean your job is finished, however. You have a lot of work to do, while patrons eat their pizza in the other room. [Mark] Wuh-
[Narrator] From your terminal, you have supplies to buy, Papers to print, and repairs to make. Once you've taken care of all the items on your to-do list, You can log off for the day, and get out of there. Money for supplies and repairs comes out of petty cash, so don't worry about it coming out of your pocket. We've got you covered. The only money you have to worry about is if you choose to upgrade any of the equipment in your office. [Narrator] Now on to other matters,
[Mar]} Uhhhhhh [Narrator cont.] Something to be aware of is that the ventilation system, and your terminal, are pretty loud, and may prevent you from hearing things in adjoining air vents. That won't be a problem if there's nothing in the vents, however, if you feel that something might BE in the vents, *Mark honks Funtime Freddy's nose*
you have a few tools at your disposal to protect yourself. You can shut off your terminal and the ventilation system at any time To decrease the amount of attention you are drawing to yourself. Also, shining your light directly into a vent will most likely prevent anything from jumping out. You also have three tools available from the terminal itself. There is a motion detector, an audio decoy, and a secondary ventilation unit. Keep in mind, however, that you can only have one of these active at any given time. Now get to it! Simply log off when you've completed your tasks for the day, and you can go get some coffee. [Mark] WAH-
[Electronic powering down noise] Ooh? What did I do? I didn't mean to do that. G-alright, okay, I'm, I'm boned. Uh, alright! Well! [Loud music begins blaring]
[Mark] Oh no! An ad!? Oh shit- [Mark laughs nervously while music cuts off] [Mark screams] Okay, alright we're fine alright we're fine I'm gonna stop screaming now. Unclog toilets? I don't even know why-why are those a thing? Wh- Why is that a thing? Aaa, what am I printing and where!? [mark moans in fear] [mark sobs quietly] I thought it was just gonna be fun and happy! Oh, god, I hate this, I hate this, oh, I hate this. That is a long time to print a flyer. Okay, I guess we're done. Do I have to do- Do I have to do all of these? Before I leave? Is that what you said I had to do because I don't, really remember. Wuh-DAMMIT GODDAMMIT!! [quiet mechanical printer noises] Okay, so-wait, did you hear that? Wait.
[printer noises continue] Wait. Wait. What is that? Did you hear it? [softly] wuh- What is that? I don't know, I don't know anything that's going on here, this is completely different from anything I've ever seen in any other Five Nights at Freddy's before! I ain't about this shit! I ain't about to deal with this shit! I ain't about to lose my life!!! wuh-Why is it taking so long to sca- Why does it take so long to scan. [Machine powering down noise] Okay, everything's fine Uh. Uh. Everything's fine. "Everything's fine," I keep yelling at myself. Everything's absolutely fine. Everything is one hundred percent fine. OKAY, DID I DO ALL MY TASKS? Equipment...uhh log off. [Mark] I'M DONE, I'M OUTTIE!
[Narrator] Great job! Looks like you're getting the hang of this! [Mark yells in victory]
[Narr.] Now let's just focus on getting you through your first week. [M] Okay...
[Narr.] There's a big party here Saturday. [Narr.] And you should view that day as your ultimate test. Make it through Saturday and you will have proven yourself as the successful entrepreneur that we all know you can be. 
[Mark] Thank you? [Mark] Thank you very much? I think? I'm pretty sure? [Ominous background ambience begins]
[M] Ooh. [Tape] Congratulations on completing your first day. [T] However, your job isn't over just yet. There is another aspect to your end of day routine. And that is inspecting and salvaging any animatronics found in the alley outside the back door. Things are found here quite often, and while we aren't sure why, what we do know is that they can be used for parts. Which can mean a much needed revenue boost before starting your next day. [Mark whimpers "Why?"]
[T] Of course, [T] As with everything else in this line of work, those benefits come with risk. The safest thing to do is to throw it back outside, but then, you get no money for the salvage. Choose to keep it, and you run the risk of certain negative consequences. Namely, death... Should the item in question not be as docile as it first appeared. If you do decide to try to salvage it, then you must complete the maintenance checklist. During this testing phase, check on the animatronic frequently. If you feel that it is becoming unstable, use the taser provided to you. You can use it three times without damaging the hardware. Every use over three, however, will decrease the item's salvage value. Before you is an animatronic found in the back alley. We are unsure of it's origins. It is your job to complete the maintenance checklist before claiming it as salvage. Or, if you choose to, you can throw it back into the alley where you found it and forfeit payment. Please make your choice now. [Mark] Uh. Alright, we'll salvage it! [Tape] You have chosen to proceed with the maintenance checklist. [Mark] Yeah [Tape Man] Remember, use your company issued taser to return the animatronic to a neutral state if you feel that it's becoming unstable or aggressive. You can only use it three times before it begins to damage the animatronic, and decrease its value. [T] Begin audio prompt in 3...2...1. [Strange, warbling mechanical noise] [Mark] I'm watchin you!

[yells] [banging on door]
Okay hi, you actually coming in-? OOH! Okay good job Bonnie, go FUUUUMP yourself. Right? Ooh that's- that's the opposite of good! [sings] I'm sleeping, I'm sleeping! Can't you hear me snoooring? [child screams in the game] Well that's interesting in my house where I don't think I have any other brothers or sisters that could scream at that pitch. [sings softly] Close the door, go away. [normal voice] I need to get up right now URGH! Oh it is... oh hi, hello. Oh my god (x4) That's terrifying, holy fucking shit. [yells] YESSSSSS! [yells more] YESSS! Yeah this is weird, alright. I don't know what it means by "hide", there's nowhere to hide here! It's a big empty room, where am I gonna go? Am I gonna slide into the bookshelf? Am I gonna slip under the couch? File myself away under "Fubbernucked"? Boy oh boy, oh bo- oh boy! Oh bo- oh boned. Oh boned I am. Oh say can you see how boned I am in my butt. [sings] Then go over to the other side. Ohhh hi! Freddy boy! Freddy boyyy! Freddy boy, how you doin' Freddy boy? Bonnie might be coming down and Bonnie might bash open those doors and bash in my skull with her big Bonnie bonnigan. [gasps] Hi... Oh that's baaad!
[jumpscare] Ow... Look. Imma risk a look. Ooh that's a bad look! [yells] That's not a good sound. Ohh... 
[loud jumpscare]
[yells] Okay, am I dead? I'm not dead (x4). That's right, you just scare me. [sings] But that's okayy. [sings] Don't listen to the noises of the night. AGHHH! I'm fucked! Oh they're- oh I'm fucked, I'm fucked, I'm fucked! [jumpscare]
[yells] Fuckleduckle. What am I doing? Wait- woah! (x4). That's- HEY! The fuck is that? Oh my god, I don't know what's happening. But I don't like it. It's 5AM and I'm too close to this to be bullshitted! Man, as soon as Freddy goes I'm diving in that corner and [unintelligible]. Freddy go go go, go Freddy, go Freddy, go Freddy go! G-go Freddy go! Yes!! [yells] What the fuck?! (x3) What the fuck? (x3) Someone's at my window! Get up! (x4) Hi, are you-? Please don't be Foxy. Oh, get that! Okay. I have a funny feeling... [screams] The wrong feeling!! Noo! Oh that's not good, that's the opposite of good. There's... I- did I bug it by getting a two-fer? No, there! Off to the left! Why are you there again?! [screams] Was that a two-fer or was that a one-off?
[jumpscare]
[screams loudly] Okay Foxy, no no no! Foxy no no! [jumpscare]
[yells] I didn't think I actually did that, I was so concentrated! I was so flocused! Ah good yes, you put me in the shitty toilet! Oh good, thank you for that, why is this in MY basement? Hello? Oooh hi! Hello! Who are you? Ooooh! [very loud jumpscare]

Good thing you got thurplus of pipe because that's my favorite thing to have when I'm in the dark basement and fearing for my LIFE! No way, no how. There's no way in hell that I would ever look back because if I were to look back, and when there's a door right in front of me... Okay I looked back! You don't know what that did but I did it! [running footsteps approach]
[screams] [loud jumpscare]
[screams] I shouldn't have looked back... I got this, I got this. I know what to do, I know what to do. Oh like a butterfly, like a butterFLYYY! Holy shit, I saw that movement! Oh, no door! Oh we're in no-door land! Oh no door, no door! Hold the door no-door, we ain't going nowhere hodor! "Flash him 12 times to beat" What? Whaaat? What does that even mean; I gotta flash him? I gotta give him the ol' 'nip show'? Huh? The fuckin- I can't MOVE!! I don't know how to move! [screeches] Oh, hi. [loud jumpscare] Who's there? Oh no RUN!! No, oh you were- it was right! I was correct, but I didn't do it right! Oh boy [screams] [loud jumpscare] I just- I just shocked him, he didn't go back! Oh, where'd he go? Oh he's here isn't he. Oh hey, woah hey! Wh-heyyy!] Oh my god! (x5) If I look away, do you just go away? Hi! Aaaayyyy! [jumpscare]
Oh, that's my head in your mouth. I am dead. 
hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome back to the evil within - part 2 welcome back everybody hello I hope this is coming to you right on time it's not late again don't say it's late because I've gotten a lot of stuff to do here and we've got to get underway we've got a lot of radio signals that are on the horizon and we've gotten a lot of zombies to show the menu to when we get to them and then we got to sneak our way through this whole village and then we'll rescue our daughter which I still question very much at this point I am still not allowed to present sure about how that goes so bye bye Liam Oh potatoes okay I'm gonna go over here I still don't have enough weapon parts to be able to upgrade everything and and and I don't have a lot of bullets so I gotta use my knife as much as possible track down the source of girls voices do community know I'm gonna do the thing where I got to find the other guys and I got to find a sniper rifle repair part to this sniper rifle so that we can go over here and shoot people from a distance because that would be the ideal and I imagine I imagine that there's a lot of things in this game that are gonna seem like very reminiscent of Silent Hill because I didn't do nothing do you want to hear the menu I can tell you about our specials all right hello you over there oh no what oh look at me in the bushes I'm so sneaky oh look at me oh there you are geez alright well okay what are you doing over there is there a light in that butcher's there's something that I want to grab all right excuse me sir sir sir excuse me how is this not a so I know come on I was in the bush I was in the fob stuck on a lamp stuck look okay never mind you know I'm gonna freak out for a bit here because that wasn't supposed to happen I guess when I'm two inches from the from the guy's face it's pretty hard to miss me so I can't really be my fault there all right go get stuck on a lamp all right we're at it we don't have Coke is Pepsi okay there you go got that what a good start to this what a good start what a good game player I am oh yeah the ax that's right it's a one-time-use thing that's handy though because they do like to grab me oh you know you know what I could use after that you know after a rough and tough encounter with a Zombo I could use a piping hot cup of joe actually I'm not gonna go for that because I don't even know if it's respawn yet I know in my mind I've been playing this like it's been 24 hours since the last time I played this but in the game's mind I'm an idiot and literally had a cup of coffee like two minutes ago so not gonna do that anything in his garbage can anything in those boxes anything in those boxes yeah was that what just happened I know but I miss mass these boxes up who a Fu's a cannot be used to repair broken fuse boxes well then what's the point what's the point what's the point I stupid that's stupid there must be at some point in the game a fuse box and I'm I know what I got to do I got to go over here though warden crossbow yeah I'm gonna go over here and here so everybody hold on to your pants geez I'm gonna get to the signal let me get by these guys over here yeah all right battle take that take these over here okay that guy's dead there's a couple zombies on the rise and there's at 1k pounding someone away on the roof over there Hey you all right you all right no you want a bottle you probably hit you from here looks like I can't I got a wicked arm and I could throw real good that's not what I meant to do excuse me just wanted to wave at them with my axe can I ask you a couple questions I'm good time these guys tripping on ecstasy or something all right so I know I can probably sneak snug this guy don't turn around turn around I know a lot of all them might see me sneaks nang'k you but I I got him I got him I got him come on come on come yeah it's a stupid desert yeah keyline is our specialty oh I'm on fire now that was a mistake shoulda got my coffee I am very hurt oh that's not good I gotta find a bush now let me find my bush now God please my bush please please God my bush please wow I didn't know I didn't know that death would set me on fire I had no understanding that would send me ablaze ah damn it I'm all the way back is there coffee no I'm not even coffee already god dammit of such a fool I'm such a goddamn alright that's my bad that's my bad that's my bad alright that's not even a difficulty thing that's just me being an idiot I should have noticed like he got fired as an what happened if I stab guy with fire in hand and I have fire in hand or mi have fire in face is that what me am have alright look at this oh god do this again do the oh ow gotta hide in the bush I just realized that like for the past minute I've been screaming my bush my bush please please dear God my bush and out of context that's real weird no don't don't do nothing are you naked oh god this guy's naked too all right well don't come near my bush that's all I gotta say all right well I should turn off my lamp I'm not gonna make that am I you gonna turn around before hey I'm gonna use I'm gonna actually use a bottle here go right there what was that oh are you I can't believe you right now I'm not gonna come up with a new food-related murderers saying is Pepsi okay it's much less much less interesting juncture oh sorry everybody this is off to a - to high-quality start I thought I was gonna keep it like a little tepid and you know my normal like markiplier lowbrow little sip whatever the hell is going on here but uh we're starting off with a bag it's it's it's good it's good it's real good it's real good so so the lesson of the day is if it got fire in their hand don't melee kill them because that fire will suddenly then be on you and that's bad and you can't run as well if you dabble in just that's another hilarious anecdote all right what was they doing they're looking for there's something just right around the corner here so I should go oh it's a freaking RV no no no roofie it's not an RV at all that's a Humvee that's no RV that's home that's all hum no our God all right no that's the fire one but the rest of them don't have fire so that's see that's literally the only one with fire so I can I can understand that if that one came after me then suddenly they would throw fire at all the world just kind of ends here look at all these oh jeez I didn't notice the corpse at first but look at all these whoa yes it's some of the weapons that I very rarely used in the first game this one was particularly devastating if you didn't miss and I think I remember I missed a lot all right most types of warden crossbow bolts full function as proximity mines after being fired onto a surface Sebastian will not trigger proximity mines firing a warden crossbow bolt onto a surface with another surface medially opposite will create a tripwire trap a red laser will aim showing where the tripwire will be created alright the crossbow bolt releases electrical current which arcs from enemy to enemy stunning them and sometimes knocking them down it can also be broken fired it broken fuse boxes and pools of water for special environmental effects shock bolts can be crafted by combining fuses and gunpowder fallen enemies can be stomped to finish them off alright that's weird okay how did this guy if that vans a-rockin nevermind oh it's oh it's trying to teach me oh it's one of those teaching scenes well hey hey diddly hummed oh wait how do I get my crossbow out let me put that three all right I got and OH gather all ye gentlemen from around the world alright turn around and no I meant nuts ground I'm in that the ground god dammit I meant at the ground god dammit why'd you have to catch that with your face you freaking asshole alright I gotta stop who you're making me look so bad I'm not bad that guy just my name is too good that's what it was my a mush a guy go uh hello sir fast we're not open yet Oh God what an ass I've made of myself oh what a douche nozzle I meant to aim at the water I'm in a bush you can't it's my sneaking bush you can't find me in my bush get out my bush get away from my book no no no I'm not in there anymore I'm in a bush that's right you better run or walk or step stomp your stompy legs real real hard when I get enough brain juice and I get better sneak in speed oh yeah but no not in a bush [Music] if I hold onto your hats is gonna be this is gonna be a while [Music] [Laughter] see see this is why difficulty as no no register I'm currently playing this on nightmare mode that has no play in what I'm doing here that is nothing to do with what I'm doing I will find ways to screw myself over no matter the difficulty totally fine everything else I'm a mess I just want to destroy these people I want to get their brains in a jar and I want to move on with my life oh good thing fire lady's all the way over there all right well I'm not gonna waste another crossbow bolt trying to get that guy down don't look over here this is my fence my fence cuz the rogue signal is coming from Crimson's I believe and that may may may have something to do with the lovely I could get you all right you know what just for satisfaction reasons with my last crop nope that's no I ignore the big glowing light over here mister stumpy foot believe this well back to my drinking all right and I just please there that's what I wanted there you go there you go that's what you deserve and that didn't finish him off did it shit I can't go in there oh no he did really really all of that was even what's the foot no come on no no I don't have a bunch err don't make me run all the way back don't please do I you making me even when I do it right what would have been the point oh we didn't even follow me we doesn't even know where I am to find this van instead coming over give up all right okay I'm gonna go this way I know I have to stomp on them I know that how am I gonna stop them when the ground was electricity how how you answer me that riddle me that audience riddle me that yeah so you can't riddle me that I'm unriddle a bull have no idea what my riddle riddle levels are I'm on Ritalin no no you know frickin I'm going for it I'm gonna get up on this ladder I'm gonna bash that guy no that's slope oh hello all right I'm gonna go up this ladder my back No oh dude you lost your fire what are you gonna do now no fire oh this guy doesn't know everyone he's too busy smashing all right go angry our mashed potatoes are searched with onions and chives all right there we go got that see you go up a ladder you kill another Zombo all the others all missoula oh here we go get out of here is this like the store owner or something this is Chad every teen here in this small town of Silent Hill right okay is there a reason to come up here that's the question right is there some other yeah whoops that's was weird Sebastian you're cool dude but no no no what happened there all right climb down ooh a door you wouldn't think that's how you do okay man how many Mobius people were in here and how they all get separated and died oh no no I don't like that no uh why was that so cinematic and scary why was that terrifying why was that terrifying there was a specific reason why they made that terrifying and I don't like that all right listen I'm not crazy right like that was terrifying you guys hearing me right there was something suspicious about that and I'm in a the game where I don't know what everything's doing everything seems a little suspicious at all moments okay a workbench I guess sure all right okay I might have enough to be able to upgrade my gun or my Stabbin knife I don't want to upgrade my crossbow that's why I never really used the crossbow because why would I use it when half the time I would screw myself over anyway and when instead I could be better and do cool things all right I'm gonna go for fire power straight up cuz the first one is worth twenty percent so might as well blam and then it's a little more powerful because if I remember correctly from the last game unless they change something the the first gun the pistol is just what I'm gonna be using pretty much predominantly because I can't be trusted to do anything else all right let's make oh I'm almost full on bullets actually let me not craft those and make one medical syringe yup our boom bolt I need sniper parts and weapon parts to be able to do that but not right now okay good but also why this was very scary it's C it's C I'm not crazy uh I mean that's that's questionable but I'm not crazy right this seemed terrifying so there's something here okay nothing apparently all right well I'm gonna go out of this terrifying place and go over here now boom now that I know how to do that properly okay so where was that signal no it was right around the other side of this building so it was here there's none of zombies in my way to be able to cause me a problem Oh nails perfect they make great shrapnel I mean you could try to build things up with it oh no no I don't like that I like the opposite No yeah oh boy I don't like that okay I'm gonna no no no no no just run around no don't don't do the screaming thing that's that's really annoying oh oh oh what was that oh why was that why's that car or rocket now I'm in a bus oh god I'm in another bush I'm in a bush you can can't beat my sneaking bush oh goodness foliage out of my face no no no no no no Sebastian that was a cool bit ever but was it necessary this juncture oh my god they've discovered the technology of hiding in bushes they've discovered the technology of screaming randomly to try to thwart their enemies which has been my longtime strategy what's under here let me take them up and out of my busy day to check out others goddam out No [Applause] I hate I hate Sebastian I hate him I hate him get in my bush no one can find I'm in this bush now I'm gonna die because I can't get in a bush why Sebastian why I know all this is inherently my fault ah Frick I'm dead you know no come on alright let's get a few things let's get a few things clear here number one listen listen hang on everybody I know you're having a giggle right now number one the whole car rolling thing I didn't know that was a factor the whole car climbing thing I'm not used to that number three that was entirely my fault that was one percent I panicked it was a crisis situation I should have brushed it more calmly I had every opportunity but number two I reformed sometimes right at the last second that's not my fault they just do that now probably because it's nightmare difficulty oh that's so silly thankfully it dropped me off here and not way back and it's fine it's fine it's fine just fine I'm tough I'm a tough tough boy of a tough boy I'm a tough man see that doesn't seem right either I'm a tough man I'm a man that's what I am there we go let's do this ring around the Rosie again I like it all I had to do was get in the bush getting the bush getting the bush hey the much in the bush and no not yet there we go safe in the bush no idea Oh what happened over there he's just disappeared very bizarre no no no no pie oh I'll pay the bush all right let's not play it sounds like yeah oh yeah okay now I got his number now I'm gonna take him out to the dance no no stop the ranting raving I don't like that yeah I see that was it that was it uh yeah where you gonna go though no no no are you going what do you do stop humping that car let's give me an opportunity so it's like when he's like moving around that he it's only he only like does the turn doing he really wants at that car no don't don't no the soup of the day is potatoes it didn't make sense but I didn't have a lot of time to think about it because I admittedly all that time that I was waiting for you to turn around I could have been thinking about her soup of the day but you know I'm new here I don't know the menu very well what why who are you where and why what what were you under the car is it like secret like the blue glow beneath the car can either meet supplies or zombie are those the two choices all right fine okay I'll get you I'll get you yeah you can't see me okay oh no she's hiding in the bush alright mistake mistake probably was a mistake what no she's so fast oh all right fine geez all right here we go what an adventure we have here gang what an adventure alright now that I got this this is how much effort it takes to kill one one one dude sometimes alright it's alright it's alright though we're good you're good alright so now that we've had enough time to dick around I still got to go back and I still have to I know there's something some item over there but I'm gonna go around here and I'm actually gonna get to the signal over here because the signal the last I heard from it they were actually voices let me just run it and give this stuff that I've earned after dealing with his bullshit a nice brain goo beer thank you for that 700 you almost I think I need 3400 to be able to get the sneak in upgrade which is something very important to me woah no again you're doing that cinematic thing and I don't like it oh my daddy who stole me I was gonna get a big sack someday and I didn't know what though well that that ain't right huh-huh alright I don't like that Oh again I knew that was there oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no I have to make the art oh I made the art No there we go oh geez Oh oh geez oh geez okay weird

more so what is this oh whatever was it looks like they were here oh oh that's what the phrase off the chain means cuz you're literally off the chain it's like letting a dog not sure Oh I think like I did know that but I never like connected the dots no stop I have bottles I'll bash you right in your freaking head dude no no no I'm gonna push behind this no no I meant to be more stuffy about that oh yeah yeah dad you know before I get my sneaking speed up I might want to up my like like oh boy my any literally any other ability like the quietest run possible around oh wait I should use bottle that's right Oh Bush disappeared what happened to my Bush what what was that very scary suspicious bottle breaking one everybody over in house I think I have enough after this I think I have enough to be able to get the sneak in upgrade but before I do that I've got to see what I'm doing next okay so there's both resonance points alright well I'll go north then there was other stuff to the north that I could have used anyway there's a lot of axes lying around here I haven't had to use one yet mostly because I've been either succeeding or dying like that's been my two extremes here but can I go in this place no mobis lockdown screw you oh you know I didn't see you over there I would have tried to help but I'm an idiot now I can barely help myself so Sebastian gonna crawl away I'm gonna do the castellanos crawl back into this bush and you can just lay on the ground over there and die which is exactly what you did okay so it's right around this place I'm gonna go the bushy way I'm gonna go you know what I calling it the bushy way because frankly I just don't like when things are called the bushy way is this a personal prayer no gotta go the bushy way ah crap get in the bush hit the bush in the bush I love bush I love this bush this bush is good mmm all right I got a bottle Whangdoodle is behalf my magical bottle push disappearing powers what's that oh god [Applause] no no I thought it was in a bush just go right there right there right there just go right there I'm gonna hold this so this frickin thing disappears no no [Applause] I'm unbelievably back this is oh your I don't trust that this is oh no this is a trap no this is a trap oh this all is a trap oh wow I cannot believe how on believably bad I've been what no no no no I was in a bush no no I was I don't know where you went please my chance my one opportunity don't don't chance blow don't miss your chance to blow don't chance blow don't taste both ha 11 herbs and spices okay there we go [Music] no no no no I mean I was in a bush no I was there the boys you know what you know what sneaky sneaky ain't my style anymore I gotta hit him in their face oh stop a dumb them F something oh no wait Frick ax oh boy okay yeah yeah there's one down reload reload reload no no time to stop messing around I'm gonna get a little serious even if it cost me a few bullets here and there there's no way that I can do stealth kills on all of them until I get my sneaking skills up then I'll be able to do self kills on all of them but I gotta be a little bit better about this okay so this signal was right here somewhere yeah because I don't want to just waste you guys this time okay so there's some kind of thing there Wow you know in every game I've ever played whenever I see something like that I'm like well you mean you could try you got guns Sebastian takes a fucking knife just that was like that was like a half foot of steel all bunched up in one easy yeah Sebastian don't mess with nobody Sebastian tired of Mark Blair you're giving him a bad name oh that ain't good you're so close and yet so far can I stab you okay trust that that's that's hilarious Wow Sebastian is a bat what's that got my favorite sports team Go Go Oh score goal unit basket all right I'll be right there since you're being so adamant about it okay I need zombies over here so if the residents points was in here some hair so I gotta get in there that a gate open or is that gate closed okay all right doesn't see I don't see anybody out here I wonder if it's randomized when people are out in the streets and what people are not I can't get in this way either maybe through that door over there but I don't like these guys laying about and that just spells bad news bears for me am i reloaded I better be I need to make more L god I do not trust that in the least nope yeah your eyes are still glowing that means you're obviously alive and I do not trust that can I stomp on them just in case alright I think I can get in here oh oh why that trucks are rocking why would I why would I do that BAM hello and close that well okay we got someone here huh are you saying [Music] there's a supply cash under here I gotta get down there yeah I do but what about all the zombies I'm not too good at that and I'm lon bullets as as usual my bullet sack ain't big enough to be able to take on a horde sure oh maybe I could like set up a crossbow trap but I don't have enough crossbows this might be difficult okay so if I undo all this panel here can I like bring them all out I think so yeah flip I'm a flip switcher oh I was one of them puzzles god damn it I hate puzzles oh I said that does that and then this oh that's easy that's nothing all right well this is probably gonna be bad oh no I got a lift up what is why does that keep happening oh oh that ain't good okay get my bottle out I don't like that you seem different oh I don't like that at all oh that's not good oh that's not good that's that's awful everybody hush about the know maybe I could drop a car on him oh that looks like a witch from from left 4 dead I do not trust that at all why is that that way why are you that way no no no no no no no no no no no thank crush you oh god I don't like how slow you are no no I don't like it no I don't like it oh jeez oh jeez gosh okay I don't think I'm gonna be able to sneak kill that one probably no no no I like that oh god I like you so not no oh I don't know if that was a tougher one than usual I hate that I didn't like that at all okay all right let's try that again except this time being less bad oh yeah it's just panic that kills me panic is the only thing that's killing me right now I just need to stop panicking like a bitch baby okay there's gonna be one stim stomps out of there and then as soon as it does I'm gonna go for it I'm gonna try to do a sneak kill cuz if I can get a sneak kill a sneaks not kill with my sneaking shoes it's gonna be better for me any day now No why not what okay all right I'm just gonna go for it go for it I have to lose would you like some wine with your dinner for your new life oh I knew it I knew it I knew it I knew it I knew it your dip no not that you're different you're different oh come on hit your target damn it hey you're out come on hit it oh no that's not what I wanted oh boy yeah you're different okay that one's very different I don't like that at all I can't hit my target boom detective Castellanos oh my god okay I'm gonna take a medical syringe that's good I'm out of ammo officially so I'm kind of screwed unless this supply cache a blow this has stuff oh [Music] this is awful oh why would I do this oh why would I do this is that the janitor oh why would I do this Oh metal pipe oh maybe I can use that to fix the fix the sniper rifle let me be a little ramshackle but I mean at this point I think it's okay I mean when everything is a dream world why can't I just load in some cool cool weapons like the matrix which this is get up [Applause] okay at first I thought that was hilarious and then that was horrible but I thought cuz the two shadows that were there I thought they were talking to the guy like the body on the ground like Johnny get up what are you doing down there man and then I was gonna laugh and then I stopped laughing but then I oh okay that looks like a supply cache is this a spy cache oh come on it's got Mobius on it it looks like a supply cache why do I got to do this oh that rat is not having a good time all right well fine then so go towards danger it was apparently my favorite thing to do in this day and age it was this I don't think I can go through there and probably not probably the south an alarm if I try I should go through this door don't mind me everybody I'm just gonna come over here Pat this body for a bitch hey hey hey hey come on now hey hey hey come on how did you know okay that's good well alright nothing to see here all right well excuse me you gotta take this alright why was that what happens BAM Wow no no no no no oh that's uh this is the opposite of a good block up the ladder yes ladder yes gasps ladder yes okay all right we're all good we're all good we're all good for all gucchi all right I got bottles I'm why I'm cause well I've done a lot of problems a lot of problems a lot of from no didn't mean we pick that up and hit that oh I'm done done done Zoda why no it's not a matter of difficulties like I said I would cause by self my own problems alright it's all good okay so is that guy still following me up hopefully not oh it arms that okay but what I can do is I can lure someone into that or I could just take well alright that's easy enough alright so if I just okay just go over there and hopefully turn around before you investigate it [Music] okay well didn't do that right anyway no oh oh yeah yeah okay okay that's not ideal what are you doing everybody hush I'm thinking stupid you've been at the table too long you have to go you have to order something okay all right this ass a bit cuz now is the best time to do this of course I've got a lot of brain juice I really need to get this into my brain like one way or another I got to get this in me at least I got some explosive bolts but you're gonna be good for the crossbow I can hopefully set up some traps and stuff okay so I know there's um the way out through there but there's a deep grumble over that way but I got to get into that supply area there's barn on it gotta do that okay so I'm just gonna turn this on I'm a back step of bitch in case that cause noise someone with the floor I'm good about sage did someone build the fort oh it was such a fort someone built that fort Oh God I was about I was just about to say someone hiding in a fort over there and then boom you got me oh you big dumb doof all right here's the sitch you're gonna go right over there best to get that noise that was weird huh oh yeah no oh god these guys are just assholes about which way they're pointing down the darkness huh oh you did you are all right well he's he going back just for it is he about to buy start rebuilding his Fort Lee I build a fort in birth weight like I gotta get like the dynamics of this what that know why did I do that no that's not what I wanted either oh boy oh boy did you see me how'd you see me all right I got nothing clever to say now huh I've run out of soup references alright so we got that stupid freaking stupid freaking fort man over there and then we got supplies right here yes okay give me those sweet sassy so this is not a lot I was hoping there was gonna be like a plethora of supplies I mean it's good at all take what I can get I got more fuses and one not bullets not enough and I know I can craft bullets on the go I do but I really want to prioritize go into like work benches just because of how many it's gonna like give me one push push Sebastian you've cut through like a half foot of Steel with me like it was nothing no no release it let go Sebastian you gotta let go yeah I let go Lilly daughter dead your wife left you got let go man you gotta let go okay ooh can I get a cold beverage I'm gonna get a sweet Fuji day ah is that brain juice oh I forgot I forgot you could get brain juice out of those things I thought they forgot what is that over there what all right well I'll go over it into the bushes there's that the tip of the train tip the train that might be tip of the Train which I like even less but okay I think that's tip of the track all right let me make sure I'm reloaded at least to some extent I think there's anything down there that I need probably Oh mmm that seems bad an ominous and also bad who don't like that okay well I'm gonna go down this scary hallway and hope for the best here we go okay oh boy is bad red goop red goop red goop red goo bread goop I need that I need that red goop blood this mysterious blood red liquid it's it's like the color of blood it's like taste like blood it really sounds like blood is warm what could it be I have no idea oh it's so curious oh well life's a mystery sometimes I don't like that I don't like that I don't like that do people just not know do people just not know that they have a voice in their head that they can talk to themselves with like everybody has this mysterious like voice in their head sounds a lot like them but maybe it's not themselves but you know it works to the extent that you can talk to yourself and without saying words out loud I don't like this oh sorry sorry I just think there's some though right okay everything's fine I thought I thought that was gonna be like an introduction to another character oh there's another safe house over there I can go there I'm gonna go I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna go hit this one before I move on because I eventually got to go over there and I will but I'm gonna go back I'm gonna craft stuff I'm gonna get brain goop in me I'm gonna talk to Liam just in case there's anything else that he needs I'm gonna hit that last resonance points because there's a bigger mystery afoot than what there seems there were people living in this city like Union City there were citizens here but why like that's the that's the biggest question that I have right now why were people living here why did people choose to have their brains uploaded into a city like I get that it could have been an experiment but these people didn't even know about Mobius like that that person said Johnny or Terry or whatever was they didn't know about Mobius why would they have known about Mobius or why wouldn't they have known about Mobius when they went into this thing did they just think it was just some random collection that was gonna like let them live out their matrix dreams because that doesn't seem right either because if you if you have to go if you have to go in there like if you have to go in there there's so many different things that you could do oh I gotta go back um I will go back to the workshop and I will get ooh okay I'll go back everybody everybody hush your faces I'll get there I'll get there okay I'm going back but my point still stands why would the people going in to this place not know about Mobius why did the technician not know about Lilly Castellanos people's memory seem to be very selective you know what I mean people's memories are just all over the place with what's going on here I don't know if it's intentional or I don't know if it's like something else there's there's there's like a deeper level was it in here was in here boom hello hello ah okay yeah you're right you're I I think it was back there because there was a security door that I can get through now because they burst open yeah but there's something here right why wouldn't they know why would Mobius keep it all secret like why would whywould and mobius has to be like a big corporation right it's not like one of those things really never heard of them that's impossible Oh was it here ah okay I just miss it ah any day now any day now that's not a shotgun that's not oh come on get up the ladder uh yeah yeah I'm gonna set up a trap for you set up a big old trap for you all right no too late can't sup trap got a shooting face oh come on stupid bullet waste bastard all right there you go bloap all right well that's good got that they got the bolt at least loaded up with something okay I'm gonna do explosive rounds yeah she was she was talking out loud I have no idea like why what would have been the point of it yeah I didn't miss his I was in a bit of a rush here so I couldn't couldn't exactly take my time with this all right so I don't have security code ah oh wait okay hang on Oh at the door be 34 okay B be 34 so 96 76 Hey okay all right cool cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo all right whoo okay that's good I guess all right what's this medical kit high-grade weapon parts all right well that's good okay so does that gonna help me craft up the sniper rifle which is gonna be really good I guess I'm gonna keep that in the menu here cuz otherwise I'm gonna accidentally use it when I don't want to use it but I got a high grade weapon part which probably gonna be to the sniper rifle and then it's got to be some way to get around all that because where did they come from right because they went back and then they came around at me I just don't know where yeah all right I'm trying to find the shotgun hang on guys I'm trying to find it see this is the other benefit of doing this live like you guys like do it like in the comments normally of Let's Plays like Mark you do this thing Oh got you dummy Oh shoo and then I cry and cry and cry because I'm like I'm trying guys I'll try my best I work to please you but sometimes it doesn't work out and then you guys are like oh fuck you mark we don't care what you think and then I'm like I wouldn't really make you happy and then you know but here live now you get to see me cry right on you're gonna see me like be broken down into tears and my own inadequacy live in front of you it's all true you guys are like and then you know we have a happy fun that's what it's like that's what it's like every day where was it I have no idea what you guys are talking I think it was it in the workshop it was probably there probably ship we have borderline abusive it's great I love it it's good stuff all right was it here is there another one than in here am I going so I'm out stamina I have no idea where it was was it down here uh-huh no that's how I got into that place in the first place where go back down that ladder break the boxes you guys I have no idea what you're talking about I've no idea yeah there's only so many ladders you guys will like the ladder and I went up and down the ladder and there was nothing so all right wait hang on you guys we're gonna play a little game all right just play it it's like say say warmer or colder let's go through if I'm getting closer to the shotgun say warmer if I'm getting farther away it's a colder and all that's gonna happen who's like what we're calling warmer colder colder it's hot it's lava lava hot lotta hot okay this is the only ladder I door Tommy go down here all right looking a look looking looking looking so hard with my eyes all right you need meanie miney moe me me no no oh ah that would have been hard too hard to get an author is Jonathan Stephens entered unauthorized Moebius area in witness sensitive material [Music] Zeta 5 emergency ok warm warmer ok I'm warm I'm red-hot I'm warm I'm so warm oh look how warm I am bo baby I'm warmest I could possibly be so warm of warm mmm so warm cold cold cold cold cold blinding cold Arctic I'm so cold warm warmer warm or cold you're warm and cold bark woods so warm cold you're cold warm fire warmer do it was it in there was in there yeah yeah oh yeah there's no good I'm dumb dumb I can't lava frickin warm warmer warm warm warm warmest warm cold warmer apparently I'm warm guys and warm it's not even there yeah ah see the shotguns not even in this place see okay you know forget the shotgun I'm not gonna fight it it's fine I know is there's no way this girl look I've looked if I haven't found it yet it's all good it's all good there's no there's no shotgun here I've looked everywhere it's not here let's it's in there which I'll look not here guys this doesn't exist shotguns a myth jakka and it's like a dragon you know it doesn't really exist shotguns are just the stuff of legends you know that are that our parents tell us about it wasn't down the ladder no no it wasn't there it wasn't there it wasn't there no I'm gonna move on the legacy of the shotgun shall never be redeemed we've got other stuff to do though the good thing I got a lot of time to get this done or else we'd go nowhere okay all right now now now all you guys are gonna be talking about us how hot or cold it is for like the next 30 minutes straight I love it it's like I want bannered of me like half on fire half frozen just meeting the fire and ice child you look like my lower half is frozen to my hot top half is on fire just please I need some of that in my life pretty pretty please oh well hey whoa where'd you come from how long have you been following me buddy oh don't even think about it I'll go up this ladder I will mess up your day bro okay can't run a stamina oh he doesn't want to chase Oh big baby oh how didn't you get more fire all right whatever I don't have time to worry about that I got to go to the other resonance point which technically actually I can get to behind this place anyway back to what I was saying about this whole area like I know I'm quick to like point out game logic flaws but the one thing about evil within is that it was it was a very interesting story like it really had an interesting story it did have its flaws of course I'm not saying it was perfect but it was really engaging and well thought out so I don't want to be like negligent and saying that these things I'm observing are just chalk it up to game logic no I want to I want to think as if this is all meaning something like you guys did for who killed markiplier like I wanted dig deeper into this because something just doesn't add up I don't know what mobis his end goal here is besides the control of people you know what I mean the only thing the only thing that's been consistent with mobis up until this point is not telling out everyone all the information that they need the control of information is like the number one priority of Mobius so this whole system must also be for that end right like this whole Union City bullshit like that's all just to control people okay it's in this house right here this weird glowing house that looks really lovely yeah nope okay all right never mind that there's something over here definitely getting closer what's this a bottle I got a bottle everybody I got a bottle yeah so yeah it's like what does that mean and what does that mean for me when I'm trying to find Lily why does it keep doing that cinematic view I don't like that I don't like that at all that's just no good like listen right like of course if you're if you're suddenly going into cinematic view in a horror game that's normally third-person it spells bad news bears and one day that's gonna get to me oh good I stole your no that was flour not smoke powder that was flour I stole it out of someone's grocery bag what's going on in here bottle thank you I don't care if it's full chuck it at someone no matter what but that's just a theory I gotta watch Game Theory's newest five nights at Freddy's videos I got a I've heard that they were very good and I've also heard that Scott Cawthon applauded them now IIIi think I heard that they weren't exactly correct but they were about the closest that could be anybody in here so I gotta watch this I don't know why but every time well hello dead body that I was just stepping on I'm sorry sorry can I open this no apparently not okay well what was the point of this Oh like that at all good good good good I'm never it is I'm never gonna believe what Turner mr. citizen murder I mean admittedly I am killing these people after and I maybe I'm not any better than that I am killing people but maybe they were also already dead I don't know 100% for certain which is the true true but you know oh that's that's strange can I kick that alright I'll go to the visitor center I'm gonna get my upgrade I am that's what the thing is I get sidetracked very much I get sidetracked a lot in games but that's the thing I like about this like it just being able to talk with you guys here is like it's all just it's all part of the experience because no need to feel rushed you know what I mean ok go to the marrow his computers still working I'm loading very slowly I don't that's weird so of course like this whole thing is a system right that's why this is explained it's like half matrix because it's just a simulation even if it's in in someone else's brain even if it's in Lilly Castellanos this brain that all this is built like that's the whole point of it like they needed a brain to be able to join everyone together like but which is weird by itself it's not it's not just like oh okay yeah sure they need a brain no it's it but it's still like it's fascinating that they can control something like that and maybe like our technology isn't gonna be too far away from that it may be some day I mean I'm not saying we'll all be living in someone's brain you all can live in my brain I'll be supervising it won't it guys we could all just brain together know like what it'll be is something even like more than that maybe maybe maybe not maybe I'm just being crazy but computers and brains is probably gonna be thing it's either gonna be like we're gonna make AI and they're gonna take over the world or we're gonna put computers in our brain we're gonna become the AI technically cyborg whatever and then we're gonna all die probably oh just to get cataclysmic about it but for now we got cool video games that replicate it without any of the punishments so consequences be damned we're gonna go away are you uh you're one of the ladies anymore I would think that like an axe would be able to take him out in one go okay so how should I approach this without being an idiot charge blindly forward yeah that sounds good everybody be quiet cuz it might be quiet out there everybody be quiet did someone get Jim on the scene so what should I do ah blouse Julie er no what were you going Sabet where were you going where where are you going Sebastien them you prick and douchenozzle we've got a very serious and pergurt man your face is so beautiful I've never seen a more beautiful whatever you are see is it even worth is it even worth trying to kill her like that's that's my question I do not think it's worth I wish I had my sneaking skills up Oh I could get a shot on her but is it even worth it maybe I'd have to do two and then some bullets I know this is gonna work all right go go go go go go go no why didn't I go forward now where are you coming Sebastian Sebastian you asshole okay let's see if I can get away from her number one because she's pretty slow until you're shooting at her and when you're shooting at her she's really fast I know I have the crossbow but I'm trying to save ammo here I'll be all stealthy about things and stabby you know tell people about the specials and such that's the thing right I can kind of use me just running as a way to lure her into some places like if I do that she's gonna hear it right up until I start crouching right so if she comes over after that that's yeah so she's coming over slowly she's coming yeah there she goes yeah yeah okay welcome to Dairy Queen oh that's so stressful god damn it I got so much green goop so much brains juice that really like gets my heart pounding and that's cool because the last time I remember like that much stress trying to take out Emmys is like the clicker in the last of us like that enemy in and of itself is terrifying but also like trying to avoid multiple of those which I know I'm gonna get multiple of these and eventually I'm gonna have more firepower and that's gonna be great but I hope they don't do it too much because that's really cool like having those moments where I'm so that's okay I take that back give me as much firepower as I can possibly have I've got so many parts I just want to get back to my bench but I keep getting sidetracked by side quests look at all these boxes Brown a BAM baby this doesn't sound Pleasant why am i going towards this it's a really hefty grunting and meet slapping and I don't know what I don't know what I'm gonna see around this corner I don't think it's gonna be good for everybody place your bets Oh he was thrown around the body like a rag doll okay Angry Men what's up yeah it steamed broccoli okay can i pat this guy down oh no that guy was already past Hobbs manski ah Sebastian's here now what do we have here hello whoo broken fuse boxes can be powered momentarily by firing a shock bolt from a warden crossbow at home okay sure let's go that's a normal crossbow I don't think I have a warden one I think this is just a normal crossbow I've only got exploding bolts yeah this isn't gonna do shit to it cuz I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure I don't have yeah it's just a harpoon bolt yeah I don't have shock bolts so that would be a waste I'll come back to that once I'm able to get a craft a shock bolt up what am i what am i trying to match here am I trying to match the red okay unlock what a weird well that's not security that's not secure at all and kick that door open Sebastian you know what's good for you oh no seems like there's something there alright is that a gun take that thank you didn't do you no good alright god this this looks like it might be a gun really something good hey there's the shotgun yoo-hoo you guys you didn't even know what you were talking about you didn't even know you are running me on a wall you didn't even know oh you were all there it was all herd mentality one person was like the shotgun the shotguns in there okay and then everyone's like Oh Marjorie and I I cried for nothing oops I cried for nothing gotcha ha ha ha ha ha I'm gonna be that three there's three that four bombad it ah okay now that I've been sufficiently assholes about that kick the goddamn thing open are you killing me all right also I know that I can um I know that I can field craft a shock bolt do I wanna ah you know what let's do it why not I've got a ton of stuff lets us make one okay we got one shock bolt now all right let's do that doobly-do and Frank go through go through Sebastian come on girl get chopped in half what was the point of this why did I come here why did I come here I have no idea whole hops musky Sebastian oh well I just there was no point to that there was no there was no point it's the same direction ah but I'm waste what a waste of my precious material yeah y'all god oh god oh god get behind something Sebastian you idiot oh boy that ain't good oh boy that ain't good no don't oh no indeed ah Frick okay I might shoot you guys oh right in the slow deep part of your brain try try me try me bro try me bro are you doing oh you don't even know where I am oh no what what was that noise ah no oh he's not swage he's not just wait oh there we go alright I'm Anna I'm missing too many shots here I'm like my accuracy is way down but at least I got a lotta bit of gunpowder at least I got those guys without taking a hit that's good getting slightly better getting slightly better but not a lot better but getting slightly better can this take me up a man then for you go go oh come on ah key that's right oh that's right oh how many of those have I missed out so many probably but oh that's right I totally forgot about the key mechanic when I go back into my brain I can get the key stuff oh that's fascinating I totally forgot about that and you guys probably totally reminded me about that and I was just being an ignorant idiot which is you know not uncommon for me not uncommon at all but hey I got that okay so I gotta go I gotta go I'm gonna go back I'm not gonna waste any more time I got to go back and I gotta get these supplies in me and I've got to get crafted oh because I got a lot of upgrade potential but I just got to get back okay let's go back sure I see we're doing good we're doing good although I'll take this moment to say new shirts are on sale right now they are a sweet holographic pattern they're available in black and white and a big logo like this or a small logo that's just on the pocket they're super cool love them a lot Oh you can get them by going to markiplier comm I believe there's a link in the description as well god that's so fascinating about the travelling between worlds like that because you could literally like they set up these terminals for the employees to use but it doesn't just have to be the terminal like the whole point of this is like you know you know the whole point of this is for someone to live out their fantasy of like the world is theirs to create so someone can play God like that is the end objective here they want a world that's gonna be stable enough for them to go into and play God where they can live forever or whatever have you and they can have a great time alright change my mind about there's immediate predicament it gets worse every time I go down that hallway every single time I go down that hallway gets worse every time okay all right everybody hold on to your pants look closely for monsters oh boy all right Sebastian Castellanos here let's try something how do you know that was me how did you know you're good enough no especially wouldn't have known if there was a bottle yes yes weird thing to say weird thing to shout when I'm stabbing a zombie but everybody ignore the fascist habit I was just very celebratory that I did that correct please don't take that out of context that might have been the most inappropriate way I could have possibly said like do this weird like pelvic thrust not what I was intending not at all not at all what I was intending but the success is there nonetheless and I'll own that I did that I did that good I did that nicely in fact I could have done it a little better if I had taken the moment when the one was stunned from the pull to go up and finish him off well why Castellanos please I just want what's under the car oh man some good shit ahh why where'd you come from no you know I'm a weird where did I go you don't know I'm so sneaky you have no idea where I am do you you stupid zombie you stupid oh oh oh that's that's no good okay nope okay weird but alright stay on the short side stay on the short side stay on the short side oh yeah

guys I know you guys are disappointed you guys are not disappointed in me because you expected just that little but I have never like in any other game like if I flail like if I flail in panic in any other game usually I can get by but no other game other than this one is like anti flail like I can't flail in Bannack I just can't I will die every time it's so bad oh it's so bad I apologize for nothing no what good what no no no all right you know what let's do it the old-fashioned way huh by the old-fashioned way honk full clip huh for one dude you know I had to test out this No oh I didn't

great hey if you want to go go go - markiplier comm check out the new t-shirt by the time you get back I'll be where I was and I won't be an idiot [Music] running down the hallway doodly-doo I don't think be tableau is gonna help me in this scenario I'm pretty sure I don't think there's a blacksmithing this town either I don't think anyone's gonna find a pile of dirt over here there ain't nothing going on here but I do have a lot of specials to tell everyone about if someone was like someone was like why screaming though and I'm just like the screaming is my natural response I have no other crisis response besides screaming who's still in his body who stole it oh I stopped what oh oh oh you're really there you're really a thing oh geez okay no gag oh okay well you were I didn't know you were really a thing I did not know that that's fascinating Wow okay well what you're saying so that means there's someone outside of this okay we're good okay all right now all I got to do is I just got to get back in good time and oh wait I forgot to go to put the shotgun on three this on four and there we go you're there there's something over here okay Oh God the dragon of body what the hell was that why oh yeah they are holographic the shirts are holographic they're super cool I like him a lot I really wanted to do something special and I gotta say like the quality of them are super nice so check them out if you would like okay all right straight shot back gonna get this I got it I got it everybody everybody it's good it's good it's good it's good and just because just because I messed up a lot I'm going to I'm gonna extend this I was gonna end it like 9:30 but I'm gonna go an extra like 15 20 minutes just so I can get something actually done and that would be super nice all right so I'm gonna save first so I don't save any changes that I don't like blam okay got that go back okay Liam all right first off Liam how you doing oh nothing missions alright tempered cup of coffee for me on old cup of joe if you don't know this is the most hilarious healing mechanic I've ever seen in my life you pour yourself a cup of coffee you slug that bad boy back mmm good fresh hmm all better all these wounds knife wounds stab wounds bullet wounds bite wounds nothing a cup of coffee can fix hmm right like a summer day all right now weapon parts I need to number one I'm an upgrade let's see what no I'm gonna upgrade let's see what the shotgun can do 90 for a five percent boost that's awful animal capacity would probably be better than that reload time would probably even better than hammock capacity would be good Oh 30 oh hell yeah that's enough okay high-grade weapon parts I don't want to do that because I want to repair the sniper rifle if that is what that takes 30 at 30 is not bad I can do 30 30 is fine fire rate 40 even that not bad why not right is that the same for the other ones too Oh 20 oh that's nothing all right 20 fire rate good sure why not at least get the first ones reload time that'd be good walking speed while aiming that's nice but I'm not gonna waste anything else on that let's see range Church time full decomposable these guys yeah I'm gonna hold off all right so sniper rifle Oh what do you take oh you need specifically sniper rifle parts okay that's a thing all right that's fine okay so I'm gonna make up some Ivy's gonna give me a bunch not that bunch let's get like let's get like 10 cuz I am gonna find more shotgun shells I only have one of seven it's not a lot but it is what it is just in case because I don't know those are probably good for taking down down some big guys and I don't know what I'm gonna find some big guys but you know it is what it is let's get some more clothes the bolts are food bowl now why not do the pipe I guess might as well go full on explosive but no now I'm gonna find him well I'm gonna use him I guess it's all good okay get more pipe okay so we're crafted up there we're gonna max out this now I might find a syringe I'm gonna hold off I'd rather keep the materials if I don't need to spend them right away okay now I gotta put great brain goop in my brain and then we're gonna get that I'm gonna get I'm gonna get my sneaks nan conceals I'm gonna be better at sneakin you guys are gonna you gotta go to be so proud of me I'm gonna be so good at sneaking oh yeah yeah let's save here - I like those weapon changes but I'll get a new save anyway Blanc okay doodly-doo come on come on screw coffee use goop juice hey in this universe copy is the gook Joos indeedy-do nurse nurse what am I gonna be able to open some lock boxes I got a key could I do that nurse okay okay excellent some Keys open doors of perception but this isn't one of them this one is more mundane but still useful okay open one its contents are better off in your hands which one do you guys think just say warmer and colder who we gonna swarm or colder I'll get there I'll get there hang on warmer I'll call they're all former what cold cold warm that was this one okay all right cool you got it Oh gun powder perfect okay let's put stuff in our brain I'm gonna get so much sneaking skills oh my god so much neat good there it is yes yes low profile yes grabby yeah crabby Oh ambush that'd be really good okay all right so I need move faster walk cross oh I need that oh so much in my brain I do I can't afford that one but I like the the ambush skill that's good and eventually I'm gonna get the predator I will get that I will get that quickly close on an enemy oh yes I want that so badly oh I want all of this okay space near wall sneak kill that's so good cuz this I don't need them to turn their backs yes that yes yes yes yes yes okay do I need the low profile number two I mean that'd be good I do like grabby hands though but I don't have enough for grabby hands alright let's just see what else we got in athleticism and stuff stamina gauge that would be good health not really a factor here okay steady hands melee attacks do more damage that's always nice get the ability to push enemies away from you recovery though ones recovery more health and healing items athleticism is eventually gonna be more avoidance stamina recovery speed running always good but right now I'm all about that stealth baby that stealth is gonna be able to let me get more kills which is gonna be able to let me you know get farther to wear it oh I'm all stealthy baby oh I'm so still stand up yes okay so like I said I'm gonna keep going for another like 15-20 minutes just because I want to test these skills out and I want to make sure that I don't waste you guys this time so let's go no don't avoid it Sebastian come on let's save one more time because i'ma save the holic and then we're gonna go in there it Sebastian it's gonna be good double save just for just for two for fun [Music] so we got this and then we're good to go now we can go to the other signal there was also they said to go to the visitor center so I'm gonna do that and hopefully there's gonna be something interesting at the visitors center for me cuz Turner said he was over there but I don't like Turner to move I'm so much faster when I'm sneaking oh I'm not a lot faster but I'm faster oh yes oh I'm so quiet no you don't see me I'm sneaking oh I think she sees me no yeah she definitely sees me okay great luck no Ron Bush Bush Bush gotta get on the bus sneaking bush it turns out my sneak oh oh I think she somehow still knows where I am okay good what if I this is not using my skills to the best of my mood no don't don't turn around don't turn around don't turn around ah would you like a salad with your soup [Music] okay that went marginally better but I don't think it was a factor of anything other than me being an idiot okay into the visitors center we go home whoa anybody here detective Castellanos runny to take action I got damn these squeaky doors all right seeing suspicious in here seems awful easy actually something in there no way I can't believe it unbelievable who's that don't even think about it bro Turner if you're in here if you're causing a goof if you're uh kissing up a goof I ain't about it not about that at all well communions ideal mix of a small town do people know that they're here do people understand that they're here do people know that they've been trapped here like because with beacon Hospital none of us really like knew we were in the system we just ended up there don't go go yeah go I'm going I'm going baby I'm going lamp what about the lamp there's something about a lamp lamp very no lamp here all right okay we're gonna uh there's a key okay there's a key I'll get it on the way back there is a key I'll get it on the way back and I heard someone say there might be sniper parts on the roof but I've already gotten this that might be the other sniper thing I was that you guys that I got in the last episode war oh hi okay I've recognized this work him again [Music] tough luck right tough luck don't rig to take a picture of the victim that's so weird it's so weird it's it's it's interesting because I've never seen anything like it before like the moment of death captured like forever it's horrifying and Awful's to be art and it's an execution it's just up it's just a corrupt mind like another communicator something like it's so weird Moebius team members we might have something useful on them yeah cuz it's where he's reminding me of was it Vesuvian Valu V inversion ruvie Andrew Ian ruvé Ian Ruben Ruben Ruben Ruben Ruben sandwich Riven Riven some Ruben Ruby some grooving roubo Rambo whatever he reminds me of that no not but oh we go thing I got my crossbow Jesus and like Reuven in the last one this guy seems to be able to like move around like use this place to his advantage and uh I just realized what that was sneak mode engaged I don't like that at all that's the hell is this supposed to be sick I know that's no idle boy okay wait hang on I'm gonna go down the hallway and get some range on him some range on him okay what was this about if I put this on the wall it's a tripwire right okay let's try that let's try that come at me bro come on come on right here bruh that got one of you wait does he not know I'm here oh jeez yeah it is let's see if I can nail him right let's go oh he got up dammit what the fuck got him daddy oh come on now wasn't reloaded ah there we go no damn oh damn it there we go god I always get like the first two shots perfect and then I for some reason miss maybe like really when their head like loses a bit like not the question like oh the controller's grim like maybe but when cuz when it takes like one headshot in their head like partially like gets exploded but then also like a piece of their head is missing and they got these weird tentacles popping out of it so maybe there's something to that where that target gets smaller it always is Oh God Oh God all this is horrible what am I supposed to be doing in here I don't really see an objective there's something in here there's some way out of here oh they're gonna book shelf sure scene by the light okay come on use your big muscle Sebastian use your big strong muscles Rubick Rubick thousand Rubik I don't know I'm not saying this is ruvik but ruvik like have some similarities but ruvik also was in control of all of it this guy only seems to be in control of part of it so I'm thinking like this whole system it's more of a collective than it was before it's more like unified weird than it was before you know what I mean the place o'neil safe house is right there might as well give him the bad news about his entourage face to face oh I'll do that okay you guys said there was a statue in here so I'm gonna keep my eyes peeled for a statue where is the statue I'm looking for you where yeah you hidin you were buying the counter maybe in here maybe weapon parts at least somewhere in here mmm lamp the lamp I don't see it unfortunately I don't see it and I don't want to waste too much time just hunting for it hey little lady nope I don't see it I'm sorry it might be staring me right in the face and I might be dumb and I apologize for that but I will get through this game even without it I tried my best I tried so I got go tell Liam the bad news everyone everyone Liam Liam so actually that's weird because I'm not sure what's going on with the time like cuz the time of this place is weird because I'm getting radio signals from people who are already dead I'm getting radio signals from people that may have been dead a long time and also I'm getting radio from people that are here currently like it's it's bizarre and also the radio is like the number one thing about all of this it's it's it's tied into everything and I don't know I the the radio saving seems familiar was it like in one of the DLCs because I know it wasn't the main game that had the radio saying they're dead but after what I saw you're better off without them around they were reporting on killing everybody in here and now for one emergency huh can't say it's the worst idea I've heard you're a real piece of work on the UM you know that I'm just being a realist you can't save everybody it's impossible mobius made emergency plans for a reason if they never made this twisted machine they wouldn't need emergency plans in the first place maybe so but look at what they've done it's pretty incredible still a company man after all this has incredible oil T pays off for you at the end because right now it seems like they don't give a shit about you what do you mean they sent you in here didn't they sorry I didn't mean to make you angry here I made some more of these for you for your troubles he made some of these and it's like a string of paper butterflies it's like he's the enemy weapon parts all he did was hand me a pile of trash and we'll lie here I made this for him Oh Liam Oh potatoes oh boy thank you it's beautiful thank you glad you're taking the death of your old team so well all right hey I'm gonna leave all right so I need to upgrade the handgun firepower I really do want more firepower out of this bad boy but at least I know that I do oh that's good one percent of 30 I want that I want the critical cuz I've already got a weapon part and I love my pistol I love my pistol pistols like the like my jam in all of this so I'm gonna go for the critical that's awesome all right and let's do a little more firepower we can afford it why not blam okay good good to know all right we're good there Nomi I think I need to craft some more bullets out of it just a full clip would be nice okay good we got a lot of crossbow bolts we got to make sure to use it I'm not gonna end it just yet because I'm more curious about how like I want to get into the real story this was all side mission that's a really cool thing about this oh no I'm out of I'm out of safe slots you only let me get 10 oh you assholes I want all of it Oh sach is on the bench outside all right all right get your get your pants out of your ass come on stop stop pooping all over my face Oh God stop being a dingle donger dingus damn stop

that house maybe yeah take on so many materials Oh Zetas I think that's a lady I'm gonna call him a witch anyway just because that's the most similar thing that I can understand about that I'm pretty

Then I'd see something, right? That's how it works That's how it works. Okay, whatever so I need some source of light.. Maybe I could rig this bone up with some cloth.. and burn it. Like if I rig if I rig my... If I rig this bone up with these scraps of clothing from this mysterious dead body Can I SHOOT anybody? Anybody wanna get shot?

Kay, another victim by the infamous Mr.Whiskers Last Thursday night, Dutch salesman Alexander Wit has been taken from his home Just as the previous kidnappings, a dead mouse and a blank note has been found at the crime scene This is the 14th victim taken by Mr. Whiskers. A local witness was able to take a vague picture of Mr. Whiskers Oh, thank you. What is that the Loch Ness monster? Is Mr. Whiskers a UFO? What's going on here with this picture, huh? Oh what, in this day and age 1988, they don't exactly have the technology with which to make a better picture? I heard that. Also, I question the conundrum of leaving a dead mouse in a world where cats and horses and stuff real life day Is that like a full-grown like dead body to them? Is that like another person? Like, oh god not only did he kidnap someone but also a dead body, murder kidnapping! Okay anyway, I see. So that's interesting..

Why do I make promises that I can't keep? This question came up during my Q&amp;A panel when I was at VidCon over the last weekend and, oddly enough, it didn't come from the audience I ran this QnA a little bit differently, because I wanted to answer questions that I ask myself. Questions like, 'Who am I?' 'Who am I to you guys?' Like, 'why do I make videos?' How did I get to this point right here, and, more pertinent questions like, Why do I make promises that I can't keep? Because if you've been watching my videos for awhile, you know what I'm talking about. It's not a thing out of maliciousness Or it's not me outright lying to you guys I have ambitions and I wanna reach high and I wanna accomplish them so I often find myself making promises I don't keep up with and the panel itself was really, really interesting for me and I hope it was interesting for the people out in the audience. Uh, but more than that, it was, uh, a moment of self-reflection for me. Like it was the moment where I could just have an honest true discussion with you guys about who I am and who I was and who I want to be and where I'm going with this. And that question just kinda stuck with me Because I vaguely answered it on stage but then I kept thinking about it. Why? Why do I keep promises that I can't keep? Why am I not keeping them? And, and if I can't keep them, then why do I make them in the first place? Am I not working hard enough to make sure that happens? Am I lazy? Am I forgetful? And so, I'll get to the finer details of this answer Uh, later on in the video, but to understand my mindset right now I have to talk about something that happened just last night. If you weren't there, we were running a charity livestream over on Twitch. We weren't doing it over here on YouTube, so don't be surprised if you didn't see it Um, but we were over there on Twitch and it was really, really awesome because Bob flew into town and we were having so much fun and we were having all these challenge videos that we were doing Uh, I have a T-shirt challenge that I'm probably going to post a video of later but then later on we had, uh, this guy by the name of AlaskanBlueJay on YouTube who I met through the Make-A-Wish Foundation while I was at VidCon and I promised him that I would bring him on board for the livestream and I almost forgot Uh, but thankfully, I got friends who reminded me to call him and we called him and had a nice discussion and he told the story. This really, really impactful story that resonated throughout the rest of the stream and I'll try to do it justice right now. You've probably heard it. He didn't make it up or nor neither did I. But it's the story of this young child walks along the beach and on this beach hundreds of starfish wash on shore, doomed to dry out and die. But this child walks along and every time he sees one, he picks one up and he throws it back into the ocean, giving it another chance at life. He can't get to all of them but every morning, this child, on his way to wherever he's going picks up another starfish and tosses it back into the ocean. And he does this everyday for awhile. Day by day, walking along the beach, tossing another starfish back in And one day, this old man who's been seeing him do this comes up to the child and asks "Why are you doing this?" "Hundreds and hundreds of starfish wash up on the shore everyday." "And you can never save all of them." "Why even bother?" "You're not making a difference." And the child looked at the man and looked down at the ground at the starfish at his feet. He picked up that starfish and tossed it back in the ocean. and said "It mattered to that one." And that's the story and it's a simple story with a simple message meaning that if you do something even in the grand scheme of the huge insurmountable obstacle that is the bigger problem if you chip in just a little bit, it'll go so far. But then almost immediately after he told that story We're just talking there. He started screaming Jay AlaskanBlueJay started screaming through the phone and we didn't know what to make of it. I thought maybe the TV was on or maybe or it was like a joke or a prank. I had no idea. But what happened was his defibrillator in his chest went off right on stream. And it scared the crap out of me. It scared the crap out of everybody. Everyone in stream was so scared. And I didn't really know what to do. I tried to stay calm about the situation. He went to the hospital immediately. I tried to stay in contact with him. As of right now, I believe he is at home resting It was, as he was told, it was probably a malfunction more than something life threatening but, they are monitoring him and he is doing okay and as an aside, if you could send some love to him, he has a YouTube channel AlaskanBlueJay, I'll put a link in the description. But the point here is after that story was told and after he went to the hospital, and after that big scare, uh, Kathryn helped start this campaign of one dollar donations. We had one hundred thousand dollar goal for this charity livestream to go to Able Gamers and we were behind. We were actually behind Uh, and then Kathryn kinda like started this "March of Dollars" where if someone donated we could see who donated, and if they left a comment she asked that they comment "Starfish." And for those of you who don't know who don't know, Kathryn is my editor and good friend and, uh, they commented "starfish" and after that, not only did the chat take it upon themselves to start the hashtag #PrayForJay but also they really, really rallied behind this concept. That these one dollar donations could make all the difference in the world and then we saw, like, the counter steadily rocket up. Names were flying by. Everyone was saying "starfish." People were donating for other people, saying "Here's twenty starfish." "Here's a hundred starfish." Someone donated a thousand dollars and was like, "Here" "Here's starfish for everybody who couldn't be there and can't donate." And it was this beautiful, beautiful thing, this avalanche of one dollar donations The- the representation of what that meant in the face of being scared for Jay and- and after there, I kept up with him. He gave us an update when he went to the hospital. He tried to stay on the stream. He tried to actually, like, watch the stream while he was in the hospital which I applaud that so much and- and- and it was this beautiful, beautiful thing that came out of me just meeting this one guy and him telling a simple story and everyone chipping in one dollar donations. And- and without that, I don't even know if we would've made our goal. And this all ties into the question: "Why do I make promises that I can't keep?" Because I made a promise to Jay that I would bring him on the stream and I almost forgot. Not out of maliciousness, but just because I got caught up with other things and I got busy and allowed myself to become complacent. And I don't mean to turn his tradgedy into something that it's not but without that I don't think we would've had the drive to keep going. I don't think it would've resonated as hard as it did. And so when I ask myself, "Why do I make promises that I can't keep?" and I think about the answer I gave on stage. All of that is bullshit. If I make a promise and I don't keep it, I am bullshit. Because if I didn't keep my promise, what would've we missed out on? I wouldn't have been able to talk to Jay and get to know him and you guys wouldn't know his story and we may not have made our goal and how many times in the past have I made promises that I didn't keep and what opportunities did I miss because of that? I don't wanna do that ever again. I'm almost twenty-eight; I'm gonna be twenty-eight in two days here and I do not wanna live my life making promises that are empty in- in all the ambition and all the-the swept up nature of the tour and- and going doing these ambitous projects and going to VidCon and going to conventions and meeting people and doing quote-unquote "bigger projects" I- I feel like I've lost sight of the small things that made it important for what I do here. And- and I made excuses for it and-and I've relied on the fact that I'm so happy that my friends are here to support me and- and my friends are here with me who have been with me for YEARS and Bob, who flew into town for me just for this stream because it's a cause that he believed in and he wanted to join me in this fun day that we had and it was the most fun stream we've had for a long time and it was all because and- and it was all because we were all able to band together and we were able to keep this one promise and we're able to keep doing these things over and over again and we're able to keep doing them in the future because that's what's important. This community is what's important and you you're what's important about this channel. That is the only thing that keeps me going and it so easy for me to forget it. Even if I'm focused on the why and I know in my heart that I'm doing this for you and I'm doing this because I love to do this, even that isn't enough. Because if I let this slip through the cracks, And I know I'm not perfect, but if I let something as important as a promise go by [I mean] What am I, then? With that grand statement and, uh, a bunch of wordiness what I'm here to say is that I'm here for you Because I owe everything that I have to you. and if I'm going to be in this position where I can talk to millions of people out there and try and steer this community in a direction that I think is genuinely good then I have to hold myself to a higher standard. Not just in being better as an entertainer, but being better as a reliable friend. And so, I will make one promise starting off this new age of Markiplier where my word is my bond. The schedule, starting tomorrow, will be back and will never falter. Eight and Twelve, PST You'll get videos and I will tie in the ambition that I have. I will tie in the lofty goals that I have. And I will keep these promises, and whenever, I promise you guys something even if it's here through a video or if it's when I'm meeting you in person, if I promise it, it's going to happen. And I guarantee that. 'Cuz if I don't keep those promises, I'm not worthy of you guys giving me even a moment of your time. So I know this got serious, I know it did Uh, and- and I feel like it had to after the emotions of the tour and the-the windstorm of Vidcon and coming back for the charity livestream and just this blur of the past few weeks and then approaching my birthday (HAPPY BIRTHDAY) which I- I think you guys know that I don't really care about my birthday I- uh I just wanna say this is the best thing that's ever happened to me. What you guys have given me is the best thing that's ever happened to me. And I should treat it as such. So thank you so much for watching and thank you to Chica because Chica was the hero of the livestream because uh- uh all that aside, the one individual that made the most donations was Chica because we did a Pet-a-thon and there is a infinite pet-debt. "Chica do you mind me picking you up just for a little bit?" Moved the chair a widdle bit But Chica was the true hero of this livestream and I owe her a one hundred thousand pets from each and every one of you guys [baby voice] because we did an amazing job there and you were a great bub. You like [giggles] she's just like, "Eh" "This again" Aw, I hope you know how much I love you. And I mean it A hundred percent mean it There is no lie here There's no false promises here This is everything to me &lt;3 So thank you everybody so much for watching Thank you Chica for being there Thank you my friends who supported me Thank you Bob who flew into town Thank you AlaskanBlueJay for staying so strong and thank you everybody that I met over this past weekend And as always [cute baby pupper voice] we will see YOU [normal] in the next video Buh-bye! Bye, bub! Bopitty-bop-bop-bop Who's a puppy, puppy, bub? Love you Okey we'll letchu down Good girl! "Who's a goodie puppy?" "Who's a good puppy?" "Who's a good puppy!" "Whoseagoodpuppy" Oh, you're not supposed to jump up" "Don't up, don't jump" Even though I'm telling you to jump Don't jump Don't do it Oh no 
hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome to a very special live stream that I wanted to do I wanted to do Oh am i up yet hello hello hi hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome to a very special live stream for me if anyone's there say hi and I will say hi back to you hello hello anybody there nobody there oh hi how's it going hello hi guys welcome welcome one and all welcome welcome welcome I am doing a very very special livestream today for me anyway this game I talked about it in the video where I I posted the video where I did a little story when I was at VidCon hi guys hello my goodness so many names here hello hello hello everybody hello so I wanted to do a quick overview of the game home world and home world is a game that's very special to me for the reasons obviously I stated in that video and I'm loading it up right now so it'll be ready to go in just a second but I want to super lag where are we oh god are we there are we still here are you all still here are we all okay I have no idea happy birthday oh that's loud oh okay yeah I didn't load up the game yet I forgot that to go through all the settings oh my god it's crashing I swear this game is good guys I swear this game is good oh no it is completely crashed there goes my oopsy poopsy no no not ever I know you guys can't see it I know you guys can't see it but every time I touch something it breaks okay oh my god this is so finicky right now Oh rose again hang on I know you guys can't see anything I know just give me a second here I'm getting it all set up and ready to go apply okay I think we're good or you just ignore the grumbling and groaning that you see in the distance until I get the actual game but okay the game is up and it'll be ready to go and just to say let me turn down the volume for you guys anyway so this game is home world this game is part of my childhood and this game is something that I wanted to bring to you guys live because I wanted to talk through it with you like in in in the most detailed way I can and home world this is the remastered version so this is the one with updated graphics from everything that I saw when I was a kid I haven't played the updated version so my mind is still in that childhood nostalgia where everything was so much grander than it actually was everything looked more amazing than it actually did and everything was fantastic in ways that you couldn't have seen here so in this one we're just gonna go through what is essentially the first levels of the game so I can talk you through this because I in this in this like entire scenario this know that wasn't sure yeah I didn't load this up before so in this entire scenario to give you an idea of the entire world I'm not sure if it'll do the opening cinematic of it but if it does I'll let it play but because it got the narrator on like the opening cinematic 100 years ago a satellite detected an object under the sands of the great desert an expedition was set [Music] an ancient starship buried in the sand [Music] well this game so much deep inside the ruin was a single stone that would change the course of our history forever on the stone was etched a galactic map and a single word more ancient and the clans themselves hiigara our home Raiders so good oh god he's so good there's everything about this game I love and the opening cinematic is not done yet so the clans were united and a massive colony ship was designed construction would take 60 years it would demand new technologies new industries and new sacrifices the greatest of these was made by the scientist Karen's eject yourself permanently integrated into the colony ship as its living core she is now Fleet command the promise of the guide stone United the entire population every mind became focused on the true origin of our people every effort on the construction of this ship that would seek it out among the stars here we go this opening sequence whoo my mind as a kid this is the whole concept of just flying around in space like and this was like I hadn't played a lot of 3d games at that point and just like all they're talking about his leg reading prep for the ship launch so that's like that it's probably really loud I wouldn't doubt if it's really loud so please let me know if the volume is okay and all that stuff because I don't know if it is or I've I don't know if it's too loud and old but yeah when I was a kid uh when I first saw the mothership radar status [Music] reserving struction on line insertion cryogenic subsections k2j online [Music] Katie s online scaffold control stand by for alignment [Music] this music is called Adagio for Strings by the way for you music heads it's oh gods one of my favorite pieces of string music ever [Music] standby release control [Music] Paul Keller for bankers it looks so pretty it's so pretty the mothership has cleared the scaffold we are way and you like the sense of scale of this thing doesn't even translate it looks big here but it doesn't translate those little ships that you stopped popping out those are entire fighter jets coming out of this thing big ones oh it's so big and beautiful okay I'm sorry just I get so excited about this game I agree I said love this game so much I love it I love everything about it and there we have it okay so now we're actually in the game and once you are able to actually go into the game and you were actually able to data and generate mission objectives Oh hyperdrive test several trials must be completed by building the primary research ship resource processing by harvesting the asteroids provide oh okay hyperspace module charging 35% capacity and rising lugu mothership will be ready for the hyperdrive test and done good look at him go these are the resource collectors I know you don't care about the resource collectors but I care about the resource collectors we will be monitoring formation performance being provided here assign of formation to your fighters and destroy the drones yeah destroy those drills screw those drones get those at all they're sucking the horn oh that looks so good God man prove that so much that looks so good oh man the last time I play this was was it eight nine years ago now was the last time I played this game oh man if you haven't seen the video of me talking about this game and why this game is so important to me you can check out the video on my channel called the story of why I love space because this game is literally why I love space you see you like the magnificence of like the universe and and what's weird is like you zoom out and it's like these tiny little specks these tiny specks here are my scouts and they have to put a triangle over them cuz they're so goddamn small and then you zoom in and it's like oh dude oh you look at these little bastards and it's like oh my god you wanna know where the guy is in this one right there that's the cockpit this is huge guns and these are the scouts under the planets there you can see the lights I love it so much [Music] anyway I just want to show you guys oh yeah and I forgot the map isn't Alan what is map I forget that forget what map is space that's right space so you gotta go over here you got a fall a middle click to do all that stuff all the minor and then don't drone those drones you can give them oh wait no Han I forgot what is the oh it's been so long all right so I click to attack if I could get them no don't move oh yeah oh yeah 3d maneuvers like shift to go up and down because you're in space it's 3d this whole concept it blew the mind oh oh offensive formation I Delta formation that my favorite was always claw formation oh there they go they're aggressive today oh and then they were doing attack runs and they were just straight back and forth until all the enemies go boom oh it's so cool alright so kill those guys kill them good formation trial complete flight analysis shows a 22% increase in combat performance the next trial will test the effectiveness of tactics stand by to begin tactics trial so we're not just here we're evasive tactics I'm not gonna do target drones here I'm not gonna do a live stream of the entirety of this game I don't want I don't want this point set you up for this point but what I do want to walk you through is the the initial campaign and what what like just how this game not only from a sense of scale of like the the world that you're in and it and it is a really impressive sense of scale but also just from like the way the story interacts you just from right from the get-go it sets the stakes so high like this whole planet I don't know if you even you guys even caught it like hey attack things I think move and attack are they going to attack yeah they're going to attack so like not only if you caught it in the opening sequence like it set up the the stakes for this he United every single clan on this planet from a derelict ship that had a guide stone of their homeworld they needed definer they had to find it they had to find out who they were and it took eighty to a hundred years I forget exactly how long it took but it took lifetimes just to build this one ship so that they could go and they could find it music so good everything about Italy the next trial will test the performance of the salvaged Corvette this is like this is like an opening and tutorial gameplay style thing so it's like it's both the gameplay of the game and the the style of it itself so I am gonna calm down I promise I'll calm down thank you so much yeah but I just absolutely 100% adore this game let me just a on one say sorry I'll get right back into it there we go all right so now what was it oh yeah I got a build I got a build a board Corvette so your mothership is the thing that obviously builds all of your craft so you build doodly-doo you've got your different shapes which designate different like Fighters Corvettes you eventually get frigates you get capital class ships resourcing non-combat for research and whatnot but what's even more amazing is this ship can produce other capital class ships carriers destroyers like it's it's it's insane what comes out of this the first got a bill to salvage Corvette to be able to finish out this tutorial these guys are probably idling because these resources have been drained and I don't think there's any other resources to be had anywhere oh yeah so this this game is super important to me I'll recap like the story of why when I was when I was young my dad bought me this game and when I when I grew up like this game was very important to me I loved it a lot but you know it was this game but then after my dad passed away I came back to this game and a collector like I I saw it for what it really was and like the scope of it and the scale of it and that's what really really got me so happy about this game and like made me really appreciate space and so I just can't say in so many words about it but we're gonna get through this because this is this is I'll admit this opening sequence I've done it so many times it's boring to me so I'm gonna get through this because the more important things happen later because we have only a certain number of ejected zwi got to capture this one we got to build a research ship I forgot about that and we should have done that a while ago research alright and then this guy is gonna salvage this probe it's just teaching you basic concepts of that game not not the most important thing in the world yeah get that up get it I always love just like watching these things really closely like just watching them going through space doo-doo-doo-doo doodly-doo doodly-doo oh so good oh and there was a way to break the game obviously if you build too many things there are no other resources besides that if you build too many things before you ever built the research car the salvaged Corvette you are stuck and dead in the water and you can't progress and after we start the level just one of those things it's just like unforgiving and I kind of like it about that all right so after that and once the research ship is built which it's almost done then I can actually research something because I know that's what it wants me to do hyperspace module I haven't seen how they do the the new effects for this good luck everyone good luck the hyperspace is the first time they've no idea if it's gonna work [Music] oh yeah and then once you press that button you actually have to wait for all of your ships to dock I mean you don't have to cuz they have to dock or else they'll all blow up you know what I mean and the fighters are coming back okay oh I want to see it oh oh look at that it's gone okay all right so where we're going now we're doing a test jump we're not going all the way to hey Gaara right now you couldn't do that Oh hyperspace systems operating at full power if the hyperspace targeting system is accurate we will emerge in close proximity to the support vessel cárcel M this ship has spent the past 10 years traveling on conventional drives to reach the elder care act system the car Salim will monitor the quantum waveform as we return to normal space in the system tuning our drive control systems if the hyperspace module malfunctions the car Selene will provide assistance in resupply mission objectives will be to dock with the support vessel in order to complete adjustments to the mothership and her drives can you imagine that going out 10 10 years just for a test 10 years just sailing through the blackness just for a test so now we're on the outskirts of the characteristic which is where we just came from space complete all systems nominal and the quantum wave effect has dissipated thank you Karen the support ship is not here fleet command will signal the kharsa limb while we confirm our current position this is the mothership calling support vessel cárcel in come in please we've missed jumped and are requesting your beacon this is the mothership calling support vessel car salim please respond this is where you get the first hints that things aren't what they seal or shield up the car Slim's automated beacon send a probe to make contact can re-establish communications because yeah you know what I'm not even gonna say anything because it would just be a spoiler so you need to build a probe which you're super cheap I'm sending my guys out to do their thing but also I'm gonna bullshit and fly the ball so we got the probe so you send the probe out it goes super fast right all the way over to there let's follow this bad boy because this bad boy is fast go buddy go oh god he looks so cool now oh they made him so streamlines in the original game you could actually play as one of two different versions of the mother ships and all the ships were different made no sense story wise but you know I always played as the other version for some reason one my first step we're getting close we're already almost there [Music] oh when I first saw this it I was I'm shook I was a shook little boy I was like oh my god it's all broke Oh so pretty they did it so good update ah but in my mind it looks no different because in my mind this is how it always looked to try it try it is under attack engage incoming units the other ship must be defended oh it will be oh it will be Oh it'll be defended all right are you go over that now intercept intercept intercept intercept intercept okay engage engage alright so this is the first taste of like actual combat and the beauty of it is like all these ships that are flying everywhere they're barely more than little pixels in there to fighting out a fight to the death I was like watching one to seeing one of the group and just seeing how they fly around and they're like guys good know yeah I want to see the destruction oh hey those guys are tearing us up yeah this guy don't look so good he's going down Oh buddy you all right there buddy he's struggling and I always feel bad when will scouts died it's like there's a guy in there there's a fighter boo this guy's tough there guys going for it maybe he should dock back hey how about you know my research vessel get off of that take out the standard Corvette oh ho ho unrelenting fire see how that looks oh man good that guy yeah you have to like plan like everything was very meticulous because you had to plan the order of which bit because if you missed it like you had to strafe out and then come back round to it like it was legitimately difficult also why am I not researching anything I should be I'm not though okay so these guys you got to get rid of the Corvettes because the Corvettes are the ones that are actually attacking the mothership not that there's any actual damage like that would be able to happen to that but even so and Danzo Danzo get that last guy see if I can zoom in on this guy it Lulu ugly bastard with tiger stripes I so cooler things to use anyway ah and this is a taste of it this is just like the start of it oh is that guy running away I forget what it is what do I need to do out there doing fine yeah oh look resource man's coming in for duck nice good job good job man any more research Corvette right yeah but this is this is what it is love so much not so much are you done yet sorry I was waxing poetical interceptors are great by the way I love interceptors and whatever I guess they're fun copy come on just finish Mawson target animal weapon set the full power yeah Scouts aren't very powerful so Scouts are just like nothing where is that intercept there is this is my boy interceptors are my boy there there they're like only 30 units more than the other ones but they're way more powerful that should be the last one it's destroyed yeah damage repairs are underway yeah interceptor complete the kharsa Lima has been destroyed heavy weapon damage is visible on the remaining fragment a salvage Corvette must be sent to retrieve the mission data recorder will do alright so now we gotta send these guys out and I'm gonna send them out with a little squadron clutter pretty sure there was a I'm not a hundred percent sure but there might have been an ambush waiting for me over there either way they're a squadron now so go get em boys reporting alright I think there's a way you can like assign them to protect oh yeah aggressive I want to do I always like aggressive but shouldn't now come on move move move get over there get over there alright they're gonna go but obviously the salvage Corvette is way slower so these guys are gonna go over there because I'm not our percent sure but there might be something bad Aven maybe something bad over there waiting for us wait whoa what was that what was that I saw that something over there okay anyway not important confirmed yes slow piece of crap if I had to remember all this I used to when I played this over and over again I used to just automatically like know where to send them exactly where to send them when to send them but anyway so I sorry I get so distracted by this game all the time but this game like you guys can see why I love this game it is a real-time strategy it is yeah it definitely is it's a hundred percent real time strategy but unlike any other real-time strategy I've ever played like just the non dimension like the the technical aspects of 3d but also like the unn like the not so technical aspects of like micromanaging these guys would be a monumental task because you can't exactly control where they go you can do combat maneuvers and like it with your capital ships you can definitely do strafing runs and stuff like that and kind of control it in that way but when it comes to more detailed like more yeah yeah they're gonna accompany this guy wherever the salvage Corvette goes well one of them but yeah so like when it came to this hi hi guys hello hi guys there's either but when it came to this like just the sheer scale of it I loved it so much I that's why you have intercept course with the cars to live call direction of the salvage team as a primary objective oh hey that is that returned the sky was going to mission recorder that's why I'm here I knew Annie carrier they appear to be reinforcing their squadrons of Fighters and Corvettes with it uh-huh how about that good for them or it clear Oh a gimmick Corvettes and we let Corvettes alright so these guys are doing their things they'll be fine there's really nothing that Scout is like sacrificing himself Wow one-man army over here you know you can go back home but you're you'll be remembered I suppose yeah so you could potentially destroy this guy whoa yeah so this is an example of a capital class ship like it's a it is very technically a carrier and it can produce fighters so I can build a carrier that can produce fighters later on the game is such a smart way of doing RTS stuff like you obviously build an armory to build stuff and other games or whatever it is you build a barracks and Starcraft you know but the fact that you can build like another capital ship just makes so much goddamn sense cuz the capital ship is a ship itself and it flies oh he's always back so that'll be the last one and then it'll be another cinematic and then we have to get back because this ain't gonna be good I know the graphics are so good I mean compared to what they were I mean I know there's obviously games with like more photorealistic and who knows what this is in terms of photo realism but of the music - it's so weird but it just fits [Music] sir they're coming in fast they're getting through reaching across all deck whole integrity Bailey confidence of mothership the jurors leaving before hyperdrive can drive test it always unnerved me how calm they sounded because it was just like well they're under attack and they're dying it's like pilots in like any any plane like they have to be calm anyway so that's that you're gonna talk to me now there it is organize a defensive force to protect the mothership okay all right so I gotta take care of these guys they're coming in whatever it's fine I'll be fine I just got to build more I can build Corvettes like Corvettes all here yes Corvettes are gonna be the best thing dude where's my interceptors okay interceptor squad Scout squad doodly-doo okay one your aggressive go claw and do it once I get more like actual other shifts like frigates frigates you need their big somewhere in between a capital ship and a fighter like this they are like they can be ion frigates which are I cannot wait to see the ion beam in the new version of this but oddly enough like I don't want to like get too crazy about because this does look like homeworld 2 which was a good game and you know the sequel I love the first one more but you know obviously you get what you get Roger see if I can go actually kill this carrier I got one striker good job locked in come on office good for group 2 Strike Group attack order confirmed so I'm gonna have the scouts mop up these guys there we go those guys I wonder uh there was a way spear formation houses fear formation is great because then you can just it'll they'll literally just sit there around around the the capital ship and they will just orbit them and shoot them until they're dead if they lose all defensive capability and sphere formation but hey hey it's a lot of firepower to destroy oh I forgot the capital ship oh I forgot the capital ship can also cute forgot about that I just lost great - I'm done alright let's see yeah someone's someone's been eating yep yep yep all right anyway so I did that wrong but I got Corvettes over here that are gonna take care of this guy Roger all right what else can we build we're gonna need a lot more interceptors underway construction in the right direction underway oh no and I need to cancel some of those there we go they're done how many more we got all right we could just get these good as you left once this guy's dead and then it's just this guy oh dude the other guy already oh did he bug out already he did okay so the other carrier already jumped away so he's gone then we just have these guys left and then we can take care of him then we're good to go oh yeah you did you do doc oh oh wait no cousin one more they are where did you come from Oh finish them off come on we gotta get out of here we got to get back to the homeworld barriers oh kappa how many more of them are there kids get rid of that guy Gobert alright so they got that guy and they got this guy come and finish him up already all right there we go come on finish up there is always a dodgy one there he goes goodness gracious there's so many of these guys they're just all over the place where did they jump to oh can I just not see oh I was in the wrong space ok jeez do I have to kill that carrier then let's see how I would Oh destroy I do need to destroy the carrier Oh okay well that makes sense I thought that was what I was supposed to do then what was going wrong before yeah either way it's gonna keep that ended up in here attack vector laid in earth clear alright he's gonna take a bit longer than I thought because I was going about it the wrong way I was pretty sure that you were supposed to destroy that but I don't think yeah the carrier doesn't have any defensive capabilities does he and that wouldn't make any sense at all alright I'm just gonna have the Corvette's hammer the carrier there and hopefully they'll be enough to know it does have guns oh do have guns that's no good oh yeah and they got their their missile frigates or missile Corvettes sorry these are all things that you guys don't know about like I know these these uh stupid goddamn jerks hang on let me focus on this in concentrate interceptor coming here and assist get rid of these missile Corvettes they're tearing us up straight group attack order confirmed you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna hammer all firepower on the carrier because if that's the only thing that I got to do then that's we're gonna do no it doesn't have guns those are them oh I'm so stupid no he does have guns I know that you can see the impact of the bullets on this thing but I just couldn't remember it like it was actually shooting back or not well that's sad for group 1 maybe they should have been better oh man that thing man we are not doing enough damage to the thing [Music] the student combat stations friendlies under fire moving in ready acknowledged Roger Missy if I can steal this Corvette nope already on oh wait no yeah yeah I can maybe yeah get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it you got it yeah get it oh you should he's stupid yeah you're on our team now this is by Lou and then gone yeah you're mine now ah got ya okay so I just got to get rid of these who's more guys - yep I'm I am we're all out of oh no we're not all out okay we there's still some oh yeah the gas clouds that's right okay looking good huh what do we got here hell yeah standard Corvette we robbed them alright we just got to get rid of this this guy but I think we can sneak and steal actually if we can steal that one then we can attack this one yeah cuz if we can get that missile Corvette that's gonna be helpful go get him buddy oh we're chasing them out of the system oh yeah you get out of here we have too many collectors here expect delays uh yeah okay whatever this guy's gonna be able to get this game nabim don't kill him yet oh no you son like that don't kill no you interceptor bastard oh you douche oh you do Sh alright keep hammering that guy I really don't think we're gonna be able to kill him because it's just not enough that was it I didn't need to kill him I could never remember that it's been nine years I guess alright we're getting outta here we gotta go quick doc we gotta go we gotta go we're out of here baby we're out here we're out here okay there's where things get really really really intense hi guys hello hi guys yeah oh I'm glad you liked the game I'm glad you like it I love it a lot it's so cool it's on Steam if you want to get it it's on Steam analysis of wreckage reveals the hostile units are using strike craft ranging from fighters to combat Corvettes all pilots will be briefed in case hostiles have penetrated farther into the car axis tum' on our return to car act the final outfit of the mothership must be accelerated in order to defend against possible future attacks many major mothership systems are still incomplete we will notify car axial defense system of this possible threat the mothership will then dock that the scaffold for repairs stand by for hyperspace exit to car rack no one's left everything's gone characters burnin kuraki is

even beacons wait on the maintenance frequency I'm getting a signal from the cryo tray systems in orbit one of them is suffering a massive malfunction the cryo trays are under attack defend them moving to intercept ready it is likely they were involved in the destruction of capture at least one vessel for interrogation and destroy the rest yeah so the entire world is gone every single population is gone and I'm taking you with me hey ba how about you shut up and you come with me you're coming with me yeah Nana don't even think about oh I need to I forgot I needed to oh I forgot you needed to for that Oh No I'm an a-hole I forgot you needed to for a frigate oh no I'm gonna lose a cryo tray I always prided myself in being able to sell like save the cryo trays oh I forgot I was supposed to build that in the last one before I love oh that's fine it's not gonna be like world destroying for me it's just sad [Music] yeah cuz if I would have had to I would have been able to immediately do that but stupid me forgot oh well it's fine I get over here you got work to do come on come on come on come on come on no no not the mothership oh my god get away oh the mother she was kidding involved alright so cool because even the frigate you can see it's actually trying to shoot at that tiny target and it only hits it I lost the crab god dammit it doesn't have any impact on the game it really doesn't but like I always like I took it as a point of pride I wanted to make sure that I had all the crowd trays secured hey come on be nice to that guy be nice yeah don't shoot him alright now this guy is mine you come with me there you go that's a damn shit but once we get this guy in here you'll see what happened and then I'll explain it because obviously I'm not gonna do a full playthrough the game but then I'll explain it but I mean it'll probably explain itself because it's pretty pretty clear gosh-darn frigate [Music] I don't even know if the are there any resources to collect here I don't think so there's nothing here although I guess there are yeah always is I said that guys is gonna be slowly sucked into the mothership there i know space i know i know space ah space guys enemy units neutralized begins salvaging the cryo trays hostile vessel captured crew in turn interrogation is underway while searching the enemy ships computer systems we came across these flavor Corning's standby for playback [Music] analysis of the recording indicates that the karach missile defenses heavily damaged the attacking fleet however we have concluded that at present they can still easily defeat us we have therefore plotted a course to a deep space asteroid belt there we can hide and prepare our fleet for an assault [Music] all right so let me explain this and a was it this moment this or we have reverse-engineered the drive technology and developed two new ships plans for a third vessel are underway but will require frigate chassis research so let me explain this this like this is the moment where I got hooked into this game more than I ever had because I'm gonna explain this game and with Chama try without spoilers but at this point like I don't know if it's avoidable this game was so much more than that by the time I got to this point because they burned this planet because there was an ancient ancient ancient treaty an ancient law that these people villag Ahrens the people who live there and were subsequently burned were banished because in this universe there's only a few civilizations that are capable of warp technology the ability to have warp is everything you wouldn't be able to go to the other planets if you didn't have it but I forget what it was they specifically did but for some reason these people were banished from their homeworld and their homeworld was taken over by the very people that burned this planet and fundamentally just wiped him out like almost made them entirely extinct each one of these cryo trees has a hundred thousand people in it in addition from those crowd traits to the crowd traits already on the mothership that's all that's left maybe a maybe two million people of this entire civilization left in this ship with anger in their hearts trying to get back home and as the story unfolds throughout the rest of this game you travel this huge unimaginably big universe trying desperately to survive and struggle and maintain with what limited resources you have and your resource carryover from every mission your resources carry over you only have what you have and what you managed to take from each and every part if you waste your resources building things that aren't gonna help you survive you won't make it like just the beauty of that concept the struggle and and knowing that this universe was huge like that's that's what made it beautiful so incredibly beautiful and that's what I loved about and this game is long this game is like probably I don't eight hours long maybe ten depending on how how slow you take it if you take your time if this could last up to like maybe twenty hours but I'm gonna leave this it here cuz I just wanted to give you guys a lot of people were asking you to do a let's play this and I didn't want to do a full let's play of it because it was something very important to me but I think this is a good trade-off a personal like very personal for me like little introduction of this game to you guys and it's such a good game I love it so so much not only just for like my history with it but because the game itself is this beautiful but I'm gonna leave this here so thank you everybody so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this I really want to know like what you think of this game if you buy it for yourself and you play it later let me know what you think of it it is a good game and like I'm not sponsored by them in any way I'm not I I make nothing if you buy it like it's just this is it's beautiful so anyway thank you everybody so much for watching I will have another video out today don't think that I'm just trying to skip out on the noon video the livestream or nothing I've actually got another one that I want to put out today but just thank you guys so much for giving me the chance to introduce this game to you I hope you all have a wonderful day expect the next video in like a couple hours or so but thank you everybody so much for watching and as always I will see you in the next video bye bye bye bye guys bye bye bye bye 
(Obnoxious burp.) "Hi guys, how's it going? I'm live streaming right now on Twitch.tv!" (A really obnoxious burp.) "But don't worry!" "I'm gonna answer the question of whether or not you should actually go watch the stream or not-- right now with this handy-dandy yes/no generator." "So, should they go watch me livestream right now on twitch.tv?" "NO" -Heavy 2018 (A coldness hits at the core of Mark's deep and inner being, he stares at the screen in such shock he can barely hold together the last strength he has.) "NO! NO GOD, PLEASE NO!" (That one Office meme with Michael Scott in it.) "NO! NO!" "NOOOOOOOOOO---"

wait for I don't even know if I use that correctly but I'm gonna keep pressing forward as if I know what I'm talking about so the evil within - yo for those who want the basics of a survival horror experience keep an eye on resources approach situation with caution don't get overconfident I'm exactly as confident as I need to be for how great I am what are you talking about recommended for players who enjoyed the difficulty of the I did enjoy the difficulty of the previous game I will say that oh I will say that ah alright okay alright maybe maybe maybe maybe but it before I it before I get underway I got a I got to do one thing real quickly here I forgot and there we go I think that's gonna be good okay so what do you guys think hard nightmare nightmare mode nightmare mode might be might be the right way to go about it but I'm not arms insurer so oh okay all right okay all right a lot of people want nightmare mode but also I'm gonna go for it I'm gonna go for it I know it's probably a mistake I know it's probably a mistake home engulfed in flames tragic fire kills child man oh but that's horribly ironic oh no a fire consuming the newspaper that they're set a fire consumed the house of it oh no yeah yeah okay we're going nightmare we're going nightmare mode and I don't know where it's gonna leave buses now I see people like no don't do nightmare no you fool too big idiot listen to the sign it's clearly there for your protection no no this is not happening that it's clearly happening what are you looking at of course it's happening it's not a mistake I know what I'm doing Oh whoo look at me run go Sebastian did you think that that was Lily just blowing up right there no this is his this is Sebastian's past I believe like his tragic backstory that we were kind of touching on in the first game but I'm not 100% sure all right let's go this way Lebowski damn it damn it damn my family for being so secure and locking all the doors I'm in good I'm in good I just got back to vacation but let's take care of this this situation first yeah shit alright fine men well this is no good ooh backstory do they both have guns but it what did I both have guns do you see that in that painting they both have guns there Oh maybe is it because like they're both officers wait no that was here wasn't happening god I spent so long since I played the original game but I put yeah apparently but yeah that's right because the his wife is still alive now I remember yeah because oh geez oh come on out what Lily where are you I'm here dad's here you weren't here from you dad all righty then okay yeah I didn't I knew that was gonna be bad look from the very GetGo how his hand is still bandaged up from when it got stabbed well I mean it got stabbed and shot and broken BRABUS hello hi how are you doing hello Sebastian it's been a long time three years I've been trying to track you down for three years then you thought you'd find me at the bottom of an empty bottle is that it and why are you here now damn it you didn't find me because they didn't want you to calm down Sebastian you knew what was gonna happen in that hospital didn't you what happened at vegan is in the past you need to forget it you sound just like that psychologist that force shoved down my throat but he didn't have answers you do you're gonna tell me about Mobius yeah oh that's probably not good I think those guys are straight out of the matrix yeah because of this did you get this you know what you know what's super weird Kidman looks exactly like his daughter and I don't know if that's intentional but Kidman looks exactly like his daughter I'm not the only one that sees that right I read the police report I was at her funeral we can rewrite history if we want to staging a death is child's play why would I come out of the shadows just to lie to you Lily is alive and she's with us but she's in danger we need you to help save her safer what have you done to her you don't mess with Sebastian oh wow why what did you do that to my pork neck Lily needs you okay his agent Smith and Agent Smith back they're gonna help you with that okay my thought is at the end of evil within one it was never clear whether or not he was out of the whole system right good oh hello yeah oh oh no I'm in a chair y'all mighty Moebius be careful about what you say you don't know how powerful they are I have an inkling cyber suspicions have to kidnap a washed-up ex-cop to help them at least your terrible sense of humor is still intact terrible enough of this bullshit where's Lily right - all your answers are right here see ha ha I called it I think she's a lily Oh God not this wait no this was a hospital it was an unfortunate setback who's talking but we used the knowledge gained to build a new and vastly improved stem system and I don't like that Oh was that harder imagine it millions of minds connected together no no thank you happiness for one is happiness for all that trickles down happiness going on miracle will allow our species to achieve greatness no no no no we needed to start with a mind that was pure and clean enough to support thousands of personalities the mind of an innocent child you connected lily to that machine her daughter is quite special the most stable core candidate we've ever tested thanks to her the new stem has been a smashing success until recently over a week ago Lily vanished just stop sending signals what's this turn right at her began to collapse we thought it was just a technical glitch an easy fix so we sent a team of Mobius agents inside but then we lost contact with them and stem went dark think about this mr. Castellanos I am providing you an opportunity nice absolutely I see your daughter again but to save her life something you thought you failed to do before you can save her or let her die oh thanks for the choice it's your choice you know what fuck you wanna see I'm gonna climb into one of your dirty bathtubs and and go find my daughter who is a brain now and I'm just accepting this or whatever good luck Sebastian and please try to cooperate with any team members you might find him there right okay yeah sure you don't trust us but they have the same goals as you do no I'm probably gonna shoot him in the face I'm fine by myself just remember to call me the moment you find Lily so that we can begin the extraction process huh I'll be out here for you yeah yeah I don't think I'm out of Mobius to begin with like that's how it's got to be right like Castellanos has to be oh I'm glad in this wonderful future we're thick ball in the brain they still have USB ports are you ready be careful in there Sebastian of all the things like that Sebastian should not do mr. Castellanos please get your head together you've been looking for this person for three years then they suddenly show up because they want you to see them to one and then you you you know in your head but your daughter is gone but you suddenly have a dream about your daughter I know you couldn't save it right before Kidman shows up and tells you that the only way to save your daughter's to go back in this machine to rescue her from this fate to pay up to it's all bullshit Sebastian you should know better I've been falling for 30 minutes this is Bo oh okay I'm crying upwards now am I in the middle of a markiplier video there's so many tears in here okay I believe this no where am I going now this doesn't look good this reminds me of the big hall of baby heads Oh title sequence nice boy boy I mean of course there's a certain level of like acceptance to get into it you have to like accept a certain things this guy Sebastian Castellanos is very very desperate of course but I don't think I don't think that Sebastian was ever out of the stem system in the first place number one like that's no good number one like the technology levels that they have here is just very basic that looked like Disneyland I'm not 100% certain about that oh it's a hospital it's Beacon Hospital all right sue the barn this seems to be a lot of elements of fire because in the first game IRA would boo in the first game I remember that uh the the main guy what a ruthian or whatever it was he got burnt in a barn fire to be tied to fire my memories huh if that's the case then where my wife and child this place looks like my old office Crimson City Biddy you're self-conscious that built it you should ask yourself that question let's get down to business we sent some information into your room these guys right here cuz they're part of your team there are photos of a bunch of Mobius agents here your lost team why so your experts need rescuing - thanks for the vote of confidence why would they make this smut like the the horrible like futuristic mind prison that is this place look like a small town straight out of Silent Hill why would they choose to do that that's a horrible has anyone ever been to a small town I grew up in a small town it's no utopia let me tell you Valley true this picture of me it was burned up along with everything else in the house okay alright well my first commendation it feels like another lifetime yes because it was I don't know about that alright anything else here my jacket can I have that coat the coat looked good on me look damn good anything looks good on me admittedly I don't think I don't see her do union of course not Union Oh looks like any town USA exactly calm and relaxed the exact opposite of be control it doesn't seem like you've got much control this time either look I don't know what you're going to encounter in there if you need information I'd suggest you try talking to some of the locals you know canvass the area just like you taught me back at kCPT I have a real detective kid okay sure all right whatever I got to talk over to all this stuff and now me we're all stuck inside stem I still don't understand why you can't just take them all out of their pods and wake them up it's the matrix Mobius has got some stellar backup plans but why is that my responsibility I'm the one who already mourned the loss of my daughter Baker team leader uh-huh he's the guy I should try to find first why why him why why why I guess that makes sense I guess combat specialist huh hopefully he can take care of himself you think that all of them would be combat specialist considering they all seem to be like either ex-military or some like of that psychology and surveillance this one could be cagey mm-hmm all right fine Matt one last attack but at least he has some small arms training uh-huh okay why don't they all have small office training I'm stuck there we go our Liam O'Neill Liam Oh Irish was not even expecting trouble if they sent in all these technicians I guess that's true that could be what it is yeah if they expected everybody just to be technicians but I mean in what world is this place even reeked of technicians like what IT guy is gonna go into stem hey Larry climb into the bath tub of milk and go into this brain oh boy remember owning a cat I remember a cat I remember it cat very much hi candy how you doing Oh know if that was Kidman's cat those rice slide projector in the in Kidman's dlc thing when Kidman was doing the thing why is it covered in blood all right fine okay slide projector excuse me kitty go away I put this up on the screen of blood okay ah back yeah you know the uncanny valley where things just look creepy if you look at them that kids smile that's a dad to demon smiled I ever saw one all right I guess that's all of them right okay talking getting you there you always really if your damn machine didn't go on the fritz I would have spent the rest of my life mourning her and you wouldn't have cared I cared I'm not sure I believe you to manipulate me to get me to perform like a good little soldier these things should be before all friendship was built on a lie yeah you'll never know how I feel until you've lost your family better to have loved and lost is that what you're saying taken okay all right then well that's that and that's that everybody's got emotional baggage just get over it I'm guessing it is that brain goop is this some sweet brain goop oh it's been so long since brain goop oh it's gross and it comes from dead enemies that's cause there's brain goo thanks Kitty for getting this your brain goop Kitty all right oh I didn't do that just like bacon there should be a way out okay yeah I assumed oh but we just make regular doors you know what I don't know about save terminals I'm gonna need a lot of these because we're on nightmare mode on this one and it's just not gonna go good but I I'm already on Chapter two hey I got through Chapter one with flying colors I didn't even need to worry about no thing nowhere and at least I got a radio on me just like a real detective here we go again into the looking-glass oh that would have been a better name for this video into the looking glass is such a good name I can change it I'll change it later anyway so we're gonna get brain goop and we're gonna put it in our brain and our brains gonna be bigger and better don't ask how the cat got that you don't know you don't know how the cat got that a few too many chomps to the brain Euler region of another enemy mom can fix it for you she can fix anything yeah yeah no I'm not insane it's on nightmare mode because it said if I like the difficulty of the first game then I'll like this mode and I did like the difficulty of the first game because it was infuriating to the nth degree oh good clearly not lady be more praying goop I've got a wonderful family an amazingly smart and beautiful life why wouldn't I be alright whoa there Sebastian whoa there mr. Castellanos Oh Oh careful I've fallen into a many hole before usually doesn't end well for me oh I get the feeling that combat is about to start wait there's looks like the house from Resident Evil 7

the door then okay do I have a body mounted foot Oh hip mounted flashlights the most utilitarian of possible flashlight locations okay I don't think be tableau is gonna help me in this certain circumstance sir or madam boy you know it's always a good sign when classical music starts blaring out from a inconspicuous and dark hallway nope don't like that not one not one bit no I didn't like

whoa God is like is his mind like trapped in that one moment of death like in perpetuity cuz that's awful that's awful oh that's so bad and I'm gonna turn up the the game volume just a smidge here we go alright back the game yeesh my vacation was great it really was it was good to kind of like relax and get away from things and then eagerly anticipate the return of coming back to things such as the like as this also I want to mention that as of right now as of exactly right now there are brand new shirts available for sale with this awesome holographic logo you may have seen me wearing similar shirts in some of the van videos that I've been doing but if you go to markiplier calm right now you'll see some sweet sweet shirts both in the small print and the Big M on the front something Bad's about to happen hello I'll take this please ahh file mystic whoever did this must have enjoyed it nothing on the back alright okay you Shh so who in here would be sadistic enough to do this because it seems like there's other pictures on the wall and also some dirty gloves over there I'm thinking the doctor from out last one is something to do with this what I wasn't looking at that oh it's great B's block the way out okay all right well I fixed that one no I remember some timely shoves back in my day I gotta say though the graphics in this one versus the first game are vastly improved it's amazing what happens just a few years but uh yeah it's pretty cool Oh does your hand hurt after three years your hand still hurts buddy don't you get over it yeah this I'm not crazy this this looks a lot like the house from Resident Evil 7 and I know that's probably not intentional probably all decrepit manors look a bit similar but uh I don't know something about the rule hello Castellano speaking these darn pranksters they're always calling me up in the middle of the night right before I get in the bath whole lot of nothing over there a lot of something over here boy hello

person ain't cool but then again like you do know death doesn't really mean the same thing in this place like these people might not actually be dead I mean they probably are but considering there's been a lot of weirdness I wouldn't be surprised if Jojo walked around the corner and haunted me from the grave oh yeah that's what I think about that oh boy this I don't like no that's the opposite of what I wanted on my day here today ah nope okay all right then well I did Lee hum doh where are you gonna go oh geez I can't go there alright well I like the placement of your spooking chair it's very

a bottle that would have been incredibly useful for me to have right before everything else happened did this guy have a gun on him is that what the deal was for this guy oh no no this is this is Billy every teen this isn't actually one of the members of that club there all right let me take care of this guy boy I sneak slowly I sure hope I can upgrade my sneak in speed just like what my

Shh into my gun okay Wow Wow whoa hey calm down don't shoot Lin it's me I'm not gonna hurt you see Oh Danny Boy the pipes the pipes are calling you can lower your gun I'm on your side you're not Mobius you might not be one of those things but that doesn't mean you're on my side you're right I don't work for Mobius but I was sent here by them try this machine with those things out there what they can do No yeah I have lucky for you your partner was willing to sacrifice himself so you could escape think he was willing he was just a member of Union security detail protecting me was his job and my job is to solve a hardware issue dying inside here is above my pay grade I'm not a soldier I'm just a technician I know stop all right well Liam sorry that went that way but it had to be done I like your soldier would have taken the safety off ha ha ha Ricky miss told you we're on the same side let's try this again I'm Sebastian Castellanos oh no no that's not right it's Castellanos get it right next time Sebastian I'm O'Neill Liam oh no it's Liam Oh iris oh I'm sorry Moebius but they sent you in here why I'm looking for my I'm trying to restore the core just like you are yeah good luck with that mmm I'm done I'm just gonna hold out here until extraction they can't extract you not until Lily is found it was Lily look everyone is stuck in here until the course okay can you help me out if you're asking me to go out there with you you can forget about it this is a safe house so I'm staying safe got me but I may have a lead on the core I detected some signals nearby that resonated the course frequencies got opinions we were trying to track them when we got attacked here listen to this it sounds like a little girl right was that her the car I think so but I've been picking up all sorts of weird signals on my communicator since we got here no way to know for sure until you track it to its source how do I do that your communicator can pick it up too once you're out there check it you'll see you'll probably pick up other signals while you're out there it wouldn't hurt to follow them to find out what no way the core first it's the only way we're getting out of here suit yourself let's pair up our communicators that way I can tell you if I find anything yeah okay can't hurt I guess sure all right why wouldn't they be oh oh do I love trees ah some of the stronger eggs are pretty tough takes a lotta ammo to get them off my back you got something stronger in here stronger ammo here but bigger bullies I'm out there this place was designed to be peaceful but Mobius and firepower go hand in hand weird about know where I can find some of this firepower it's a pretty chaotic out there you're not gonna find a pile of heavy-duty weapons altogether but I did see something useful next to an abandoned APC just outside I'll mark its location for you but be careful there are a lot of those things hanging around it all right let me let me turn up the volume real quick because I think it's still just a tad quiet let me know if that gets too loud but I don't think it will be all right so opinion first before I move on to the other stuff here I have a distinct problem with him not knowing who Lily is and not recognizing the name Castellanos considering he's in the bathtub where right next to the bathtub on a big plaque and big bold letters says Lily Castellanos it's all a ruse it's all a lie I don't know this guy's ignorant or untrustworthy O'Neil makai Rashmi I'm not gonna give you my potatoes and not gonna happen there's no way that he didn't know the name Lily going into this thing if he's a technician of this thing then he knows how it works right he would know that there would be a lily inside and it's not Lily inside they're using that to make Sebastian it's more dangerous out there than I expect that's my theory any idea kit mean is actually weapons and supplies I tried to tell you about this one signal but you didn't want to hear it well I'm all ears now I picked something up from to Mobius security team members who were talking about weapons caches maybe you can follow it and get some gear maybe they're out there can help you out now let's think about it come on man I'm all alone in here I could use some protection maybe if you hadn't let your last guard take the fall for you whatever we have to signal on your communicator whatever follow it or don't follow it I don't care Wow O'Neill okay all right excuse you oh that's cool live members of you it's like it's like sub mission forces greenie in here to help us but yeah there are five search team members wait did you just say were I found Baker he's dead huh doesn't surprise me he locked onto a powerful signal and went to investigate I told him we should just request extraction and report our findings leave the dangerous work to somebody else but he wouldn't hear of it being team leader and all always had to be the brave one asshole oh there's a thin line between prudent and cowardly - tomato tomahto I'm not saying I'm great tomorrow with what kind of asshole do you think I am I hope the others are okay I'll let you know if I find anybody else why couldn't they've made him say potato pudding so you've been stuck in here a week already has it been that long damn sometimes a little fluid in here this is supposed to be a simple in-and-out job like home in time for dinner simple but this is different than anything I've ever seen before what do you mean wonky stuff usually happens when a core goes AWOL but what's happening is more than that this place is falling apart of the seams we use the stable field emitter but it's not working like it's supposed to what's the stable field emitter if Mobius since you in here shouldn't you know this stuff already uh we're not gonna talk about that also did you guys notice how his nametag it says Mobius on it but instead of like Mobius it says like with the way everything is over it looks like mofo like if that's not if that's not foreshadowing something or trying to paint them in a certain picture I don't know what is I must save here plop this bad boy in their new slot please yeah I didn't mean to that but alright double save for double security rule number one of the zombie apocalypse double tap or something call the method of health regeneration is a good old cup of coffee that is freaking hilarious I didn't need to use that health thing if I'd have known that there was a cup of joe waiting for me around the corner excus takes a while for another pot to brew takes the edge off it really stitches up these bullet wounds God this knife in my shoulder feels a lot better now god I love this game I love it so much that is freakin hilarious I love it I love this game alright Wolff crafting or weapon upgrade all right let's see what crafting ass bullets are always good I could always use that I don't think I have three of those but I have a lot of gunpowder what's that spicy gunpowder down there of the farty variety all right let's make some bullets how about just three ah yeah let's do that I'll probably need him okay that just made three bullets it takes three stats so much my weapon upgrade what do we got here ammo capacity fire rate I don't have any weapon parts so I can't do any of this but yeah that seems pretty similar to the last one the crafting of items is cool because I don't think you were able to do that before field crafting icon from the arsenal to craft items without a workbench field crafting requires more resources than crafting at a workbench and you cannot upgrade weapons of your field crafting that's handy all right I can assign it to a shortcut apparently let's put that bad boy eight let's put that bad boy eight oh I can't set a shortcut oh that's stupid I'm gonna set this bad boy at one get all my bottles in one so I'm really wearing doodle I'm out there willy-nilly at random Oh weapon Bart's oh sweet I'm still not gonna upgrade prolly well let's see if I can give me a bunch what excuse me I'm gonna just there's one corner of the benches all I'm really gonna work on let's see what we got I think fire power would be the best application of this 90 90 90 oh all right I can't upgrade anything right now I'm going to save it until I know exactly what I should go for you're not gonna go for anything so high yeah hope no one heard that excuse me not what I meant yeah all right let's see what's going on over here hey Liam who is that there's something weird out here you know what I'm gonna go for it hey I'm Eric I'm Eric come back look at you real hard you got coffee in there really use some cup of joe who is that my wife again my wife this is leading me into who a sneaking chair a broken chair oh you got my portable spookin chair Oh finally that's not good huh so we'll do it that supposed to mean this is the goop juice chair not good oh I made a horrible hair oh yeah I know you oh you could craft bullets in the old game yeah hey let me out of here no oh no you're not my wife detective Cassady Janos what a pleasant surprise welcome back you again how are you here I could ask you the same question regardless it's nice to see a familiar face even if that face has seen far too much you don't know how much my face is seen detective no I can help you get back in shape don't like where this is going just like before thank you okay just like before where's the coffee play into this can I get some soup really could use some hot hot soup Oh athleticism that's what I need pretty much everything stealth Oh my spoken skills can I upgrade my spooking skills oh no that's what I wanted but it's just one away no enhance spooking is right there ambush my super spook ah my grabby hands brow brow lured you I'm gonna be so good at spooking oh man I can't wait predator spoke inator I'll pay the full spooky oh man I can't wait that's exactly what I wanted okay I'm saving up for the spook oh man that's so it's not it's not at all all right I know I don't even need to look at anything else hey lady hey lady this place give me an idea what's going on you it's just like beacon but this isn't beacon this is Union is it it all seems familiar to me these walls that chair you for me it's as if nothing has changed at all is this what I brought in here my office is relaxing but it's no place to loiter all right I find that now am I ever going to get these nails right didn't you keep interrupting my manicure uh don't you think it's time that you moved on to the task at hand no lady no I know my off all right fine whatever okay all right well I can't upgrade so I'm a stand save the goop in for another day I need a lot more juice where's all my brain goo bat anybody want to give me brain goop did I get any more slides I don't think I did no I don't have any more slides I don't think anything else would have spawned in the air I don't think there's any reason to go back in here oh but one of them is deceased two of them actually aren't they wait who was the other guy oh that was he did say that there was a security detail already in here so tip of the knife is a dangerous job yeah and he's dead now anyway I have a very dry sense of humor let me cook my way into that mirror by cat buh buh don't kick you all right let's go back in here but keep moving forward is she a program that I don't know she might actually be inherent to the stem program I mean just because she has like she remembers me doesn't mean anything at all there's definitely some pooping potential out here all right let me put on my scooping shoes okay let's see if I can find this signal okay let's go for them all suck it up James we've been through worse than this and we're better armed this time or at least we will be once we raid the supplies come on that must be a signal O'Neill mentioned James what's this one looks pretty far away but it's the only lead of God if it's anyone not that Lily I'm gonna get there and then turn right back around because it's just bullshit all right I'm gonna go for the road signal first all right back into spoofing mode yeah all right sounds like that's that that's disconcerting everyone keeps in her up in my spooking mode I got much mooking shoes on problem or advice you go in that building and tell Liam pick Irishmen that there's a bit of a problem out here Oh Sebastian look out Sebastian no don't do it oh boy if it keeps breaking apart like this there won't be any Union to search yeah try to find that signal and I'm gonna take my time all right i'ma take my time hey lamb uh you might be dead in like two minutes just just fair warning whoa was that hello I'm under here hey what's going on in here Oh coffee Oh gunpowder ah blue glow and gunpowder I should have known okay there was something going on in this church I want to make sure no that's where the other signal was let's go to see it was uh whoa now what about this other one what fallen

good bye good bye 
Hey guys, I wanted to make a video that's a little out of the norm from what I usually do. Uh, this is in relation to the Stoneman Douglas shootings and first and foremost I have to say that I'm incredibly proud of the way the kids have been handling themselves, how they've been demonstrating all across the country in the organization of marches and talks with people in political spheres. And usually, I stay out of anything that has to do with politics or religion or anything of the above. But in this particular case, I felt I needed to say something because some of my fans have been affected by this and some of my fans are out there demonstrating about this. And I wanted to say something because I don't feel it's right that kids have to be the ones on the frontlines of this fight. And - and I wanted to throw in my support and give my thoughts on the matter for whatever that may be worth. But to give you a background, um, I have an extensive background and experience with guns. My father was a 24-year Army man. He was a member of the NRA. He taught me about guns from a very early age, and he taught me to respect them and how to properly handle guns. I have gone to the shooting range many times. I've shot all kinds of guns. My dad even built muzzle loader rifles as a hobby. So, when I say these things, just know that it's not coming from a place of ignorance. And first and foremost, I want to say that I don't think people should be able to access assault rifles. There's no beating around the bush. There's no kidding about it. There's no exaggerations. Assault rifles exist solely to kill people. And you could say the same thing about all guns, but assault rifles are especially - they don't have any purpose in hunting. They have a purpose in self-defense, only to the point where they can kill multiple people with a lot of bullets in a very large magazine. And... I know I'm going out on a limb into saying this outright but, I'm a hundred percent in the field that we need to ban assault rifles. And I know that people will say that gun control laws are not the thing that can change this, or at least they'll say that it's not the only thing that can change this. But in my mind why not do everything in our power to try to protect our kids? Or our people, or our fellow countrymen or our neighbors. And in the avenue of trying to attack this from both sides, why don't we stop stigmatizing mental health? Why don't we stop treating it like some sort of problem that people just need to bear alone? That should be the first and foremost if everything not just in these, but in general because there's so many people out there suffering silently with mental illnesses that need help and are so afraid to go out and get it, because of the way we treat it in this country. And also why do we require more licensing and registration for cars than we do for guns? I know that people abide very closely by the Second Amendment, and me as a proud American, I'm very proud of our Constitution. But at the same time there has to be some measure of control. I know that people want to be able to bear arms and I respect that. I come from a family that was all about that. But that doesn't mean that we can't have some measure of control over these extremely dangerous tools. In the end people will say that I'm spouting ignorance or that I don't know what I'm talking about. Or that I'm saying things that are wrong, and that is fine. But right now, the only thing that I can think of is why shouldn't we be doing absolutely everything in our power to help? Now is not the time for talk. Now is not the time for empty promises. Now is the time to do something for the people that are suffering most from this. And I want to end this by saying that these kids that are out demonstrating, they are an inspiration. An absolute inspiration, not just to me but to everybody watching across the country. And if you're watching this and you are out there demonstrating or you're organizing marches. Or you're talking to the people who are supposedly in power of these decisions, keep it up. Cause the world is listening, the country is listening. People will try to ignore you and people will try to dismiss your opinion, but you are the future of this country and you are the future of the world, and your actions dictate what our future will be. So, don't give up the fight, stay strong and thanks for watching. Bye. 
Doodly-doo, going down the mountain! Doodly: hello! So I just spent all day recording, well not all day But I recorded a bunch of videos today, and I've been really loving playing super flight It's just like a very relaxing, like, so even though it's like, *panics* horrendously Nerve-racking with like the-the risk of death flying around every corner. I just kind of had fun with it, so I (Markimoo noises) Wasn't paying attention I probably should look while I'm flying down a mountain I'm trying to get a high score, but every time I get like some good moves I try to be fancy about it and so I shoved my head up my own anoose and then I.. I'm just an asshole about it, and then I don't go anywhere so This is a weird one, what the hell. Oh my god. I've never seen a map like this is so cool (so cool count: 1) wheeEE Free points! Uh oh! Oh getting fancy. (Stroke), awesome, I know. Oh, I know it's so cool. Yeah. I think it's randomly generated (so cool count:2) I'm not 100% sure ,honestly It's a fun fun fun adventure. shoop, Niicee, my high score is dismally low right now because for some reason, I can't keep a streak going to save my life uh oh, uH OH, OHHH NO See that happens! I get stupid! You're a man, in like, uh, wing suit, like one of those cliff diving wing suits. squirrel suits, or whatever they call em', I'm not 100% sure. But yeah, its one of those suits, and you're going around and you're being an idiot Tiny! tiNY! TINY!! nailed it. Why wasn't that a bonus? &gt;:0 Stupid! To the window, to the wall,to the sweat drip down my foreheAD! UGHHAHAHA I'm an idiot OHH Double! oh come on! it's not worth double!? its not a double dagger?! Piece of garbage just circle back around oh now. I got the speed for it. Oh. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah Oh, it's such a fun I almost lost it. I don't know why but I almost lost that please give me enough speed I Know that I can't make those and then Okay good news good news Have you heard the good news the good news is I'm not terribly stupid and this guy hasn't died yet. Oh my god. Oh Okay, great great. It's not going in that portal. Just yet. We've got too much good stuff here, ooh Way too close uh ah How about this one? No? I'm not gonna make that one note I would not I I knew I wouldn't have made that one so it's good call on my part I'm a smarty can I make anything else? No okay? All right? See ya! It's good. It's good. All right cool Oh, so the way this game works is exactly like if you were wingsuiting down a mountain. You kind of just just slam your face and break your everything, every bone in your body gets broken so that's That's literally the only way to play so it's the only way to do it in real life, too, I guess I Don't understand anyone that would actually do this in real life (I would hope not, but some do) Like I get it the adrenaline rush is what people go for but personally like it's just like the risk for the reward oooooh That is nooot anything *sighs at his inevitable crash* Oh God See I get up to like 20 to 30,000 and then I just lose it because I play it fast and loose like an idiot (at least he's trying) OOOOH like an *nervous laughs at his fast and furious crash* ooh, that did not go well for that guy It is why i cou-  *crashes again* pfttbbbhh This is why I couldn't do it in real life That's why I would never do in real life Cuz I would die like just plain and simple I would just die TINY- *crashes once more* Oh god, there is no saving it There's no second chances for me. It is just pure. Oh, I'm not gonna make that yeah I don't even think that gap is get a bow if it is gettable It's so precise that it's not definitely not worth trying for, but here I go again. Ah haha I made it in the hole that means it's possible Okay, ah AUGH so close I just want to get this in super fun. Oh Come on. I was right there Uh-oh it's millimeters. It's millimeters It's millimeters- okay on target, ye-ehe-ss 
 (ah finally he did it!) Yaaas, yaaas, yaas, oh Yes, oh oh. Yes. Oh yes. Oh yes oooh, yes Come on is that it, that it really? alright, welp here we go noowaaaaoooh *shakes head at self* tsk I'll never break the twenty thousand barrier because I'll always be stupid *jump cut woop* a, b, Yes always b stupid, always b stupid *the sound of concentration* *the sound of concentration* - Oof Oof x2 Oof x3 Oof x4 Oof x5 - Oof x6 ooowwwff oof Why do I choose to do things the hard way *panic of the opera* *more opera* *a sing song improvise* *a sing song improvise* Okay cuz it's more satisfying see, this is- see I say I don't get why people do the whole adrenalin junkie thing and yet here I am - I am pursuing the hard ones because it's more fun So- ooh- I thought I didn't get that I thought I didn't get that I got an achievement, but I didn't get that WHEE HOO Okay, I see a small silhouette of a man who fitting through a hole yeah Uh, yeah, it feels good endorphins in my brain. Uh uh trees watch out alright. Got some here Just go for the small. Hole. I like it a small hole and you can quote me on that yes points Yes points Yes point Not worth it though is not worth it alright. Let's see if we can keep up his speed ooh. This one looks fun and horrifying Yeah, I bet I hope there's a gap through this oh good. There is it looks good That's a good approach ooh bad approach bad. Ah Okay, we're fine. We're fine. We're fine. Everything's fine. Oh, man. I'm sizzling. Oh yeah. Oh, yeah, this is a dead end This is a dead end no it's not It feels good endorphins in my brain Hahaha new high score. Yeah, don't tell me to get I got an achievement called get a life you shut your mouth I know exactly what I'm doing with my life, and it is taking a break by screaming at a game and is Supposed to be an emulation of a very death-defying sport how many people die doing this probably a lot Yeah Yeah, oh. Yeah. Oh, yeah, okay? Ah do I have enough speed. I probably don't here. We go anyway Oh, No here we go Okay all right oh boy Why did I do that there was no reason it was just no reason Squeeze okay odds of dying in any base-jump activity is one in two thousand three hundred and seventeen I Guess that's not that bad. I guess it's not really odds. Is it. It's it's not really up to odds That's probably the statistical odds, but not the the practical odds. See if if I were to try to base jump I would die because I'm an idiot and I'm not good at that like how do you even practice? Oh, No? Please whoa Wow I saved it. I saved it. I am amazing I am amazing. Did you guys see how amazing I was Almost doing there hey, there's no gap I was doing so good. I was doing so good Why do I try why did I bother trying in life? I don't why don't I just like let my failures be the lesson that I learned and just Remember that I shouldn't try I mean that's obviously what this game is telling me. There's no gap there I almost did it again, but I learned my lesson my failures have taught me well Oh well where am I going where am I going where am I going where am I going? Oh? Oh god? Oh? God is this what it's like to be a fighter pilot, or a bird or a flying squirrel? Mm-hmm oh gosh, so scary all right. I'm out. I'm out. I know let's try it looks good enough. Oh Don't freak out don't freak out. Oh my god. There's no way out. Oh my god. I found a way. Oh my god That was amazing oh my god. I have the biggest boner right now Okay, all right we're fine Everything's fine. I don't know how any of that has happened, but okay Oh, so scary. I think I peed my pants Too tight a gap yeah, yeah ooh in all kinds of oh oh That was too small it was too small oh boy here we go fancy maneuver. Oh Fancy maneuver not really fancy. It's kind of gold. I caught the go down maneuver It's just where I go down a lot a ye, okay. Let's try as Uno, mas all right. We're going in starting my attack run oh Why did I do that I was doing so good I was doing so good. I survived all those amazing Amazing maneuvers, I survived all the death-defying stunts and I like maliciously slammed this character's head into a wall for some reason just because I like pain because I think some part of me like just Automatically knows that I'm doing good in some aspect And it's like you need to shut that shit down mark can remember you're not a success So you just shut up and get back to your corner of failure a little bit And it causes me to just do the stupidest things imaginable at any moment, and that's how I live my life That's what happens in my life. I'm not doing it. Oh If it wasn't obvious in this game you get points the closer you are to objects so the more death-defying your stunts are Obviously the more points you get just like real life Right and you can build up some sweet combos by staying real close to things oh Why why? Why oh geez okay? I'm starting my attack run oh? My head *laughs* I need to stop saying I'm starting my attack run because I'm pretty sure that's the that's the code for the game to kill me here We go on the attack run. What a good attack run. We've got here fellow gems oh I'd like to think I'm just sending clones of Jim off into their death. I've started my attack run oh God why do I keep saying it it is what's killing me. It is 100%. What's killing me? I've started my attack run. Oh? Can I just get one please I just want one sweet sweet savory swears slavery attack run That's all I want ass Waverly save early attack run. Yes starting my attack run. I'm sorry my attack run I'm attacking my run my runs. I might as my shit is running right now. I've got running All right there we go oh I almost land right into a Bowser again So close so close so close there buddy throw him So bloody closely Oh going for it shouldn't have gone for it That was a lesson that I learned there that juncture I shouldn't try in life You should just give up as soon as he possibly humanly can and then you will only experience joy at that point And you can finally live your life without worrying about ooh the problems of society oh I'm going for it. Oh, that's a sweet sweet nuzzle. Oh yeah, I've started my attack run My attack run might have been an error. Oh that looks like a gap Awesome Oh another one your ass another one. Oh mistake You're about to see That was intentional to show you what not to do now you're about to see some pro level gaming that I Know you come for and I know you stay for and it is from a to you That I send the love that I am showing you right Now like a bullet through the sky. Oh oh ah goddamn it Yeah, yeah, you know what I'm not gonna go for those anymore I'm just gonna go like why do I keep going for the tunnels? I don't have to go for the tunnels you can just let go Get a better combo get like the multiplier up and then ooh Right, and then you get plenty of points, too And it's not as many points obviously it's some points. It's not as many so I guess it's not as fun Woah wind?! what that was that wind did wind blew me? Wait can wind blow you in this game Can anything blow you in this game? Can you get blowed in this game? Oh? What a handy dandy feature Is that possible?  I mean there is window and the camera does oh, okay alright. That was my fault Alright, Imma go this way now Oh, yeah, oh That was right on the belly, I nuzzled that with my Tumtum. I felt my navel scrape along the ground there pleasant sensation if ever there was one oh Wow everybody celebrate how great I am in your own way and make sacrifices sacrificial lamb for how crueI am?! Alright cool cool cool. I don't ask most of my fanbase only that they make a Blood Pact no meehh Ever just remember Yeah, you think back to a moment in your life when you're like okay. I have the chore You ever think back to a moment in your life when you're just like I have the choice Whether I'm gonna live my life as a productive member of society or I'm gonna live my life screaming at a video game that I could be good at But for some reason I actively choose not to be good at it. You know you remember ever I think everybody remembers that moment in their life when they experienced you know that that conundrum of choice And they have to look within themselves and be like okay. I know I'm gonna be a loser yeah I'm gonna be a loser and then That is what you is and that's what I am and that's how I got to where I am today So if you want to have the same level of success that I do which is none just remember just to admit that you're a loser and Don't do anything worth a damn in life, and then you'll be fine Fear fear fear fear one fear two fears many fears one fears breaking all my bones of my body the other is standing naked in front of an auditorium So the tasteful nudes are gonna be a little strange for me. Yo whoa Camouflage itself I didn't see the giant floating pillar anywhere who could have seen it you came out of nowhere Alright, I gotta get a little ballsier. This is gonna take forever. Okay. Here we go after my attack run well This is a mistake. Okay. There's no attack run to be had in there Oh break heart whoa I almost made that one that was pretty good. Okay well there's a Ledge there whoa Oh almost ah Ah what the hell is happening there I was like getting blown all over the place that can't be wind if there was wind in this game. It would like ruin like the sense of skill oh Oh, oh, I am very fortunate that the formation of the hill went as thusly because otherwise No I daaaaa Why I just want to get a good score nope not gonna do it I was tempted to do it but Ohhh-ha-ha I just said that I was tempted to take the dangerous route and I die On the safe route, this is gonna be the high score run. You know why cuz I'm starting my attack fuck Yeah, that's the stuff oh, yeah, that's the stuff when someone asks for the stuff They're gonna point to this and they're gonna be like that that that right. There is the stuff now I'm gonna be like oh. Yeah. Yeah, I recognize that stuff. That's good stuff Yes that is the stuff what's going a portal go to portal for all? All right, let's study this I see a spot Risky, but I like it. NOOO what's in here I wonder I wonder death ah Okay, okay, all right. We made it. We made it. Okay. Oh where am I going where am I gonna wear my god? Where am I going? Oh break? Okay? I got to a triple score? Nice, portal time. Oh you, okay, I'm starting my attack run Oh, No I said it oh, no, what's gonna happen I'm gonna die very very likely very likely very very very likely okay. I have begun oh Boy, this attack run is going very poorly Or very goodly okay alright not  bad not not bad, ohhhh Not bad no holes to go through, but you know You know this is a gap. Oh, this is a gap this gap that goes nowhere. NOOOOOOOOOO I coulda broke right. Oh, there's lots of gaps. Oh. Nope. I Like how it says awesome right before I died as if I didn't know how bad I was already whoo. That's a good gap That's good. Yeah. Oh, that's a bad gap. Whoa whoa whoa whoa come on. I was doing so Gucci there we go there we go And yes, okay, where is this going? I don't want to go through this one noo! this one just sucks it sucks It sucks. It sucks. All right. You know what I'm gonna play. It safe this time all I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna play it nice and safe. I'm gonna play it super safe i'ma play it super nice I would just like coast be real chill about things. I'm just gonna go down to the easy gaps I'm not gonna go for the big bonkers. I'm just gonna cruise because cruising is where it's at Please please please oh I'm not going for that gap as fun as that would be Not doing it cuz dying is not nearly as fun as living I think I missed all of the portals. That's alright. I don't need them. You know why cuz I've got you guys Right I can always count on you guys Oh What hell is this? What fresh hell have I walked into this is uh? oh That was actually a gap who'd have thought oh. Oh I suck. I suck I suck. I don't suck I don't suck guys guys. Did you hear the good news? I don't suck. I don't suck at all I've got like antisuck I in fact. I blow-by-blow guys guys. I blow yes Yes, yes, oh Eh? Ohhh Fuck me I'm actually concentrating. I'mma try hard on this one. Cause I'm doin good. Doing shockingly good. No one could have ever expected this out of a little little boy out of Cincinnati Ohio from a small town called Milford. No one could have possibly anticipated Whoa no one could have ever surmised. No. I lost my combo okay, never mind. Okay. Bye. Oh my scores gonna be so beefy There's gonna be a good one I can feel it guys, No. Oh my god. Are you kidding me? Are you yanking me? Aah? I haven't seen any good opportunities to even try To do any like sick maneuvers, which is probably why I'm surviving up until this point I mean I've gone through a few gaps, but nothing that would equate to a sick nasty maneuver Yeah, hold on nothing all right well off I go to the next one nice nice nice nice sick nasty nice sick nasty Ok bailing. Uh-huh got scared. I got scared and bailed and I'm only getting like 4,000 per level So I don't even know if I'm actually close to my high score, which is like 69000 But I don't think I'm actually close to my high score because I haven't been able to actually go through it. Oh Never mind, then new high score everybody shut me up. Shove a dick in me and call me Sally. I need to shut my mouth Okay there we go oh why am I why my? No no no I said as I was doing it why am I going Oh?
