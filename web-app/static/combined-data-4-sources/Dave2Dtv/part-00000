I'm based out of Toronto and I'd like to shoot some a special Overwatch vid for youtube with you.. @superscientific need to keep it for referencing =( If you're a chromebook MASTER, then it's awesome - but for 99.9… https://t.co/xUcABNltd0. @superscientific Not at all. @Parithi A watch from Nixon. @neilkelly88 i haven't played around with enough phones in that price range but i imagine it's really competitive there too. @KicstarV yup. stoked for that device. looks promising. @StarFire2258 yup yup. @StarFire2258 right? and SO many of them are kick ass phones. @LOTReviewsBA @maglalangpankik at the top end, ya that's probably the same top 3 (maybe diff order)
but at $500-700… https://t.co/PMLHaHXz4K. @brolshevik ya but which one? It's hardest at the $500-600 price point. Sooo many good options. @LaurenceZ isn't it awesome?! there's something really cool about that screen. @ChengmingAlpert even to purchase one. the decision process in 2017 is so much more difficult than it was 2 years ago.. There are way too many good phones right now. It's so hard to stick to a daily driver. @tldtoday omg that teal. @tremblingwater this is so good! congrats!!. @jasonick1 👍. @THANELUCK i assume you use premiere? blade is faster but not by a ton. @Rudolv 1050 is fine for those games. you have to lower graphics quality a bit to get 60+ FPS but very playable. @KxngPoetic totally different machines. @KarlConrad Good luck dude!. @Robotaki 👀.

If you enjoy that rounded thin-bezeled look, you'll like the phone at $500. If the @Essential phone had launched with it's current $500 price tag and camera software, it would have crushed it.

Hey, how's it going? Dave 2D here. So, the Galaxy S9 Plus I've been using it for about two days at this point. I'm going into day three and Here's the thing Samsung phones are usually not my favorite phone usually I find some kind of thing that I dislike about it Whether it's like some kind of hardware thing or like a speaker thing I usually don't love Samsung phones enough to switch over to them But this time around really like this phone hence this really short video where I kind of explain Why so this is the Pixel 2 XL
Switching over from this to this and The big thing for me is actually not the camera or any kind of like the more heavily Advertised features its the speakers this is if I'm not mistaken the first Samsung flagship that has had stereo speakers And it makes a really big difference for me when it comes to just the general use of this phone I often play music or watch videos on my phone And it's just a really big difference to have stereo speakers the camera like this is the thing that's kind of weird they Advertise this thing really heavily They marketed this thing is like you know the world's first variable aperture camera, and it's cool like the camera is great But seriously I took a bunch of photos, and I don't really see a huge benefit of the variable aperture thing yet No, it's not with the photos that I take now the low-light performance is better on that samsung S9 It's noticeably better than the S8 and I think it's actually better than even the pixel 2xl for low-light photos It's going to use the F1.5 to let the most light in the low-light images are very clean on the S 9 slightly cleaner than the pixel 2XL But the difference feels pretty minor when you compare to the iphone 10 though the difference is more substantial The slo-mo stuff is kind of neat But it's not easy to time properly the slow motion recording is activated by motion not through user input So it's not as easy as you might think the AR emoji stuff is just straight-up junk to me, but hey That's just me now. It's a great camera, but the camera isn't what's making me switch to the S 9 It really is the speakers for Samsung to finally put stereo speakers on their flagship device just completes this phone for me I also love the design. I forget how good the Samsung phones feel? I think that's something that we all kind of take for granted the design of this phone like we've seen it so often the S8 and the S8 plus we're so common because there are such good phones if you look at this thing objectively And just kind of step back and think about what this phone is it is a beautiful phone and this year I feel like the curvature on the glass is just a little bit less pronounced like it's just a little bit easier to Hold it feels more comfortable in my hand than the s8 and the S8 plus did. I also miss the wireless charging It's like a bonus feature that comes with any of the Samsung flagships and the pixel 2 XL didn't have it The glass back on the s9 has the usual grimy fingerprint issues, but I put a skin on it It's an easy fix, and it makes it look good the processor like the new Snapdragon 845 It's fast, but it's again Not the thing that makes me switch to it and also the screen when you switch over to this thing from anything That's like not a Samsung display. You kind of forget How good these ones are. It's a really good screen It supposed to be brighter in today's like I've compared them side by side between the S8 and the S9 it is brighter But I wouldn't base your decision on that because it's not that much brighter than the S8 or the S8 plus screen now I will say this if you've disliked Samsung phones in the past for whatever reason like if you don't like Bixby or if you don't Like the Samsung experience UI and those things are deal-breakers for you, then you probably won't like this phone again Because it's not like a major revamp It's still a Samsung phone through and through it's just that it feel like Lee perfected the Samsung experience It's like It really is in my opinion the best Samsung phone that you could possibly make with our current technology Like what would you do to this thing to make it any better? It really is a kick-ass phone OK  Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it. See you guys next time   
Hey, how's it going Dave2D here, and this is the 34UC89G from LG It's their new Widescreen gaming display, and it's awesome I got to thank LG for sending this  
  thing out for me to check out and for sponsoring this video because they're actually running a contest for you guys to win one you can win one of these displays or the Grand Prize is a $10,000 gaming setup. It's pretty crazy. I'll link all that stuff below but first let's check out This display 34 inches IPs panel with good color Gamut And it's slightly curved so you can get that visual wraparound when you're playing games But most importantly this thing runs at 144 Hertz and has NVIDIA G-SYNC the resolution is 2560 by 1080 It's not particularly high-res But if your main goal is to play games well this resolution is perfect you can get high resolution screens obviously But unless you have insanely good hardware You're going to get a better viewing experience and gaming experience on this thing where you don't ever have to scale 1440p and 4K gaming sounds great But when you're actually playing running around trying to kill players before they kill you High resolution doesn't matter very much the big thing is frame rate the difference from being able to see 144 Hertz versus a regular 60 Hertz panel is massive so if you have good hardware And you can get good frame rates in games this display is awesome for it, and if you're running a high-end laptop But it has a 60 hertz screen docking it to this thing is really nice it also has NVIDIA G-SYNC So if you have an NVIDIA card it will minimize any kind of visual Artifacts or tearing that you would see in games stuff Just looks super buttery smooth on this thing now higher refresh rates are amazing But it's not something you can experience from watching a video because my videos are being displayed in 24 frames per second But if you can see these higher frame rates in person it looks really nice, and you'll notice the difference right away I also want to talk about the widescreen element so the fact that it's a 21 by 9 aspect ratio for Some games the widescreen thing just makes the game look lot better and the curvature gives a very immersive experience for those games It's a visual treat right. It's nice to have something wide but it doesn't give you a competitive advantage Just because you have a wider screen But there are games like rainbow six siege where having a wide screen like this does give you an actual advantage A very perceptible advantage when you're in game with the same Fov You're actually seeing more and I've noticed that most pro rainbows players are using wide screens because of that advantage You're literally seeing more than players that aren't using wide screen displays Their hardware on this thing is nice. It seems really well built. The ports on the back are easy to access You don't have to look from underneath or anything and the menu is also super intuitive you get a bunch of game modes to choose from you can overclock the refresh rates to 166Hz instead of the stock 144 And there's even a crosshair menu to put some sights into games that don't have sights And I don't know how I feel about that because that's a pretty distinct advantage for people that have this monitor but that's what makes it an awesome gaming monitor ok LG 34UC89G starts at $1000 and if you're interested in winning one for yourself LG is running a contest. It's the 2017 Ultra Wide festival called the dream Quest and I've linked all the details down in the description below Basically you make a short video clip 144 seconds or less and you talk about why you want to win the display and the prizes for the class get better and better? Until the last quest has an amazing grand prize of a $10,000 gaming setup It's going to be nuts and if you don't want to submit a video entry you can also win these displays by Participating in like the voting and stuff like that I'll link again full details in the description Ok hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time 
Hey! How's it going Dave2D here. And this is a comparison between the $1000 gaming laptops in mid-2017. Now, choosing one of these things is not super easy, you have to make compromises, of some sort. You're not going to have like an 800$ laptop, that's super thin, with the 12 hour battery life and like amazing performance. It's just not going to happen. You have to figure out what you find most important in your decision. And also what you don't care about as much and then make a purchase decision based off of that. Ok, in no particular order we have the Asus GL 553. This is one of very few laptops with the black and orange color scheme. It has an RGB keyboard and it has a metal top surface. We have the Dell Inspiron 7567, it's been redesigned for 2017, comes in red or gray and it feels very solid. 
This thing is dense. Next is the 2017 HP Omen. I haven't done a video on this refreshed version, it's so similar to the 2016 model and it's also very similar to the HP Pavillion this year. Then we have the MSI GE62. This is one of the very first Pascal based laptops on the market. It also has a metal top lid with that MSI dragon logo. Next up is the VX-15 from Acer. This has a more traditional gaming laptop aesthetic. I don't love the color but I do like the design language that they're going for. We also have the SABRE 15 from Gigabyte. This is their least expensive gaming laptop and there's no red color accents at all. It's also based off of a Clevo barebone's laptop. And then lastly we have the Lenovo Y520. Not too much red on this one. The exterior is all black and it's kind of low-key but the inside has red accents. And the way that I do my comparison videos, if you haven't seen them before, I kind of go through several categories and then choose a winner in that category based on these laptops. Alright, let's do this. Alright, the first thing is build quality and at this price point you're not going to get top tier build quality. I'd much rather have a well engineered plastic chassis then a poorly made metal one. My top pick is the Dell 7567, this thing's built like a tank. The chassis is rock-solid. It's actually weird to have toughest thing feels for this price point. The ASUS GL 553 I'd say comes in second place. It's got an aluminum top panel, plastic bottom, but well built. The Lenovo Y520 and the ACER VX15 are also really good choices, both of those are built well. Ok, the next thing i want to talk about is screen quality. The thing I need to mention though is that this laptop, the Dell 7567, this originally launched with a TN panel. It was pretty bad, and Dell realized that they made a huge mistake and they now actually ship with IPS panels. So I mean it's still not the best of the bunch but it's significantly better than what they used to have. The winner here is the MSI GE62. Close runner-up would be the GL 553. They're more expensive, so you're paying a bit of a premium to get a better screen. But if you're looking for something that's brighter or more color accurate in that 1000 $ price range, these are my top two picks. The rest of them are actually pretty similar. I'd say that the Dell with its new IPS panel comes out a bit ahead for color accuracy, but they're noticeably not as good as the two leaders. The HP Omen and the Dell 7567 both have 4k panel options. The 4k Omen panel looks pretty good. It is a PenTile display. The 4k Dell panel is better. Also if you want, you can upgrade all of these panels, not just the ones on the table, but the ones that are off frame right now, but you can take all the panels out if you want and then purchase them on eBay and replace them. Now, it's not an easy process but it can be done. So if you're stuck with a laptop that doesn't have the best screen, you can pick up some really bright and really color accurate panels on eBay and do it yourself. Ok, so here's a chart of what ports and drives these devices have. At this price point, none of them have Thunderbolt 3 support. They're all upgradable like you can open them up and add memory and storage drives. But the one that's easiest to upgrade is the Dell 7567. There's a single screw to get inside and it just straight up feels like it was built for the user to open it up. The Saber 15 or the Clevo has the most number of ports, but some of those are located on the bottom right, so it can get a little cluttered. Also the Asus and the MSI have optical drives, if you need them. Now in general all of these have good connectivity and good port selection, but I've had to choose a winner it would be the MSI GE62. In terms of the keyboard, all of them have a decent keyboard. None of them are bad per se. My favourite keyboard would probably be the MSI. It's a solid keyboard with zoned RGB backlighting. And then second place I'd say would go to the Lenovo Y520. Trackpads are a different story. Both of those laptops I just mentioned with good keyboards have not-so-good trackpads. My favorite trackpad is the Dell 7567: plastic surface, windows precision drivers, good button mechanism. I like this one. To be honest I don't feel like any of the other ones are as good. Maybe the tracking on the Sabre 15 is similar, but I much prefer to click on the Dell over the dedicated buttons on the Sabre. Ok, so performance is dependent on two things. First are the components, so the faster components you have the better performance and then the second thing is how well those components are cooled. So if you don't cool them properly, they just won't run as well. You need to have a mixture of the two to have like the "best performance". So, all of these laptops come in, well most of them, come in two configurations in i5 and i7. If you're just playing games the i5 is perfectly fine, but if you also edit videos I would totally upgrade to an i7. So, all of these laptops are running a KabyLake i7 and the best thermal performance goes to the Dell 7567. I have a tough time getting this thing to throttle. It's cooled really well. I kind of ranked them in order from best to worst in terms of how hot the CPU gets when it's running the 3DMark stress test and then here's some scores from Fire Strike. Now, keep in mind that these temperatures are from a benchmark, right? Regular gaming or video editing won't push the laptop as hard but this gives us a rough idea. While we're here, I might as well talk about fan noise and these are all running Kaby Lake processors so for the most part they're pretty efficient. The fans don't always need to run when the laptops are idling. These are the measurements I took and it's a pretty close battle for first place. I think it's a toss-up between the Dell and HP Omen. In terms of speakers, the two leaders are the Lenovo and the Dell. The Dell sounds better, it has a sub so if you're watching videos or playing games you can hear the lower frequencies better. It's not super heavy bass but it is there. The Lenovo has a better location for the speakers. It's up on top so it projects upward and to the sides, so the stereo effect is very pronounced. If you want positional audio for games, and you don't want headphones or you can't use headphones, these are very usable. The ASUS also has nice speakers as well. Ok, let's talk battery life. Here's a chart and the leader here is the Dell. It's a big battery, it's significantly bigger than some of the other models here. Now all of these are measured on a 1080p screen. If you upgrade to a 4k panel the battery life will be lower. And in case you're wondering like how I run my battery tests, I set my laptops to 250 nits, if the laptop can even get to that brightness, but I set it to 250 and I run the script that does web browsing and text input in this loop. Ok, the last category is value and I think the winner for just sheer value is the Lenovo Y520. For 850 bucks you're able to get a 1050Ti, which is a really powerful chip for games and you're still getting your 2-year Lenovo warranty and stuff. The Dell and the Acer are also really good but every laptop here has some strengths and weaknesses, so you can't really go wrong choosing any of them. If you're wondering what my top choices amongst these, it's the Dell 7567 and like I mentioned everyone choice is a little bit different. My preference is for a bigger battery and really good build quality and they kind of nailed that. This only applies though for the new IPS panel. If they didn't have that new panel I would have gone for the Acer VX-15. Now, if you're one of those people that have the TN panel, it's not that big of a deal, I mean it is not as good as this new IPS panel, but you always have the option of going to ebay and doing that whole swap thing that I mentioned earlier. It's really not that expensive and it's not too difficult on this particular model and you can get some really good panels for like a hundred bucks. Now, the other thing I want to mention. 3 laptops that I do not recommend purchasing: first is the Samsung Odyssey, I have a review unit, I will not be doing a review on it. It's $1,500. It's way too expensive for what that product is. I think it's overpriced. I think it's - I mean - it's a fine laptop it was $1000 not 1500. The other thing is that this laptop here the MSI GE62. It has a younger sibling called the GL62 and you might be tempted to purchase the GL, because it's cheaper than this one, but the fans on that thing are super loud, the screen is significantly worse. Save up for the GE62 if you want the MSI. The other thing is do not purchase a laptop with a GTX 960M right now unless it's like a huge discount because the performance difference between the 1050 to 1050Ti and a 960 is way too big to ignore. You do not want to purchase a 960M just to save a couple bucks. You will get longer like lifespan with this laptop if you pick up a 1050. It will last you longer in terms of like gaming years. So if you can save up for 1050 or 1050 TI. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it. I'll see you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here ! Let's talk about ultrabooks those thin and light laptops that are built for Productivity, and there's a lot of really good options to choose from in early 2018 We're looking at like XPS 13 razor blade stealth HP Envy the x1 from Lenovo all of them with 8th gen CPUs great devices but they're all Light but not super light and these two are the superlight Laptops that I would recommend for most people. So, these are the LG Gram devices the 13 inch and the 15 inch and what make some special is how incredibly light they are So, this thing comes in at 2 pounds most of the devices that I mentioned earlier are pushing three pounds, Maybe them a little bit more than that This is 2 pounds, and I mean when you're looking for a portable device a one pound reduction in weight is massive and these things are just so comfortable to hold so when you make something this thin in this light you're gonna have some compromises you can't have something of this weight and expect to be able to treat it poorly It is built well much better built than the original 14-inch LG Gram But it's still something to take care of I would get a sleeve or something to protect it, the magnesium alloy is strong but it can't beat physics. All right. Let's talk about the things that I do like about it first the screen This is a 1080p touchscreen, it needs a little bit of calibration to be accurate, but it has great color gamut And it gets reasonably bright the backlit keyboard and the trackpad are both good. Now I wouldn't consider them to be best in class or anything But I'm very happy using them. The 8th gen CPU on both these devices are nice now These are a nice step up from the previous generation when it comes to multi-core performance But to be fair the improved performance isn't something most Ultrabook users will be able to notice you do need particular apps to show that off properly It is an 8th gen CPU so you do get better battery life as well speaking of battery life these both have 60 watt hour batteries and The software in here can be set pretty aggressively so you're like sipping at the battery and you can get like 15 hours or something ridiculous, but for regular use 250 nits on the screen I'm getting around 8 and a half hours on the 13 inch version around seven and a half hours on the 15 inch version It's a little bit less because there's just a bigger screen more stuff to light up okay I want to talk about the 15 inch device for a second And I think this is a pretty unique product a lot of 15-inch laptops have 15-inch screens with 45 watt HQ processors And I get it a lot of people that want that bigger screen also want a faster processor more powerful processor But some people don't want that some people just want a bigger screen And they just don't need the extra processing power that every other company is stuffing down their throats This thing is still running a 15 watt U processor and almost everything remains the same It is a little more roomy and there's a number pad on the keyboard, but it's a thin and light 15 inch laptop Which is rare, okay? Let's talk about some things like don't love about it first and the big one for me is the webcam it's located in The hinge so when you use it it kind of looks up your nose, and then the speaker's don't sound great They're pretty mediocre and the last thing is a charging port so they include a barrel plug as the AC adapter I really wish they'd include a USB C charger because it can take it where you need to go and buy your own USB C charger Which is unfortunate so both the 13 and the 15-inch? LG gram are just great options for people looking for something really portable and just an all-around great laptop This one in particular the 13-inch one. I think is actually on sale on Amazon right now for 800 bucks Not sorry not the 8th gen one But the previous generation the seventh gen which is very similar in performance and everything else across the board. That's a steal 800 bucks I don't know if it's like a Black Friday thing or like a holiday special But that's a really good price for something that originally launched like 11-1200 bucks I'll leave a link for all this stuff below You know what there's one other thing when I talk about If you're interested in portable stuff everyone knows this mouse right the MX master series It's smaller sibling is not as well known I feel like this thing is actually a better Mouse than the big one for a lot of people one It's just a smaller fit the MX master is a really large Mouse And I think a lot of people that have seen it are intimidated by it And it's just not a great travel Mouse This thing is half the size a little bit cheaper same sensor same super long battery really like this thing This is the MX.

Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here and behind me is a very large screen from LG it's their 43UD79 and it's literally a 43 inch screen. So on paper a really large screen like this seems kind of useless, right? I'm sure there's applications for commercial or professional use, but when you think about how large our regular screens are It does seem a little bit excessive. But here's the thing this thing is $700 and when you look at any review of this thing online from Amazon B&amp;H wherever you go, people love this panel. People are replacing their thousand or $1500 screens with this thing It's like half the price So I thought I'd check it out Looking at photos or even videos of this monitor doesn't really showcase how large it is It really just does look like a normal-sized monitor. That's someone brought in to photoshop, grab the corners and just stretched it out It's a perfect scale model of a small regular monitor Now the build quality is good It's plastic but everything looks built well. There are four HDMI ports in the back, but only two of them are HDMI 2.0 And there's also only one DisplayPort There is a USB C connection so if you have a MacBook you can connect it up using one cable For both the display connection and for power. Now this isn't going to be a regular review This is more of just an experience of using this thing for a while because I only started using it for fun But I actually liked it so much This is probably gonna be my main monitor for a while Obviously its main feature is its size 43 inches is a lot of real estate Now I've connected computers to TVs before, but I've never used a monitor this big and the size is awesome You don't need to scale anything keeping Windows at 100% scale everything appears large and very sharp and working in Premiere is Unbelievable on the screen so currently I use a 30-inch ultra wide for my video editing, but this thing is better It's just more overall real estate and when I view the video in full screen I can see everything clearly The image quality is good. I measured it with a spider And I'm getting a hundred percent sRGB, and about 78% Adobe RGB The colors are accurate after calibration But you do need to calibrate it because the default white point is quite blue but once you do and you sort it out sRGB color space is great and just ideal for YouTube I tried out this monitor with the PS4 Pro And you have to tweak it a bit to get it to work you have to turn on this barrage setting called ultra HD deep color But once it's running 4k console gaming on a desk is so nice The size is awesome for immersion like I don't think it's great for competitive MLG gaming because you have to look around to see the full screen But if you're a console casual like me this thing is great The one thing I wish this monitor had was HDR support I mean 4k is nice, but 4k HDR is just that much better and with the increasing number of HDR capable games It would have been really nice the thing is if this thing supported HDR. It wouldn't be 700 bucks I think it'd be pushing like 12-1500 dollars Now the one feature that makes this monitor super special is The split screen. You can connect up to four devices and display them all at once now Here's the thing when I was setting it up I remember thinking this is kind of ridiculous like who's gonna need four screens on one display at one time right it seems really Superfluous, but once that thing's set up it is awesome So I connected my PC, a MacBook, a PlayStation 4 and a Nintendo Switch And this is just a demo right realistically I would probably only connect Maybe one console and maybe plug up a TV or something But whatever it is the possibilities are endless whether it's for work playing a ton of games multi boxing I don't know cryptomining, stock stuff whatever it is having four screens each of them being like full 21 inch images I think a lot of people are gonna find it useful now the one issue to this whole proposition is the sheer size of the monitor you need to have a large enough desk or a large enough workspace to actually sit this thing on there without it looking stupid or ridiculous because this thing is massive You can't really tell in the videos, but it's really really large So if you don't have a huge desk this might not work out for you, but if you do This is pretty cool. It also has a pair of speakers Which are way better than I thought they'd be they're clear, and they get loud. There's not much bass Which is kind of expected because there's no sub at least not a significant one But the audio quality in this thing is very good And I'm very happy editing videos or playing console games directly off those speakers And now you just don't need to have external speakers The last thing I should mention is that there's a remote which might seem a little weird because it's a monitor But once you start doing the split-screen stuff you can switch between the regular and multi-window really easily And you also get in volume control from speakers, but that's basically it. It's a pretty unique monitor I don't think it's for everyone obviously But if you're someone who can make use of its capabilities You have a lot of devices you want to connect up and view them all at once you want to be able to switch Between them really readily check this thing out. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it! Subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. So a little while ago Nvidia announced Max Q, which was the new design approach to building laptops that would keep them thin and light and quiet, and on paper it seemed almost too good to be true, because these were GTX 1080s in a laptop, that was 19 millimeters thick and that were running at 40 decibels, which is incredibly quiet. And one of the ways they achieve this, was through reduced wattage to the GPU. The more power you give to a GPU the better performance, but you hits this point of diminishing returns. And once you hit that sweet spot, the extra wattage that you feed, it doesn't get used efficiently. So, Nvidia caps the power consumption right at that point. Now you get reduced performance right? You can't tap into that last 15 percent or whatever. But you use way less energy, and you get better thermals. So, my initial reaction was: "Hey, that's kind of cool", but there were a lot of enthusiasts that were like: "Hmm, is Nvidia trying to pull a scam on us because these could just be underclocked GPUs and just relabeled as this whole Max-Q certification thing." And I understand where the concern comes from, because these are not cheap gaming laptops. These are two or three thousand dollars a pop and at that price point you want to make sure that you're doing the right thing with your money. So that's what this video explores: are these Max-Q laptops a scam? In front of me are three fairly different Max-Q laptops: the ASUS Zephyrus, the AORUS X5 MD and an Alienware 15 Max Q and these all have GTX 1080s inside them and they're all Max Q design laptops. The Aorus X5 MD is running some very early software but... whatever. So, all three of these are very strong performers, in Fire Strike they score less than a regular laptop with a GTX 1080, but better than a laptop with a regular GTX 1070 and the variants you see between these three Max Q laptops is mostly a difference in just the clock speeds of the GPUs. Okay, when you look at this graph, you might notice how close these three Max Q laptops are to the GTX 1070 laptop. We're talking like a seven to ten percent difference. And some GTX 1070 laptops can be overclocked and those will actually outperform these. Alienware put up a video, showcasing how their GTX 1070 laptop could be overclocked and could actually outperform at a cheaper price their GTX 1080 Max Q laptop. And so the question pops up: "Why is Nvidia pushing these Max Q laptops when you can get a GTX 1070 that has very similar performance or even better performance if you overclock it?" And the problem is actually that some companies don't take full advantage of the whole MaxQ design approach So, if you look at Alienware, they put a lot of effort into their designs and they're made really well. They bring out new laptop designs every three or four years. They're not going to design a whole new chassis just for some Max-Q stuff. On the other hand a company like Asus, they put out new laptop and PC designs every year, so for them, they can put out a brand new ultra thin Max Q laptop right away. They can take full advantage of the Max-Q design, because that's just how the company rolls. So, back to the Alienware 15, they're running their GPU the Max-Q GTX 1080 at 110 watts, which is the highest level you can run it at for a Max Q design laptop. And they're able to push their GPU hard like this, because this chassis was designed to handle an overclocked GTX 1070. It's got a ton of thermal headroom. So, is this laptop still good? I mean yeah, it's designed well, it's built well, and it's very powerful, but it's not impressive to me. This is the same chassis as was in their regular non Max-Q laptop and honestly I love Alienware, I think they make some of the best laptops in the market. But this feels like a me-too product, like they looked at everyone else making Max-Q laptops, and they thought: "Hey, we should make one, too!", but they just didn't put it into a new chassis. So you're stuck with this, so when people look at this product, Max Q does not look like a compelling thing. It's just... why would you buy this gimped GTX 1080 version when you can buy the cheaper GTX 1070 version that performs just as well if not better. And then you take a look at the opposite end of the spectrum, the Asus Zephyrus, this thing was built specifically for Max Q design. It's not as durable as an Alienware laptop, but it's still really well-made. It's thin, it's light and the fans are incredibly quiet. It's not a traditional look, the keyboard has shifted down, the trackpad is on the right and things are a little weird when you first use it, but to me this is impressive. This is a thin and powerful laptop that is super quiet. And I kind of want to touch on the whole thing about fan noise. Decibels are a logarithmic unit, right? So, an increase in 10 decibels is double the perceived volume, so if you're starting at 40 decibels, if you hit 50 decibels that's double the volume and then if you hit 60 decibels, that's double the volume again. Now, gaming laptops can easily hit 50 decibels on load. If you have a GTX 1070 or 1080 in there they can sometimes hit 60 decibels. This thing has a Max Q 1080 in there and hits 39 decibels when you're playing games, so yeah, you can get a 1070 laptop that has very similar performance to this. But it's going to be so much louder. I also want to talk about this thing: the Aorus X5 MD. They didn't change the chassis, it's their regular X5 chassis, not super thin, but to me, Max Q is perfect for this laptop. It still has great performance with the GTX 1080 and the Max Q design keeps it quiet, stays really close to 40 decibels when it's gaming and has a ton of expandability: there's 4 drives in there. Max Q design allowed this really great laptop to get even better. Three months ago the thinnest laptop with a GTX 1080 was this thing, the Razer Blade Pro. And everybody downclock their GPU a little bit just to kind of keep the thermals in check. It's a very good performing laptop, but it's super loud, 60 decibels when it's under load. Now, there's nothing wrong with this device, I mean, it's a very powerful machine. But if all you think they're doing is downclocking their GPUs to kind of make Max Q laptops. That's not the case. There's just so much more going on, like the hardware, the software. It's all combining together to be able to make something this thin, this light and this quiet. So in conclusion: no, I don't think Max Q is a scam. It's not a new GPU and like the technology isn't like the super crazy. But they're combining something that's in the software component and a hardware component to make something that, you know, is really impressive, as long as you're doing it right. Now, the other thing to keep in mind is Nvidia isn't forcing you to buy these Max-Q things, the regular GTX laptop still exists, if you want to buy those things, they have a little more power and a little more fan noise. You're more than welcome to. You don't have to buy these, but for people that want to spend a little more money, to get something that's like a little more elegant, you have that option as well. 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here, and this is a video on some inexpensive laptops for students And I know you can get some very cheap laptops out there for like 200 bucks that have Windows 10 on them but those laptops I feel like they wouldn't last for regular use for what a student does day in day out putting it out of your bag Using it everyday. Those are not good laptops I feel for students so what I have in front of me are three very well-built Well priced laptops that all do different things these aren't competitors. There's not going to be a comparison of them It's just three individual laptops and depending on what you do as a student or what you want to do with your laptop You might be interested in one of these and I also have a couple other side picks as well But the three main ones are: the asus ux305 The acer aspire 5 And the lenovo 320s. So let's start off with the Acer first I've done a full review of this thing before this is a great device for students who want to get a laptop for school But also want to do some light gaming basically It's an inexpensive regular looking 15-inch laptop that can handle current gaming titles Reasonably well because of the video card. It has an MX 150 from Nvidia Which is kind of like the GT 1030 and most current titles are very playable on this machine. If you want a more detailed review I'll link my video below. The configuration with the MX 150 cost $600 and it's a great laptop for the money. Now there were two things like might be an issue for students First is the battery life I'm only getting around five hours of battery life for this so if you want to bring it to school and you have a full Day of class you're gonna have to bring your charger with you. The second thing is that it's not super thin or light It's not like a really thick gaming laptop, but it has some size to it. Now if you are looking for something That's a little thinner and lighter that is still a good price point It's this thing Lenovo 320 s so this thing starts at I think $550 for the base model, it's a full aluminum build but the chassis has some flex to it the bottom panel is easy to open up for upgrading the RAM and storage the Screen is a little dim and the base model isn't a 1080p screen It's not bad though videos and pictures still look really sharp at normal viewing distances the keyboard is comfortable to use but The keystrokes are little softer than I'd like and there's no backlighting. The trackpad uses Windows precision drivers Which are really and the battery life is surprisingly good as well , I'm getting around seven hours But this thing comes in couple configurations starts at around $500 - $550 depending on sales, but great device for students Okay, next up we have the Asus UX330 Which is the successor to the UX306 which I've reviewed in the past and this thing is a surprisingly good laptop for the money. Now, it's not super cheap It's 700 bucks. This thing has great build quality and a pretty simple design It has two regular USB ports, a USB C and a micro HDMI. It has a good screen 1080p matte finish And it gets pretty bright. Also has a nice backlit keyboard and windows precision trackpad. Tracking is really good on the surface It's just a nice texture, but the button clicks are a little shallow. They don't feel bad though, Just really short travel. The speakers on this thing are really good. They're located on the bottom, and I mean for this price It's kind of crazy How good these speakers sound. They have Harman Kardon branding, but usually having branding like this for a laptop speaker doesn't mean anything They usually sound very average, but these actually sound good It still doesn't have strong bass, but it's a very clean, audio, and you'll be happy with these speakers It is a 13 inch screen. It's a little bit smaller than the other two laptops I've mentioned so far So depending what you do or what you want to do with your laptop this might be too small But if you're looking for a 13 inch device you're on the money The one thing I don't like about this device is actually the fan noise It comes on way more often than you'd like it to and when it does It's pretty loud and actually comes on when you're doing very un-intensive stuff like watching a YouTube video or browsing the web It's kind of weird because this is something that software should be able to fix But it's been out for several months and there hasn't been a change, so we'll see. Now for the price for $700 It's not something that is for someone looking for the cheapest laptop right, there are going to be cheaper laptops on this But if you're in the market for some of that's kind of higher-end like an XPS 13 or an HP Envy Those are like 900 bucks or more. This thing is a lot less But still a really good laptop, now the other thing I want to mention This is not part of the three that I was originally going to talk about is kind of like an off pick so this is the Dell Inspiron 13 7000 now this is a two in one device. I'm not a big fan of two in one devices. I find that they're a little bit kind of cumbersome for everyday use as a student But I know that a lot of my audience are crazy about two in one devices just because they're so versatile this one's $650 and I think it's the best foldable two in one device at this price point now There's a lot of inexpensive two in one devices and a lot of them suck. Just they're not good as laptops They're even worse as tablets But this one is very usable in both forms the keyboard in particular is surprisingly good for the price It feels like honestly it feels like they're XPS keyboard. It's really good trackpad is good It's a Windows precision driver the whole thing has excellent build quality lots of metal, impressive speakers for the price It's a great two and one the two things that I don't love about it Though are the screen and the battery life The screen feels a little dim and I really wish it was brighter because this is such a good device for media consumption But because of the dimmer screen you can't use it outdoors readily, and the battery life could be better I'm only getting about five hours of life on this thing, but for a cheap But well built two and one, this is my top pick so the last thing I want to talk about are some devices that are well. They're not really on the table here It's kind of like a theoretical device so right now the eighth generation CPUs from Intel have been launched Intel's coffee Lake and those 8th gen CPUs are kind of trickling down into all these devices and everything Is getting refreshed so the seventh generation KB Lake CPUs those prices are coming down a little bit? But there are some sixth generation skylake CPU laptops that are significantly cheaper and they're still available on Amazon and some of those devices are barely a year old so they're actually quite new still it's just a Matter of perception of whether or not you want the brand-new one that's coming out or one That's a year and a few months old ok I'll link all this stuff below And I'll link some Sixth generation skylake CPU laptops down below as well as some of those have amazing pricing like this 510 s that I have over here But yeah, hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs. If you liked it subs if you loved it. See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here So I've been using the Razer Phone for a couple of weeks at this point and I wanted to share my experiences of using this phone with you guys so a lot of people are interested in this phone because It's such a different looking phone from a lot of other Android offerings especially with that 120 Hertz screen But I feel like there's so much more to this phone that is actually really good for a lot of people not just Gamers or whatever you might think that the Razer brand is catering to so the first thing I want to talk about is build quality this thing is built like a tank. It's aluminum, It's not like special materials or anything But the design of it is just so boxy and so just industrial feeling and industrial looking It's a really solid phone if I had to drop phones thousands of times. It would be this one I feel like this is the one that's gonna last the longest The button placement takes a while to get used to, the power switch is good But the volume rockers are just, I don't know they're a little bit lower than I'm used to so even after using this thing for A couple of weeks, I'm still not used to their lowers position. I wish it was higher up I also don't like that this thing doesn't have a headphone jack now a lot of phones don't have headphone jacks in twenty-seventeen But this one in particular. I feel like it really should have had one. It's a gamer oriented phone I mean it can be for gamers, but even for regular people because this thing is so good for media consumption I feel like a lot of people could have really benefited from a headphone jack and It doesn't have one which is unfortunate. Okay, Let's talk about the screen. It's probably its most flagship feature It's the thing that they're marketing the most heavily It's a really nice looking screen 120 Hertz very fluid very color accurate my biggest complaint about it Though is the brightness. It's not super dim or anything like that don't get me wrong I think it measures at around 300 nits but because of how bright other smart phones can get at this $700 price point it just feels like it's dimmer than it could or should be now the screen is nice for games But I don't know if it makes me a better gamer so most of the games that I play in mobile are just pretty relaxed And chill games something like Altos landing looks really nice on the screen 120 Hertz But there's a lot of games that are like the competitive games that still don't run at 120 Hertz on the screen even if you Lower the resolution So it depends on the games you want to play? But keep in mind that that list of games that supports high frame is growing every day Now using the screen outside of gaming is also really nice Just browsing the web anything that has a UI just looks super smooth Just browsing Reddit, imgur, flicking and swiping around on this screen feels so smooth and after using this one for a couple of weeks Switching back to a regular phone feels so choppy the speakers are in a league of their own. They sound amazing It's not the volume and the bass I mean it does get loud and the bass is present But it's just the clarity if he sounds so clear when you're playing games listening to music just anything that has sound Sounds abnormally clean coming out of these speakers. It's weird hearing this kind of audio from a smartphone It is unfortunately one of those things that you have to experience in real life and same thing with the screen you can't like this video is not going to do is justice the screen and the speakers are something you have to experience in real life now if there's One complaint I had about the speakers It's that when you lower the volume the bass and the mids Disappear way quicker than the higher frequencies it had to install some EQ software Just to make it sound the way I want but really good speakers overall. The camera is disappointing There's no way to spin it It's not a good camera the default software the listen comes with takes particularly bad photos like the low-light photos are really grainy But if you download the Google camera app like the one that comes stock on pixel devices the image quality looks so much better But here's the thing people shouldn't have to do that I feel like a lot of people don't even know how to do that So it's unfortunate that this camera Delivers the photos that it does coming out of the box now a lot of reviews are going to focus on this I think a lot of people are going to tunnel vision on The whole bad camera thing because it's a really easily compared thing or it's a very objective metric that differentiates phones But does it really matter to you I mean if you're someone who spends a lot of time on Instagram and you have to post these like Curated photo collections, then yeah, don't get this camera Don't get this phone, but if you just use your phone for the average memory Just take a picture here their camera image quality is important But it's not the most important thing in the world so if the other things in this phone are kind of Good for you, then. I'd still keep this thing on the short list of options looking at performance Snapdragon 835, eight gigs of ram, and I gotta be honest I don't feel like this is any different from any other Snapdragon 835 phone, which is the majority of flagship phones? It's fast, but it's not Blazing fast the iPhone X is still faster in benchmarks But this thing feels really fluid and because it's running a pretty much stock version of Android 7.1.1. It's gonna stay fast for a long time, okay last thing battery life this thing has a four thousand milliamp hour battery and I I Thought or I kind of hoped it would last a really long time like a two day battery because it's relatively big But that's not the case I'm getting around six hours of screen on time It's basically a day and a half battery now. It does support quick charge four plus. Which is really fast It's as fast. If not faster than dash-charge from one plus I'm getting like sixty-five to seventy percent of battery off of a 30 minute charge It's really impressive now overall Great phone for the right person so if you're someone that again if you're if you're really big on photography Don't get this thing if you just use your phone like I feel like most people do for media consumption and stuff like that this Thing is awesome like do you know how much better browsing reddit is at 120 frames per second than a 60 frames per second screen? There's no comparison It's just better to look at better sounding than most phones out there for media consumption So if that's your jam check this phone out I think you guys will like it, but if you're not interested in that stuff if you're like mister no business and mister... Photographer Not the phone for you. Okay, Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs up if you liked it, sub if you loved it! See you guys next time 
[Lew] Face towards the product eyes, towards the lens. Okay, what do you do mouth closed yeah? How do you do it, how do you express shock without the mouth being closed? I feel like I'm constipated This is harder than it looks Okay, I'm just gonna do it because that's what we do here Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. And I normally don't unbox things, but I'm in environments where things are unboxed Unboxy place okay iPhone 10 I did not want to do  a video in these things because I want to experience these products like a consumer It's some serious stuff But here I am unboxing these things for the world's worst iPhone 10 unboxing. Okay. I'm just gonna crack these open and See what is up, so I actually haven't seen a single video on these things sorry Jon, sorry Lou but I Wanted to see right. I'm excited about these phones These are one of the first proper products have been like amped about since I started doing YouTube. That's the thing as a youtuber You get a lot of stuff and it's cool to get cool things But you lose that that connection with a new product the new toy that comes in you just you lose that That joy that comes with it, and I wanted to feel it again with the item content, so here. We are Space Gray black whatever they call it and white or silver now the phone I'm using right now is the essential phone and I'm a huge soccer for this phone because of the screen the Somewhat bezel was screen and Really Yeah, but there's gotta be phones that are like like those like those like Asian was like dude II know What's this one iPhone 10 Cool So how good is that unboxing you guys want to see more of this on my channel? He subscribed should I just should I just keep going going? Yeah, but come on power chapter sit down Tell me how is it done as a nun as a professional? Versus unboxer first of all first of all you need to take it down a notch because your Husband's feet I mean you're scaring people in this video and audiences as well. They're very It's upsetting your tone is upsetting. Okay. It's stirring up all kinds of strange feelings for me in various body parts How are they still using lightning cable? So you didn't respond to me there well Are you team zero? Because I mean I'm in odd this place, this is like the temple where products getting Wow Okay, which one do you like that bulb mom I? don't know I've never been a big like white or light phone kind of guy I Am a white phone kind of guy. Yeah, I Especially in this one. We're like the bezel on the front is black. It's kind of strange, but then again It would look terrible if it was white The screen is not as like white as I was expecting the color temperature in is that me is it the whites I don't know man, I saw people on Twitter saying that the the eight displays a little nicer than this one I Mean those are just people and really those are just people on Twitter at all I remembered like the the first impressions people are saying It was supposed to be like this is what you buy this for these are nice boxes though You're all that the boxes. I know well like I'm just saying let's see how they put the little silver edge in there There's some attention. Okay. I've decided The color I'm going with is the black it's this silver man. The silver looks cheap this looks like Yeah, it looks like the dummy ones yeah It does which I mean that makes sense Okay, so what's gonna happen you're gonna. This is your new phone. You're putting your SIM card is on whole thing for you absolutely alright Do we just roll, let's make this a ten minute one second video Just you guys can watch me put my SIM card as rude. Call my wife. That's rude Look at this. What did I say? world's worst wife want an unboxing I Didn't want to do this man, but I'm here. Oh, but I'm here fired up Just practice be can be you can be a jack Kind of heavy what you Take this thing was shot on iphone, but though it really wasn't Levels here are deep He's never been so well it look at them yeah, man, I get lit with natural lights in my set this is like I Know my every video looks different every video I know that's why I'm here. I ran it a light to make my video no Dude let's go swipe to open I Told you it's the world's worst iPhone 10 in boxing and anyone who makes it to the end Focus Yeah But you can't lean in that much though yeah, you get used to it Eventually you're just gonna be like yeah You get used to how close so little leg like this is going through so much because Wireless too seriously yep Wow, there's a wireless receiver over there select your country Canada, but see you can't do any of that you're doing I Thought you're gonna put your sim in use I did I'm also I didn't realize you could you selling that we're good? I heard people were having activation issues the servers were overrun All right, I mean, it's later now. I'm sure you be fine How does my face look on the iPhone 10 beautiful it's always beautiful me yeah boy like 10 out of 10 oh Dude I mean face it Oh FaceTime Ivy Go continue it How to set up face ID so do I show this to the thing you got this I got you The one on the table moves your head slowly Just flip the label no I feel like I just because you could you have the sponsorship you have to it's part of the Okay, like you fulfill this. Oh, I thought it. I thought it said it was complete at duty Huh and did it fail are we gonna do twice no for the sponsorship know What create a passive you're gonna get flagged not suitable really Look at that possible use anyways There's so many steps Business riveting you're at eight minutes two more to go Dude it's gonna get like three views who cares god this this video wasn't even it wasn't even supposed to exist So the people that are scrubbing through are so confused oh I have dual like authentication This is the real process of a phone setup right all that you Almost dropped it there all that stuff you see with people just zipping through That guy just do you monetize my video Thanks, dude instead of three cents. I don't think maybe they heard that oh really I need I need a I need a laptop, too Let's just keep it going It's just rolling dude You gotta you gotta kick the cone, right Okay, I got you Okay Authentication Was it this one Why are they both showing? Dude they both reset what happened I know I did it really oh Dude it's this one there's a lock symbol on hello swipe up to open, okay, we're good Why I Don't Watch me do it. I'm telling you three views. It's not about the views I just wanted to experience the phone the way the normal people experience it 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. So this is a video on the new iMac Pro and this is going to be a good two-part video. I'm going to do a comparative performance review between the iMac Pro and 3 other powerful desktops that I've been using over the past a little bit. And then, for the second part of this video, I want to talk about the idea of this product as a whole.
So for the comparison, we have 4 desktops. So first is this iMac Pro. It's the 10-core model, 64 gigs of RAM with the Vega 64 GPU. And then we have a Threadripper,
Alienware Area-51. So this thing has 16 cores, 64 gigs of RAM, and a pair of GTX 1080 Ti's and SLI. And then we have a Ryzen 1700x build. This is an 8-core CPU, 64 gigs of RAM, a single GTX 1080, and then lastly, we have the 10-core "trash can" Mac Pro.
Now, this thing is a little bit dated as 4 years old at this point but before the iMac Pro came out recently, this thing was literally the most powerful Apple computer that you could get for
multi-core applications. Performance on the 10-core iMac Pro is very good. Like if you ignore the price of this thing,
and you only look at the performance benchmarks, you can see that
it's better than the 8-core Ryzen by quite a bit, and it's a noticeable step-up from the 2013 Mac Pro. But as expected, it's not as good
as the 16-core Threadripper. So these benchmarks obviously don't
assure us everything, because this thing's running a Xeon processor with ECC memory, but it does give you a general idea of how they perform relative to each other. Now, I'm an Adobe user, particularly Adobe Premiere, so I'm going to focus my performance review of these devices, for Premiere.
So these are the render times for my workflow, which is 5K footage from a SCARLET-W camera, and we're seeing the same kind of trend here.
Performance on the 10-core, iMac Pro is very good. Not as fast as the Alienware Threadripper system, but it's still very impressive.
The thermal performance is also really good, because cooling a 10-core CPU in a form factor like this is not easy, and then doing it quietly is even more difficult. And we're looking at very comfortable temperatures on idle or load.
Fan noise is also surprisingly quiet. It doesn't come on very often, but when it does, it's very tolerable. So yeah, there's a lot of good things about the iMac Pro. I mean, it looks really good. The space gray is awesome. Space gray keyboard is really cool, and the black Lightning cable, which for some people is really important. The 5K screen looks amazing with an improved webcam. And the I/O is pretty good as well, you're getting way more ports than the average Apple computer.
And as you saw earlier, the thermal management is quite good,
but the thing that makes this computer special to me, is the form factor. They're able to sake so much great hardware into a relatively small all-in-one package.
And it's a very nice-looking package, in my opinion. But the reason why I made this video and the thing that, kind of, bugs me up this product is the price tag. So this is an Apple product. Apple products tend to be a little bit more expensive, and it's a professional Apple product, so you're going to pay a little bit more over premium than normal. But, you often see this argument being thrown around about how this thing is "not overpriced", because if you try to build this thing from scratch, like through your own parts, the price tag would be not too different from what Apple charges.
But I don't entirely agree with them, because I think most people, they're building systems with Xeon processors and ECC memory wouldn't be pairing it up with a 5K screen.
So Xeon processors are used for applications where it's just constant, heavy use of the CPU. So if you're a stock trader, or, just doing any kind of application where you're doing complex calculations all day, every day. You're running scenarios of something like that Xeon makes sense. If your renders take, like, 18 hours to run, then yeah. Xeon makes sense. And same with the RAM if your applications require huge amounts of data to be transferred around in memory, and you just cannot have any room for error, then sure, ECC RAM is great for you.
For most people, for most professionals, they just, they don't want this stuff. They want really powerful computers and in 2018, we have the ability to buy really powerful computers that are not Xeon processors and do not require ECC memory. And, it bugs me that Apple is putting this type of equipment as the only option for those professionals. So, most people, most professionals, they want high core count.
They want, like eight, ten, maybe twelve cores, and for Windows users, there's plenty of inexpensive options right now. We can get, like Ryzen CPUs, i7, i9, even Threadripper's cheaper than this stuff. With Xeon, you're paying a huge premium for the processor with the architecture, and you're forced to buy, just expensive components across the board to make that stuff work. And with Apple, you're locked into that ecosystem just because to get high core count. So for certain content creators that work with Apple applications, this, kind of, make sense because it's really your only option, but for people that work with applications that have multi-platform abilities, like you can do it in Windows or you can do it on Apple, like the Adobe application, this product is, just, it feels so overpriced. I really enjoy the OS X or macOS (they call it that one). I enjoy macOS, but this product just feels way too expensive to justify its purchase. At least for someone like me, like uh, kind of mid-tier content creator. So, that's what we have, a very overpriced, I'm going to use that term, overpriced product from Apple this year, that fits the needs for very few number of people but I think for most people, it should be a pass.
Okay, hope you guys enjoy this video. Thumbs if you've liked it, subs if you've loved it.
See you guys, next time. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave 2D here, and this is the Lenovo Y720. So the review for this thing is long overdue They actually showcased this laptop at CES of 2017, so that's like eight months ago And I finally was able to get my review unit in last week, and I've been playing with it for a while This thing is One of the cheapest laptops you can get with a GTX 1060 so this thing comes in at just over a thousand dollars I think like $1,020 if I'm not mistaken and the build quality is Really good, the paneling is strong all over It's got aluminum on the outside the keyboard deck is plastic But it's very rigid all the surfaces feel oddly strong for the price point The hinge uses a design where they're closer together, and I normally don't like this But they've built it very well this year it feels very durable. The port selection is better than most gaming laptops at this price point Lots of USB ports A couple of display outs a Thunderbolt 3 port and an ethernet jack The only thing that I would say it's missing is an SD card slot and if you're curious the Thunderbolt 3 port is actually full four-lane PCIe not two lanes like some other laptops Which is nice the internals are accessed really easily there's just some screws on the bottom the RAM has a cover of some sort but remove that and you can replace the RAM and You also have access to both drives as well. There's a two and half inch SATA and an M.2 SSD The battery down here has a bit of a weird shape. It's this giant L And it's a 60 watt hour battery and I'm getting around four hours of battery life using the 4K screen You'll also notice down here a woofer dome the speakers on this laptop are pretty good There are a pair of speakers up top to complement that sub these get really loud like uncomfortably loud They sound clean at regular volumes and the bass is present But the moment you crank it up to even like 60 70 percent volume the distortion is pretty severe The keyboard has a good layout I actually like it a lot the arrow keys are under the number pad So it makes it very roomy But it might be weird for people who frequently use a normal number pad the keystrokes are a little shallow And I feel like it could be a bit more Responsive on the whole it is a decent keyboard overall and it has RGB backlighting it's lit by zones and not individual keys But at this price point you're normally stuck with red backlighting So this is a nice touch the trackpad is an Elan trackpad, and it's okay. It's not ideal I know a lot of trackpads on gaming laptops never even get used most people just plug up mice for playing and stuff But I still think it could have been better the surface is nice and the button mechanism is good But the tracking doesn't feel consistent to me. I'm getting occasional skips another thing that I don't love is the design now I know I mentioned that the build quality is really good and it is but the design feels Kind of out of place to me It's got this crosshatch pattern on it, and it's cool that they went for something different than most other gaming laptops But I don't know I don't love it And it's also prone to fingerprint smudges now most of it comes from just the material because it's a matte aluminum It just shows smudges really readily, but yeah, if that's something that bothers you be aware the screen is okay I'm using the newly released 4K panel here I've also used the 1080p panel in the past both are IPS panels But don't get very bright Now part of the reason why the screen is dimmer like this is because they put this matte coating on it You can remove the coating I've seen it done in the past I've done it before on older Lenovo laptops basically you take a hair dryer heat it up peel it off I'm not gonna do it on this because it's a review unit But in the past when you do do it, it does get a little bit brighter Just because the material is gone The bezels on the screen are a little thick on the top and bottom but for the money It's kind of expected and the webcam looks ok it's a 720p cam nothing special Performance on this laptop is solid it's excellent for 1080P gaming It'll handle lights and midway titles easily you'll be way above 60 frames per second on just about any Modern AAA shooter some open-world games can get a bit more demanding So you might have to lower image quality a little but in general This laptop is more than enough for 1080p gaming and it's fully VR ready Only really demanding games or poorly optimized games like PUBG will need lowered graphics settings And when I play PUBG on this thing I only felt comfortable with the frame weights when I put too low graphics quality Thermal performance is good I ran some stress tests and the external temperatures stay comfortable during those tests as well now originally this laptop had some thermal issues when It first launched I know that some of the early reviews like the very early units had some issues with external temperatures But I didn't notice any of that with this unit for the stock fan settings like the automatic fans They're pretty quiet, and they cool it adequately, but if you put it on extreme cooling it gets really loud It does help a little bit. I mean temperatures are a little bit lower It's not really worth it to me though The extra noise is way too loud But if you live somewhere warm or you use your computer when you don't have access to air-conditioning That could be really useful so the Lenovo Y720 this thing gives you some pretty good value for the money It's everything you'd expect But it's a very well-built laptop starting at just over $1,000 the screen is probably its weakest point both the 4K and the 1080p panels feel relatively dim The keyboard has zoned RGB backlighting, shallow stroke in the keys, but it's comfortable to type on the trackpad uses Elan drivers And there's some occasional tracking issues inside the GTX 1060 and the Kaby Lake CPU options are awesome for 1080p gaming and are well cooled without the fan getting too loud The RAM and both drives are easily upgraded if you want and the battery comes in at 60 watt hours with okay battery life I'm getting around four hours with the 4K screen so a GTX 1060 laptop for around a thousand dollars is a pretty good value There's two real competitors to this first is like a broad competitor Which are the bare-bones systems like Clevo and Sager But the other kind of brand-name competitor is the Acer Helios 300 which I've reviewed for in the past They both have black and red gamer aesthetics I wouldn't call either of them better-looking than the other if you're trying to choose between the two They're both good the Y720 has better build quality And I think on the whole is just a more complete laptop. It has RGB backlighting It's got the Thunderbolt 3 port it has better thermal characteristics. I mean, it's just got more aggressive cooling. It's heavier It's got a bigger battery it's a more substantial laptop. The Acer Helios 300 it's a little bit cheaper So you're going to get better bang for your buck in terms of just raw performance But it is I I would consider it a quote-unquote cheaper feeling laptop Just because it's got more plastic and the whole device is just lighter weight and everything but seriously both of them are great Can't go wrong with either of them. I would go for this one if you want build quality I'd go with the Helios 300 if you want just pure value Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it. See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. And this is a video on the concept of using the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement. So, I've been using mine for about three weeks with iOS 11 and I really feel like that's the operating system for these guys, and, well, ever since iPad have existed, people have been trying to use them, with limited success, as laptop replacements, because it's quite appealing: they're thin, they're light, they're not too expensive and iOS 11 looked like it had a whole bunch of new features, that would make it more viable. So, let's take a look. Starting with media consumption, iPads have always been great for watching videos and listening to music. The 10.5" iPad Pro has 4 speakers, and they sound awesome. It's really weird that a tablet like this has better speakers then like 99% of gaming laptops, but it does. It also has a really nice screen. The 120 Hz panel is excellent, like, straight up 10 out of 10. You can literally see twice the number of animation frames in the UI, so everything looks super smooth. It's tough to showcase this in a video, because you're seeing this at 24 frames per second, but if you see it in real life, you'll notice it right away. The thing is... nothing outside of the UI really makes use of that 120 Hertz panel. You're not watching videos at 120 frames per second, you're probably not playing games at 120 frames per second. So, the hardware is awesome, but it just feels untapped for what the device does. Now, if you're an artist the Apple Pencil is really nice on the new iPad Pros, the lower latency is noticeable to me, I will say though, if your master plan is to pick up an iPad Pro and an Apple Pencil to learn how to draw, don't do it. It's not going to happen, start with paper and a pencil. So, there's two big things in iOS 11 that were really exciting to me: drag-and-drop and Files. So, drag and drop is a new UX that allows you to drag and drop multiple objects, and, I have to say, it's really well done. And Files is an app that allows you to store files, like mail attachments or photos, links, downloads. You can place them into various cloud storage locations, and it will show up on devices that have that Cloud source. So it'll show up on your laptop, your desktop, whatever it might be. So, these two features alone bring a level of usability that I've never seen before in an iPad. I mean there were third-party apps to do this kind of stuff before, but they just weren't nearly as fluid and well integrated as these. I would say that it is a viable solution, like, if I had to, I could get by with using the iPad Pro as my only device, and I think a lot of reviewers came to that similar conclusion, that the new iPad Pros, running iOS 11, are a significantly better experience than iPads were in the past, for using them as laptop replacements. But after using this for a couple more weeks, I thought: "What am I doing here?", like, "Why is this still so difficult to use this as my laptop replacement?" It's not as fluid and it's not as nice as it should be. I mean these devices have been around for 6/7 years, and the touchscreen is never going to be as precise as a mouse. If you're accessing websites or doing spreadsheets or database stuff, poking on the screen, like, to click stuff, it's usable, but it'll never be faster than a mouse or a trackpad. And the same with the drag-and-drop stuff. I send photo attachments from work very frequently, it works, it's a welcome addition, but a keyboard and a trackpad are just so much faster than this. Split-screen works like it should, but it's cramped and all the tapping and swiping you need to do to get this split swing going... I'm fluent at the mechanics at this point. I've done it so often. I know other keyboard shortcuts, I'm very familiar with them, but it's still never going to be as fast as a laptop or 2-in-1, running a full fledged operating system. And that's my whole issue with this proposition. If you're going to replace a laptop with this thing, the experience has to be as good as the laptop that you're replacing. Or else, why would you use this, right? The keyboard is not bad, I'm using the Apple one, but if I had a choice, I would never use this thing over a regular laptop keyboard. And it isn't very slim, once you add the keyboard onto the device, it's as thick as a Microsoft Surface Pro, or like a Razor Blade Stealth. The pricing isn't too expensive, but once you add all the accessories and stuff, it's like $800 or $900, which is in the realm of some really good ultrabooks and 2-in-1s. So the hardware on the iPad pro is excellent, the actual tablet itself has so much potential. It's gorgeous, the screen is beautiful, it's got amazing battery life. We took an easy eight or nine hour battery life on this thing. I mean, it's really really cool, but the software cripples this thing. iOS 11 is definitely a step in the right direction, but I think it's still really far away from what this tablet can do, if it had a completely different operating system, that was more conducive to regular work. So if media consumption is your jam, like, if you're just buying this to listen to music and watch videos, go for it. It's expensive, but it does a really good job at it. But if you're trying to use this thing to replace a laptop, I mean, it's doable, but it's still a giant pain in the ass. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here! And this is a little different video from normal. This is something called Flybrix. And this is a product that I actually purchased last year, like, late 2016, and I bought it because it would be pretty cool, and I completely forgot about it. It just sat in my office for months, at this point, and I finally found it back again, and I thought I would kinda do an unboxing slash... kinda product experience with it. Because I'm not going to review this, I'm not an expert at this type of thing. What it is is a drone-type product, technically they're called, like, remote-controlled quadcopters or remote-controlled... toys of some sort. But that's what this is-- but what makes this one special is that it's made out of Lego, and you can attach, like, different things to it, and you can make it a Lego drone. Okay, let's take a look. So... I've never built my own quadrocopter before. Or drone before. Oh my gosh, this is so many pieces. I'm just going to try to do this thing without  instructions, because... I mean, we'll see. This feels very not sturdy. Like, I know it's Lego, but this feels extremely not sturdy. *Laughing out of confusio .* What am I doing here?! I think I have to look at the instructions. It looks like to control this thing, you need to get an app. So I'm going to download that on my phone, I'll be right back. Okay. How do I fly it? No! Oh, I had to arm it! [WTF] *Escaping to avoid being cut into a million pieces.* *Sad drone sounds.* *Laughing* *Okay...* *Okay...* Okay. Okay. Is this off? Is this disarmed? Okay. [Rip drone.] *Okay...* That did not go as planned. Umm... I kinda have a feeling this one was very imbalanced-- that's why it flew off. And when out of control. Okay, I'm going to rebuild this. I mean it feels... ...slightly more balanced than it was before. I don't think it's going to make that much of a difference, but I have to test. *Random Lego brick goes flying better than the drone.* I'm not sure what to think of this thing. I mean, I could probably rebuild it and try it again, I think I should. I've been trying, like, four rotors, they supply eight. And I guess eight would give it more stability? I don't know much about quadcopters and RC toys, but I feel like the more rotors would kinda give it more opportunity to balance itself out with the gyroscope. So that's what I'm going to do, I'm going to do one more attempt at a build, I'm going to follow the instructions to a T, get eight rotors on this thing, eight props on this thing, and see if it does any better. Okay, so at this point, I've spent a little bit over an hour building this thing, and I gotta be honest, it's not been the most fun hour  of my life, but this is the completed version of their eight rotor device, I guess? Uh, I put on a BB8 up front, because I mean, that's what this whole thing is about, sticking Lego pieces onto this thing so that's what we have. BB8's probably my favorite Star Wars-related item. Now we're just going to reconnect it and let's see how this goes. Now, before I launch this thing, I gotta be completely honest, I don't have faith in it. I feel like the reasons why it failed originally with the four rotor version still exist in this eight rotor version. But this is as complicated this build can be, and this is built exactly the way that they've described it in the instructions. So if this doesn't work, then this doesn't work. Okay, we are connected, and I'm going to get out of the way. And let this thing fly. Okay. The other thing is I'm convinced that this is going to shatter into, like, all the pieces, and I don't want to rebuild it, so this is the last time I'm going to do this. Okay, here we go. Please work! *Oh my god.* *Oh my god.* Okay! This... ..is... This is why this product should not exist. Okay. I spent... about an hour... building this thing... ...and... ...and you know what, while I was building and I looked it up, this thing is currently going for $180. It was a little bit more than what I thought it was, that is a lot of money for a product that... ...I mean... ...maybe there's someone out that's going to enjoy this, but really, if you're interested in drones, there's like, $20 drones that are amazing. I'll link my favorite one below, and it flies, I mean, this one I broke, but the fly great, and if you ever smash them, it's 20 bucks. Not 180 bucks. Hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And this is a review of the brand new XPS 13 for 2018.
So this thing's been redesigned It's got a fresh new look, and the original XPS 13 Or I should say the previous generation of XPS 13,
that style has been around since 2015 It's been around for a while. The
design has gotten a little bit old And they finally refreshed the whole thing,
so this thing now comes in a new design It's thinner, it's lighter and it's significantly smaller
than the previous generation I think it's something like 24 percent smaller
than the previous generation which is very noticeable See, on camera, or just, if you look at it on pictures
and stuff like that, you can't really tell But when you hold it in person, especially
when you are comparing it with the old one, right beside it, it's a very noticeable difference. In weight and in size. And I think it's a really nice looking device. So, one of the best things about the XPS lineup is that they don't copy MacBooks. They just kinda make their own thing. And it's distinctly, a very XPS-looking machine and I think it looks quite good. The big change though in terms the aesthetics
is this new glass fiber weave And it looks awesome so, the original XPS 13 and 15 had this black carbon fiber material.
That looks really good Honestly, I think this looks better,
so the one difference though is that this material is, it doesn't have that rubber finish that the XPS 13 and 15 had from last generation. It was almost like a soft touch material This feels just kind of like a regular- I want to say plastic, it's not plastic, but it feels kind of like a smoother and harder finish which isn't as inviting to use. It's more
of a technical material But it does look really good Now, this material does have some kind of stain resistance to it I tried putting some pen on it. It doesn't stain,
like you can just wipe it off pretty easily It's supposed to look fresh, and it does.
I think it looks really really good So they've matched the white interior with a
rose gold metal for the top surface They call it rose gold, but it's much less pink than a lot of rose gold materials from other companies And I'm rocking a dbrand skin
on mine because seriously, this looks super fly. Marble top,
gold trim, white interior. I mean This is fresh AF! One of the few complaints ahead about the previous XPS 13 was the power supply So this finally uses a USB-C port to charge it I know the old one could use USB-C, but it included
a barrel plug as like the AC adapter I like USB-C much more for 2018 Now, the rest of the USB ports are all USB-C as well And they have a microSD. I like the USB-C's and they include an adapter for USB-A connections,
but I don't love the microSD slot I feel like it's something that not a lot of people will use,
but it is there in case you want it Now, in terms of the Thunderbolt 3 ports,
they support four lanes of PCIe And it's something that bothered some people with the previous generation They only supported two lanes of PCIe for external
GPU connections. Now you get all four The webcam on this laptop has been updated and
now supports Windows Hello for secure logins Now, it's still located at the bottom so
the camera looks up your nose and the image quality isn't amazing or anything, it's
kind of your standard webcam for an ultrabook, but, it does keep the bezels really thin One thing, I don't like though is that, the
white trim, like on the white model That black camera cut out is a bit of an eyesore So if you don't use your camera very often or if you just want a more secure camera thing, you can get some privacy stickers from dbrand, cover it up and it looks a lot cleaner. The bezels on the previous XPS 13
are already really thin These are even thinner, I think it's like 23% thinner It's just a more immersive experience
when you're using this screen The screen itself is covered in Gorilla Glass 4 And I'm running a 1080p panel, and it's
bright with decent color accuracy It does come in a new 4K panel
with a hundred percent sRGB if you need something for color accurate work Now the performance on this thing is good as
you expect because it's 8th gen CPU For multi-core applications, these 8th gen CPUs can fly. I tried to run Intel XTU on this laptop It does throttle. it's kind of expected considering
the size and everything on this laptop But I had big dreams. So the thermals on
this system have been changed So this is now running a new thermal management
thing called Gore thermal material, and I'm not sure exactly what it is But it's supposed to be some advanced material that
they use in space programs and stuff It's a good thermal solution But it's not amazing like, if you're hoping to go full turbo on all four cores for an extended period of time, It's not going to happen. It will throttle The good thing is that the fans are
really quiet on idle and on full load Gaming performance isn't amazing It's running an Intel UHD 620 So we're gonna get some pretty mediocre frame rates unless you're playing some really light games The keyboard feels really similar to
the previous generation to me It's a little bit different visually like the keys are a little bit larger and the layout's changed a bit. Page Up, Page Down have their own keys But the typing experience feels
really similar to the old one I think a lot of people will enjoy using this keyboard The trackpad is... I think it's identical, I mean They might be using the exact same one It feels good. Windows Precision, glass surface.
It's a good trackpad Okay, let's take a look at the internals It's a fast drive, PM961, user-replaceable.
The Wi-Fi card looks to be built on board But it can run the Intel 8265 so if you want a good Wi-Fi card, I'd go with that one The battery is 52 watts. It's smaller than before,
the previous generation had a 60 watt battery, but remember, it's a smaller chassis You kind of expect it to have a smaller battery as well But the good thing is though, the
battery life is still really, really good I'm getting around 11 hours of battery life
on this thing with the screen at 250 nits Alright, the speakers They're mounted on the side, so they're
positioned reasonably well, I prefer them to be kind of on the keyboard facing up But this is a decent location. It does have new software But I feel like the actual audio quality and clarity sounds pretty much exactly the same as the
previous generation which is good, but not great The coil whines, so people that are interested
whether or not this thing has coil whine I have one unit, it's review unit so...
this unit did not have it But the responsible thing for me
to say is that I can't tell yet I feel like I would need hundreds of XPS 13's to be able to tell you whether or not
this thing has an issue or not but this particular unit did not have it Overall, great laptop. I think that Dell did a
really good job this year, and honestly, There's so little to dislike about this thing, but there's one thing I want to get off
my chest. This was a redesign They had an opportunity to make something completely brand new in aesthetics and in appearance And they went with something that is just- it feels too familiar to the old one, so the old one was a good design, but if you didn't
know that this was a new version and you had the black version, particularly
like the black and silver version of this You wouldn't be able to tell immediately
that it was a new version, there was a new updated version of the XPS 13 because it looks so similar. It is thinner,
smaller, lighter, all that stuff But... I mean, you could've done something crazy, Dell! You could've made something like completely fresh Now, I know Dell's a more conservative company They're kind of like business oriented,
enterprise oriented, so I get it, But me personally, I would love to see something Just completely different, visually But it's a fantastic product. If you're
looking for a thin and light laptop, this thing should be near the top of the list. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! 
Hey, how's it going? Dave 2D here. So there's been a lot of Samsung S9 and S9 plus rumours that have been floating around the web But a couple of days ago a really big tell was leaked. It was a GeekBench score Not just like a photo of one, but there was a recorded GeekBench score that was uploaded to the GeekBench database and that is HUGE because you can't fake those things or it's incredibly difficult to fake those things and so with that GeekBench score you could confirm a lot of things that have been rumored about this phone So let's just get right into it, the first thing is the build. It's gonna look very similar to the S8 and the S8 plus like to the untrained eye It's gonna be very difficult to tell them apart Same kind of design, same kind of aesthetic, same kind of form factor, power button, volume rocker, Bixby button It's all there. The big tell though is on the back and that's the second thing the fingerprint sensor has been moved into a better location so a lot of people didn't like the fact that the S8, the S8 plus and the Note 8 all had the fingerprint sensor kind of slightly on to the right not the most ideal position because I think your finger would sometimes confuse the camera lens as being the sensor and just, it was difficult to nail it each time It's now placed right in the middle directly underneath the camera And this should make it easier for most people to hit that fingerprint sensor basically every time they reach for the phone. Another thing that's been kind of confirmed is the processors. This thing is now running a Snapdragon 845, which is the new one from Qualcomm And it's a pretty substantial increase in performance over the Snapdragon 835. We're looking at a 25% increase in performance maybe a little bit more But keep in mind that the S8 and the S8 Plus are still really fast So I mean I wouldn't go running out to buy the new phone just because the small CPU upgrade. So with that Snapdragon 845 though also comes a nice camera upgrade so the video processing capabilities are improved It should be able to record 4k at 60 frames per second But the crazier thing is the slow motion so the Snapdragon 845 is supposed to be able to do 720p at 480 frames per second. That is super slow-motion, so I want to test that thing out when it comes with that camera stuff though is the whole thing about the two different cameras of the S9 and the S9 Plus are going to have different camera configurations right now the S8 and S8 Plus both have the same camera; both single-lens S9 is gonna have a single lens, S9 plus is gonna have two lenses stacked in a vertical configuration Just one on top of each other so if you're into the whole like depth stuff and just having a secondary camera S9 plus is gonna be your choice. Now looking back to that Geekbench score that S9 Plus is actually rocking six gigs of ram It's only got five and change available but six gigs of RAM in the bigger model four gigs of RAM on the smaller S9 The most exciting change for me, though And this is gonna sound really stupid for some people is that the S9 and the S9 Plus will finally have stereo speakers. I feel like this is something that's been missing from the Galaxy line forever.  Like, it just never made sense to me that something with this kind of build quality, and this kind of premium awesomeness didn't have stereo speakers It finally will have it Alright, number seven on the list the iris and facial recognition on the S9 should be significantly better than the S8, so I feel like facial recognition stuff is just kind of popping up in mass right now especially with the iPhone X doing their stuff This phone like the S8 didn't have a great facial recognition system. Samsung been putting this tech in their phones for a while but it's never been amazing. S9 should be quite a bit better; high resolution camera That's like a big thing for facial recognition stuff. Okay, headphone jack number eight that is awesome They've still putting in a headphone jack, and I think for a lot of people that's super important And I think Samsung is one of the last if not the last company that's making those premium flagship phones that are like 800-900 bucks that still includes a headphone jack, and I think a lot of people will appreciate it. In fact I think a lot of people will actually just buy this phone Just because of that one feature which is a good thing for Samsung.  Okay last thing, it's gonna be running Android 8.0 right out of the box, and they're obviously gonna stick the Samsung skin on it now if you know me And you follow my channel you know that I don't love skins on phones and themes on phones I just like the whole stock Android experience but I will give Samsung this they probably had the best skin of all the heavy skins from 2017 and every year, their phones get slightly less obtrusive like the software is just a little bit better of the year, a little bit less obnoxious So hopefully the S9 has some kickass software So that basically wraps it up.  S9 is gonna be kind of like a minor upgrade across the board nothing huge, nothing major, but it should be a really awesome phone because the S8 Was really really good, like nearly perfect for a lot of people and now it's just gonna be even better.  Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time! (Outro) 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here So the OnePlus 5T was just announced, and I thought I'd just do a quick impressions video of this thing, so I've been using it for a few days This won't be a full review obviously But I want to share some of my thoughts of this device with you guys So the first thing, the big thing about this phone Is the screen. It's been updated to an 18 by 9 ratio. It's a much larger screen It's just over six inches and the screen-to-body ratio is just over 80% right now, so it looks a lot more I guess modern over the original OnePlus 5, not that the OnePlus 5 looked poor But because of 2017's whole like,
bezel-less smartphone influx This just looks more up-to-date. In terms of the actual screen itself like how useful we find it, it depends on how you use your phone for and how you like your screen Personally, I don't love 18 by 9 screen ratios. I find them a little bit weird to me I like my 16 by 9. Maybe I'm old school. I like my screen 16 by 9 like my laptop 16 by 9 I like my phone 16 by 9, but you might like this. This is the thing for 2017 Okay, what else has changed? The other big one is the fingerprint sensor, so this has been moved to the back now And I've always been a big fan of fingerprint sensors in the back. I've always found it Just easier to hold, you pull out of your pocket, fingers already there When you have that fingerprint sensor on the front, like the original OnePlus 5 down at the bottom Especially because this phone is like, so sleek It's just the top heavy device, and not that you drop it or anything But just, I don't like it as much as a back placement I've always liked it there, and it's nice
that they have it there. Now I know some people don't like the fingerprint sensor on the back because if your phone's on the table You can't unlock it unless you pick it up, but they actually have a face unlock this year Which doesn't really resolve the first thing But I thought it'd be a good segue to talk about face unlock. Um, I got to be honest I thought face unlock would be bad I thought it would just be a really kind of like me-too product that OnePlus would put on their phone But I am amazed by how good it is. Now I haven't been able to test it thoroughly in terms of like how secure it actually it is But it is fast. Like significantly faster than Apple's Face ID which is weird but at the same time kind of expected, because this thing doesn't have the nearly like the security in terms of like how many facial points is measuring. It's very very fast It's pretty much instant. The moment you look at your phone, the face unlocks so, which leads me to believe that it probably has some kind of flaws to it, but if you use it as kind of like a secondary security device I think it's not bad, but I do want to test this thing out more thoroughly over time. The other thing that's changed is the camera. So the OnePlus 5 virtually launched with a telephoto lens. This is now no longer a telephoto lens It's the same kind of focal length, but this lens is actually supposed to help with low-light photography. Now I don't miss the lack of telephoto lens at all because I never use that stuff, but I do wish it was a wide-angle Unfortunately, it's not I am interested to see how this thing performs in low-light because this thing was never bad like the OnePlus 5 was never really bad at low light so I don't know... This might seem promising I will be covering that in my full review later on The thing that hasn't changed which I thought was surprising was the battery, so it's still a 3300 milliamp hour battery, which... I don't know. I don't know how I feel about that I mean it's the same chassis size, but because the screen is larger And it's like the same brightness as the OnePlus 5. I'm assuming this somehow It draws more power than the original screen So, wouldn't the battery life be reduced? Maybe? I'm not sure. Now, Dash Charge... These devices, if they are still in the frame I mean, this is one of the best things about the OnePlus 5 system I think it's about 30 minutes for a 60 percent charge You can't go wrong with that. Now, overall the phone hasn't changed all that much It's not like massive upgrades or anything It's a nice refresh. Same processor, same battery just a little bit better all around Now the best part about it all, but the price hasn't changed. This thing launches at $500 Which is the same price as original OnePLus 5 I think goes for sale on November 21st, so yeah. If you want to check it out, I'll leave a link below Hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time! Oh yeah, if you're wondering what these are, these are the cases And it didn't open them because I'm not much of a case person. I don't love the red I also don't love the wood which is two of the cases. The carbon fiber looks pretty cool It's just not something I would rock on my phone personally But the sandstone, which is like the original OnePlus kind of texture, I like that, but I'm just not a big fan of cases. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here and this is the 13 inch Razer Blade Stealth. And this is kind of exciting for a lot of people that know about this product, because when it launched it was a great product, but those bezels were extra thick and I guess Razer listened, so now we have this. It has the same external dimensions and finishes. It's got great build quality, one of the better built ultrabooks. The black finish is really nice, but I highly recommend putting a skin on the Stealth. I'm using the Black Dragon from DBrand and I know the skin looks nice and all, but the big thing for me is protection. A scratch on a black laptop looks extra ugly.
I nicked my old one and it sucks. I'll link these skins below. Now, there is another color called gunmetal grey, it's a very muted look, it's all grey, there's no light-up logo and even RGB keyboard is gone, it's only white backlighting. I will take a look at the gray one in a couple weeks, but if you want RGB lights, you got to go with this one: the black version. The ports also haven't changed, there's one HDMI, two USB-A ports and a Thunderbolt 3 port, that's also used for charging. The internals look pretty much the same. The RAM is soldered on, again. But this time it has 16 gigs of RAM which is very roomy and something that a lot of enthusiasts were asking for. The SSD is replaceable, you've just got to remove the ribbon cable, again. But sadly, it's still using the PM951 drives, which have relatively slow write speeds at the lower capacities. It's not a terrible drive, it's just that there are so many better drives out there that they could have used, it's kind of disappointing. The battery size remains the same at 53.6 watt hours, but I'm getting less battery life. Running the same loop as usual, it's clocking in a little over seven hours. Still very good, but it's about 40 minutes less than the older model. And I think it's just because the screen is bigger, there's just a larger surface area to light up. Now speaking of screens, there's two screen sizes available: the older 12.5" panel and the new 13.3" panel. I have a strong preference for this one. It's got a great color gamut and the accuracy is also pretty good, after calibration. I do wish it was brighter, it's perfectly fine indoors, but especially with that glossy screen, it's not ideal for bright environments. But that bezel, it's shrunken down and it just looks so much better. I mean a lot of you guys have complained about the older thick bezels, and they did something about it which is awesome. Another thing they've changed is the trackpad. It seems to be the same size and it's got the same glass texture, the button mechanism feels slightly different to me than the older one. That one had a more pronounced click. But the tracking on this new one is so much better: Windows precision drivers, finally. I never loved the trackpad on the original Stealth. 
This new one is great. Performance is as expected. It's a KabyLake i7 and with 16 gigs of RAM, it will crush any kind of media consumption, work or school stuff that you throw at it. Video editing on 1080p footage will be pretty decent, if you have an external drive. 4K footage is going to be gnarly, but it's an ultrabook. Now, one of the things I need to make clear is that the Razer Blade Stealth is not a gaming laptop. I mean it's made by Razer, but it's not designed to play games on its own. It's running an HD 620, the integrated graphics chip from Intel and, I mean, you can play some light games and still get reasonable frame rates, if you turn everything down and play at the lowest resolution. But the Razer Blade Stealth was one of the first laptops to support external GPUs over Thunderbolt 3 and even in mid 2017, this is still one of the best setups for the job. I connected to the Razer Core running a GTX 1080 and it's a super easy hookup, it's basically plug and play. Now, gaming performance is really good, but like all Thunderbolt 3 GPUs, performance is going to be around 10 maybe 15% less than direct connection on a desktop, and remember, you want to use an external monitor for the best performance. Now, if you're interested in learning more about this particular setup, I'll put a link in the video description. Thermal performance remains the same, nothing is too hot, nothing's too loud. Razer did a pretty good job on this thing. So, obviously there's a lot of stuff I like about the Stealth, but for the sake of being thorough and for the people that just want to hate on something, there are a couple things I got pick at. First is the keyboard. I think it could be better, it hasn't changed since launch or at least not in any way noticeable to me, it's decent and I like the RGB lighting, but I wish it had a bit more travel on each stroke. And the functional markings still don't light up, so if you want to adjust volume or screen brightness in the dark, you've got to memorize wich keys to press. The speakers could also be better, I mean they're positioned well, I mean good stereo separation, and they look cool, but I just wish they had better audio quality. The 12" MacBook and some of the HP Spectre laptops have better speakers, but that's about it, Razer took a really good laptop, fixed everything that people had to complain about it and we have this. There is however something that kind of casts a bit of shade on all this awesome stuff. The Razer Blade Stealth has actually been one of the best values ultrabooks on the market, which was weird because it's Razer and they normally have more premium pricing, but this one costs $1400 at the base model. I mean, it's significantly upgraded compared to the old one, but it's like 50% more expensive. So, with the new Stealth, I think they did a great job on it, it's pricey, but I think it's going to be a very popular device. It has the same great build quality as before, the 13.3 inch screen has very good color accuracy and the bezels are finally smaller, but it could be brighter. The RGB keyboard is spaced comfortably, but the keys do have a shallow stroke. The trackpad is glass again and tracking software is much improved this year. Inside, the KayLake CPU and the HD620 are quietly cooled and deliver strong performance for an ultrabook. The 16 gigs of RAM is soldered on. The included SSD isn't super fast, but it is replaceable. And the 53.6 watt-hour battery will last around 7 hours. So, should you get this thing? Honestly, if you just bought the old Razer Blade Stealth, I feel bad for you son, because this one is so much better. It is a lot more expensive, there's that, but if you're looking for an ultrabook and you can afford this thing, this one's really good, ok. 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here. So this is a video on some tech accessories that I think are super useful for students, and this is not going to be a video where you're going to see stuff like TVs and speakers, because as fun as those are, I seriously don't think that those are just really all that useful for students. What you will see are things that I actually think are, well, I'm not a student anymore, but I feel like if I had these when I was a student these would be awesome. Okay, first up are some cables. They're not just any cable, these are every cable in one cable. So, these are made by a company called Chafon, and it's essentially every single charging cable connected into one USB-A cable. So we have mini USB, micro USB, USB C and on the big one it actually comes with two lightning cables. So, with this device you can basically charge any phone as long as those made in the last like 10 or 15 years. I think this is incredibly useful. So the thing that makes this thing cool is how simple it is and you can keep it in your bag, your car, wherever you want, they're very inexpensive. I think they're like eight or nine dollars. Yeah, great, purchase. Very useful in my opinion. Second on the list are some battery packs. So my go-to battery pack is Anker, I feel like they make some of the best quality battery packs on the market. They're inexpensive and they don't have like stupid features, like lights and like flashlights and RGB stuff going on. Very simple but very reliable batteries that I've owned from even before I started doing YouTube stuff. They come in various colors and various sizes and some of the bigger ones from Anker can recharge some laptops. Now if you're in the market for a battery pack and you want something that's a little bit more streamlined, there are a couple devices out there that have like built-in prongs, so you can just plug them right up into the wall to charge. And they have built-in cables to make it that much easier. Now sadly, I've never found one of these all-in-one battery packs for USB-C. But they do have them for micro USB and Lightning. I'll link both of them below. Alright, the last thing I want to talk about is storage, and I really think this device is something that every student in 2017 should have. This is a device, it's just a flash storage, right? Very unassuming, but it has both USB-C and USB-A on one device. So you can just flip it around and plug it into whatever port you want. If you format this thing with exFAT, you can connect it to any computer: Mac OS, Windows, Linux. Whatever you want. You're basically unstoppable. But the thing that makes this thing so useful is like if you ever want to transfer a file or if you need to transfer someone's file over to your computer... whatever... like.. this thing... and it goes onto your keychain, right? It's so small. It's so insignificant Get this thing this will save your butt so many times in school like just do it. Okay, If you want something a little more substantial we have Seagate and Western Digital drives. These are obviously a lot bigger. These are one terabyte at a minimum. I think they start at like 50 bucks, they're relatively inexpensive- And you can use these things as backup to store your work, your games, your videos. Whatever you want. Now, I've always used Seagate drives in the past, but I've actually tried these recently and these Western Digital ones. And I find them actually slightly better. They're equivalent in price, but the thing that makes you kind of cool, I mean they come in different colors, so that's kind of a bonus, but they have these rubber feet on the bottom. The seagate drives don't, so when you place them down on a table, the Western Digital ones just, I don't know, they stick around a little better, and that alone makes me prefer them more, but you can't go wrong with either of them. Okay. That's basically it. Three pretty important pieces of technology I think every student should have. 
♪♪♪ Hey, how's it going? Dave 2D here! So I want to do a quick video to talk about two upcoming laptops that were showcased at Computex. The first one that caught my eye was the Asus Zephyrus. So this is their new ultra-thin, ultra-light gaming laptop that's actually packing a GTX 1080. So this is the world's thinnest laptop with a GTX 1080, it's thinner than the Aorus X7, thinner than the Razer Blade Pro, it's even thinner than the new Acer Triton 700. The thing is GTX 1080 chips run hot, like, really hot, so manufacturers tend not to put those GPUs into these thin-and-light chassis, because it's just asking for trouble to happen down the road. The Asus is a little bit different. You'll notice that the keyboard and trackpad are shifted down, so the top half of the deck is essentially a giant grill right on top of the CPU and GPU to allow for better airflow. Secondly, the bottom of the laptop shifts, so when you open it, the hinge mechanism actually opens up this gap on the side of the device for more airflow. And when you close it, everything seals back up. And the third thing, and I think this is the most important thing, is that the GTX 1080 in this thing is one of the new Max-Q GPUs from Nvidia. And these are essentially just more power-efficient versions of these GPUs. They're not like a new fabrication or anything, they're probably just going onto the line, picking out the ones with the best thermal characteristics, so the ones that have the least current leakage, so you can undervolt it a little bit, and just deliver those as Max-Q GPUs. I'm not trying to belittle what Nvidia's done here, I think it's awesome for the consumer, it's just not a brand new fabrication or anything like that. Now, with this reduced power consumption and reduced thermal output, I wouldn't be surprised if you're getting slightly reduced performance as well, but we'll have to see when the review unit comes in. To top it off, the Asus Zephyrus is decked out with some really nice gamer-oriented features, but the big one for me is the 120Hz G-Sync panel. And I've said this before, but when you play games on a really high-end GPU, you gotta pair it up with a nice display like this, so you can actually make us of those frames. The paper specs are awesome, and visually it's pretty unique. It's not going to be everyone's favorite design, but there's a huge amount of functionality here, and not just aesthetic style. So the other laptop that caught my eye was the Asus ZenBook Pro, the UX550. And this is a device that I think a lot of you guys would be interested in as well, because it's something that-- well, it's functional, and just, like, super cool. It's a thin-and-light laptop with a GTX 1050ti, 4K screen, and all the usual trimmings for a premium, high-end laptops. The base model starts at $1300, but once you deck it out with all the good stuff, I wouldn't be surprised if it's closer to, like, 18, or maybe even $2000. Now the design is actually very similar to the Asus ZenBook 3, so this is their ultrabook, and it's got the whole focus on thin-and-light design with really good build quality, and the chamfered edges look awesome. The UX550 has all of this stuff as well. Now aside from good looks, the thing that makes the ZenBook Pro special is the 1050ti. That thing handles 1080p gaming really nicely. It's kinda like the sweet spot for laptop gaming. Not just in terms of pricing and performance, but also in terms of thermals. You don't need something super thick to cool a 1050ti. Now, the paper specs are awesome, but there's two things that kinda worry me. The first is the build quality. So the ZenBook 3 was built really well, super thin. But the older-generation ZenBook wasn't amazing, and when I saw a clip of someone pressing down on that new ZenBook Pro, that worried me. Now I don't know if it was like a full, retail version that she was playing with, it could have been an earlier prototype or something. I'm hoping that is was an earlier prototype, because if the final version has that kind of flex, that's going to be disappointing. The second thing is the thermal management. Now, Asus normally has pretty good thermal management on their laptops, it's just that this is a thin-and-light one. The 1050ti, it's not a super hot chip, it's relatively easy to cool, it's just I hope Asus has done it properly. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video, I'll be doing full reviews for both of these devices, the Asus Zephyrus as well as the ZenBook Pro. I'm more interested in the ZenBook Pro, because that's just a device that, I mean, it's just right up my alley. Super thin, super light, 1050ti, what's not to like, right? Thumbs if you liked this video, subs if you loved it! I'll see you guys next time. ♪♪♪ 
Hey how's it going, Dave2D here so this Is the Doogee Mix 2. It's a $200 smartphone And the company hit me a couple months ago, and they were like. Hey, do you want to check out our new phone. I went on the website the pictures looked good. The specification list looked awesome, we're looking at 6GB Of RAM, a big AMOLED screen, USB-C charging, Expandable storage, so on paper there's alot of good things going for it And it's built well, it's not going to win any awards or anything for design. But it is built well, and it feels solid. It's a little bit heavier and thicker than a lot of phones in that $200 price point, But i like the way it feels in your hand. Now they include a bunch of accessories Which I guess is the norm for inexpensive phones like this, you get A case, 2 screen protectors and a USB-C to headphone adaptor. Ok, let's talk about the actual usage of the phone The fingerprint sensor they have is not bad, It's pretty quick, obviously not the quickest one out there. But they also include a feature that gives you face unlock. And this face unlock is terrible, I don't know why it's so bad But even in ideal lighting conditions it would often fail. And we're talking 30% failure rate and I tried setting it up multiple times. So I wasn't expecting Face ID from the iPhone, I wasn't expecting that but I thought it should at least work, most of the time. But it doesn't, I wouldn't rely on that. I wouldn't buy this phone for face unlock features. Let's talk about the CPU, it's a reasonably fast processor, bumps out decent benchmarks. Now obviously it's slower than the big flagships out there. But the overall performance is good playing games Multitasking, it feels fast I mean the 6GB of RAM it's gonna be nice, but i'm not super impressed Not that it's not good, it's just that there's so many cheap Phones right now that are just as fast as this so It doesn't really stick out as being an amazing performer or anything like that. But it's good. The screen is awesome. I'm really impressed by it, it's an AMOLED panel 5.99 inches so basically 6 inches, it's big It's bright it's colourful, it's one of the best if not the best Screen i've seen at the $200 price point, that being said I feel like I need to give some disclaimer of warning If you go on the website, the renders make it looks like this is a completely bezelless phone I mean look at this thing, what are they doing? They're using these white highlights or these reflections To disguise what the actual screen edge looks like, those images Are so heavily enhanced that when I got this Thing and I pulled it out of the box, I they sent me the wrong one, I was like This looks like nothing like what the images on the website looked like So be aware that it still is a decent looking phone but the renders Are lies. Okay, the battery life is good its a 4060 milliamp hour battery It's bigger than a lot of other phones, but the battery life is just good, it's not amazing or anything and this thing does not support quick charging of any sorts So it's a full 3 hours, actually a little bit more to charge this thing up from zero to full which is a long time The speaker's on the bottom, its a mono speaker and it doesn't sound particularly good. And there's also no headphone jack. But there's three really big things about this phone that bug me a lot. The first one is the camera, I was expecting a pretty crappy camera, because its a 200 dollar phone, and the Doogee mix 1 had a pretty bad camera. This one is, well it didn't disappoint. It's a bad camera. The Daylight photos are okay, you need to have a really steady hand though because there's no image stabilization but the lowlight photos are basically unusable. We saw stuff like this in the Doogee mix 1 And they haven't really changed all that much. The thing I find really weird is that there are two cameras on the back but the second one isn't used for telephoto, or monochrome or anything that I could find. I'm not even sure what the second camera is here for I hope tell that its not some kind of dummy camera. But regardless image quality is not good on either of the cameras in the front or the back. Well the front camera has a wide angle, which is kind of neat If you're into wide angle selfies, but again image quality is not great The other thing that really bugs me about this thing, is call quality and that's something that's pretty important for any kind of phone it's just.. not good call quality. Just bad speaker quality bad speaker volume, it's not great. but the thing that kills me the most about this phone, is the Wi-Fi signal. So it doesn't matter how good everything else on the phone is if it doesn't have a good Wi-Fi connection, it's just crap.                                 
 Hi how are you, Dave2D here, So 2017   Has been filled with many smartphones that we can choose   basically all the manufacturers out there managed to produce   High quality goods this year. And it is very difficult to make a video about them   because every time I find HP and try to make a video about it.   A month later another company will release a new smartphone   which is just as good as being so hard for me to   say "hey this is good, that's nice Eh wait that this is good"   so this is the most i like,   this is my top choice this year   Every HP in front of me this is   HP that I love really makenya. And little surprise to me how good this is   So I'll start   and at the end I'll choose the one I like best   in 2017. So let's start with Samsung Galaxy Note 8   HP is launched at a price   almost 1000 US dollars and   the first time I learned about the price. It is very disappointing karna   It's very expensive from what I think   Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 plus are very similar in usage   But Note 8 is different from these two phones   Now the price has gone down a bit   which already makes sense to me but this tetep is not my favorite HP because karna   If you buy now. I buy this now. I still pay   for stuff I've never used. And stuff I do not like too often   For example rich S Pen, ga never use. Tele Lenses in the back   also ga never use. And about the software. I'm not a fan   from software made by Samsung. In conclusion, HP is good overall   It's just not my favorite :). Okay let's move on   There is LGV30 here and this is the HP that it functions   I enjoy more than most Samsung phones   The idea is the same, with a thin bezel. But ergonomically   I love how this HP feels and I like it   function of both lenses. So this is wide lens and I prefer type i.   the rich like this. It's more useful for me   especially for taking pictures   yes but anyway, I still do not like the software   I now use google launcher, and I've tried also nova launcher   but still I can not make this HP rich android stock rich   still rich HP rich in HP. I mean   Some people may like, just baseball, conclusions   not my favorite HP this year. Next I have a Razer Phone   and this is HP that makes me very amazed   many very unique features that are completely different   120Hz screen. Speakers with excellent quality   Possibly the best current speaker for HP. But the price   700 US dollars, okay it's worth what you'll get   the price is not too expensive or lebay. But still   ga rich taste really attracted attention for me. Many features here are made for media consumption   and playing games. Which is very cool. But this HP does not have   headphone jack. I think I'm very left behind. Such as HP rich gini   Where are you used to plug the charger and headphone at the same time   karna you ngabisin batrenya very quickly. It would be very nice   If this HP can ngecas and tetep nyolokin headphones can   connected. which is highly unlikely. Conclusion   well. Good HP but not my favorite. I think   this HP has many cool and good features for most people   just not too good for me. OK then let's   take a look at Google Pixel 2, Google Pixel 2 XL   This is the HP I love very much, and   when this item is launched, many complain about the screen   but I never ngerasain tuh problem. I know this   ga as good as Samsung Galaxy Note 8 screen but yah   I'm happy to aja hell with the screen, ga never a fire screen problem, blue screen and part   but the price was $ 850   is a lot of money for this HP. Indeed this HP has   best camera in its class. just yah camera ga too   important for me, it's important it's just not the most important feature   it seems rich I paid for something that I do not need such as   A very clever assistant, a squeeze feature, it's just like   something cool but not   something I'll use every day. The conclusion of that HP   very good but not my favorite. OK next   Essential Phone. This HP? bro sis i have   great hope with this HP. I really love this HP. This HP   "oh this is a flame, I guess I've died all"   HP is launched at a price of 700 dollars which   I think it's too much (too expensive). I think if this HP in luncurin with the price of 500 dollars   (which is now worth the price) will definitely ...   sold out. one thing that is very unpopular from HP is its kemeranya   when this HP du luncurin, he has a camera with a quality that is too standard   The hardware is okay. And I have this sample item which one   my camera is better than the goods sold in the market. Which one   it took cukuo long time for the factory   make improvements and revisions to fix existing versions on the market   now the camera is so ugly   but many people do not like this HP, because   many bad reviews about this HP. the one that keeps me going   is the screen, is not OLED panel. So reply   you see another HP that uses OLED panel and see this phone again.   HP is going plasticity less good. HP itself is very sturdy   I like the ceramics behind him. I like the design without the bezel   it's just not my favorite this year. Okay last   before my favorite HP. This I have an iPhone X (ten). Well   this is HP so far. iPhone is waiting for the most   which I see all the time   maybe the previous iPhone 4 is very nge hype where   well this is also the most nge hype since the iPhone 4. and well   I like this HP but again the price   you will be shocked. This HP   Okay   the price of this HP ga   will affect people who really kepengen buy   this HP price will affect   the whole market. Next year because of HP this price 1000 US dollars   other companies are going "hey   Apple for HP for 1000 US dollars, yok we also make. so I'm not   would be surprised, if HP will come next year   the price will be close to 1000 US dollars. HP is giving the green light   for all companies to produce HP for a price   1000 US dollars and it kills me   HP is still okay, really expensive   Okay! finally this is my favorite HP   OnePlus 5T. Well When OnePlus 5 launches   I like his HP and this one is much nicer   more premium look than OnePlus 5   because the screen is large, bezel super thin   and rich plasticity I hold HP 900 US dollars but   which in fact is only worth 500 US dollars. I like this face detection feature on HP   I guess it's just a gimick, but it turns out it's very fast and very good   it certainly is not as safe as Face ID on iPhone X (ten)   which is more technology used to process Face ID   but this one is fast   and really easy to use. I like it!   other things I like about this HP  
hey how's it going Dave Toodee here so this is a can of coke and behind it is a can of Awesomeness this is the nebula capsule made by anchor it's a very small projector and I've tried a lot of mini projectors before the rift 6 the pico projectors like they're just there's always some kind of deficiency to the product to the point where I just don't enjoy using it this is the first thing that I've enjoyed thoroughly it's bright it's got good colors and it's just a really solid product hence the video now the three biggest issues have had with mini projectors are number one brightness they're usually just not bright enough for me secondly is the color of the image so it'll just project usually a very like desaturate or a flat looking image which i don't like watching and the third one a big one for me is sound there there's obviously fan noise that comes from these things because there's a little lamp in there and they got to cool it off which is fine but if their speakers aren't good and if they're not loud enough that fan just drones out everything else that you're trying to listen to this thing does not have any of those problems so this thing has your standard HDMI connection so you can connect any kind of media device through an HDMI cable right up to this thing and it also has a dongle with a USB connection so you can connect up a USB flash drive or whatever but the thing that makes this thing like so much better than most projectors most mini projectors is the software that's built into it this thing has Netflix YouTube Plex a whole bunch of media services available right on the device you don't need to connect anything third-party or even a phone to this thing it just literally takes that service streams it and then projects it onto a surface all in the size of a coke can like how cool is that right okay another thing I like about this thing is that the speakers sound way better than I thought they would now a lot of mini projectors have this issue with just having a mono speaker and just projecting in one direction this they call it 360 sound I wouldn't go as far as to call it that but it's just a nice sounding speaker system that you can kind of be wherever you want around this thing and it'll still sound good it's a 5 watt speaker not huge not amazing but it's clean there's no buzzing there's no hissing it's just clean audio at a good volume the lower frequencies are missing it's not great with bass but considering the size of this thing I mean it's probably physically impossible to get a good bass out of this thing so I'm happy considering what this thing is the fan noise is actually pretty average to me I wouldn't consider it louder or than most of the many projectors that I've used but because of the bigger and better speakers I feel like it kind of compensates for fan noise the battery life on this thing they claim for hours on the website I'm getting actually a little bit more than that but I think it depends on what you're doing with the device so I'm able to get a little bit more than four hours with the thing at max brightness but I'm streaming video if you have this thing connected to a USB device or some kind of physical drive that's feeding the data to the machine I think it's a little bit less but I'm getting around four hours of streamed content so the image is bright way brighter than any of the other mini projections that I've tried it's rated at 100 ANSI lumens or a hundred an SI lumens I'm not sure exactly how they describe that thing but this is literally double the brightness of your average mini projector often they come in at 50 the colors on this thing are also really good so that's something that a lot of mini projectors screw up on it's just really muted colors this thing nice colors it's a little bit oversaturated but considering what you're doing with this thing like you're not watching these like super color accurate images this thing has a nice color profile it has vertical Keystone correction so you can have it tilted or even use it on your bed now there's one issue with the image and that is its resolution so before I looked up the resolution on this thing when I was just looking at the image on the wall I always assumed that this thing was like 720p maybe even Tandy Peet like my I can't really tell when it comes to projection because they're never super super sharp this thing is actually a 480p projection and it's on paper that's terrible like that's straight-up pathetic I think for a lot of people they're like 840 P screw that not interested but visually it looks totally acceptable to me if you're looking for like a 4k super crisp image then don't even look at these products but if you're just looking for like a large screen with decent image quality that's super portable this thing fits the ticket okay in terms of the screen size you can get up to 100 inches that's what they say but you got to be in a really dark room to project it like that but I can get like a 62 maybe 70 inch image without going to a super dark area so what else is that there's a remote it's like kind of your standard remote and there's also an app that you can use on your phone to control the device and it's surprisingly good there's no hiccups it's not janky and there is mouse control it's actually a pretty good app there's some things I don't like about this thing the big one for me is frame rate so I don't mind the resolution loss because visually I just it's not that important to me at this screen size and at this viewing distance but the reduced framerate limits this thing for my use so if I'm watching twitch or even playing games I'm used to just watching things at 60 frames per second this thing is not I want to say it's like 24 or maybe even 30 frames per second it's not really listed in the instruction manual so I'm not sure what it is but it's definitely not 64 inch or second another thing I don't like is that you can't log into the YouTube app so maybe they'll fix that in the future but in its current iteration because you can't log in you don't see your subscription feed or anything like that you there's still a search history so you can kind of see the videos that you've looked up in the past but there's no custom feed in the YouTube app right now okay my favorite thing about this device though is seriously this thing paired with one of these things those like retro gaming consoles from Nintendo this kind of combination is super fun like this is already a portable system they can bring around do whatever you want with it and then you plug it up to the projector and now you can play big screen Mario Cart wherever the heck you want it's freaking awesome so this is a device that is gonna be different for everyone who uses it some people want something like this some people want to stream for the phone through airplay cast or Android whatever it is there's just so much utility with this thing and I think for a lot of people it's a really good pick up so this thing starts at 350 bucks it's obviously not cheap but it's got a lot of utility and for the right person it's a really cool device okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it subs we loved it see you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here, so these are some new speakers from Razer They're called the Razer Nomo and they start at $99 which is relatively inexpensive for a pair of decent speakers now they come in three variants They have the base $99 version They have this one which is 150 bucks and they're adding RGB lighting as well as a DAC And then they have their super premium model which is their 400 or 500 dollar model? It's called the Noma Pro and I was able to hear all of them at CES and Obviously the 500 dollar one sounds the best has got THX certification all that stuff But I feel like these ones here are where it's at these sound really good for the money, so what makes these things different? Right away is their look? If these don't look like your standard bookshelf speakers like if you go with the clips Pro media or logitech speakers are just your standard Bookshelf speakers they have a certain kind of dull look to them these don't look like that these definitely have some gamer DNA in it It looks more modern to me with a pretty clean aesthetic now the build quality on this thing is I mean it's your average Kind of build quality it is plastic. It's not like wood or anything like that, but it's made well There's three inch drivers up at the front and then there's a base port on the back and this one here the $150 nomic Romo has RGB lighting that you can control in their software now You can do some crazy stuff in there Or you can just keep it basic and use one of the profiles just to add some color to your setup it is nice to have that availability though in terms of connectivity you get your power connection and then on my model because it's the Gnome of chroma it has a DAC so you get used B connectivity And you have your regular auxilary analog connection and in your headphone jack the controls are really simple. There's two knobs There's a volume dial and then there's a base dial in it first one. I was checking this thing I was like what they only have base tile like there's no treble controls, but the way that they've done It is actually really smart the base control has automatic gain so if you increase or lower the base it Automatically adjusts the EQ of the sounds of the base will scale Distortion free it's actually really nice to have your base cranked up your volume cranked up and everything still sounds clear So how do these things sound honestly they sound really good? I kind of expected them to sound not great because it's a razer product right not that it would be bad But razer doesn't do speakers. They're not known for speakers so when they bring this thing out. It's like it looks cool But are they really gonna sound good For $99 I really like the audio quality from these But where they shine is in games the positional audio and these things are excellent those higher Frequencies are really pronounced and clean and you can hear footsteps well I don't have a way to showcase the stereo separation properly with my mics But I'm very comfortable gaming on this thing now Compared to other speakers that have used for gaming like the clips Pro media or the audio engine a 2 plus or the kanto yu6? These aren't like the best sounding things out there That's all I'm trying to say, but they sound really really good for the price And I really like how these things handle the higher frequencies when you lower the bass you can really hear player locations on these speakers Okay, there's a few things that I don't like about the noma speaker the first is that it's a little top-heavy I understand that that's the look. That's the design aesthetic They've gone for but I wish the base plate was a little bit wider because right now It's got this tendency to wobble a little bit if you hit it backwards switch a little bit dangerous the other thing I don't love is that the auxilary and the headphone jack are on the back of the speaker And I understand that for bookshelf speakers. That's pretty normal, but because these are gaming speakers You kind of expect them to be closer up to the front so you can just access them easier But that's just what we have here and the last thing is I don't like how the chroma version is $50 more a lot of money for just RGB lighting and a USB connection which I don't know it doesn't really make that much sense To me okay overall great speakers for 99 bucks I feel like these are these aren't the speakers to beat And I'm saying these are like you know the best speakers out there for 99 bucks But if you like something that looks a little bit different looks pretty cool And has that way to complement your setup with different colors and stuff you should check these things out, okay? Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs. If you liked it subs if you loved it. See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. So I want to do a quick video on the Pixel 2 XL. This isn't a review I feel like there's a lot of really good reviews out there particularly Márques's that's an excellent video if you haven't seen it But I wanted to touch on something that I feel is The issue surrounding this phone, which is its screen, so let's talk about a couple of the good things It's an excellent phone if you're interested in stock Android phones like this is It's everything you would imagine the Pixel 2 XL to be and maybe a little bit more because the software is so good. The one Thing that sticks out in particular for me is how good the software is on the camera. It's a single lens and the camera in general is really good But I want to focus on the big thing that is for me, the screen. now This phone if it didn't have the controversy surrounding its screen I think a lot of publications and reviewers would consider this to be the perfect Android phone because there's so much that this thing does right, but because of the screen There is I guess doubt in the consumers mind as to whether or not they should purchase it as to whether or not this is actually a good phone because the screen is such an important part of your phone experience you use your screen every time you use your Phone and a lot of people would consider it to be the most important part of a phone So there's three issues that are surrounding this screen the first is the issue of Burnin on the screen some people are noticing that just residual artifacts on their screen from the UI and this is actually a very common Issue with OLED screens, it doesn't matter what panel you're using if it's an OLED panel There is a risk of burnin this has existed since the beginning of OLED panels on phones as for my particular phone I don't have any burning yet, but it's only been used for a couple of weeks. I feel like over time It's gonna pop up and when it does I'm just gonna live with it because almost every single phone that I've used that had an OLED display has developed some kind of Artefacts over time that's just the nature of the panel's now the good thing is that Google has addressed this if kind of like Squash people's fear of this by giving two year warranties on these phones, which is crazy like I don't think there's been any other phone It could be wrong, but I don't think there is any other phone that comes with a stock warranty of two years on Hardware That's amazing so if you have issues down the line I feel like Google is going to care of it the other issue that they addressed is the washed out colors and I would agree the Pixel to excel launched with a very flat color profile and even as someone who prefers more realistic colors and just not overly saturated Stuff I still found this one a little bit dull So it's nice that Google is addressing it now the last thing want to talk about is the whole Blue shift when you tilt it, and this is obviously a real issue I think a lot of people are getting this right out of the box and Here's the thing I think it's another thing that's been kind of over sensationalized because of how good everything else on this film is people just want to find something to pick up out on this phone and the color shift is It's there, but so many phones have some kind of color shift now I think there is some variation depending on the unit that you have like there are some defective units out there Maybe that exhibit in a more Pronounced color shift when you tilt it my unit is pretty decent and when it compared to any of the flagships here So this is like a samsung s8 the v30 like they all have some degree of color shift And I wouldn't say that the pixel to excel at least not my unit is Significantly worse than the other phones not that it doesn't exist because it is present But it's not terrible or anything at least not to me Now the reason why all this matter is this total discussion about the screen being imperfect is because the price of the phone is $850, it's not cheap and at this price point I guess the consumer expects some degree of perfection, not that perfect phones exist, but they want this screen to be as good as possible and therein lies the problem With Pixel phones with Pixel hardware in general you're paying for the amazing ecosystem that the software provides. You're not paying for a top end Hardware if you're looking for the top line Hardware There's a ton of other options out there to choose from but you're not going to get that with Pixel phones So if you're purchasing this phone, make sure you're purchasing for the right reason because if you're not, if you're trying to get like amazing hardware You're in for a bad time, but if you're going for a softer ride, this is a great phone. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it.
See you guys next time. 
Hey how is it going? Dave2D here. So this is a video on three completely different setups. They have nice aesthetics, they're great performers, but they're super expensive. Okay, first is the Razer Blade Pro Version 2. It's similar to the Razer Blade Pro I reviewed a few months ago, it's still running the 1080, it still has the mechanical RGB keyboard and the trackpad on the right, with a programmable scroll wheel. But it has faster RAM and overclockable CPU and THX certification. So, these speakers are amazing, they're as clear as the new MacBook speakers, but it has stronger bass and they can get super loud. The 17 inch display is also THX certified. It's excellent for content creation and gaming. It's color calibrated at the factory, it's got 4k resolution, it's bright and it's running G-Sync at 60 Hertz. It's not the quietest laptop and it's not the most powerful and with the new overclockable CPU, when you crank it up, the temperatures get pretty hot, but for gaming and video editing this is one of the best laptops on the market. For $4,000 though I would never call this a value oriented purchase, it's a very steep price tag, but it's awesome. Okay, next up is a desktop PC, this is a bare-bone's pre-built PC from ZOTAC. It's 5.85 liters in volume, it's really small. It's running a core i7 7700, a GTX 1080, but all the other stuff, you got to supply yourself. It costs $1,800 and I know you can build a custom PC for like $7, that would crush this thing in terms of performance for the money, but it wouldn't be this small and it wouldn't be this quiet. And those two things are pretty important to me. Inside it's running a samsung PM961, a 500 gig SSD and 32 gigs of RAM from Corsair. The BIOS gives you a good amount of fan control, you can keep the system running incredibly quiet if you want, and it will ramp up the fans, if you're doing heavier stuff. Gaming and video editing performance is surprisingly good, considering how compact the system is. The display is the 8K panel from Dell, the UP3218K. It has excellent color gamut and accuracy and it's crazy expensive. It retails for $5,000, the resolution is nuts. It's obviously aimed at the professional content creator, who's working with really high-res video or photo files and I've got to be honest: I'm not part of that demographic, but the screen is awesome. The camera I use is a Red Scarlet W. It shoots in 5K and before this display, I'd never seen the full 5K image before from my camera. At least not on one screen. I'd had to like zoom in and scope around to kind of see all the pixels, but now I can see all 5K. Regardless it's a really nice screen to edit videos with, it is in fact the sharpest display I ever used. It does need a pretty beefy graphics card to run it and you're using two DisplayPort cables to make it happen. 8K gaming is actually not too bad on the Zotac. It's pointless, though. I mean, I would never play games at this resolution, but it is viable for some games, if you're curious. I'm running some speakers from Kanto. They sound really good. These aren't particularly expensive speakers, but I like them because of their aesthetic: matte gray, clean design and they also connect over Bluetooth, so you have less wires. The keyboard is also wireless with Cyan GMK key caps and I also have a white Razer DeathAdder. There's one issue that I have with that setup and it's a problem that most people wouldn't have, but because I'm old and I have a kid and I have a pretty intensive job outside of Youtube, I don't like having that gaming PC around. So, I have terrible self control when it comes to PC games and I found over the years that the best way for me to kind of curve that addiction is to just not have a gaming PC. So, this is the setup I like the most: the trash can Mac Pro. It's three and a half years old, it's still stupidly overpriced, but fortunately I can't play Overwatch in Mac OS. It is the quietest desktop I've ever used and it's also one of the fastest that I've used for Adobe Premiere. It's running a 10 core CPU with 64 gigs of RAM and that's why I still use it. There's nothing on the market right now that has a five and a half liter case that crushes video edits like this and is also virtually silent. Now, as for why I like cases that are so small and so quiet... like... I don't know... I'm weird! I know most of you won't appreciate that kind of stuff, most of you don't care about things like that, but it is important to me. The display is the 38UC99 from LG. This thing goes for $1500. This is one of the more reasonably priced items in the video, but it's also my favorite display for edits. I actually prefer this thing over the 8K panel and for the stuff that I do, I think this display is perfect. It's bright, excellent color gamut and color accuracy, there's enough of a curve to give you a bit of immersion when you're watching videos, but it's not too distracting and it has USB-C input and the speakers in here aren't bad. I actually don't use speakers when I have it connected up to the Mac, just to keep things as clean as possible. But that's it, I hope you guys enjoyed this video, I mean there was no sponsor to this thing, there was no even purpose to this video, it's just to showcase three really cool setups that I've been able to use and I thought were really impressive, in case some of you have really big budgets and you want to go ham on buying a computer, well now you have three more options. 
  Hey, how's it going Dave2D here so if you know, me or if you follow My channel you might recognize this place. This is my condo. Now Dyson reached out to me. They were awesome enough to sponsor this video. Dyson has announced today, March 6 that they're no longer designing those traditional upright vacuums. So those yellow Bald things that were really iconic when i was growing up. James Dyson is announcing that they're Not designing any more new ones. Instead they're making something like This. The cyclone v10 absolute so this is supposed to replace those upright Vacuums. It's fully cordless, it's highly, maneuverable, and it's very flexible but, there's a problem to this whole scenario. My place is clean I'm not gonna pretend like it's super dirty just to make a video. This is just how I keep my condo. It's a clean place so I Thought, what is the best way for me to showcase what this thing can do? What's the best way to kind of like Dirty this place up to make it worthy of a vacuum. In front of me are two fans. These are.. I haven't tried this yet. This is going to be a bit of an experiment. I have fans and a bucket of dust, and I'm going to pour a lot of dusts on to these fans, and hopefully coat this place with a fine layer of dust. Okay here we go. I'm gonna go for the far fan first, and then the close fan and...(looks at dust) (realizes his mistake) Holy, smokes. I gotta be honest This, is way worse than i thought it would be. Oh my god. Okay Cyclone, v10 this thing has up to a 60-minute battery, it's got whole machine hepa filtration and the bin size is significantly larger than the v6 or the v8 that i've used in the past. I mean let's just put this thing to work It's actually doing a Decent job on the pull on the push it's leaving stuff behind i think it's. Like, bigger Chunks, but I'll just go out. And just pull it in nice So I've done most of the floor but, I want to switch attachments because I feel like This, tool here is a better device for cleaning the couch, oh? My, god there's like rocks on this thing So i've been, going for about 30 minutes now i've done the couch I've done most of the floor and the battery Still says full, well it says three out of the three bars so I don't know. I guess that's good but I'm gonna Keep, going I'm gonna switch to this tool. It's I guess a, soft bristle and I'm gonna Use this on the computer and the stuff on the coffee table Now the bin is in line with the rest of the vacuum so you're getting better airflow. With this new design Well I thought this thing, would be dead by now i feel like the battery should have, worn out long time ago. I'm going nonstop for about an hour to the point Where my fingers are tired. I think that's actually something. I wish they would add like a switch that you could flick without having to squeeze The trigger. I like this thing a lot. I feel like for most people you could easily replace your vacuum like Your, big quarter vacuums with, this thing it's just like a, big vacuum but, super portable and just Wireless; cordless that's awesome huge battery huge bin. Smaller motor has just been way more efficient is. I like this thing okay if you guys Are interested i'll drop a, link down below you can check out their store at www.dyson.com hope you guys enjoyed this video and seriously i'm so glad for this vacuum clean, this place up properly Because it was a total, mess and i was actually worried this Was me a giant, disaster but cleaned up nicely okay hope you guys, enjoyed this video thumbs We liked it subs you loved it see you guys next time 
hey how's it going Dave 2d here so the other day I put up a poll on Twitter just to kind of see what it setups you guys were using and the most common answer was the Android phone with a Windows laptop or desktop and I kind of expected that but the thing that I thought was interesting was how few people were using Android phones with Mac OS as their operating system on their computer so basically an Android phone with an apple computer and I thought it was strange because just so many of my friends and family use that as their primary setup it was just a little bit strange but I thought I would make a video to kind of showcase the stuff that I'm using in March of 2018 so I guess I'll start with the phone the phone amusing right now is the pixel to excel this is a relatively recent switch if you ask me three weeks ago it would have been the iPhone 10 but two things number one the camera on the pixel to excel is just I think it's the best camera in the smartphone market right now and the other thing that's been bugging me recently is I picked up the Apple home pod pretty good looking device and I also been using the Google home max for quite a while now since it launched and I'm not gonna do a review these I like this a lot and I will say that this is a cooler looking device and it sounds pretty good I would actually see it sounds better than the Google home max but I really don't like how aggressive they've been with the whole anticompetitive stuff like the fact you can't you Spotify with it and like there's just so much a dislike about this thing and the fact that Siri is as bad that it is compared to Google assistant it just makes me not want to use this so it just makes it an easier choice for me to use this as my primary phone the Google pixel to excel okay the computer that I use the most frequently right now is this the Dell XPS 15 it's not brand new or anything this thing's actually from early 2017 but it's just such a well-built machine and the screen is awesome one of thin bezels I like this thing a lot now I feel like it's due for refresh relatively soon the 8th gen H processors will probably hit this chassis in the spring or summer and yeah I'm looking forward to that but this is my main laptop the other laptop that I use occasionally is a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the touch bar and I just use that to go to access some of the stuff at work that requires Mac OS ok next up is a battery pack this is from Ankur no no the model name but 26800 Power Core Plus that's a mouthful but the thing that I like about this thing is the USBC so uses use BCE to charge and it can also output through use BC so you can fill up your laptop your phone through that port and you can use the charger from those devices to fill it back up it's really convenient now the backpack that I use for all of this is a backpack from a company called oh this is this is gonna show sure it's made by a company called cote ACL and it's a French company so I'm sure screwed up the name but it's a pretty big backpack that can hold a ton of stuff and it's just a nice looking backpack that I chose because of its aesthetics more than anything else okay backpack done what else do we got in the backpack I've emptied it out just for this video but the stuff will normally go around with include the MX anywhere 2 s so I think this is literally the best travel Mouse available it's small lightweight long battery life awesome Mouse I also travel with this this is a backup Drive Western Digital and the reason why I like this drive over the Seagate drives that I used to use is simply because of the rubber feet on the bottom it gives you a little bit of traction on your table wherever you place it and I like that I also travel always with these cables if you guys have seen them my videos before it's they're called chef phone or something and there's just awesome utility they're like 9 bucks you get every single charging cable that you could possibly need and it's just something I always have in my bag the external drive that I use the most frequently is this thing it's the SSD to go from angel bird it's a smaller faster better Drive than the really common Samsung t3 or t4 is the the real reason why I bought this was because of the blue color I know I'm a loser ok headphones that I use most frequently h7 Wireless B&amp;O I like these a lot they're not cheap but I think I've tried a lot of wireless headphones and these are my favorite again aesthetic plays a role in these these look really clean but they also sound excellent so other stuff that I use is this thing it's a flash drive it's got USB C on one end use BA on the other hand I have this around all the time just in case I need a flash drive I think that's basically it for tech I have a whole bunch of knives in there hope I have this this is a Gerber knife it's by far my favorite small knife I like small knives I like to have them around but this is my favorite one because you can replace the blade always stays sharp and it's just very compact very inexpensive the knife that I use in my studio most often is this thing it's the James chapter knife and you can't get this anymore unfortunately but it's like a limited edition I got it because of the blue like I'm all about that blue you guys know that that's well there's this this isn't really tech we've kind of like devolving into this non tech channel at this point books I use one for work one for YouTube it's just and a pencil these are poppin books different colors I like that and then a mechanical pencil from Pentel it's called the graph gear 1000 I feel like I've shown this before in some video or another but I really like this pencil and obviously like these books you'll see these in all my videos of different colors and stuff sunglasses from Ray Ban obviously they're teal cameras that I'm using I shoot off a red scarlet W this is like my regular camera and I'm actually recently trying out the Canon 1dx mark - I really like that camera way more than I thought it would it's not meant for video only it's primarily a stills camera I think but I've shot some b-roll with it I really like what I've seen with it so far but that's basically it this is the stuff that I'm using right now in March of 2018 okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it subsea we loved it see you guys next time 
Hello, and welcome to another episode of wireless mice. Now, Dave 2D here, and this is a pile of wireless mice. You know, I was cleaning my office, and I was like 'I have a lot of wireless mice'- And these are ones that I like; there's a lot of other ones, that I've used that I never kept around These are the ones I like and I want to do a quick video- Kinda talking about why I like them and maybe one of these might be right for you, okay! These mice are... Actually most of them are Bluetooth-enabled. I really feel like, for laptops- for mobility You just got to use a Bluetooth mice. If you have one of those dongles that plug in, you're doing it wrong. If you're using a wired mouse, unless you're playing games, you're definitely doing it wrong. Pick up a wireless mouse It's, there's some really good ones some of them are very inexpensive. All right. We're going to start off with Not this one. This is not Bluetooth. The rest [of them] are- okay, this one is a really good wireless mouse, but you need like a receiver And that's just not really great for laptop users, so screw that thing; that's a Razer something-or-other. The good ones are here, okay first. Let's talk about This one: Razer Orochi. This is a pretty unique looking mouse, like if Batman had a mouse it would probably be this one. It's got great tracking but battery life isn't good and I feel like the shape of it requires a very particular- fingertip grip, I like it, and it's not too expensive But I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. The next mouse is- let's go with this one. This is a Bluetooth mouse that is very inexpensive. It's I think $12 on Amazon there's another version to this that's $10 which uses a dongle Which is actually this one if you don't have a Bluetooth-enabled computer for whatever reason or if you're comfortable using dongles you can save $2 but just get the Bluetooth one if you can. It's literally the Cheapest mouse that I've used that I enjoy. it's made by a company called JeTech comfortable to hold and It can handle a bunch of different grips and the sensor is surprisingly good. the one thing I dislike about it, is the battery it uses a single double-A But it's a pain in the ass to remove and install it you got to pull on the battery Super hard to pop it out But for 12 bucks. I still recommend it. It's a good mouse next up is the Apple mouse. this thing SUCKS I don't even know why it's in here. I had it I just, I don't recommend this for anyone it looks very pretty, but it's a terrible mouse I think apple needs to make a better mouse. Next up We have the MX master mice This is the old one (left) this is the new one (right). It's a great mouse and even though it looks big It's comfortable to use with small hands It has a side scroll lots of buttons Excellent sensor the new version looks and feels pretty much identical to the old one, it has a couple new features Like higher DPI Longer battery life, and just mute conclude logitech flow, so that's a feature that allows you to use the mouse across multiple computers Not just the cursor between screens We can actually transfer files and stuff between the two computers, and when I first use it I thought it was super cool. It actually feels very magical But I just never use it and I'm someone who uses multiple computers every single day I have two computers on my table all the time running, so I don't know if I'm not using it I feel like most people wouldn't use that feature It also has a small version of this thing, the  MX anywhere mouse So this is the old one the Mx anywhere 2 (left) and this is a new one the 2s(right) same idea though awesome sensor Good enough to play shooters casually. long battery life I like these a lot and these MX anywhere mice have this side scroll that the big ones don't Ok last two, Microsoft makes a lot of mice and some of them are terrible but most of them are pretty good my two favorite are these two the Microsoft Surface mouse and the Sculpt Comfort mouse. I like the surface mouse a lot. It's super simple Maybe a little too simple for some people But I love the minimal aesthetic on it. the one thing I dislike about this thing as a travel mouse though Is that the battery cover is magnetically attached So it pops off pretty easily, it can fall out in your bag if it pops off And that's kind of annoying the other one is a sculpt comfort mouse and I got to be honest I think this thing looks pretty ugly It's very comfortable to hold but it's not a pretty mouse. the windows button on the side is touch sensitive So you can scroll, up scroll down I mean, it just adds a lot of functionality and you can press it to launch the windows button It's inexpensive and the battery lasts a long time. but my favorite feature about this mouse is actually the horizontal scroll This is one of the cheapest mice out there with a reliable Horizontal scroll that works right out of the box, you don't need drivers, You don't need software. Which is really nice. now That's not a feature that everyone uses, but if you like video editing, or you have big database files or excel files Horizontal scroll is awesome. These are all really good mice, and you can't go wrong choosing any of them but if I had to pick one as my universal recommendation for laptop users It would be this one, the MX anywhere 2. so this is the older one the 2s is quite a bit more expensive I think that's like 40% more expensive this one's so much cheaper, and it's exactly the same in terms of user experience It's supposed to have lower DPI and smaller battery But I'm charging it just as frequently and the tracking feels exactly the same between the two and I'm also not using logitech flow So yeah, this mouse is a good choice for a lot of people. Now, There's two other things want to bring up, mouse pads the first one is this travel mouse Pad from razer It's called the razer Kabuto. It's basically a really thin sheet of Neoprene It's a cloth surface mousepad that you can roll up or keep in between the screen of most laptops. It doesn't fit Macbooks though the tolerance on those are a little bit tighter. For macbooks, I recommend this thing. It's made by 3M It's a hard surface with great tracking the bottom is sticky to give it some grip wherever you want to use it so you can place it behind your laptop or Whatever. It's not taped though It's the microstructure material that you can just rinse every time it gets gunky or anything, but yeah I've had this for two years and it looks basically brand new Ok, hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time I've linked all of these mice and these mouse pads down below in the description ok 
Hey, how is it going? Dave2d here. So, these are some 2017 MacBooks with the KabyLake chips and this are some 2016 MacBooks with the SkyLake chips. And originally I wanted to do individual reviews for all of these. And then I realized, would just be a better video if I kinda compared and contrasted all of these? So, you guys had a better idea on which one of these to purchase. If any of them at all. a brief summary of the new generation of MacBooks. So, this has aluminum build, fantastic build quality, even better than the previous 2015 body, screens are all nice and bright. The Pro models in particular, get really bright. So, the keyboards are now rocking second generation butterfly switches all round, that includes the 12" MacBook, and to me that's a much nicer feeling keyboard than the first generation. The speakers are really good and And everytime I mention this there is Apple hater that comes out in the comments "No, bro, product X or product Y has better speakers" No, Apple has literally the BEST laptop speakers in the market right now. Whather you like or you hate them, it's just the facts. 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here and this is a video on what I feel like are the best backpacks for laptops or tech or just anything you would put in a backpack. So as a male I feel like backpacks are pretty important to me because they're like one of very few items that we get to showcase a sense of style or whatever it is; like we have our clothing, we have our shoes, but those you can switch in and out every day but the backpack, it's pretty permanent, you only have one or two at a time and they last a long time so you want to choose one that you actually enjoy wearing you want to choose one that actually looks good. What you don't want to do is choose a backpack that's like a tech backpack that's super ugly just because it's a tech backpack. You don't want to do that. You want to get something you actually like the look of and you actually feel proud wearing to school or work whatever it is. So in front of me are Herschel backpacks, this is not a sponsored video, they didn't send me any of these I purchased three of them over the years and the other ones I borrowed from my friends and co-workers just so I could make this video. Now understand that this pile of bags is not an exhaustive list of what they have. They have probably 15, 20 styles: this is like five of them, so go to their website if you want to see more, but these are the ones that I particularly like. Okay, let's start with this one: The Heritage this was actually one of the very first bags I got from them, it's designed for 15-inch laptops, so any kind of normal sized 15-inch laptop will fit in here: XPS 15, MacBooks, any of the thin ones will obviously fit, but if you've got like an ultra thick gaming laptop, it's going to be a little bit difficult. It's a really simple pack, it doesn't have internal pockets or anything you have the front pouch and the laptop slot in the back but that's it: it holds a lot of stuff, but it doesn't separate them into different compartments or anything. now the one that I have here is a little bit older. You won't be able to find this exact model, but you'll be able to find a ton of other colors on their website. If you're looking for something with a few more features, it would be this one, the Pop Quiz, this is one of the more popular bags, and if I had to choose one blindly from the whole Herschel collection It would probably be this one for just the average person. Again this comes in a ton of color options, and it's designed for a 15-inch laptop It has that padded material again for the laptop, but this one has this elastic which helps it stretch a bit more so if you have some bigger laptops this might fit it a little better. It also has a couple front pouches and an inner pocket thing. Now one of the common features of the super ugly tech backpacks out there is that they'll include a battery into their backpack and they'll sell it to you. They'll sell this $100 or $150 ugly backpack and they'll call it a tech backpack just because there's a battery in it so what I think is better is to get your own battery pack, this one's from Anker, and this backpack has a slot on the inside, you keep the battery in there along with some cables. I use these octopus looking cables and whenever I need to charge something, I just connect it up And I'm good to go. So I'll link all this stuff in the video description if you're interested in building your own kind of battery pack system: it's pretty simple. The next pack is similar to the Pop Quiz, it's a little bit less boxy, it's called the Settlement. It's a little cheaper, but the front area only has one zippered area, it's not two zippers and the inside laptop area has no padding it's just a separate section. If you have a sleeve for your laptop it's no problem, but if you don't, I feel like you have to be a little more careful about how you toss your bag around. This pack is actually the one that I use the most right now. The inside area has a slot you can put your battery in there, just like the Pop Quiz, but yeah simple backpack, and I like the look of it. The next one's a little bit more expensive It's called the Mammoth this one is designed for 13-inch laptops, but they make a bigger one that's designed for 15-inch laptops, and this whole pack is just more streamlined. It's made with a more technical water-resistant material, and it also has a rain cover. There's a front pouch and then some pouches on the side, but this one's pretty simple if you want a more technical looking pack that looks pretty clean. This could be a good pickup. Another one that I like is the Parker and this pack is actually the one that I like the most in terms of its looks, nothing too fancy. The front pouch is flush with the pack it holds a 15-inch laptop but like the Settlement I showed earlier it also doesn't have much padding in the laptop area. It has two side pouches, and the front pouch is water sealed, but it's not super spacious like there's space below the zipper, but not above it. I really like the look of this pack, and that's why I purchased it but if you have a ton of stuff to carry this may not be a good fit. Okay, the last one here is a Messenger bag, it's called the Pop-Quiz Messenger, and I normally like Messenger bags, but I don't love this one. So this one's a little bit bulkier it's got a padded area for a 15-inch laptop, and this is actually a bag that I borrowed from someone who's had it for over a year, so it looks a little bit worn. There's a lot of space on the inside, but maybe a little too much. I like my Messenger bags just more streamlined and more clean; this has a lot of room and it holds a well-protected laptop but it's just a little too big for me. But if you're interested in Messenger bags, Herschel makes some as well. Now I looked into the warranty and it seems like there's a lifetime warranty for these bags, which is kind of cool these bags aren't cheap so the peace of mind is nice. In terms of the overall experience with these bags I mean the reason why I made this video is because I've enjoyed using them over the years: they last, they look good, they protect your laptop, so if you're interested in them, there's links to all this stuff down below. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video: thumbs if you liked, it subs if you loved it. See you guys next time 
    Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here! This is something very special from Acer, it's the Predator 21X. So this box has a laptop in it. It's huge. It's the biggest, it's the heaviest, it's the most expensive laptop in the world. And I normally don't unbox things, but because this one's kinda special, I'd though I'd share the experience with you. [Sick gainz] This is so big. I don't know why they needed such a large box. *Wow.* Okay. Oh my f***... this is so heavy! *Laughing.* Oh my god. Okay. I gotta see this, I gotta see what it looks like. Okay, this is surprisingly heavy. I knew it would be heavy, but this heavier than I thought it would be. Okay. Now I'm going to put this aside for just two seconds, while I look at the inside. Let's see what else is in here. This looks like a weapons case, like if I like, went to a weapons dealer, and he showed me what I was going to buy, this is what it would look like. What is this?! Cool. We have a trackpad. Oh, it's got a numberpad on the bottom. But it's like a trackpad/numberpad. Okay, you must be able to switch that in and out. You get... ...pamphlets. Oh no, it's keys. Aghh, this is so cool! Okay, I'm assuming this has removable WASD keys. And a removable space bar, maybe for, like, I don't know, we'll see. That's pretty cool. I should take this stuff out, 'cause what I'm going to--plug it up in a minute. We get two very large AC adapters to power this thing. I want to see what this looks like on the inside. 'Cause this is special. Holy smokes, you could get a serious workout just lifting this thing... ...all the time. Ohh... kay. I love the blue keys. This keyboard-- it's so weird! Seeing this type of keyboard in a laptop. Like this is like your regular desktop keyboard. And it's a mechanical-- I think it's mechanical. Feels... It could be like a... a Cherry Brown, or like a Brown switch? This feels like a really nice keyboard, and it's weird to have this kind of key travel and this type of tactility. In a laptop? Are you kidding me?! Okay, this is cool. I though this would be a sticker, but it's not. This looks like it's, like, painted right in. Okay, look at this. Limited edition, 17 out of 300. That's pretty cool. Okay, this shows you how you can use... ...this thing. So you can... okay I get it. So you just plug it up. Oh it's magnetic! Ohh! That satisfying click. Does it come out? Okay, and you can just flip it. When you want numberpad, and when you want... ...trackpad. Okay, I need to boot this up. Now I didn't go through the exterior features while I opened this, because quite frankly, I was, like, super excited to just boot it up and see it. But now that I've looked at this for a second, the build quality is so good, there's no play or flex on any parts of this laptop. The screen is probably one of the most unique features on this thing, and it's a curved screen, and I've never actually used a gaming laptop that had a curved screen. This might be the first one of its existence. The whole reason why you have curved screens is to give you that extra level of immersion in games. But the color accuracy and brightness on this thing are fantastic. The other thing that's really cool is that it's a refresh rate of 120Hz. Games are going to look really good on this thing. My only suggestion if you happen to be one of the 300 people that get one of these, is to do this to your keys. It's perfect, now it's, like, customized to the way that your hand naturally rests. There's an eye tracking thing down here, I've never been a user of Tobii eye tracking. I've seen people, like, play games directly off of this, but I've never tried it myself. So... it says caution over here, but I'm going to crack it open. I should power this down. Okay, we're going in. I'm curious to see what's inside this thing. Uhhhhhhhh, am I giving this too much pressure? I mean, it's *only* $9,000. Aghh, it's coming apart, yes! We're in. Hard drive. 2 RAM sticks. I'm going to see the underside now. Four M2 slots, two more sticks of RAM, WiFi card. So the inside's pretty simple to access, if you need to get in there. So you're able to run a lot of storage on this thing. 5 drive bays, you probably won't need any kind of external storage. The Predator 21X uses two AC adapters, each one of these is 330 watts, it's a lot of juice going through here. And they both connect into this rubber housing, which kinda keeps it in one package. I'm going to port some specs, I'm not going to go into too much detail, but this is as loaded as a laptop gets. It's beyond impressive. In terms of the speakers, they don't sound bad, but I think for a laptop this size, I had unrealistic expectations, I kinda thought it would sound amazing. They do get louder than your average laptop, though. The SLI GTX 1080s are incredibly powerful. This is the stuff that dream desktops are made of, and then when you put it into a laptop form, it becomes even crazier. I ran some benchmarks, just to see how it would compare, it performs like a crazy powerful desktop, it's insane how much horsepower this thing has. Alright, I want to play some games. Let's put this thing to the test. The framerate on this thing is fricking amazing. One thing I just noticed, the fan noise when you're idling is surprisingly quiet. I thought this thing would be significantly louder, because it's a pretty powerful processor. But even when you're playing games, if you're on the default mode, it's pretty quiet. ah The external temperatures are very comfortable, even when you're playing games. When I'm running benchmarks, there is some thermal throttling on the default mode. But if you crank up the fans, that throttling disappears, and you can overclock it pretty generously. I don't know if the mic will pick it up, but the fans are on full tilt right now, and it's loud. Obviously this is a very powerful laptop, but whether or not it's worth it, chances are, if you're watching this video, and you're kinda wondering whether or not you should buy it, this is not for you. But, if you want to live the dream, and you have the money for this thing, this thing is incredible. Amazing performance, amazing device, limited edition, pretty cool. Hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! I'll see you guys next time. 
Hey how's it going, Dave2D here and
these are Surface Laptops this is a 4 GB model and then this is an 8GB
model. I've done a couple videos about these guys already, so this will just be
kind of like a mini review, but I want to spend some time talking about the
viability of the 4GB model. So in case you don't know, Surface laptop has
amazing build quality; this is the new leader in build quality for 13-inch
Windows laptops. It's better than the XPS 13, better than the Razer Blade Stealth,
better than the HP Spectre, and better than the Lenovo X1. I mean those are all
really well-made, but these are a step up. It's not so much that the materials are
better (they're still aluminum) it's more of the fact that they're just really
precisely machined and like everything about it is so finely tuned. The hinge
feels just bang-on, but you are paying a premium for it. It's an expensive device
and I think a big part of that cost goes to the fact that they're as well-built
as they are. The screens are really good. It's not my favorite screen and there's
too much wobble to use it regularly for pen input, but visually it's really nice
and it gets bright. The webcam and mic are pretty good, this is what it looks
like: and this is what it sounds like: the SSD speeds are slower than I was hoping,
so the drives in here get faster as the capacity increases but at the 128GB and 256
GB models, they're not very impressive. The speakers are pretty good, they're
hidden underneath the keyboard but they projects upwards, so positioning is nice.
They sound good, not amazing, certainly not as good as a MacBook Pro
or the HP Spectre line, but they're better than the XPS 13 and the Razer
Blade Stealth. The keyboards are really nice to type on so the Alcantara fabric
is - I mean it's soft, it's inviting, it's comfortable to use, and we still don't
know about its long-term durability, but it's a very nice keyboard to type on, and
I think most people will get used to it really quickly. Same thing goes for the
trackpad - good size, great texture, but if I was looking for something to complain
about, I would say that the click is a little loud, but in general, the inputs on
this thing are great. Now battery life was one of the headlining features of
this laptop, and it's excellent - it's a 45 watt hour battery, which isn't actually
that large for a laptop of this size. Ultrabooks sometimes have 60 watt hour
batteries. This one's smaller but I can comfortably get eight hours on this
thing doing normal tasks with the screen at around 250 nits. Thermal performance
is good - it runs quietly, and the fans don't come on often, even if you're
watching videos, but when they do, it's louder than you'd expect for a device like
this. All right so the thing I want to focus on in this video is the
performance of the base model, and for students, this thing's $900 for regular
people; it's a thousand and all the great hardware stuff that I've mentioned
previously exists on the base model, but the thing is this thing has 4GB of
RAM. This has 8GB of RAM and this is
significantly more expensive, so it's kind of like a tough decision for people
to choose between the two, when the main thing that they're concerned about, is
the difference in RAM. Now just to get this out of the way, gaming performance
on the base model isn't great. It's an HD 620 -  really light games, or in this case
with Overwatch, really low settings will let you get passable frame rates, but
don't get a base or a mid tier Surface laptop to play games. In regards to
regular performance, I did the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro right away. I
mean, I think for 99% of you guys you won't want to stay with Windows 10 S. And
performance on the 4GB machine is actually not bad. I can comfortably have
4 or 5 chrome tabs open with Netflix streaming, Microsoft Word and Excel open -
it's still manageable. If you use software at school like MATLAB or
something not crazy intensive, it's the same thing - memory gets tight, but for the
most part, the user experience stays fluid. Now if you use any kind of imaging
software, or if you're doing even moderate content creation, you're going
to need more RAM, but if your work flow is more productivity focused, you'll be fine
with 4GB. Even if you're a software developer, unless you're working with
like 3D graphics or like a really heavy IDE,
you'll be ok with 4 - and the core i5 will give you pretty decent compiling times. So to answer the big question, yes I do think that 4GB of RAM is enough for
some people, especially if productivity and media consumption is your jam, but it
kills me that Microsoft couldn't just add 8GB of RAM to this, because in
order to get 8GB of RAM right now,  you have to buy the more premium version
with more storage, and not everyone needs that storage. So yeah that's kind of a
bummer. Whether or not it's worth it on the whole, like the Surface laptop, I mean
you're getting a really nice-looking laptop with great build quality. If
that's what you're looking for, this is a good option. Ok hope you guys enjoyed
this video, thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it. See you guys next
time. 
[Music] Hey how's it going Dave 2d here this is the third and last CES video that I'm gonna do this year and again apologies for the non normal image quality being shot on a phone checked out the Asus event they didn't have any amazing laptops I mean they had some refreshes and stuff but nothing that was like really amped up about but they did have this really cool bezel remover thing so for triple monitor setups you know you can normally see the bezels in between each monitor now they have these plastic bars that serve as lenses to basically hide those bezels and it's actually very effective you didn't think that something that was just a piece of plastic could look this good but they put them on and it actually looks like a bezel free display there's a little bit of distortion from the plastic lens but it actually looks quite good and it's weird how inexpensive this thing's going to be because it's just a piece of plastic and how effective it is they also have this external GPU that looks really slim and sleek it's just like a very narrow box for what external GPUs often are but the thing that made this thing special was its price tag this thing's going for 330 bucks and it's actually one of the better-looking external GPUs out there so I think that's gonna be cool now in regards to laptops there were two laptops that stood out at CES for me the first is actually an XPS 15 to one so it's not replacing their regular XPS 15 they're still gonna have those but this is the first tuned one that they've had for the XPS 15 lineup here's the thing when I first heard about this thing when I first saw the press release I wasn't impressed because I'm not a big user of tune one devices that are big like a 15-inch two and one device is gonna be big and when it's in tablet form I thought it would be pretty uncomfortable to hold and just not a great device for me personally so I'm gonna check this thing out with not particularly high hopes but this thing is awesome it's not great as a tablet it's still not gonna be a comfortable thing to hold but this is excellent as a laptop and really really good in like presentation or tent mode it has this Maglev keyboard that uses magnets to keep the keyboard really thin so this thing only has a zero point seven millimeter key travel which is really really shallow and you'd expect something with that short key travel to feel crappy but it doesn't at all it's not the best keyboard certainly not but when you type on this thing it actually feels like a one two a one point two millimeter key travel it feels really nice it also has lots of use bc ports with four lane Thun well three support finally which is great the microSD slot a bit of a buzzkill I feel like on a device like this that's obviously geared towards creatives it's weird to put a microSD instead of a regular SD slot it has pen support and because the whole XPS lineup tends to have a stiffer hinge you can just write on it without the screen wobbling too much now I was only able to test it in 3d paint which isn't the most optimized program the thin strokes we're fine there's no latency it's actually felt really good but the thicker strokes with more complex textures and just bigger brushes had some lag to it they're running the new Intel chips that have the 8th gen CPU combined with the Radeon Vega MG views it's pretty cool I think that those will have performance similar to a 1050 1050 Ti I'm not sure exactly that we weren't able to benchmark it but I'm excited to test that thing and I think one of the big advantages of this thing is thermals like the way that they've designed and engineered this chip should definitely help with thermal output so overall it's a pretty cool device I have to test this thing more thoroughly to really give a final opinion on it but I think it should be pretty good they also have this Thunderbolt 3 external drive which is I mean it's a really really fast drive for people that need it there aren't that many options out there for a Thunderbolt 3 external SSD so it's nice to see them in the game the last booth I've got to check out was LG and they have a couple monitors that are pretty neat I mean the one that stands out for me is the 4k Thunderbolt 3 capable one so now you're able to connect two displays daisy-chained to a single MacBook Pro which is pretty neat they also have a 5k widescreen panel that isn't curved and also uses Thunderbolt 3 so you can have that single cable set up which is nice now the star of the show was this thing the new LG grant so if you follow my channel from earlier I did one of the early reviews of the original LG grant 14 is such a cool idea like a super super thin laptop super lightweight laptop but I hated it I felt like the thermals were bad the build quality was poor it just wasn't a good product and this was like what 2015-2016 they've improved on a year upon year and it's gotten really good but this iteration is freaking amazing so I feel like they changed so much on this thing and basically listened to everybody who had anything to complain about the LG gram and made it what people wanted it's still the same kind of design but they improved on the build quality again and this time and it feels extra tanky so this has actually been certified by the US Department of defense was something that and it's surprising to see a device this thin and this light with that kind of certification it also has a 72 watt hour battery just to put this into perspective XPS 13 Rays would stealth those have batteries in the 60 watt hour range just like the previous LG Gramm but this new one is 72 watt hours I'm just quick math it's like like 20 25 percent better that's a significant improvement in battery life it has Thunderbolt 3 support although I'm not sure if it's 2 or 4 Lane they've improved the webcam location like instead of being in the middle and the hinge looking up your nose it's now at the top and the mark traditional spot they have slightly better speakers they have a better location for the fingerprint sensor and they now have to drive bays inside so for people that want extra storage you now have that option visually it doesn't look that different but in the short amount of time I got to spend with it I think it's gonna be a great laptop I think it's a significant improvement from the previous generation ok last video at CES hope you guys enjoyed them thumbs we liked it subs you loved it we'll see you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And there's a lot of hype on the market right now for the Pixel 2 XL Not so much for the Pixel 2 but the XL is pretty hot right now, but there's another phone on the market that I've always felt was under marketed Underappreciated and just more importantly under hyped especially on YouTube, and that's this phone, the LG V30 So this is made by the same company as the Pixel 2 XL. They're both made by LG This one in particular was the gray and silver one, but I've actually put a marble dbrand skin on it, because I didn't love the silver trim I wish I'd just gotten the black one The black trim looks way better than the silver trim in real life And a dbrand skin would look good on that one as well Well so the reason why I made this video is because the Pixel 2 XL and the LG V30 have a lot of similarities. Both are running Snapdragon 835 with 4 gigs of RAM, which is going to give you kick-ass performance. They both have a rear fingerprint sensor which I'm a big fan of. They both have big batteries. The one on the Pixel 2 XL is slightly bigger, haven't tested it fully but the V30 gives you a full day of use and I wouldn't be surprised if the Pixel 2 XL gives something very similar. They're both quite water-resistant. Now, the higher number on the V30 I would consider insignificant. It's IP68 instead of IP67 on the Pixel 2 XL, and it's probably because the Pixel 2 has larger speaker apertures upfront... So it's harder to keep water out is my guess. They both have awesome 1440p P-OLED displays Supposedly, they're both using the same panel. Beautiful colors, really inky blacks But there's one big difference. The V30 has significantly thinner bezels than the Pixel 2 XL. When you compare the two side-by-side, you can't just help but tunnel vision on the difference. Now the reason why the Pixel 2 XL has a bigger bezel I'm sure a big part of it is because it has the speakers, that's got two front-facing speakers I'm a big fan of those on smartphones, but the V30 just looks so much nicer to me And then the more I use it, the more I look at the hardware The more just feels like a much better phone in terms of its hardware. First, it has the microSD slot I mean that's something that I personally don't care too much about But I know a lot of you guys are really interested in expandable storage And then you look at the cameras. The V30 is obviously a very different looking camera setup than the Pixel 2 XL But it's also a really good camera. The Pixel 2 camera is gonna be amazing I took a few photos of the event and they just looked really really clean, but this camera is also fantastic It's one of the best on the market right now It's got a wide-angle lens which can be awesome So a lot of phone companies will use black-and-white lenses or a portrait lens as the secondary camera This one uses the wide-angle one and by far It's my favorite of all the secondary camera lenses It's just so much more useful for the photos that I take. And I know the Pixel 2 XL has the highest DxOMark right now Which may or may not be important to you, but numbers aside V30, awesome camera. And the video mode on this thing is surprisingly good The lenses and the sensor are obviously good But the software and the amount of control you have over the footage is unbelievable And it even has log footage so if you want to capture the most color data, I mean see log on a phone, is crazy The V30 still has a headphone jack, but more importantly, it has a really high-quality DAC But no amount of me explaining things, or me describing how the audio sounds is gonna do justice. It really is like looking at a 4K screen versus a 1080p screen except It's for your ears, and it's one of those things where you need to have good hardware, like a good set of headphones And I guess it'll depend on the hearing of each person But if you have a good quality source file and decent headphones even The difference in audio quality is phenomenal, so if you're into music or you think you'll get into music and you want good sound quality, a high-quality DAC on a phone is amazing, and they even include a very respectable set of earbuds in the box The V30 also supports wireless charging, which for some people might be a small detail But it is a nice feature to have. If you look at pricing, both of these phones are pretty expensive The V30 is going for around 800 bucks off-contract. The Pixel 2 XL starts at 850 I wouldn't call it like, a better value or anything just because you're getting a bunch of free stuff with the Pixel 2 right now You're getting like the Google Home Mini, plus some carriers give you discounts and stuff Currently I would consider them a wash in terms of their pricing The software though is gonna be the biggest difference between these two phones The Pixel 2 XL is going to run the latest stuff from Google, which is awesome. I love stock Android. The V30, it's running 7.1.1, which is good... It's not the newest stuff, but it's also running a skin, the LG UI and, I don't love it I personally think there are better-looking skins than this, there's significantly worse ones But I still don't love the LG skin. Now what I've done for my phone is that I just nuked the skin I'm running a Google launcher and It's close to stock because Google has enough apps in the Play Store to replace the LG apps if you want But it's never gonna be 100% stock Okay, if you're on the market for a phone for particularly, the Pixel 2 XL, take a look at this thing if you're interested in hardware because quite frankly, this has better hardware But if you're in it for the software and you want that smooth, buttery newest Google experience, sure, Pixel 2 XL is the way to go But I want to leave one last thing on your minds. This phone Not just the V30, but the flagship LG phone, so last year the V20, year before that the V10 They've always been great phones But they've always been kind of underrepresented, under marketed because just that's how LG does stuff. They don't have like crazy billboards They don't have the celebrities that just kind of rock these phones This is a fantastic phone. If you look at any publication, online or print And you see the reviews for this phone Everyone loves it, but it just gets buried by the hype of other phones which is unfortunate because, they nailed it this year. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it.
See you guys next time! 
Hey how's it going Dave 2d here so this is a very high-tech coffee cup it's called the Ember ceramic cup and the reason why I have this thing is this wasn't sponsored they didn't send this to me actually purchase this thing so I go into Starbucks just before Christmas and I'm just buying a regular coffee drink there and I see this thing being marketed pretty heavily you can see it on like the front windows they have it at their cache there's like lights and stuff and it's got like an hour GB light to attract your eye and I look at the price tag and it's 80 bucks and I remember thinking there is no way that a coffee cup is worth 80 bucks there's no way but then I look at the box and like okay heats up your drink and it maintains the temperature so I'm like I'll bite so basically I got conned into buying this thing because of Starbucks marketing but I will say that after a couple weeks of using this thing I really enjoy this hence the creation of this video okay so what this thing is is like the simplified version is that this thing takes hot beverages and it maintains or increases the temperature to your desired temperature so it's pretty simple you fill it up with hot liquid and then you set the paired app on your phone to a particular temperature and it'll maintain that temperature so if you're someone who drinks a lot of tea or coffee or hot chocolate or whatever it is that you drink if you like hot beverages this thing might be of interest to you okay so just to demonstrate how this thing works I'm going to pour some hot water into this thing and make a tea and just we'll see how this goes okay so I have hot water in a this was previously boiled it's a little bit cool at this point but what's interesting about this app is that when you pour it in it says empty right now you can kind of see it as you pour it in it'll register its current temperature so right now it's reading at 149 which is already really hot you know what it's so hot that I can't even so the water that was in here is like recently boiled and it's it's above the temperature that this cup can raise it to so this is yeah this is uncomfortably hot you wouldn't want to drink coffee of this temperature you can raise it up to 145 Fahrenheit which in Celsius is 62 point five degrees but to demonstrate this thing properly I feel like I have to lower the temperature of the liquid inside it so that we can actually see it raising it back up so I'm gonna go outside grab some snow up right back okay this is some fresh Canadian snow I'm just gonna drop it in and should reduce the temperature by quite a bit I don't know how much it'll drop it by but hopefully in about not buy too much so you can see the temperature on this thing we'll see how low it goes and I swirl it around a little bit it's completely melted now 58.5 that's quite the reduction in temperature you basically set it at a temperature 59 degrees and it'll just maintain it for however long so there's a battery life to this thing so let me just show how this thing works it's a ceramic mug and there's a battery at the bottom with heater coils and there's a charger for this cup and I normally this charger has an AC adapter plugged into it I don't have it plugged in right now but it basically charges the cup through some contacts and then the cup has a battery that in turn heats up the liquid so the device is pretty simple in terms of how it works and what it does but I'm just going to go through some things that I enjoy better and also talk about some things that I don't like with this product but one of those I really like about this thing is that it is a ceramic coated mug it's not like a ceramic mug there's some kind of insulation material going on that it actually is a very cool cup on the outside but the liquid is super hot which I really like the other thing I really like about this thing is the app it's a really simple app it's available for iOS or for Android we call the Ember app set the temperature and you're good to go so overall the good things about this product are pretty simple but for people that enjoy hot beverages and you want to kind of maintain a particular temperature for an extended period of time with your beverage it's pretty cool it's really nice to like leave your coffee or your tea on a table come back an hour later and it's the exact same temperature it's actually a pretty weird sensation because your mind expects the temperature of your drink to be lower after a long period of time like that but it isn't and it's a nice experience now there's a couple things I don't like about this thing I got to pour this thing out to kind of demonstrate what it is a beer back [Music] okay a few things that I don't like about this thing first of all they say that it's not dishwasher friendly now I've actually run this thing through the dishwasher about ten times so far no issues yet but I feel like it's gonna have issues eventually because of how the sink charges so this thing uses these raw metal contacts on the bottom to charge the device so basically the charging pad has these two pogo pins and when you place the mug on to the charging pad it sends current through the pogo pins and then through the metal rings and it charges up the mug but my question is why would they have raw metal contacts on a container designed to hold liquids and here's the thing when you drink like there's gonna be liquids I kind of run down the side and to potentially get on to this area so I don't know I feel like we could have done an induction thing like a ton of products out there use maybe it would've been fast enough to charge I'm not sure but this bugs me a lot I think these charging rings are why it's a hand wash only product but ain't nobody got time for that I don't go no hand wash a coffee mug just because it can charge another thing I don't like about this thing is the battery life so they claim on the box and on the website being at approximately two hours of use with this thing I think that's BS I'm comfortably getting an hour maybe a little bit more but unless you're I don't know how people are getting two hours like you've got to be using some kind of lids to retain the heat or something but you're not gonna get two hours don't expect that and the third thing I don't like about this thing is the volume so they say this thing holds 10 ounces and it does if you fill it up right to the brim but you're not holding 10 ounces comfortably it's holding like 8 maybe even 1/2 ounces it's a little deceptive the base is quite thick because it's got your charging hardware your heating hardware Bluetooth connectivity stuff like there's a lot of equipment at the bottom of this mug so visually this thing holds less liquid then it would seem but overall it's a great mug I think for the right person this is a great gift or if you're into drinking tea coffee frequently this might be a good pickup for you now what I mention one last thing is the price tag so this thing should go for $80 amber sells it for 80 bucks their website has it for 80 bucks but a lot of sites are selling this thing for inflated prices for like 100 150 bucks like Amazon selling this thing originally for 80 bucks right now is 150 so don't purchase it from places that are selling it for ripoff prices 80 bucks is where you want to be okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs have you liked it subs if you loved it and if you'll notice the sets a little bit different right things look familiar but not the same stay tuned it's a bit of assets you guys next time [Music] 
2-in-1 convertible laptops are devices that I have always wanted, like, the idea of it is really cool: to have a laptop that can turn into a tablet just by folding the screen back- but there's always been issues with usability. It's just something that comes with the nature of a screen that folds back and then, you're now holding a keyboard that's at the bottom of a laptop. It's… a lot of companies attempt to do it but a lot of companies don't do a good job at it. And that's why I don't cover them very often on this channel, because I feel like a lot of companies produce them, it's just they're not really noteworthy. This one is the HP Specter x360 and of all the 2-in-1 devices that I've been able to use, I think this is the best one, in terms of just usability for the average person So, there is a 13" and 15" version to this. This is the 13" and my honest opinion if you are kinda deciding between a screen size for 13 or 15 inch for 2-in-1's there is very few people that will be able to comfortably use a 15" 2-in-1 …as a tablet. As a laptop thats great, but, if you're looking for a 2-in-1 and you plan on using it as a tablet relatively frequently, I would go for the 13 inch Okay, let's first start with the keyboard.
It's a good keyboard, can't complain. It's backlit, very good layout, good spacing. It's a little bit slick because the keys don't have any texture: It's just like a smooth plastic, but it's a very comfortable typing experience and the trackpad is also good It uses a synaptic driver. I would have loved to have seen a Windows precision driver but it's actually a very good touchpad. It's got good tracking and good button mechanics   There is pen support, and it's included in the box, but the pen itself isn't amazing or anything. I mean, it works, it does everything that a kind of average stylus would do. But it feels like an older generation Surface Pen to me. Ports on this thing are pretty standard for an ultrabook. There's two USB C's, one USB A, a micro SD slot and a fingerprint sensor. The USB C supports ThunderBolt 3 AND it's 4 lanes PCIe for the people that want to plug this thing up to an external GPU. Inside, the RAM and the WiFi are soldered on. The SSD is replaceable if you need but that's basically it: everything else is soldered on. The battery down here is a nice size: 60 Watt-hour slab and battery-life is very good: it's pulling a comfortable 9.5 hours with the screen at around 250 nits. It's relatively long for a 2-in-1 device. I mean there are devices that have longer battery-lives than this, but it's very good. The performance on the 13 inch x360 is actually quite good. A lot of 2-in-1 devices are using "Y" processors, which I don't love. This is using the regular "U" processor: quad-core, 8th-gen Kaby Lake-R, and it's awesome for multi-core stuff. You do need the right type of application for the CPU to really flex, but these are really fast processors. Gaming performance is pretty limited: light games will play at reasonable frame-rates, but nothing amazing. The Intel UHD-620 is not a gaming GPU so you kinda expect that. Now, one of the more interesting things about this laptop are the fan noise and the thermal performance. So, this thing has two fans, which, at first I thought would give it some amazing thermal performance. And it does, but not in the way that I expected. So this laptop is quiet, one of the quietest laptops that I've ever used, even under load. It can get a little warm, nothing too bad though because you can comfortably use this laptop on your lap. Now, because this thing had two fans, I was under the assumption that this would have the ability to increase the wattage in XTU to sustain boost clock, but I wasn't able to. I was getting throttling even with under-volting. And it's not a weak AC adaptor: it's a very comfortable 65 watt one, but it's just that this laptop was not designed to run above the original thermal specifications. So fans on this laptop are great if you just want to keep things adequately cooled while being quiet, but you can't push out crazy performance them. The usability as a tablet is where this device excels, and I think this is where a lot of manufacturers just, kind of fail. So, here's the thing, if you're going to buy a 2-in-1 device, if you're going to spend the money and pay a little bit of a premium to get a 2-in-1 device, you have to be someone who's actually going to use it as a 2-in-1 device. Like like, it, I know it sounds really obvious, but a lot of people will buy something like this, and just use it as a laptop, and rarely use it as a 2-in-1, and it just doesn't make any sense. If you're going to use it as a laptop, just purchase a dedicated laptop.But if you're gonna pick up something like this, you'd gotta be damn sure you're going to be using it as tent mode, presentation mode, tablet mode, and this thing is very comfortable to use in all of those positions. It's weird because visually there's a lot of angles and edges on the Spectre, but it's actually really comfortable to hold. Now there's four speakers on this device, there's two on the top and then two on the bottom, and they've positioned them in a way so that you get clean audio in laptop mode, tablet mode, presentation mode, it doesn't even matter. The audio itself is not amazing, I'm not gonna say that this is the best speakers ever; it's an ultrabook, but they sound good. The most important thing: you have access to clean audio, regardless of the position you have this thing set up in. Alright, lastly, I want to talk about the screen. This panel is a 1080p panel. It's bright, it's got a good color gamut, and the viewing angles are good. Now the side bezels are thin, they look nice, but the top and bottom panels are thick, right? Well, they look a lot thicker than you want them to. But I think they do this on purpose. A lot of 2-in-1 devices have thinner bezels, and it looks nice. But in terms of usability, these thicker bezels on the top and bottom are really nice in tablet mode. There's just way fewer accidental clicks and taps when you're handling the device, which is something that I think a lot of Windows 10 tablets have an issue with, but I just don't get that with this thing, and I really like that. The webcam looks pretty clean, and it's located in the normal position up-top so it doesn't look up your nose or anything like that. The overall device is very comfortable to use and it's just something that a lot of manufacturers overlook, or just straight-up don't care about. 2-in-1 devices should be comfortable as a laptop and as a tablet, and this guy does both well. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it; subs if you love it. See you guys next time! 
(Intro music) Hey how's it going, Dave2D here. So I've always been a fan of small form factor PCs I've always had this thing for like tiny PCs Just like really powerful computers in these really small form factors. And, well it's why I continue to use this thing The 2013 Mac Pro. I like it because even though it's a 10-core CPU, and it's quite powerful, it's still really quiet and still super small and even though the GPU is like, old and not very powerful, the CPU in there is still really capable for doing multi-Core stuff, which I like I've been trying to find a Windows equivalent, I've been searching for a very long time and I think I finally found something that's really close This is the Trident 3. So what makes this thing special is the fact that it's a very, very small computer It's 5.5 liters, which is very similar in size to the Mac Pro, I'll pull it back in frame again so you can see it in comparison Obviously, the..I mean the shape is completely different But just in terms of volume, this is around 5.5 liters, this is around 5.5 liters Now, the official volume from MSI's website is 4.72 liters, and technically it is because they're measuring the physical space it occupies But I feel like it's 5.5 because I'm including the angular cut-away gap on each side Regardless, it's a small case Now this is the Arctic edition. they make another version that's all black, it's like the regular one, has a GTX 1060, has a smaller power supply, everything else is about the same but because the GPU is weaker in that one, I waited for this one to come out before I did the video design-wise, it's angular, and boxy. I mean, some people might love this look I prefer something a little more clean, a little more minimal But, I like it just because it's small, and because it's white and because it has a single RGB light, for just, I don't know, you can play with colors and stuff But overall, I think the design is good, just not perfect to me The best thing about this PC is it's 5.5 liter size Now, there's other ITX cases that are also really small The one that comes to mind that's probably the most popular in terms of like, small ITX cases Is the NCASE M1, it's a 12 liter case there's another ITX case that's even smaller, it's the DAN Case A4-SFX, and that thing is 7 liters but it's really difficult to get your hands on it The MSI Trident 3 is 5.5 liters, it's really small You can open it up, it's not recommended because there's a sticker that says you shouldn't but, when you do, you can have access to the RAM, the CPU and the GPU You can put up to 32 GB of RAM in here There's also upgradable storage, but you have to go in underneath There's an M.2 stick, and there's a 2.5 Inch SATA Drive Ok, I have to be completely honest, when MSI first sent this thing to me, I thought, there's a Desktop i7 in here, there's a GTX 1070 in here, in a case that's very small this...can't go very well. It's either gonna be super hot, or super loud, or a combination of the 2 Turns out, the performance is really strong It's not the fastest thing out there, but most Triple A titles You're looking at wicked smooth frame rates on ultra graphics at 1080p and, some weaker titles will let you play with good frame rates in 4K But most importantly, every single game that I enjoy playing So Overwatch and PlayerUnknown's Battleground Those two games run incredibly well on this system I'm able to stay near 120 frames-per-second with really nice looking graphics (gunfire) (Simple Plan- Untitled, plays) VR obviously works well with this, because it's a GTX 1070 and you have the ports up front for easy access if it's going to a home theater set-up or something Video editing is also really nice on this machine I did my last 2 videos on this, and well, i'll be doing this video on this machine as well, it's a great performer So the big question is, how good is the thermal performance, because cooling a PC of this size with this kind of performance, is not an easy task and a lot of small form factor enthusiasts Struggle with that whole, like, do we make it louder, and make it cool better or do we keep it quieter and let it run hotter But these guys, they did a pretty good job Looking at the temperatures, the idle and load temperatures are a little warm, nothing bad, it's definitely in-spec of what Intel recommends And i'm not seeing any kind of Thermal Throttling, but it does run warm The good thing is that the fans are incredibly quiet When it's idle, it's almost silence But even under load, this is one of the quietest systems I've used with this kind of performance They're doing this through good, automated fan-control But if there was one complaint I had about the thermal management I just wish that this thing had user-controllable fans, like I want to be able to ramp it up and down depending on whatever i'm doing, and, it doesn't have that so, yeah It comes with a mouse, and keyboard, with controllable RGB lighting it's not my cup of tea, but, they're actually pretty comfortable to use it's a membrane keyboard, it feels nice, even though it's free, i'm not gonna lie it feels better than most membrane keyboards made by big name accessory makers The mouse feels...less awesome, but it's not bad, it's got a weight adjustable system But either one of these peripherals are just kind of like, bonus accessories they're very viable, I just wouldn't go competitive MLG with them. The AC adapter is big, it's 330W, but it's just how the Trident is able to keep it's size The power supply is external and you can always hide it to keep your setup relatively clean The Arctic edition of the Trident 3 starts at $1500, which is, in my opinion, a very fair price for what you're getting I mean, obviously you can build a regular PC, with a GTX 1070 for cheaper than this there's no doubt. If you don't care about the size of your case, you can get similar performance to this for $1200-$1300 It would have better upgradeability down the line than this But it would be a heck of a lot larger, so for MSI to stick all this stuff into a 5.5 liter case, and include a mouse and a keyboard, for $1500, I think it's fair So some final notes, I've toured with several, small gaming PCs the Corsair One is an awesome machine, very quiet, very well-cooled, but it's a little big, at 12 liters The Asus GR8 series, or "great", i'm not sure how to pronounce it It's a pretty powerful system, but the fans are way too loud And Zotac makes some small form-factor boxes, which are pretty quiet and small even smaller than this thing, but they're running lower wattage i5 CPUs Which don't really take advantage of the GPUs, and they're not as good for video editing which is, what i'm trying to do So overall, I really like this system, if you can tell I have a few complaints about it, like, I don't love the design I wish the thermal controls were a little better, and there is some bloatware not a ton, but, if you don't like removing that stuff, it is there Overall, great system Now, most people who pick up something like this, or kind of, (are) in the market for something like this Would stick it in their media center, like under their TV, kind of like a console like, to replace a PS4 or something I'm one of the weird people that..I would use this as my regular PC because I like my PC small and silent, and i'm just weird like that But for people that are just in the market for this kind of device, this is a good one Alright, hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it I'll see you guys next time. (outro) 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here So this is a laptop that's been out for a couple months, and I've had it for a couple months And you guys haven't asked me to make this video for a couple months But I've purposefully avoided doing it because I wasn't sure if I was gonna make this video I wasn't sure if I was gonna make content on this thing because of an interaction that I had with the company and You'll understand at the end of the video why but this is the Xiaomi Notebook Pro And this is for all intents and purposes a really really good laptop for the money It starts at nine hundred bucks, and it's packed with just great performance great specs and a really good design It's obviously been inspired by apple inspired is a gentle word, but it looks a lot like Apple laptops They've done a great job building this thing and there's a lot to like about it So I'm gonna kind of go through things. I like about it talk about a few things that I don't like about it, and then kind of go into the reasons why I Kind of hesitated on making this video okay first the build quality in this thing is great It's got aluminum everywhere very minimal design it has very little branding on the top and on the bottom. The only obvious branding You'll see on this entire laptop is right at the bottom of the screen And it's just a very muted look to a very well-built laptop. Now it comes pre-loaded with Chinese Windows 10 Which you're gonna have to wipe and then install whatever language of Windows 10 You'd like. I used English and well the good thing is that the digital license is activated So you don't have to purchase a separate license or anything. It's just it works Windows 10 home ran perfectly fine on this laptop I like the port selection on this thing. There's two USB A's and HDMI, two USB C's as well as an SD card slot now There's only one USB C that supports charging as well as high resolution display output But it is a good selection of ports. It's pretty easy to get inside it's a bunch of screws on the bottom one of them being underneath one of the feet and when you're inside you can't replace the Wi-Fi card it's a good one the 80-65, but it looks like it's built on board But you can replace the SSD and there's room for a second SSD if you want the keyboard is nice it's easy to get used to it actually reminds me a lot of the older generation Mac books like the 2015 and earlier MacBook Pros, it's got like a nice plush key travel and the layout is really good I mean it's kind of weird that a Chinese company has one of the better English keyboard layouts But they do a good job at it, and I also like the speakers now They're positioned on the bottom, so they don't have the best location, but I mean they sound good It's just you lose some of the audio clarity because it's sitting on the table and just kind of deflects off of whatever surface You're using but they do sound good now the screen I have Kind of mixed feelings about it's a 1080p panel not touchscreen and it looks pretty sharp The color gamut and accuracy are a little bit lower than expected It just looks nicer than it actually is but when you measure with the spider comes out kind of mediocre The battery life is really good though So this thing's coming in at seven and a half hours of regular use with the screen at 215 nits I've mentioned this in other videos with 15-inch ultrabooks But I really like laptops that have 15 inch screens that are using u processors You just get better battery life and for a lot of people It's a good fit This particular model is running 16 gigs of ram and an i7 kabylake-r CPU and for multi-core stuff in short bursts this thing Kicks ass the thermals are good. They're running two fans in the chassis Which is pretty rare for a u processor and The thing is there's so much thermal Headroom with those two fans that you can bump up the waters on this thing pretty comfortably like You can hit 35 watt TDP on this thing Pretty easily and that lets you sustain higher clock speed higher boost speed so if that's what you want to do This is a great laptop for that option the fan noise that stock is pretty quiet Not that it's a completely silent computer anything like that. It does come on, but it's just a quiet fan Now this thing is paired with an MX 150, which is one of the best budget GPUs out there It'll give you reasonable gaming performance, and it's just better than the integrated chip from Intel And it gives you a little kick when you're doing some 3d applications or video edits I mean it's not a beast for 3d stuff, but if you're looking to do some casual gaming or graphical work It's a good option now There's a couple things that I don't like about this laptop But the truth is most of it is just nitpicky stuff the first thing I don't like is when I mentioned the build quality everything about it is good Except the bottom edge is super sharp like it feels unfinished compared to the rest of the laptop And it's actually a little bit uncomfortable to hold and the other thing I don't love is the trackpad so the actual tracking surface is good. It's very smooth. It's a great glass texture It feels very similar to a Mac trackpad, but the button mechanism. Oh, I don't love it It needs way more force to press down than almost any other laptop that I've tried And I also don't like the fingerprint sensor location. It's just in the way of the actual tracking stuff I've seen fingerprint sensors that have been on track pads that have been fine But this one kind of gets in the way when you're just using the trackpad Another thing that's kind of weird is that they only give two PCIe lanes for the drive so instead of the regular four lanes They're given two and the drive that they include is a really fast drive as the Samsung Pm 961 is one of the fastest oem drives You can get out there, but the speeds are crippled a little bit because of the reduced number of PCIe lanes But overall this is an awesome laptop for the money right 900 bucks gets you so much on this laptop And it's such good value that when you compare it to North American brands or just any other big named laptop brand It's really hard to compare them because you're just getting such good value with this device, but the big issue with this thing is The customer support. So, I had a friend who Purchased the xiaomi air like their smaller lighter laptop under my recommendation because I said it's a good value He bought it, and then like three months later something went wrong with it And he went through hell to try to get that thing replaced And I would you know I tried to get involved and just it never happened we're literally sitting on a brick of a laptop so I Don't know how to recommend this thing like I feel like for 99.9% of people that purchased this thing. They'll be happy They'll get this great laptop with great value, and they'll just those people get it great But for that small percentage of people that purchase this if you guys are watching this and you're interested in buying this it if you Buy it and it busts like that would just break my heart. There's people that save up for months Maybe even a year to buy one of these things and if it breaks like, that's this is a Chinese company and If you're trying to get customer support with this thing like this is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to customer support These guys are one of the most difficult companies have had to interact with for repairs or replacement of a laptop But you kind of expect it for the price of this thing right. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it. See you guys next time You 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here So this is the Surface Book 2, the 13 inch version Now, when the original Surface Book launched in 2015 I thought it was some of the coolest pieces
of tech available at the time It's just really impressive because No one else was making something quite like it. Two years later, we're still there No one else is making something quite like this The CPU is built into the screen It's removable and it's a fully functional tablet by itself And then the GPU is in the keyboard so when
they connect, it becomes a full-fledged graphically powered laptop, so... I mean a lot of people want something like this It's something quite unique But it comes at a pretty steep price tag This thing, this unit here, starts at $2000 US Now, there is a cheaper version But the cheaper version does not have
the dedicated graphics card in the keyboard so that makes it not as cool Or just not as unique to be honest So I'm going to focus just the experience
on this one, the $2000 version Now, there's a 15 inch version that's
significantly more expensive I may do video in the future on that
but, 13-inch for this video I want to talk about the hinge first. This is a hinge that, when it first was announced I had mixed feelings about it because I felt like there's so many moving parts There's places that dust can get into, there's
just a lot of things that could go wrong, I thought That's not the case. Two years later People still don't have any major issues with the hinge Now the design isn't for everyone.
It can look a little bit weird But functionally and mechanically, it's really well made. When you open it up You'll notice that very little has changed aesthetically The screen is still the 3 by 2 aspect ratio
with good color accuracy. It's bright It's high-res. There's no complaints here.
There's no pen in the box this year It's an extra 100 bucks if you want to buy one, which I thought was a little bit weird But I guess not everyone uses a
pen so it's understandable The one I'm using is actually from the
Eve and it works perfectly fine The keyboard and trackpad are nice It's a noticeably better typing experience than the original Surface Book It's a little bit quieter, and it just feels more responsive than the original Surface Book keyboard,
not that that one was bad It was already good. This is just a little bit better.
The trackpad has also improved It's obviously still running Windows Precision drivers The button mechanism feels a little
more deliberate when you press it And it's a little bit louder than I remember
the Surface Book 1 to be but it feels awesome, so keyboard,
trackpad, both excellent Performance is good. It's the quad core Kaby Lake-R It's a 15 watt CPU, but it's fast in short bursts. Multi-core
performance is really strong now But the question is whether this extra speed really makes a big difference for what you do And it really depends on your workflow The truth is for the majority of people that are using a device like this it won't make their workflow Or just work experience that much faster You need specific apps that can
handle multi-core processing Some computational stuff will really benefit
from it and same with video editing But at the end of the day, it is a 15 watt U processor So it's not gonna be the fastest laptop in the world. One thing to keep in mind, the 13 inch version does not have a fan in the tablet component. The 15 inch version of this device like the Surface Book 2, 15 inch screen does have the same processor as this, but there is a fan in there So it's able to run at a higher clock speed for
longer periods of time. It also pulls I think 20 watts instead of the 15 watt at max There is some CPU throttling when
you push it hard enough But most people won't notice it because this is
not the device that people would choose for really heavy CPU activity. In terms of gaming performance, It's actually pretty good. The GTX 1050 pushes
out some decent performance You have to run it at a lower-than-native resolution But light-to-moderately demanding titles are very playable on this device There are reports that the 15 inch
version with the GTX 1060 is actually pulling more power than
the AC adapter can supply So it's actually draining batteries while you're using it That doesn't happen on the 13 inch version
because this is running a 1050 Slightly less power drain, so yeah. If you want to play games on this device I mean, neither of them are a good choice But the issue doesn't happen on the 13 inch version The speakers. Surprisingly, these
have been improved this year They're not as good as the 13 inch MacBook Pro speakers, but they sound pretty good And they're positioned well, you get really nice stereo separation - The webcam is really good. It's actually
one of the best webcams I've seen on a laptop. The mic quality
sounds pretty good as well Battery life on this thing is very good I'm getting around 10 hours of use
with the screen at 250 nits Now, this is with it in laptop mode. With the screen removed and just using it as a clipboard, I'm only getting around three hours This has a 23 watt hour battery inside the screen, and I think 67 watt hour battery inside the base But overall, good battery life It'll easily last you the full day, and for people that aren't familiar with how the charging works You can charge the tablet by itself or you
can connect the tablet to the keyboard and just charge the base and everything
will charge up altogether The drive speeds are a mixed bag The read speeds are fast but the
write speeds are a little bit slow The thermals are good The temperatures are comfortable
both in tablet and laptop mode The fan noise under max load is a little bit loud But it's kind of expected considering the size of the chassis, so there's a lot of stuff I like about the Surface Book 2, but the big things are not so much the CPU and the GPU upgrades It's the little things, like the things like the
speakers, the keyboard, the trackpad Things that they didn't have to change but they tweaked it anyways because they're just trying to make a better product overall and I really like that That being said, there are things
that I dislike about this thing And the first one, the big one, is the price. Now the price When you first look at this thing seems very expensive It's $2,000 for a 13-inch laptop with a
U processor and a GTX 1050 If you spent that money on something like an XPS 15 You'd get something that's more powerful, but the reason why it costs this much is because Microsoft is the only company making
something like this No one else makes something like this and The reason why is because it's super hard to engineer this hinge And it's super hard to engineer this
device to have a CPU up top and the GPU on the bottom because if it wasn't hard, you bet that Huawei or Xiaomi would make something like this for a lot less money But they aren't because they can't, and
that is why they can charge whatever they want to. I don't like the price I still feel like it's like 10, 15 percent
more than it should be Because this is such a good product if it was more appropriately priced, more reasonably priced I think a lot of people could make great use of this But we can't because it's just a little bit another
price range for a lot of people which is unfortunate. The other thing I don't like about this thing, is the lack of a Thunderbolt 3 port. So it has a decent port selection, two USB 3.0's, an SD card slot and a USB-C But it doesn't support Thunderbolt 3
and that really bugs me because, this is a device that costs as much as it does and It's their flagship products, right? Every single other manufacturer out there who's making flagship laptops has
Thunderbolt 3 support in 2017 and it just lets you connect to faster
storage, external GPUs, 4K displays or at least multiple 4K displays There's just a lot of good features that
come with Thunderbolt 3 And it seems so weird that they didn't include it Now, the omission of Thunderbolt 3 feels almost purposeful like they did it with intent
and that's what bugs me Like, are they waiting for the Surface Book 3 to
come out so they can sell that or Was it something like cost-saving measure? I have no idea, but it doesn't make sense to me as to why they didn't include such a ubiquitously useful port in late 2017, and I guess that leads to my last thing I don't love about it. The AC adapter they include is a proprietary connector, and it would have been nice if they 
included a USB-C adapter You can charge it through that port, you just
need to supply your own adapter So overall, great device You just got to make sure that you're using it to its full purpose because, if you're buying this and you're not making use of the tablet And you're not making use of the
detach ability and all that, then there are probably cheaper devices that would have been a better fit, but
if you can make use of it and you can afford its relatively high
price tag, you're gonna enjoy it. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! 
Oh [Music] hey how's it going Dave 2d here so this is the 2018 LG gram and this is a device that gets updated pretty frequently the last update was in like December of 2017 three months later we have another update but this particular update has been one of the more substantial ones actually changed quite a bit of the hardware now this one is the 15-inch LG gram and actually think this is one of the more unique laptops that LG makes because they're sticking the you processor into a large screen to chassis which I actually think is really useful for a lot of people people that just want like a bigger screen without paying for really expensive processors this is a really good choice for them so they've made some nice changes but there's actually a problem this laptop that other reviewers don't seem to be talking about we'll get there but first I'm gonna go through some stuff that hasn't changed so the chassis I think this is pretty much the exact same chassis as the previous generation but it now has the new mil standard 810g and it looks like serious business right there's a green shield and it just makes you feel like there's a degree of durability that this laptop has and it does but I just don't think that particular specification is very stringent like there's a lot of products out there that can get that certification because it's not that hard you know what to say that this isn't a well-built laptop it is considering its weight but keep in mind that its main advantage is that it's a really lightweight laptop and every time I pick this thing up it feels impossibly light especially for something with a 15-inch screen but they have to use weaker materials to reach that weight okay something I've always disliked about the LG gram is just how difficult it is to get into this laptop it's the removal of eight screws but you got to remove a bunch of feet like rubber feet that don't easily go back on because it's using double-sided tape and it's like there's just a lot of stuff you have to do to get into this laptop it's possible but you have to be careful not to break any of the tabs now once you're inside you'll see that the speaker's look like they've been upgraded and they have technically but they sound pretty much exactly the same as a previous generation a little bit louder but the sound quality is still not good I really wish they had properly upgraded the speaker's because this room there's plenty of room in there for some bigger or better speakers but yeah we're stuck with some pretty weak speakers the keyboard also hasn't changed it's not a great keyboard anything it's decent it's just not the best keyboard out there for an ultrabook it's got good spacing backlighting and a good layout but I just find that the key mechanisms are a little bit softer than I'd like another thing that hasn't changed is the charging so this thing uses a barrel plug and they include one a barrel plug AC adapter but I feel like at this price point they should include a USBC charger because it does support USB C charging now the last thing that hasn't changed from the previous version is the screen it's a good screen 1080p touch panel decent color accuracy I wish it was brighter it's not that as dim but in 2018 we're just seeing a lot more ultra ebooks coming out with brighter and better screens this one's still good but there are better displays at this price point okay let's talk about things that have changed the big one for me is the trackpad so it's always had a decent feeling surface with a good mechanism but it now uses Windows precision drivers so the tracking and the gestures are just a little bit more accurate the webcam has been moved so it's always been on the bottom like right along the hinge it's now at the top of the panel kind of like a more traditional spot I don't think the image quality is amazing or anything but it's a respectable webcam for people that need it a nice little refresh they did was to change the location of the fingerprint sensor it's now on the power button not on the top of the trackpad or anymore it's I think a better location but I don't think it makes a world of a difference ok the biggest change in my opinion is the inclusion of a Thunderbolt 3 port so now this thing supports Thunderbolt 3 but the weird thing is they didn't change like the printing on the side of the device like it doesn't have the Thunderbolt symbol on it it's just your regular use BC symbol and instead they've stuck a Thunderbolt 3 sticker on the top of the keyboard the other thing they've changed inside is they've added a bigger battery so this thing now has a 72 watt hour battery which is pretty large for an ultrabook and I'm able to get around eight and a half or nine hours of battery life on a single charge that's with the screen at 250 nits and if you're wondering why the battery life isn't longer considering how big the battery is it's simply because it's a bigger screen 15 inch screen needs more juice to run their claims have sixteen and a half hours on their website uses a pretty unrealistic benchmark so take that number with a grain of salt okay let's talk about performance and I think this is where this laptop has may be an issue depending on what you use this thing for so this is a device that uses an eighth gen you processor and if you're doing regular stuff that you would earn Ultrabook it's great good performance great multi-core performance it's a good laptop the problem comes when you want to play games on this thing so the default card isn't very good it's a UHD 620 it's not great for playing games so whatever but cuz this thing has a Thunderbolt 3 port I connected an external GPU to this thing and the performance is disappointing so this is the problem this laptop was not designed for the CPU to run at Full Tilt's for extended periods of times when you plug an external GPU to this thing you hope for some kickass performance but I got some serious throttling to the point where it just was unusable as a gaming setup the problem is the single fan it's fine for an ultrabook doing Ultrabook things but it's not if you're going to be using the Thunderbolt 3 port so if you look at other devices like the Razer Blade self that has two fans XPS 13 that has two fans even the HP Envy which doesn't have great thermals has two fans pretty much every Ultrabook that has a Thunderbolt 3 port that can connect to an external GPU has two fans because when you're playing games on a thermally Traut CPU it's terrible and honestly I feel like LG just got lazy I feel like they slapped a Thunderbolt 3 port on this machine just so they could say they had one but they didn't spend the time to do it properly they didn't improve the thermals and it's a bit of a shame because this thing's got a lot of good hardware if the thermal solution was better like it's got 16 gigs of RAM to nvme drives and it's got four lanes of PCIe support on that Thunderbolt 3 port it's just not a great gaming setup because of the thermal solution so depending on what you want to use this laptop for if you want to use it just for like ultrabook stuff it's awesome the fan is quiet and the thermals are good it's a great laptop for productivity a little overpriced but it's great but if you're looking to pick this thing up and connecting it to an external GPU for playing games and stuff like that this is not a great device for that ok hope you guys enjoy this video thumbs we liked it subs we loved it see you guys next time [Music] 
Hey! how's it going Dave [2d] here? And this is a video [on] the surface laptop and whether or not it's overpriced So when the thing launched I think a lot of people were very excited about it because it looks really cool but then when the price was revealed people were Disappointed because it seemed a little bit more expensive than it should have been now It's a surface device so the whole surface product line has always been a little bit more expensive It's a more premium product line So it's to be expected [now] if you take a look at the build quality the exterior build quality is fantastic I would say that the fit and finish of this thing is comparable to the macbooks It's a better finish than the XPs 13. It's a better finish than the razer blade stealth better than HP lenovo it literally has the best build quality in any windows laptop that I've seen to date for this 13-inch screen size the Hinge feels well tuned and it's durable you can open the lid with one hand really easily and it has this really Satisfying snap when it closes shut the exhaust is well machined it feels really precise and the whole device is made from aluminum Not magnesium like some other surface products the interior build quality is different. It's good It's just not as impressive to me the material here the Alcantara it feels awesome It's really nice to hold and the material is adhered to the laptop [really] well I tried to pick at it to see if I could peel it off It is stuck down really well, but like I mentioned in my previous video We'll have to see how well it holds up over time it does feel slightly different from the Alcantara Surface Pro keyboard So maybe it's more resistant to wear and tear The keyboard itself feels good. It's not perfect to me. There's some flex on a keyboard deck that it didn't expect to be there It's supposed to have a unibody construction, so I thought would just feel a little more rigid to be clear I do enjoy typing on it It's just the build quality is not as good as the exterior the trackpad is also really nice glass surface precision drivers I mean surface track pads are always done well and this one's on point as expected now the Trackpad and typing experience feel oddly similar to the surface pro experience And that's weird right because a surface pro is a type pad cover and the surface laptop is a regular fold-out laptop keyboard It's good it's just not as good as I was hoping to be and in terms of the operating system windows 10s like the [gimped] version of Windows 10 If you're watching this video obviously you're somewhat enthusiastic about technology, and if you are windows 10s is not for you now Don't hate on it. I think [10s] is going to have some great benefits for certain users It's just that it's not for you. You should probably do that free upgrade to Windows 10 pro. The screen is good I brought a spider there to get some readings on the panel It's not a controlled environment, but color accuracy seemed pretty good often double check these numbers in my full review the webcam supports windows Hello
So you can log in with your face and the image quality isn't bad The drive speeds are not as I expected [so] during the presentation they mentioned that they were using onboard ssd So ssds that were baked right into the motherboard to provide better power efficiency and better speeds They're using Toshiba drives And they are pretty powerful especially for the smaller drive read speeds aren't bad the small capacity drives are slower But the right speeds these numbers are disappointing to say the least that 128 gig drive in particular I wasn't able to try all the different configurations. So some of those numbers are pulled from Toshiba Spec sheet It's not that the right speeds are super terrible It's just that for a device that's launching in miD-2017 you want something a little bit faster I was just hoping for something a little bit faster now This laptop is obviously not designed for everyone there are plenty of laptops out there that are geared for everyone This thing is not It's geared for someone who's looking for really good build quality and a unique aesthetic, and I think in that front they've nailed it But the question is whether or not it's worth it and this is where I could look confusing Microsoft launched this thing at the base model for $1000 which on paper Thousand dollars for a brand new Microsoft surface laptop doesn't [seem] [that] bad and then you look at the specs and then you're like Wtf this seems really expensive when you compare this thousand dollar base model to the competitors is just not a compelling purchase It's made well, and it looks super cool But the specs aren't there and the other thing Unless you have a really undemanding workflow four gigs of ram and 128 gigs of storage is going to feel Anemic to say the least the Mid Tier model priced at [$1,300] That's a good one And I think Microsoft knows this that's the one that's going to sell the best because that's the one they have all the different colors For and it's priced the most competitively when you compare pricing for [that] one. There's still a premium to be paid for them I soft surface branding, but it's more comparable value to its competitors and at that configuration I think it is worth it because you're getting Ridiculously good build quality and if you happen to have an educational discount it gets even better Now in terms of the I7 models I mean, they're better performers, but I just don't think they have as good of a value at that mid to your model Hope you guys enjoyed this video I'll [be] doing a full review But hope because of this video you guys have a better understanding of why surface laptops are priced the way They are thumbs we like this video subs if you loved it. See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And this is obviously a very different looking video and different sounding video. Everything on this thing is being recorded on the iPhone 8 Plus. And... Everyone knows that the camera on the iPhone 8 Plus is probably one of its best features So I thought what's the best way to test it What's the best way to really showcase what it can do... I have decided Like an idiot, to get shot by a paintball. Potentially multiple paintball is coming on how hard it hurts and I have my friend here, James. He's gonna... suit up. We're gonna just... Here's the thing, I'm not wearing much protective gear If anything, I'm wearing a mask because it's probably legal I'm wearing a headband so I don't get like, welts on my head. That's it, I'm gonna wear a sweatshirt but no like, literal protective gear. I have to be honest I'm very uncomfortable at this. I feel like this is gonna hurt. I haven't been shot many times by paintballs before, but not at this distance and certainly not with like, any kind of motion. Every single ball that comes out of this marker is gonna pelt me. It's gonna hurt. Alright! Ready? You gotta, you gotta get it like right- This feels so uncomfortable! Okay, wait wait wait wait wait wait! You're pretty sure you can hit it? As good as I can be with a paintball gun, man. Okay, now I gonna zip up. Ready? Okay, go! That's just not- that didn't hurt that much! This will! (Wait, stop!) (when you stub your toe) Ah! Stop! (when you see the price tag of the iPhone X) Okay. Auuuuugh, that lit up! We're okay. The hell bruised! That's pretty good aim! Alright. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it!
See you guys next time! That was easy, man! 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here so Nvidia partnered with me for this video They're giving away a bunch of GTX 10 series gaming laptops And they actually sent this one out to me the amasai GSC to showcase what these laptops are capable of so these all have 10 series graphics cards inside them which is the current generation of graphics cards from Nvidia, and these are extremely powerful? These are literally Two and a half or three times more powerful than the previous generation that kind of jump in GPU perforins was never seen before so It's really cool that they had them this year this one in particular is a four pound machine. It's super powerful gtx 1070 120 hertz screen packed with lots of ram storage space and a light-up RGB keyboard so you can switch between four different zones It is a very powerful gaming laptop and very capable for doing other things like video editing and any kind of 3d Application or work on the go now two years ago This kind of technology just straight-up didn't exist if you wanted this kind of performance and this kind of power in any machine it would Have to be a desktop now You're able to play triple-a titles at like 60 90 frames per second 120 frames per second While being super portable this fits into your backpack and when you're ready to go just bust it out and do some work play some Games stream whatever you want the fact that I can bring this into a coffee shop Pull it out and just crush it and overwatch is just crazy this thing has enough power so you can play competitively in triple-a shooters on the go who doesn't want that now in videos give away a bunch of GTX 10 series laptops It's called the game ready everywhere contest that runs from November 27th for about a month I think it ends at the end of the year so December 31st I believe it's really simple to enter take a picture of your laptop in a place that you'd like to build to play games Post it on Twitter and tag me in it Dave TD TV as well as NVIDIA GeForce and add the hashtag Game ready everywhere and NVIDIA would choose two winners every week over the course of the month who will win GTX 10 series laptop So you'll be able to get something. That's just gonna crush it in games now Here's the kicker from my audience you guys get a special I guess second entry at the end of the contest if you guys didn't win one of the two laptops every week You will be eligible to win one of Two of these so they're giving away two msi g s6 t3 specifically to my subscribers So if you tagged me in that twitter post you got an extra chance at winning This specific laptop and the odds of winning this thing are pretty decent for like a twenty four hundred dollar laptop Which is crazy? This is a really good gaming laptop. It's super quiet. You're gonna Love this thing okay, all the contest details are going to be below. If there's any kind of additional information I'll link it down in the video description I hope you guys enjoyed this video and good luck because I really want you guys to be winning a lot of those laptops So think of em away thumbs, if you like this video subs we loved it. See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here, so this is a Razer Mamba Hyper Flux This is their new wireless mouse that uses inductive charging to power this thing And I don't do mice reviews like this is not my thing on channels, but because I like this thing so much I thought I'd do a quick video about it. So this is literally the best gaming mouse that I've used so far ever and The thing that I like about it that makes it special is just how lightweight It is so what makes this different from other inductively charged wireless mice is the fact that there's no battery in this thing It's a completely Battery free device that has a capacitor which I don't think those are technically batteries But it does hold the charge through a capacitor, but because there's no heavy battery in there It's incredibly light and its really good for first-person shooter, so I like my mice really light and this thing fits the bill So I've used a lot of wireless mice before obviously and I've used Wireless mice that use conductive pad So I've used the Logitech they think they call it the power play, and I've also used the Corsair They call it the dart core thing is every single wireless mouse that have ever used that uses inductive charging has This weight to it, and I like weighted mice for like just work and just regular stuff But when it comes to playing games I absolutely love light my system comes in at 96 grams to put this in perspective there are Wireless mice out there that have I think like 120 150 gram weights. This is super lightweight and when you're playing a shooter It's just like it just moves around real quick real smooth completely wireless mouse it's just an awesome gaming experience now the way this thing works is you have a mat they call this the Firefly copper flux and You connect it to your computer, so this thing is actually wired But your mouse sits on top and through induction it charges the capacitor inside this mouse so the charge on this thing lasts about 20 seconds maybe 30 seconds it's not very long, but you basically always have it on the mat And when it's on the mouse mat it never runs out of power it basically uses the mat to sustain itself so you can kind Of keep using it for indefinitely now this thing can be used in a wired mode So you would unplug the cable from the mousepad and connect it directly into the mouse and it's just basically to give it some extra functionality if you want to travel with this thing like you wouldn't bring the Mousepad with you you just bring the mouse in the cable And it'll work the hyper flux mechanism to power everything actually feels pretty good. You feel reliable more reliable I thought like a wireless connection would feel, but yeah, I really like this system so this Matt It's reversible so you have two sides. I don't if you saw a video of mine earlier there was like a razer mousepad that had a flippable surface and both sides were hard surfaces this has a hard surface and a soft surface I prefer the soft kind of cloth feeling side but both materials are pretty good and the mat lights up So it's got RGB lighting. I think this is unique to this system like the power play and the dark core systems Don't light up like this, but it's 2018. It's a razer product You kind of expect that I mean would this even be a Razer product if it didn't light up an RGB um I don't think that the lights look Obnoxious or anything like that because at CES I was a little bit worried the demo booth was really dark and the lights were just like glowing Like crazy these are fully customizable in the software and you can control brightness and stuff so you can basically Light it up to your heart's content, or just keep it kind of muted. The mouse itself, so this is using the 3360 sensor It's a pretty popular sensor amongst high-end mice 16,000 dpi at the top-end, it's fully controllable, and it's a very responsive sensor a lot of people like it I personally find it extremely comfortable to hold it's definitely comfortable for palm grip users I can't speak for claw grippers because I'm not a natural claw gripper I feel like it would work, but I feel like there's better shape than this for claw grips I also like the rubber on the side I think this is something that a lot of the recent Razer mice have so this kind of horizontal pattern I just find it more comfortable to hold than the dotted pattern that my older SteelSeries 300 Mouse had The buttons are very razor ish I feel like most people are gonna like these buttons They're a little bit stiffer than the Death Adder buttons not as stiff as the SteelSeries Rival 300 ones They're very light, but not too light. Now there are some things I don't like and a lot of these dislikes stem from the fact that this is a very expensive mouse. It's $250 It's literally one of the most expensive mice. Maybe the most expensive - I've ever seen and Let's start with the first one I wish that the scroll wheel had some kind of tension Adjustment because we've seen that tech and some of razor's other mice It would have been nice to seen it in this. The other thing is I wish this thing had a weight adjustment So I understand that this whole thing is supposed to be a super lightweight Mouse that really is what defines this Mouse But for some people that prefer a heavier mouse it would have been nice that you could kind of increase the weight of this for people that I don't know for like MOBA players and stuff that do prefer heavier mice And they don't allow that so it kind of limits that customizability of this mouse But there's not that much else I dislike about this thing I wish it came in white obviously, but yeah It's a really slick Mouse and of all the gaming mouse that I've tried. This is seriously my favorite. That's $250 it's obviously not for everyone, but if you're on that hunt for that perfect gaming mouse That's got that performance of a wired mouse and the physical feel of a wired mouse But has that freedom of a wireless mouse check this thing out. It's awesome ok. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs of you loved it. See you guys next time 
Okay the office tour that no one asked for hey How's it going Dave2D here and this is a tour of my office now? This isn't my studio. This isn't where I shoot my youtube videos normally It's actually my home, and this is like the office space in my house now. It's a very small space This isn't like glamorous or anything like that and it's very functional I didn't curate this scene to make it look extra cool or anything. This is literally how I work Originally this room was meant to have two setups one for my wife one for myself But because I just have so much crap it ended up being my office so right now, we have two set ups Let's start off with this one over here this is the Mac setup, I would say that this is the one that I use the most frequently when it comes to working on YouTube stuff just because I like the Mac OS System for just my personal use so we have the ten core Mac Pro. This is a 2013 Mac Pro I would love to use the iMac in here but it's just way too expensive to really justify the cost for myself and The big reason for me is I much prefer the widescreen stuff when it comes to content creation It's really difficult for me To switch from something wide like this to a regular sixteen by nine panel that you see on the iMac Pro this is running a ten core CPU 64 gigs of ram and we have your standard kind of Mac input devices the Apple keyboard Apple trackpad and actually this is not the Apple Mouse. This is the Logitech MX Anywhere 2 s great Mouse And this is something that is just really clean really simple gets the job done now in terms of the accessories that I uses this thing I Don't have speakers on this thing so this monitor the LG 308UC99 Fantastic monitor it has speakers built-in so I often use that but if I need something that's a little more private I use air pods with this particular setup, and we have a boost ball for people that know anything about adidas boost and then we have just a standard four gigabyte backup Drive that I use This is a Bluetooth speaker from Nixon not particularly great, but I got it for free I like it so I use it and that basically wraps up this area. No. There's one last thing it's the Belkin wireless charging pad, which I use if I'm using the ten in this area the Tables are desks. Whatever you want to call these things. They are from West Elm. I forget the name I'll find the link and put it in the video description I'll link all the stuff in the video description if you guys are interested okay moving along we have the PC setup now I purposefully chose to Cripple my PC set of people that follow my channel know that I lack self-control when it comes to playing games So this thing is a powerful PC for video editing But the thing is those devices are often very good for playing games. I feel like I've had gaming peripherals this thing would not be used for work very much I would just be playing games all the time so What I've done is actually have wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse and these peripherals are actually great for just regular work and productivity But they're not ideal for playing games and when I do play games like I don't try to play competitively on these so this is the drive Oh caliber keyboard great wireless keyboard RGB Backlighting with switchable key caps and these are the cyan key caps from GM k and we have the MX master 2 SMS so these Devices are great for a Productivity just what I want to do with this thing but they aren't perfect for competitive gaming so the mousepad is a SteelSeries white mouse pad and The pc itself if you've seen my older video on the hype beast supreme pc This is that machine, but I've stripped the red paint because it was just getting a little too obnoxious and again I did that PC for fun. I'm not like huge on supreme, but it's cleaned up a little bit There are some parts that I couldn't remove the paint as cleanly But I really like this case it's the Loki ghost s1 case And I just decided to use that for this particular setup ok the monitor is an alienware 34 inch curved screen the reason why I'm using this monitor is it's 120 Hertz g-sync, it's a fantastic gaming monitor But it's also one of the few gaming waters that are Super super color accurate this thing's basically is color accurate as any monitor that are own for content creation so to round up this area We have a backup drive. This is the Seagate 8 terabyte drive. I really like this thing one cable no, AC adapter the USB C plugs up right to your PC or your laptop or your Mac whatever and single cable backup Ps4 which I occasionally use input into this thing and this is I've never actually done a video on this thing But this is the MIDI fighter 64 from DJ tech tools You've probably seen videos from like Sean sabe that have done some crazy stuff with this I picked this up to just have fun with it and potentially make some music for intros and stuff like that But I haven't gone round to doing much with it Yes, okay, if you'll notice neither of these setups actually have speakers, so I'm actually running wireless headphones on both So you saw the air pods on that and this one I'm running the B&amp;O wireless headphones what you use for video editing and some Casual gaming. It's some nice wireless headphones. Okay moving along. I did it for you anything here, No okay moving along backpack I'll probably do a video like a what's my backpack video in the future but Moving on to this side so this area here is where I do like charging, I guess It's not really a charging area But I just place my phones here and other devices that need to be charged so the phones I'm using right now we have the pixel to excell the 1 + 5 t and the iPhone 10 if I had to choose one that I use the Most frequently right now is probably iPhone 10. Just goes my family and friends most of them are on, iOS We have batteries so the battery packs that I'm using right now are Ankur battery packs. This isn't sponsor or anything They're literally the ones that I've purchased both of these they're both pretty beefy ones 20,000 milliamps the others 10,000 milliamps And the bigger ones it capable of charging laptops and stuff because it has power delivery which is pretty cool We have Nintendo switch which to be honest. I don't use that much for your often the last thing this room I guess I think this is the last piece. It's the Google home Mini So this is something that I've grown to like more and more over time it's just a really simple 50 dollar device that gives you home automation and just Assistant features and stuff like that. It's pretty cool. That basically wraps it up I should know what to chairs, so there's two chairs in here these are There okay, I got to be honest. They look really cool, but they're not for everyone because they are very stiff They're not like super comfortable chairs these are from a company called pentatonix, and it's called the air tool But what makes these chair special is that the entire chair is made from recycled materials? So I kind of feel a little bit better about myself using them and that basically wraps it up. This is the office tour of My house ok. Thanks for watching. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs. You liked it subs of you loves it See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here so this is a video on the Mx 150, the new laptop GPU from Nvidia and There's a little bit confusion with this chip because the naming system isn't normal the whole Mx and then number isn't something they've done before in the past so I thought I would do a little video that kind of talks about the GPU This is a Laptop GPU that was derived from the same chip as the desktop GT 1030, but it's surprisingly faster Which is weird right because this is the laptop version, so a few days ago I did a video on this thing the acer aspire 5 and I showcase some games playing at 1080p on high graphics settings and a lot of people were interested in this thing But they wanted to see other games at other resolutions other graphics settings So I thought I'd just kind of spend some time in the weekend played a ton of games I have some more data lightweight titles are handled easily on this GPU so shooters mobas, whatever you want you'll comfortably be able to hit 60 frames per second at 1080p on Ultra Graphics even something like Diablo 3 which can get Graphically intense will float above 70 frames per second with overwatch at 1080p I had to drop it to high settings to keep good frame rates, but it still looks really good Games that are more demanding. You'll have to drop it to medium settings at 1080p To stay close to sixty frames per second and remember you always have the option of lowering your resolution to keep your framerate up But let's step back for a moment a lot of these games are triple-a titles these are Flagship games are often used to benchmarks high-end desktop graphics and now a six hundred dollar laptop Can play a lot of them at 60 frames per second that's crazy The thing that this thing replaced like the GPU that this thing replaced is called the 940 Mx and that thing could not handle most of these games at 1080p This is really cool. There are limitations though the Heaviest Games like witcher 3 and Gta 5 they can still run but you have to put it the lowest resolution And graphic settings just to keep up smooth frame rates So yeah, if you're only going to be playing these ultra demanding games Then you're going to need a better GPU something like PUBG dusting is not a well optimised game So you'll need to lower the resolution and graphics settings to make it smooth Overall I'm really impressed with the Mx 150. It's a lower-end GPU that's designed to fit into the whole mid tier laptop segment But the performance is surprisingly good. It really is twice as good as a 940 Mx. That's replacing It's kind of in-between the 950 m and 960 m from last year but it's not as good as the GTX 1050 and I'm not saying this is the greatest GPU ever but these $600 mid-tier laptops are very capable for gaming. Now I want to mention a few other things first the CPU and GPU Combination that you see in this thing is actually pretty common for this particular GPU so it's a 7200U It's a Kaby lake CPU and the Mx 150 and when you look at the internals you'll often see a single heat pipe and at First you might think oh my God This is terrible a single heat pipe for both components But remember this is a 15, watt CPU a lot of gaming laptops have quad-Core 45 Watt CPU that just produce a lot more heat so the thermal management on this thing is actually very sufficient Another thing if you'll notice I don't have an FPS counter in any of my game footage And if you're wondering why it's because this CPU isn't great for recording while playing games the moment I start recording the frame rates drop a good seven to ten frames per second And I didn't want to have you know inaccurate frame rates reading up at the top So you'll have to refer the graphs for performance, but if you're looking to pick up this laptop to stream It's not a good idea And the last thing I want to mention is that this thing does not have shadow play so in the menu There's often this feature by Nvidia that allows you to record gameplay While you're playing that feature seems to be disabled on the Mx 150. I don't think it's specific to this laptop I think it's across all the Mx 150 laptops, but yeah, it's missing. Okay, so that's it for this video Hope it cleared some things up some of you liked it subs if you loved it. See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And this is the Acer Nitro 5. Now, this is a laptop That's geared towards that whole inexpensive gaming market. It's 900 bucks. It's got a GTX 1050 Ti, 256 gigs of SSD and a Kaby Lake chip in here. I mean, There's a lot of stuff that I like about this thing, but if you'll notice the title of this video, I don't openly recommend this thing to everybody and the reason why is because I feel like there's a better option than this for people who are actually interested in this and it's not because this is a bad laptop, This is actually a very good laptop But as you'll see, there's something a little bit better than this So the things that I do like about it. First, I really like the build quality. This thing looks less gamer, I should say? Than the average cheap gaming laptop, so it has a red strip down here But it's not that bright cherry red, it's more like a muted metallic burgundy color. It's still red It's not my favorite thing but I think it's a lot better than a lot of gaming laptops and Everything else on the top at least is black, even that logo, the Acer logo is just simple black and the components they've chosen in here are good. The 1050 Ti Is that sweet spot for inexpensive 1080p gaming The port selection is pretty standard for this price. You're getting three USB-A's and one USB-C, not Thunderbolt 3 though I like the screen, it's not amazing. It's an IPS screen, and it looks not bad. I mean it's a $900 gaming laptop You're not gonna get 4K color accurate screens at this price, so yeah I'm happy with the screen. The keyboard and the trackpad are also both good. The keyboard is comfortable to use, nice layout. The one thing That's a little bit weird on the layout is that the Shift and the Up arrow are really close together now I personally didn't have any issues using it but I think it'll depend on how your Keyboard habits are if you- I don't know, if you hit your shift in a particular way You might hit the Up arrow at the same time But I don't have any issues Trackpad is also really good, Windows Precision drivers Acer has totally gone into the whole Windows Precision driver thing They don't use anymore Elan or Synaptics drivers from what I've seen recently, so that's really nice The speakers are located on the bottom, and they don't sound terrible or anything, they don't sound great But it's a $900 gaming laptop. They kind of sound as you would expect The build quality in the Nitro 5 is good It's got a metal top panel, but everything else is plastic including the bottom panel, but all the plastic parts feel good There's access to the 2.5 inch SATA drive and the RAM slots through some hatches But if you want to go deeper, you can remove the whole panel. The batteries down here It's a 48 watt hour battery, and I'm getting a little bit less than four hours of battery life And that's with the screen at 250 nits. It's so depending what you do You'll be around there. Now so far everything sounds good, right? Everything seems proper on this laptop But this is my one issue with this thing. The thermal design is... Not ideal, so if you look over here You can see the CPU and the GPU and there's two heat pipes that pull heat away from these chips Which are cooled with these two fans And I don't like seeing game laptops designed like this So on a regular laptop that doesn't have a ton of thermal output This is fine because I mean, it's a very effective and space efficient way of cooling things down but on a gaming laptop with the GTX 1050 Ti This is not ideal And what ends up happening is that the heat from the CPU Has to travel along this pipe pass the GPU before we get cooled by the two fans And if you use your laptop for a really long time, the CPU builds up heat. Now the VX 15 is another inexpensive laptop from Acer and that thing has a much better thermal design to me There's still two heat pipes and two fans But because the two fans are located on opposite ends, each fan is gonna pull heat more readily from the closer chip And you just get better thermal performance Now if all you're doing is just browsing the web or just doing light stuff or even playing games for just really short bursts for like 15-20 minutes, then you literally will never notice it. You will not see any kind of thermal issues But if you play games for a long time like over an hour You'll notice that the CPU temperature starts to creep up and up and eventually you'll hit that wall. The one thermal advantage that I would say the Nitro 5 has is that it does have "CoolBoost" technology which is basically built-in software to allow you to control the fans. Now, the VX 15 does not have that and this does and it can be helpful. The thing is you can always get like third-party software to control the fans But this has it straight from the factory. So the fan on is on this thing at idle is not very loud It's actually quite quiet, on load it's a little bit louder, audible, but not too bad, but with CoolBoost on, this thing is quite loud And it's still not good enough to maintain really high clock speeds for extended periods of time despite it being super loud So here's the thing, for $900, the market is very competitive right now There's a lot of good options to choose from, the VX 15 the Dell 7567, the upcoming 7577. This thing, the Nitro 5, they're all like kind of in that market So if you're going to make a laptop that competes with this stuff, if you're gonna spend the time and the resources Like Acer did, to make the Nitro 5 a brand new laptop Why like, why not make it something just more different? There's nothing about this thing that makes it a compelling purchase Okay, I take that back. There's two things that are unique about this, that don't matter to me But I, to be fair I need to just kind of put this out there for full disclosure This thing has a design like a visual design That's better than the other laptops that it competes with The red isn't super obnoxious and the rest of it is pretty simple The screen is also ever so slightly better than the VX 15 and the Dell 7567 screen They're all IPS, but this one's just a little bit brighter, a little bit more color accurate We're talking like 2 or 3%, so if those things are important to you And you don't mind the thermal issues, sure, go for this thing, but for most people, I wouldn't recommend this. The Acer VX 15 is just better all-around. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time! 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here? so this is a laptop with Nvidia's new Max-Q design specifically the Asus GX501 and well here's thing for years ever since like gaming laptops existed people have been trying to find that perfect balance between power and portability and honestly It doesn't really exist because when you have a gaming laptop it's usually thick or Loud or thick and loud until now Nvidia's Max-Q approach is an approach to building a laptop That's thin and quiet and powerful Basically they're building the perfect laptop so everything from the GPU to the drivers to the thermal components the electrical components Everything is geared towards this Max-Q approach And it's essentially all about efficiency So first let's talk about the GPU it's a GTX 1080 chip it has all the cuda Cores all the memory But it's clocked slower They've reduced the clock speed a bit before this Max-Q approach But the trade-off is a very nice reduction in power consumption so in terms of total wattage a regular GTX 1080 laptop will pull maybe 250 260 Watts under full load this laptop pulls 171 Watts Under Full Load And that's like a 90 watt difference which means smaller AC adapters for portability and less heat output and when you have less heat to deal with you can make your laptops thinner your fans don't need to work as hard and on the Asus Zephyrus the bottom actually opens up when you lift the screen which allows for better air flow Now this machine is running some very early drivers But I'm just curious to see how we do for benchmarks the Max-Q design Zephyrus is about 13 to 15 percent slower than a regular laptop GTX 1080 which is around what I expected and it's about 10 Maybe 12 percent faster than a GTX 1070 laptop So it kind of sits between the two in terms of just broad performance But the thing is the fans on this laptop are super quiet in comparison to anything else on this chart It's so weird to see this kind of performance in something this quiet Now I wanted to focus on Nvidia's Max-Q design for this video But because I've been using this for a while I thought I'd give it kind of like a mini review The build quality is really good. It's a premium asus device I think it's the best-looking laptop that asus has ever made there's lots of brushed aluminum Great materials with just a hint of gamer DNA. It doesn't have any like red racing striped and stuff. It has a solid port selection for a 15-inch laptop, but there's no SD slot if you're looking for one. The nvme drive inside is really fast its upgradable But it's not easy to open it up. The thermals are comfortable when playing games But Max-Q does limit the thermal output automatically. The configuration of the top deck here is obviously a little bit different They've shifted the keyboard down for better component, airflow. It has customizable backlighting and the keys have pretty short travel It's very chickity I am comfortable gaming on it But I don't think it's ideal for typing a ton of stuff. Now because it's positioned so close to the bottom of the keyboard asus Includes a wrist rest. I didn't find it useful I mean, I found it comfortable enough to use without but everyone's Gonna be a little bit different the trackpad/keypad I find it super cool switches between the two it uses windows precision drivers with good tracking and when it's a number-Pad mode it's Very accurate it's obviously positioned a little weird being on the side, but I got used to it quickly I am right-handed though. The speakers are pretty nice and because of how quiet the system is even under load you can totally rely on them for games. It houses a 50 watt hour battery underneath the keyboard and battery life is short I'm getting three hours of battery life with my regular test, but that's just the nature of a thin and light high performance laptop There's no more room in there for a bigger battery So I played a lot of games on the Zephyrus and it just crushes them at 1080p With the G-Sync panel games look super smooth at 120 Hertz. It's just a very enjoyable gaming experience almost every single First-person shooter is going to play really well in this system Open-World games tend to be a bit more demanding, but even those play pretty well You won't be able to hit 120 frames per second on every Open-World game at Max graphics But if you reduce it to high the screen can show off that sweet refresh rate again. Video editing is also awesome on this laptop. A lot of laptops with high-end CPUs and high-end GPUs can be loud in premiere because that's just the way video editing is it's CPU intensive its GPU intensive, but with a Max- Q laptop It's quiet But you still get kick-ass performance. The other thing is that the zephyrs is low-key enough to use in a library or a coffee shop If you want to go out there and you want to play some games no one would bat an eye these laptops are so quiet and unassuming The Max-Q approach to laptop design obviously isn't for everyone Some people don't care about how thin their laptops are. Some people don't care about how loud the fans are. They just want pure performance and for those people the full fat GTX 1080 laptops a little bit thick but those will deliver great performance better performance than this But if you're looking for thin and light and powerful and quiet Nvidia Max Q delivers. This thing is seriously laptop dream material. 
Hey, how's it gone Dave 2D here and in front of me is a very small computer case It's one of the smallest cases you can get out there that can hold a full-size graphics card And if you'll notice in the front of it It's got supreme on it's a supreme Themed computer case now if you don't know what supreme is there a New York based skate brand they have this iconic look to their stuff with this white font against a bright red background and their stuff can be crazy expensive I customized this case to match their branding, but to understand where this thing came from and why it's Exists I have to go into story time, but let's start with the very beginning This is a case that is called the ghost s1 it's made by a company called Loque and They're Swedish company and now they hit me up a couple months ago on ok we have this really small case you like small cases You want to check it out, and I was like yeah Send it over when it's ready, and the thing is I receive a lot of cases small ITX cases the majority of them Just aren't impressive to me They're kind of like rehashes of one another but this one is really cool, and I actually think it's one of the best No, I'm just gonna say It's my favorite ITX case that I've ever used so this is why not only is this in a small case it's a modular case so the base like this little small box here can hold an ITEX on the board and SFX power supply and a full sized GPU but the case also has these modular pieces available that they call top hats and these basically Allow you to extend the height of the case vertically so by itself I'm just running mine without a top hat it'll hold everything that you need for just like basic air cooling But if you want to have bigger fans Or if you want to do something a little more advanced like water cooling or if your system requires water cooling they have different sized top hats available and because these components are modular you can run these top hats on the bottom or Underneath if you want to put your water cooling or your fans on the bottom of the case now for me personally I like to keep my builds as small as possible, so I'm running this without any top hats And I'm getting temperatures that are actually very similar to my old case the end case m1 so all the component that were inside here It's running an 8 core Rison 7 600 watt power Supply GTX 1080 32 gigs of ram and an nvme and everything was just straight-up Transplanted into this case now this thing is running a knock to a cooler at the L 965 and that can comfortably handle stock speeds, I just tend not to overclock my smaller bills But the crazy thing is that even with this smaller case I'm getting the same temperatures as the N case m1 which is like 40 or 50 percent bigger than this case so the airflow on this thing is obviously very good But it's not just that they've whole case design the way they give you cut out so you can run your cables and stuff It's just a really well-designed case now another thing I really liked about this thing is how easy it was to build into it so the top lid pops off It's magnetically attached and the side panels pop off really easily. It's surprisingly easy to build into this case despite It being so small just because of how well the whole thing has been designed now the last thing I love about the same is the build quality so small ITF cases like those boutique ITX cases they tend to be expensive and they tend to be really well built That's just the nature of the whole like boutique ITX case but the ghost s1 has Noticeably thicker panels than the N case m1 and the end case m1 was already a really well-built case is actually one of my favorite cases before this one came out But this one is just that much better now as for the reason why it's red and how this came to be so this is the story I Built into this case and have really liked it like I liked it so much that I was thinking I should use this case as My main rig so I thought hey why don't I make a custom Dave 2d case? And I was just gonna paint it blue, and I had these decals ready to put them up front But I go to Home Depot, and you wouldn't believe it They had every single color possible in the spray paint section Except for the one color that is most similar to my logo color which is like they call it seaside I think so I called up other Home Depot's and no one seemed to have the color in stock which is super annoying But then I thought what can I do with this? Array of colors to choose from and I just went with the red because it's something that doesn't go on my channel But I thought I would make something that just was a little bit different, and then the idea pops into my head Why don't I just make a supreme themed computer because I don't think it's been done before. I don't think someone's built a Supreme computer like at least not a little tiny one like this so I kind of thought it through and just went with it So this is what we have a supreme themed computer now this case is I? Really like it. This is not an endorsement pay me to say this This is literally my favorite ideas case that I've built in I think for a lot of people that enjoy ITX cases They're gonna like the now There's a couple things that need to be tweaked still like this is a Kickstarter project That is fully funded at this point I think today is when the Kickstarter ended so it's unfortunate that I'm telling you guys about this thing after The Kickstarter is over, but you can still purchase this thing through regular retail channels I'll put all the links for that stuff below, but the one thing that I would say is Really interesting is that during the Kickstarter process? they had a bunch of prototypes that they sent out to people and I found that the few things that I Had issues with like the power supply that I used didn't fit exactly into the framing is off by 0.5 millimeters or so so I email them and they're like hey we ready to know about this issue we're gonna fix it in the retail version so they have this list of tweaks and adjustments that they want to do to the retail version that my Pre-production and your new example didn't have but even in this kind of early form I really enjoyed this case little details like the pull tab on the top panel give it a more premium feel and Even the light up front is really subtle and elegant. It's not like this obnoxiously bright RGB LED or sound like that It's just a really elegant case. I think a lot of people like it now obviously this isn't for everyone It's an expensive case and then this thing goes for like 250 u.s.. But if you're in the market for a nice looking case this thing looks good now I have this thing actually set up at my office I have it set up with a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse and everyone knows this mouse It's the MX master 2s, but this keyboard is a new pickup It's made by a company called Revo or Dremel and actually got it as a Christmas gift, and it looks awesome It's like a wireless or wired keyboard whatever you want, and it's got RGB backlighting chemical keys 60 bucks Can't go wrong with that. Okay that basically wraps it up I'll put all the information for the keyboard the mouse and obviously all the stuff. That's in here down below Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs. You liked it subs. We loved it. See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. So Razer just announced their new product, the Razer Phone. And I've been using their engineering sample for a little bit, I thought I'd share some of my thoughts with you guys now I don't feel like it was an unexpected product announcement they did purchase the Nextbit company a little while ago and if you don't remember them they made the Robin phone this was an Interesting phone, I felt like it was one of my favorite looking phones from last year But it fell short on the technical perspective the razer phone is a completely different beast in terms of the insides It's got similar aesthetics I mean it's boxy and it's got I dunno the same kind of vibe to it. Now the Robin was a colorful plastic phone But the razer phone is black. It's all metal and feels very tanky squared off corners with a very beefy feel to the device It's got an industrial look, but it's comfortable to use. The Razer logo is on the back And it's pretty subtle it's black and silver nothing crazy, and it's not lit with RGB or anything like that There is if I'm not mistaken a limited edition Green logo that you can get like if you're one of the earlier adopters you can pick up one with a green Razer logo Which is kind of cool the buttons on this thing are really nice. It's a very tactile click when you press it You can really feel when it activates and the fingerprint scanner is just like on the Robin side-mounted power switch with the fingerprint scanner built-in It looks kind of small because the power button is just this oval instead of a circle, but it works fast and it's reliable. It is a flagship phone, it's running the Snapdragon 835 which is a really capable processor It's got 64 gigs of storage expandable with micro sd and I haven't been able to test the cameras But the back is running two 12 megapixel shooters one shoots wide one shoots zoomed They're both mounted top left with a little bit of a protrusion the selfie cam up front is 8 megapixels But let's switch gears and talk about what makes this phone Special and the first thing is the screen this is a 5.7 inch screen It's an igzo panel wide color gamut, but it's 120 Hertz now This isn't the first phone out there with 120 Hertz panel But because it's razer and because their products are usually geared towards gaming. This is gonna make for an amazing Gaming experience high refresh rate on mobile devices is not common But when you combine that with a fast processor you get a really smooth Visual experience you're able to see twice as any frames as before so every animation or movement in games Or just even the UI will look really clean now. This is something That's hard to showcase in my YouTube videos because I shoot at 24 frames per second And this is happening at 120 frames per second But even the system UI feels incredibly smooth and games that can support the high refresh rate are gonna look awesome The speaker's up front are really good They're stereo speakers one on each side and they're front-facing so it's just really good location. They get loud There's dual amplifiers in here and the sound quality is quite good. There's no headphone jack though There's a USB C port for both charging and for use PC headphones But they also include an adapter for use PC to the regular 3.5 millimeter jack There is also a THX certified DAC in here for really high quality Audio output this thing has eight gigs of ram which is a ton there's a lot of laptops and even desktops that still have eight gigs of ram and whether or not It's useful really depends on how razer manages the memory if they have a really aggressive memory management Then it won't be but I feel like they'll just let the apps sit in memory And I'll be fine because it has so much memory They also have a big battery in here 4000mAh and supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0+ We're looking at a 50% charge in less than 15 minutes It's quite impressive so 4000mAh power battery with quick charge time Can't go around with that right phone overall is quite impressive. The specs are really cool I mean the 120 Hertz panel looks. It looks nice as for the pricing 700 bucks It's not the cheapest phone, but with hardware like this. You kind of expect it to be at that price I'm gonna be doing a more thorough review once I get my retail unit in just kind of spend more time with it But that's basically it a first look at the razer phone. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if You loved it. See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going? Dave 2D here. So CES day 1 I got to check out a couple events. Now, before I get into that stuff I need to talk about the image quality of what you're looking at. I'm shooting this on a smartphone. I actually went to CES very light this year. I brought two smartphones: Pixel 2XL, and an iPhone X. And the image quality is significantly worse than I thought it would be. So a lot of event spaces are dark. I knew they'd be dark, expected it, but I just thought the image quality on these new smartphone cameras would just be a little bit better, and it's just, it's just bad. I apologize in advance. OK, first thing I went into was the Acer event. They have a couple of new devices this year. The one that stood out to me was the Acer Swift 7. So this has been updated, but it's now a little bit thinner, a little bit, just better across the board. And this is a really well-built ultra-thin laptop. It is literally the thinnest laptop in the world right now. 8.98 millimeters, and it's a 14 inch screen, but a really nice keyboard. So, a lot of devices that are this thin just have to compromise on the keyboard, just the typing experience isn't very good. This feels like a regular Ultrabook, with nice key travel, back-lit keys and everything. The thing that's a little bit weird about this keyboard is the backspace key. So if you look up the top here that delete is Right beside the backspace so if you're not used to the keyboard it might be a little bit weird the trackpad Does not click so there's a tap mechanism? But there's no actual physical movement when you tap there's literally no tactile response when you tap it It's just like tapping But it's a very good trackpad, Windows Precision drivers The whole laptop though is surprisingly expensive. This was $1,700 and it's I mean the market for this thing has got to be really nice, but if you're looking for someone That's really thin, and you want something. That's literally the thinnest laptop in the world right now. This is it There's also 4G LTE built right into the laptop so we can use a nano SIM or Isom And you can basically have this thing connected to the Internet all the time without needing to tether it to your phone or anything like that
Now the thing that might be a deal-breaker for some people is that this thing is using a seventh gen Intel CPU and I thought? A little bit weird because 8th gen is already here, but for devices that are this small and this portable I don't think there's gonna be a big difference between 7th and 8th gen performance now another thing that I saw was the new Acer Nitro 5 and what makes this thing special and it's running an AMD CPU the Verizon 5 and an upcoming AMD GPU now the actual GPU is undetermined But it's going to give performance similar to the GTX 1050 or the 1050 Ti so that kind of budget gaming laptop range? If you have other things like the Chromebook They have this blue Chromebook with USB C port which is kind of cool if you're into that stuff But that's basically the gist of the Acer event so another thing I went to was the Samsung event and they had this huge TV that they call the wall and what makes this one special Well, it's 8k micro LED. It looks incredible a lot of like the OLED and Q LED TVs Just look really good But this one's probably the nicest one I've ever seen but the thing that really Impressed me about this thing was the AI so they have this technology for other TVs Not just this one, but a lot of their higher-end TVs this year But they use it as an algorithm to basically upscale lower res footage into 8k So they can take some crappy 480p footage look at this database kind of figure out what needs to be upscaled and how to upscale each Component with this algorithm, and then push it out in what seemingly is 8k content, which is crazy the last thing I saw was another really big screen It's the Nvidia BFG displays, which is probably a reference to doom, but they actually call it a big format gaming display It's basically the 65 inch TV shaped object, which is it's essentially a TV? But the panel is amazing for gaming It's actually not meant for TV like it's not geared towards having the best image quality for media consumption But it's freaking amazing for gameplay, so they have this thing connected up to a PC and they were demoing destiny, too And it just looked really really good like you're looking at 4k 120 Hertz really low response rate It's basically a giant high-end gaming monitor with g-sync. It looks it looks so good so it's always gonna gear to everyone it's more for people that are building like some kind of like man cave and they want just a single display to do all of Their gaming on so console gaming PC gaming and obviously it's got streaming capabilities, but it's got HDR support And they have this really cool demo where in destiny - there's NPC that's welding but because of the high brightness on this man I think it hits a thousand nits the spark on the welders tool was super bright It was actually this Blinding brightness that was emitted because of how bright the screen can get and it's all g-sync and able to allow for some really smooth 120 Hertz gameplay But it's gonna be expensive They didn't release pricing it depending on the partner you're gonna purchase it from like Asus is making one Acer HP Omen is making one. They're all going to be price. I imagine, but they certainly won't be cheap I'm looking for screen like that though like that's something. I really want for myself Assuming it's not too expensive, but yeah, okay, so that's basically CSD one again I apologize for this amazingly high res and crispy footage I'll see you guys in the next video at CES 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here. This is a video about the Note 8 and it's a video that I didn't really want to make in the beginning. I kind of want to skip the whole Note 8 thing because I'm not super interested in the phone personally but as a YouTuber who genuinely gives a sh*t about my audience and I want you guys to make good purchase decisions, I felt like I had to do this video. Let's talk about the S8 first, the Galaxy S8. This is a phone that I would consider to be one of the best phones of 2017. The hardware in this thing is so good that any time anyone does a video about any phone in 2017, someone's gonna bring up the fact that this thing has better hardware for a similar price or better hardware for a cheaper price like... It's got the best hardware in the business in terms of features and specs and all that stuff. The Note 8 is a variant of the S8 in the sense that it has a lot of the same features but they've added a few things; it has extra RAM, a bigger screen but the two most important differences are the S Pen and a new camera and for the people that aren't aware about what these features are the S Pen is a stylus for the Note series of phones from Samsung that allow you to kind of draw and write and annotate things on the phone screen which is really cool It's not for everyone but it's a really neat feature and the new thing for the Note 8 this year are the dual cameras. So, there's one regular lens, one zoom lens and both of them with optical image stabilization I think that's a first in this industry having both lenses with hardware image stabilization there are some other software tweaks like App Pair* which lets you quick launch two apps into split-screen. That's pretty cool and there's some tweaks for the S Pen that allow you to write on the screen and then that animated version of what you just wrote will appear on someone else's phone but the two main headlining features are the existence of the S Pen and the two lenses for the camera that both have optical image stabilization. The screen is larger by 0.1 inches. It is noticeable if you kind of stick them beside each other and compare the two but... I mean don't make that be the reason why you purchased the Note 8. It's.. it is bigger but it's not significant. The extra RAM on here; the extra 2 gigs of RAM... so this thing's got 6 gigs of RAM I want to say that it doesn't matter but for some people especially if you load a lot of games at once and you have them concurrently playing, it can make a difference but for most people the extra two gigs of RAM will not make a difference at all The camera on the S8 Plus was already amazing it's one of the best smartphone cameras on the market. This new dual lens camera on the Note 8 is more for depth effects and portrait modes and just kind of zoom photography it is a zoom lens and the idea of a secondary zoom lens is cool... I mean it's extra utility when you want to use it and it gives the ability to take some shots that you couldn't do before but unless you're a very particular type of user and you're hardcore into photography, you probably won't use it that much... I mean you think you will and you want to use it a lot but you probably won't. That's just the nature of any of the secondary lenses on these cameras and the same kind of thing goes for the S Pen. Samsung's pen is literally the best stylus on the market for any kind of phone and... I mean it feels really good the texture's cool.. It's not like plastic on glass it feels.. not like paper but it feels nice and the implementation is done really well. It's instant it's cool and I think a lot of people love the idea of it but they don't use it that often because it's not that useful. Now there are some people who are just absolutely fans of the Galaxy Note line and for them the S Pen Is crucial for their everyday work flow but I think for most people it's not and if you're one of those people... I mean if you're one of those hardcore Galaxy Note people this video is not for you. You're already gonna purchase this phone even before the event even launched you wanted this phone since the Note 7 exploded but for the people that are kind of on the fence and are curious about this phone, this video is more for you Okay, so we have great hardware in the Note 8 and it's got some extra features over the S8 Plus that are optional. so, what's the problem, right? The problem is the price on Amazon right now or Best Buy, The S8 Plus goes for $675 it's not a cheap phone by any means but it's a very reasonably priced phone and you're getting a lot of good hardware for the money. This phone starts off contract at $930 up to $960 depending on who you purchased it from which is a lot of money it's like what $250? $260 more than the S8 Plus? Like... that's a lot of money and what are you getting for it? Well, you're getting a few more features but remember the S8 Plus is already packed to the gills with amazing features The Note 8 has a couple more but it has a smaller battery life and.. I don't know I think for most people, it's just not worth the difference in price so what's going on here? Maybe Samsung needs to recoup the costs From the Note 7 issues. Maybe they want to keep the prices high to remain competitive at least financially or visually with Apple I'm not sure what it is but whatever the reason Is for the high price, consumers get screwed. For whoever's buying this thing at full retail price for $930 or $950, that's just not cool. The other thing that kills me is the marketing so Samsung invited a lot of YouTubers out to their Samsung event in New York City the other day and they invited me. Thank you Samsung for inviting me I couldn't go. I was super busy with work but the thing that kind of makes it weird Is that the sheer number of YouTubers out there at the event means that there's going to be a lot of reviews about this phone and I think for the most part people are going to be kind of glazing over the issue of the price because... I mean this is a very very expensive phone. So, there's nothing wrong with this phone I won't need to reiterate the fact that this is a great phone the Note 8 has fantastic hardware but it's really overpriced. So, if you're gonna purchase this thing make sure you're buying it for the right reasons. Make sure you're doing your research and understanding the two main features that are on this phone are things that you would actually use and not just things that look cool because the marketing is done well. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here So this is a review on the mid 2017 HP Omen so this thing has been redesigned for this year The old model, the 2016 model that kind of carried over to early 2017 That was a very generic looking laptop. This one It looks less generic but I feel like a lot of the design language has been inspired from companies like acer or Lenovo. This doesn't look super HP to me But it's a well-built laptop. The paneling is solid, most of it is plastic. The hinge also seems really good despite the location I mean, I normally don't like seeing hinges close together like this they tend to wear out a little bit faster But this one feels good, and you can open it with one hand. There's a lot of red on this laptop It's your classic black and red gaming laptop. The color schemes not my jam, but for some people that do like this color scheme I think it looks alright. the port selection is pretty solid here. There's an sd Card slot usb threes, and you also have two display outputs Ethernet and a usb C But despite this Thunderbolt 3 looking symbol. There's no Thunderbolt 3 action to be had unless you pay for that $20 upgrade The keyboard is pretty good the keys are a little softer than I'd like but layout is good Backlighting is red for most of the keyboard but just a handful of white leds under the wasd keys the trackpad uses of synaptic drivers I really wish they'd gone with windows precision drivers here the tracking is ok like there's the occasional hiccup But I didn't have issues with gestures or tapping it also has dedicated buttons for clicking so you might or might not like that Ok let's talk about the display if you're actually interested in purchasing this thing you should probably pay attention here So the base model is dim it has poor color accuracy and quite frankly. It sucks. It's one of the worst screens I've seen on a 15-inch gaming laptop. The 4k panel is good. But unless you're using this laptop exclusively for concentration I'd skip the screen. It's also, not cheap. The only display that I really like is 120 hertz 1080P panel It's a $60 upgrade But it's just so much better than the base panel and games look a lot better when they're being played in 120 Hertz The default Webcam looks ok you can upgrade for 20 bucks, but even the base model supports windows hello for Speedy logins The internals of the laptop are pretty easy to access There's a handful of screws this configuration has a two and a half inch sata drive and an M2 ssd The ssd is a pm nine six one, so it'll have pretty quick speeds and this configuration has eight gigs of Ram You can install up to 32 gigs the battery down here is 70 watt hours Which is a relatively large battery for a gaming laptop, but battery life isn't great I'm getting around five hours of use with my regular test Which is kind of weird because this is a bigger battery than the previous generation But I'm getting very similar numbers in terms of performance. This is running a GTX 1050 ti And it's getting great performance as expected the 1050 Ti is basically the sweet spot for Price to performance on gaming laptops. You can play most triple-a titles at 60 frames per second with great image quality It's only the heavier titles that struggle a little bit now if you want to see more benchmarks for this gPU there's a link in the video description There's another configuration of the omen with the GTX 1060 Max-Q, and I guess would be their top-of-the-line model I've mentioned this in Previous videos But if you're going to do max Q you got to do it right you got to build the entire laptop from the ground up With Max Q design in mind if you take a pre-existing Chassis, and you just stick a max cube chip in there You're not getting the benefits of what Max q can do you're still getting a thick laptop. You're still getting a pretty loud laptop There's no point now in terms of fan noise on the Ti version It's actually pretty good unload It doesn't get too loud But for whatever reason when it's idling the fans kick in more often than I'd expect even with cool sense of there's also No, fan control in their software But thermal performances otherwise really good it Handles stress tests well and overall the thermal design on the new omen is quite a bit better than the previous generation the Speakers fire from underneath the laptop, and they actually sound pretty good They also get really loud obviously sound quality goes to hell when you crank it But if you need that volume this thing can do it so with the new mid 2017 HP omen? We're looking at a laptop with a metal keyboard deck, but plastic everywhere else It has good detailing and build quality it has several screen options but I highly recommend getting 120 Hertz panel the backlit keyboard is also well laid out and Comfortable to type on the trackpad has dedicated buttons and synaptic drivers Which are just okay there's occasional tracking lag inside the i7 and the GTX 1050ti have strong gaming performance Temperatures are good But the fan control is a little aggressive and comes on more than I'd like the two ram slots and the two drive bays are easy to access for upgrades and the 70 watt hour battery although big doesn't give the best battery life now if I only focus on the merits of the HP omen I would say that this is a good laptop right it's got good performance Really good build quality and if you choose the right screen games look good on it The thing is the pricing is not very good the base model with a GTX 1050 I mean, that's to me the minimum card that you should get on this it's $1,100 with a pretty poor screen the model with a 1050 Ti and the 120 Hertz panel you're going to break $1200 so in general this is not a good value for a laptop I would consider this kind of in the middle of a bunch the thing is HP laptops have usually been really well priced But not right now competition is too Fierce If you're looking to get this definitely get the 120 Hertz panel I think you're still getting okay value at that point, but any of the other options. I wouldn't do it Okay some to be like this video subs if you loved it. See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here. So this is the Acer Aspire 5 now? This is a laptop That is surprisingly, not marketed as a gaming laptop But it's very capable at playing most triple-a titles in 2017 now this thing goes for $600 that's the retail price. I think occasionally it might hit 550 on Amazon I'll drop a link below for just the most accurate pricing, but this thing has the new NVIdia Geforce MX 150 So this is their graphics cards that kind of replaces the 940 Mx It's kind of like a mobile version of the gT 1030 and it's pretty good.   Build quality on this thing is not bad It's mostly plastic Grooved finish up top the keyboard deck is aluminum with a bit of flex if you're putting a lot of pressure on it But nothing abnormal. It's got a good hinge design kind of one hand openable if you go slowly enough It's relatively thin and light for a 15-inch laptop and the overall build quality was better than I thought it would be for the price The Port Selection is good it has a standard array of USB 3 The standards to me are the usb c  port doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 but that's expected And there's also an ethernet port which isn't common at all for laptops in this price range Accessing the internals is pretty easy for the two and a half inch drive and the memory you can use these hatches the configuration I'm running comes with a total of 8 gigs of ram. If you've removed the whole bottom panel You can change the Wi-Fi card and the SSD the included SSD uses a Sata interface I don't think this laptop can handle pcie drives I tried a couple and they didn't seem to work the battery down here is a 48 watt hour battery and I'm getting a little Bit over five hours of battery life Now, I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that this is running new processors These are just more energy efficient than a lot of the quad-core CPUs that we see in 15-inch laptops But yeah battery life on this thing pretty good the screen is ok it's not amazing It's an IPs panel with mediocre color Gamut brightness is not bad I mean it could be better but for indoor use it's not an issue viewing Angles are pretty good And there's no significant backlight bleed obviously this isn't the best screen out there, but for the money It's pretty good. The speakers are located on the bottom and well I got to be honest they sound below average for a 15-inch laptop despite this true Harmony branding on the sticker They get reasonably loud, but the audio quality isn't great the keyboard is actually really nice for a $600 laptop The screen falls all the way flat Good to know.  If you've never used a keyboard with a number-Pad The positioning is a little bit weird the keys are responsive and the layout is comfortable But it doesn't have backlighting. Now part of me is glad that it didn't stick red leds into this to make it into some gaming Thing but for some people no backlighting will be a deal-breaker. Not a big deal for me And if you're using it for school or for most work unless you work like it's in the batcave or something then it should be Okay
It has a windows precision trackpad which I like.  Tracking is great Gestures are responsive. The button clicks feel a little shallow and the surface is a smooth simple plastic. It's not textured It's not glass, but the overall trackpad experience is good And it's really nice to see inexpensive laptops like this using good trackpad software.  Now if there's one gripe I have about this whole system. It's the amount of bloatware they have installed It's only a 5 minute job to nuke at all, but every time I see Norton pre-installed on a computer I die a little bit on the inside. Alright, let's talk about performance. The Mx 150 is a 25 Wide TDP Chip that's similar in Power consumption to the 940 Mx from the previous generation But this time the performance is significantly better. On some benchmarks, We're looking at pretty much double the performance. You realize how crazy that is. In one year, this category of GPU has doubled in Performance at the same Wattage. Like that's super impressive. 10 series GPUs, thumbs up! It's not some crazy gPU pushing out 4K games, but this is the first $600 laptop that I could comfortably play games on. Now the drivers are still relatively new but here are some frame rates from games You're looking at performance that is better than the 950 m and really close to the 960 m from last year Now this laptop uses a 2 core CPU so some games might feel a little choked if they're more CPU dependent and same with video Editing even 1080p video edits won't do great on this just because of the CPU but in general I think it's a very good pairing between the i5 and the Mx150 There's no heavy throttling when I was running stress tests and thermal management is also good the internal and external Temperatures are comfortable. Fan noise is also quieter than normal. These new processors are pretty easy to cool Ok so here's the deal the aspire 5 starts at $400, but the configuration I'm running comes in at $600. For the money, you're getting a laptop with a plastic Chassis and mostly plastic paneling But with a very respectable build quality. You get a 1080 screen that has reasonable brightness But mediocre color gamut and color accuracy. The keyboard is comfortable, types well, and it's got an aluminum deck But sadly has no backlighting. The trackpad works nicely. There's nothing I really dislike about it Inside the CPU and GPU are well matched with each other the combo is great for school or work and it delivers good performance for light to moderately demanding games the ram and storage are easily replaced and Lastly we have a 48 watt hour battery that can squeeze about five hours of battery life So I think Acer did a really good job in the Aspire. I think for $600 This is a surprisingly good laptop but the question some people might have is do you purchase this for 600 or do you get one of the $800 gaming laptops and those have a GTX 1050.  Obviously, there's a relatively big difference in price But this thing is also a lot thinner and lighter than those so if weight is a consideration for you if you need to travel Frequently with your gaming laptop. Take a look at this thing. I think this is really good for the money. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here I think for a lot of people, this will be the laptop that they want. So a lot of people are looking for that laptop that's thin and light, that doesn't cost too much, and, can play some games! This is that one. So if this is what you're looking for, stick around. This is the new laptop from Asus, it's called the UX331. It's their ZenBook and what makes this thing special, what makes this video what it is, is the fact that this thing is running a MX150 in a very light and portable package. Now it's not the thinnest laptop out there, obviously there are thinner ultrabooks than this. But this thing is relatively thin, but they've given it enough room to allow for a proper thermal solution because there is a decent GPU inside this thing. Okay, I'm just gonna go through some things that I do like about this laptop and then maybe touch on some points that I don't like about it. In no particular order, the build quality in this thing is quite good. It is a $1000 device So you'd expect devices at this price to have good build quality and it does deliver. The screen has a little more flex to it I feel than the older UX330, but aside from that, great build quality. Other things I like, the trackpad. This is one of the better trackpads I've seen from Asus. It's glass, great texture, super smooth, with Windows Precision drivers. You can't get much better than this on a Windows laptop. There's also a fingerprint sensor on the side if you're into using Windows Hello to login. And the screen is also surprisingly good. It's really bright, it's pretty color accurate, and the viewing angles are good. I do wish the hinge was a little bit stiffer, it's just got a little more play than I would like but, good screen otherwise. It's a little bit of work to get inside, you do have to remove the bottom feet, and remove some screws. But inside you can replace the SSD. The one that they include is a little slow, it's a SATA drive. So, if you want to, you can switch this thing to an NVMe drive. But there's not much else that you can replace in here. The battery down here is only 50 watt hours, it's not particularly big. It's kind of weird because, you look at a device like this with a 50 watt hour battery and then devices with 60 watt hour batteries with similar screen sizes and this is actually getting slightly better battery life, which is... right? It doesn't really... how are they doing this? I think it's through software optimization, I'm not sure exactly what they're doing, but, I'm getting a 9 and a half hour battery with the screen at 250 nits. The speakers also sound quite good. It's got the Harmon-Kardon branding, and the thing is we've seen a lot of bad speakers hiding behind this branding before Not to diss the brand or anything, but Harmon-Kardon at this point means nothing to me on laptops. But this time round, the sound's really good. It's a clean sound, with a good range and good volume. I do wish the speakers were located at the top instead of the bottom but, It's a good sounding speaker. - The webcam's pretty much garbage. It reminds of the one on the 12 inch MacBook If you use your webcam frequently, then you have to get an external Because, the thing is just terrible. Alright, the feature that makes this laptop the most special is the GPU. It's running an Nvidia MX150, and if you've seen my previous reviews, I've actually even done a dedicated video on the MX150 It is a very impressive card. It is not like the most powerful GPU, that's not what it is, but it doesn't require crazy heatsinks or fans. It still pushes out decent frame rates in games. You can comfortably play basically
any popular title right now As long as you lower the graphics quality of it. So if you are a casual gamer- you know what? Let's not even use that term Even for enthusiasts, you're gonna be fine on an MX150, as long as you don't need really high quality graphics. Now, if you're someone who wants to play GTA 5 with like, 20 mods running, then no, this is not the system for you. But for most people, you're going to be happy with this. The CPU they're running is Intel's 8th Kaby Lake-R And for right application, like if you're running stuff that can take advantage of extra cores, performance is great. The fans on this thing are kind of a mix. On idle, it's completely quiet; it's literally silent, they don't even come on. But when you're doing some intensive stuff, they kick in,
and they don't get too loud or anything But when you're playing games, they get quite loud. And it's actually one of the louder ultrabooks that I've seen in 2018 Now, that's honestly a good thing because remember, we're dealing with a device that puts out a decent amount of heat If you're not pushing out quickly, you're gonna have problems. Now, I did not notice any thermal throttling on this laptop when I was playing games, which is, you know? It's promising, it's good But when I ran some stress tests, I did notice throttling And it's not something that I think will appear for most people's usage scenarios, I think it does seem confined to stress tests, but it is there And depending on what you do, and how demanding your tasks are, It may or may not be an issue, but if you really need some really intensive CPU or GPU stuff, then this is probably not the best laptop for you. For most people, there's no throttling issues I can see. Now, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are couple of things that I don't like. First, is the ports selection. So, it's got an okay port selection It has a USB-C port, but it uses a regular barrel port for charging And I just feel like they missed the opportunity because... Universal charging on the device like this would be awesome Uhh, it also does not support Thunderbolt 3
on that USB-C port, so... I don't know Again, a missed opportunity. I'm sure it keeps the cost down But... it would have been nice. Another thing I don't like is the top surface. So... this has this kind of glass-looking material I'm not sure if it's actually glass But, it just looks tacky and it makes the whole thing look cheaper And, it attracts fingerprints like crazy So you're gonna get smudges and stuff on the top The older one, the UX330 just have like a plain, stainless steel finish and, I like that, but... You know what? This looks like a Chromebook to be honest Like one of those cheaper Chromebooks Come on Asus! You could've done better on this one! Kay, another thing I don't like. This is a big one, The keyboard. This is a keyboard that has a great layout But it's just not as comfortable to use as I would expect. The keystrokes are a little soft, I feel like the magnets on for the switch isn't the best But, I think most people can get used to this keyboard given enough time. Okay, overall, I like this laptop a lot. I think it's a great fit for a lot of people. If you're looking for something that is thin and light, that does not cost too much money, and can play some games on this device, with decent battery life when you're not playing games... This could be the one! Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! 
Hey,  how's it going? Dave2D here! So I want to make a video on the LG G6. And I wanted to do this because, there are a lot of reviewers out there, they're pegging the LG G6 as like, the "inferior phone" to the S8. And I just want to share a slightly different opinion from them. Now, just, full disclosure, both of these phone were given to me. I'm just- this is not a paid video or anything, this is just honest opinions about these phones. So, the S8. It's an amazing phone. Hardware specs are top of the line. The software isn't my favorite, like, I'm a stock Android type of a person. But the hardware is undeniably amazing. The LG G6 was launched before the S8, and there was some hype about it. It was way better than the G5, better than the G4, just an all-round awesome phone. But when you compare it to the S8, it's pretty easy to dismiss the G6 as the weaker phone, just because the design is more conservative, and the hardware specs are weaker. It is cheaper, but a lot of the reviewers are kinda coming to that conclusion/question of, "Yeah the G6 is good, but is it good enough to purchase over the S8?" Now, I'm just trying to say, that if I had to spend my own money on either of these phones, it would be the G6, and here's why. I'm the type of user, and I guess it's kinda weird because I do tech reviews, but when it comes to smartphones, specs don't matter that much to me. If a phone has good usability, and it's really good for what I use my phone for, I'm really happy. But if it has top-of-the-line specs- and it's not very good at doing the bread and butter stuff that I need my phone to do, I'm not going to be happy. And the G6 is better at doing the stuff I want to do than the S8 is. Okay, when I turn on the phone, the facial recognition and the iris stuff works great on the S8, but I still prefer the fingerprint sensor. I unlock my phone when I'm walking the street or when I'm lying in bed or waking up, and I just prefer to hold the phone instead of bringing it up to my face. The G6 has a better location of the fingerprint sensor. The S8, it's fine, it's just not as good. Secondly is the camera. Both have amazing cameras, but on the G6, I like the wide-angle thing, especially with that front-facing camera. I used to think wide-angle stuff was kind of a gimmick, but there are times when I want to get a wide-angle shot, and the G6 does it well. It's not every photo that I want to do this with, but the fact that I have the option is nice to me. Photos on the G6 are a bit over-saturated, you can always shoot it in manual, but overall, really great photos. Now if I zoom in and really stare at the pixels, I would say the S8 is marginally better, but for what I use my smartphone for, the occasional wide-angle functionality just wins it for me. In terms of battery life, the G6 has a bigger battery, but it's also a less-efficient processor than the S8, so battery life felt very similar between them, both have enough battery for a full day of use. Okay, the screen, without a doubt, the infinity screen is, like, the golden feature of the S8. It looks incredible in videos, and it looks even better in real life. It's awesome. The G6 also has a tall screen, it doesn't look as glamorous, but it's also a looker. Taller screens like these are great for multitasking, and having that extra screen real estate is nice. But here's the thing: the curved screen on the S8 is not for me. I know it looks really cool, but I just don't like using it. They did a great job this year with the frame to make that edge way nicer to hold than the S7 Edge, and the palm-rejection is also much improved, but a curved screen is still a curved screen, and media consumption on that is undeniably not awesome. Distortion on the edge just looks weird. The G6 gives you that big screen without the curve. That's not as elegant, and it doesn't look nearly as space age or sleek, but functionally, it's better. The phone fits in my hands better, my eyes appreciate the flat screen more, and it's just straight up practical. A curved screen looks super cool, but just has no purpose on a phone. And this kinda ties into my last thing: the ergonomics. The S8 feels nice, it's a big step up from the S7 Edge, way nicer frame, but when you hold it, I feel like I have to baby it. It feels delicate. And even though it's comfortable to hold, it doesn't feel like I have a solid grip on the phone. The G6 gives the user a much better grip. It's beefier, and it's just a more solid feel to the phone. And when I take this thing in and out of my pocket, 10, 20 times a day, I just much prefer the way that the G6 physically handles. Now there are some things I don't like. For most Android phones, the colors on the screen are a little over-saturated, the G6 isn't amped up like crazy, but LG doesn't have software to adjust this. You can shift the color, but it's always going to have that heavier saturation. Secondly, the headphone jack up on the top. I use wireless headphones most of the time, but I've always preferred audio jacks on the bottom. And the DAC in here is just, like, your standard audio quality. The G6 in Korea, or just certain parts of Asia, will have the higher-quality DAC, but in North America, we're getting boned. The third thing is the price, I think it's priced a little high. In terms of just raw value, when you exclude all the pre-order incentives, I think the S8 has better value. With the G6, there are no headphones in the box. The S8 is a little bit more expensive, but you're getting headphones and more storage. So it's kinda weird to think that a Samsung flagship at $750 is a better deal, but in comparison to this, I think it has slightly better value. Alright, just to close off here, I'm not ripping on the Galaxy S8. I think it's a fantastic phone, I think the hardware is phenomenal. But I don't think that everyone's kind of usage case is the exact same thing. I think a lot of reviewers are painting the S8 as just like, "The best phone, it just trumps the G6." I disagree. For some people, myself included, the G6 is going to be a better phone just because of the user experience. And here's the thing, we're getting to that point where Android phones, like the flagship Android phones, are reaching, like, feature parity. They all have the exact same kind of performance and have just amazing cameras in these really nice builds. So what separates them apart? User experience. And everyone's user experience is going to be slightly different, everyone wants a different experience. I like the G6, I think this is the phone between the two for me, and it may be for you was well. Hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! I'll see you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here! And this a very comprehensive comparison of ultrabooks. And like last year's video, in order for a device to be included into this video, it had to be 3 pounds or less, and it also has to have a real keyboard, like an actual, fold-out, dedicated keyboard. No attachment covers or any kind of, like, gimmicky stuff. Has to be a keyboard that's built-in, because a lot of people that purchase ultrabooks need to be able to use it on their lap or just in areas that just don't have tables. So: three pounds or less, dedicated keyboard. Okay, so no particular order, we have the Dell XPS 13, the 9360. I think this is one of the best-selling ultrabooks on the market right now, this is their second generation of this device. We also have the LG Gram. This is one of the lightest 13" ultrabooks available. The whole LG Gram lineup was nicely updated for 2017, with bigger batteries, better components, and just better build quality all-around. We have the Lenovo Carbon X1. This is one of the best-built devices that Lenovo makes. It has that classic Lenovo keyboard that everyone loves, and that nipple thing that some people love. We have HP Spectre x360. This is the only 2-in-1 device on this list. I think it's the best 2-in-1 flip device on the market, it's an amazing laptop, and for people who want to use it as a tablet as well, you can do that. We also have the Razer Blade Stealth. So this was the device that surprised everyone last year, with the individually-lit keys, great performance, external GPU support, and strangely good value. The Kaby Lake update just made it even better. We also have a Samsung Notebook 9. So this is a device that isn't super popular in North America, but it's incredibly lightweight, it does this by packing a smaller battery, but the overall hardware is good. This one is the Asus ZenBook 3. This is a more premium device, it's one of the more expensive laptops in this comparison, but it delivers solid performance in an extremely compact package. And then we have another Asus, the UX330. This is the cheapest of the devices here, so Asus makes a ton of ultrabooks options, this one just has really good specs for the money. Okay, we have the 12" MacBook. It has the weakest processor here, and it has that single port that so many people love to hate. You're obviouly paying a huge premium to have something this thin and light from Apple, but it is good hardware, and it's still a good fit for some users. Lastly, we have the 13" MacBook Pro. It's nice, but again, it's expensive. The base model is quite a bit more than most devices here, but despite that heavy Apple premium, the hardware is nice. Now there are some devices that didn't make the cut, and here's why. This is the 13" MacBook Air. It's not that it's a bad device, it's under three pounds and it's got a dedicated keyboard. But at this point in time, it's just getting super old. The CPU in here is several generations old, it's not as efficient, and I just think there are better ways to spend your money if you're looking for a thin-and-light ultrabook. Secondly is the Surface Pro 4. Great device, but like I mentioned, to make this video, you need to have a built-in keyboard. And there's also no Surface Book, because it's just too heavy. A really cool device, but I just wouldn't consider it an ultrabook. I also didn't include the XPS 13 2-in-1. So this is also a pretty good device, but I feel like the regular XPS 13 just does everything this does, but better, for the same price. Except for the flip, I mean, if you're really into that flip thing, I would consider a different device instead of this. Okay, let's talk about build. With ultrabooks, weight can be a very important factor when choosing one. And I think a lot of people just choose these things for portability. But build quality and device weight tend to be, like, conflicting things. The better you build it, the heavier it often is, and just vice versa. So it's kinda hard to find the balance between the two, especially when you're trying to find something that's as light as possible. Amongst these, I'd say that the MacBooks are built the best, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse, but they're just really well-built. For the Windows laptops, the XPS 13 is probably the best-built. It's still an ultralight device, but it's not the lightest of the bunch. The Lenovo X1 and the Razer Blade Stealth are also really well-built. And so is the HP Spectre. The lightest with really good build quality is the ZenBook 3, it does have a 12.5" screen, though. But my favorite, in terms of just overall build quality to weight ratio is actually the LG Gram. This thing is super lightweight, but the chassis is surprisingly strong for its size and weight. The screen has some flex, but the keyboard area is super solid. In terms of displays, a lot of these have really nice screens. The two MacBooks have great screens, but as usual, they're expensive. In terms of the Windows machines, my favorite is the XPS 13, but it's close. So many of these panels just look awesome. The Stealth has a QHD screen, but honestly, I feel like in this particular category, just display quality, you can't go wrong with them. Pick any one of these, and you'll be happy with the screen. A few of them have the option to upgrade to higher-quality and higher-resolution displays, it's just a little bit more expensive. If you're looking for a good webcam, so if you do, like, a lot of Skype calls, or video conferencing, the one on the Razer Blade Stealth is pretty good. Keyboards and trackpads are usually a personal preference thing, and my personal favorite is the Lenovo X1. I think it's a keyboard that most people will get used to quickly. The XPS 13 and the HP are also nice to type on, but none of these are bad, I think manufacturers recognize the importance of having a good keyboard on these ultrabooks. Except for maybe the 12" MacBook, I don't love that one. As for trackpads, the MacBook force trackpads are awesome. The XPS 13, the LG Gram, and the Lenovo also have nice trackpads. These ultrabooks have a bunch of processors to choose from, but for regular use, like watching videos, browsing the web, or typing up documents, these feel really similar to each other. I wouldn't worry too much about CPU choice. You can play some lighter games on these ultrabooks, with the HD 620, they're obviously not amazing for 3D stuff, but with the i7, framerates can be playable. If we look at drive speeds, there's a spread again, and depending on what you do, the faster drives can make it feel a little bit faster, but even the slower SATA drives will feel sufficiently fast for most ultrabook stuff, but if you frequently transfer large files, or lots of files, or if you're a heavier photo editor, I would pick up a faster drive. For the most part, they're all properly cooled, when it comes to regular use, but here's a chart for reference. The new Kaby Lake chips are very efficient, and the fans usually don't spin when you're doing regular tasks or even watching videos. The most quiet is the fanless 12" MacBook, that thing is silent. But aside from that, most of these are really quiet. If audio is important to you, the two MacBooks have phenomenal speakers, I still have no idea how they're pushing this kind of volume and/or clarity, they're just really solid speakers. For Windows devices, the Spectre x360 is probably my pick, the Razer Blade Stealth is a distant second. And everything else is an even more distant third. Running my batter loop at 250 nits, the MacBooks always have good battery life, but in terms of Windows machines, the winner here is actually the LG Gram. The XPS 13 and the Razer Blade Stealth are close, and they have similar battery sizes, but this thing just has better software optimization with this battery or something, 'cause I'm consistently getting better battery life with this. In terms of I/O, there's a huge variation in port selection amongst these devices, some of them are comically bad, but the winner to me is the Lenovo X1. Four USB ports, two of them being Thunderbolt 3. And as always, if it has a Thunderbolt 3 connection, you can connect it to an external GPU for gaming. The Razer Core works nicely for the Stealth and some Windows laptops, but the Bizon Box 3 will work for all Thunderbold 3 equipped laptops, including MacBooks. Alright, in terms of pricing and value, here's a list of their current pricing. The one that sticks out is the Asus UX330. It's crazy that you're getting an aluminum ultrabook for that kind of money. Runner-up is the Razer Blade Stealth. It's a bit more expensive, but you're getting better performance. Both of these give fantastic value for the money, and the XPS also has some cheaper configurations as well. Okay, before I wrap it up, there's two wildcard laptops that I haven't talked about yet. First is something made by a company called Xiaomi, it's their Xiaomi Air 12. It's a Chinese company, and they basically mimic- actually no, I should rephrase, they basically completely rip-off Apple's MacBooks. And to be completely honest, they're actually really good value for the hardware. The thing is, they're very difficult to purchase outside of Asia. And if you get one, and when you get it, if anything goes wrong, you're totally screwed. You can't get it repaired, you're going to have to send it back to China, and I mean, that just sounds like a nightmare for most people. If anything goes wrong. So if you have big balls and you want good value, there's an option. The second wildcard is the Surface laptop. Now, I don't my review unit yet, but my early impressions of it, that despite that relatively high pricetag, it is possibly the best-built Windows device in this market segment. And it has really good battery life. So if you're looking for something with a really premium build, take a look at that one. Now if I had to choose a winner amongst these laptops, it would probably be the two MacBooks. :\ I'm kidding. All of the laptops on this list have strengths and weaknesses, but as of today, there's still no universally perfect ultrabook, you're going to have to pick one based on the features that are most important to you. All of these are really good, but my top picks this year, it's a three-way tie. If you want something with good build quality and a nice screen, the XPS 13 is still going strong. If you want something that looks a little better, in my opinion, and you want a little better value, the Razer Blade Stealth is the winner there. It looks extra awesome with some of the new DBrand skins. But the new guy this year with three-way tie in first place is the LG Gram, this thing is a really light device with great battery life, it's what a lot of people are looking for in an ultrabook. Hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time. 
[Music] Hey, how's it going. Dave2D here. So if your looking for a laptop for school or college There's a lot of really good, inexpensive options and I'll probably do a video on those shortly, But if you have a larger budget, like twelve, thirteen hundred dollars You can get something that's really, really premium that'll last you many years and with the new Surface products out right now, I thought I would do a video talking about what I think are the best laptops for students. So we have the Surface Laptop, the fifth generation Surface Pro, the thirteen inch MacBook Pro, The twelve inch MacBook, the XPS 13, and I'll throw in the Razer Blade Stealth Now this isn't an exhaustive list, but in terms of popularity, general availability, and pricing, Those are my picks. Now when you chose a laptop for school, There's a few things that kind of come to my mind, as being really important. And in just no particular order: build quality and portability are some of the more important things You want your laptop to be light, but also last a long time and these all have excellent build quality They're durable enough to toss in and out of your bag without too much worry, And you can get some inexpensive skins to cover them up, so you don't scratch the surface. These are from dbrand. Another important thing is the keyboard. You want something that you actually enjoy using, and you feel comfortable typing on. Now, all of these have great keyboards. It's more about preference. Some people will and some people won't like the MacBook butterfly switches But in general, you'll get comfortable on any of these keyboards. The Surface Pro is a 2 in 1 device with a removable keyboard So, if you're in a classroom that doesn't have a lot of table space, and you're often typing on your lap, I'd probably skip this one and just get a regular clamshell laptop. The other thing, is that most of these don't have dedicated page up or page down keys. You can do the same kinda thing with function up and down, But if you deal with a lot of code or large documents and you want dedicated keys, the Surface products have them. Another thing that I think is important for a college student is, battery life. Your laptop just has to have good battery life. At least for a lot of students because, There is a lot of really good devices out there that have great performance and good value, but they just don't have good battery life and for those devices, I didn't include them in the list because, I don't feel comfortable recommending a device with a 5 hour battery life. The ones here all have full day batteries, so you don't need to bring the chargers with you. Some of these laptops use USB-C to charge, so you can share some chargers, and there's even battery packs that can charge laptops over USB-C now. I'm not going to talk about performance to much because truthfully, you're not buying these laptops for like blistering gaming performance. They do all feel pretty similar in terms of how quick the overall system is and gaming performance is also going to be pretty mediocre But anything with a Thunderbolt 3 port, like the Razer Blade Stealth, can connect to an external GPU for playing games. In terms of pen input, depending on the person you are and the type of courses you're taking, you may or may not find these useful. Personally, I think they're amazing. You can use it for note taking, annotating course materials, drawing, whatever you want. iPad Pro's also have the Apple Pencil, but like I've mentioned in an earlier video, the overall usability of an iPad Pro as your one and only computer, isn't great even in iOS 11. So I don't recommend it as your only device. Without a doubt, the Surface Pro is the king for pen input. The Surface Laptop can do it as well but, it's not as good because it's got a wobbly screen. You kinda have to hold the screen while you write. I mean, it's usable but the Surface Pro was kinda built around the whole idea of pen input. Now I've done individual reviews for all of these, and I'll link them below if you want some more information, but just some quick notes about them. First, the two MacBook's. They're both expensive. Both have awesome screens with great speakers. My only real issues with them, are the USB-C ports. Now, my stance on USB-C has always been pretty positive, especially in 2017. I don't mind Apple being aggressive as they have been, in terms of pushing the whole USB-C thing, But, I don't think its the right choice for students because all it takes is just one time. One time when you need a USB-A port on your device and you just, don't have an adapter. That's gonna suck. But if you can afford a MacBook, and you think can handle the dongle student life, then go for it The new Razer Blade Stealth, with the thirteen inch screen, is actually one of my favorite ultrabooks on the market right now. It's really expensive though, at fourteen hundred dollars. The older model, with the twelve and a half inch screen is nine hundred dollars, so you're definitely getting better value there. But overall, it's a really good device and there's actually nothing I really dislike about the Razer Blade Stealth. Really thick bezels, and the trackpad isn't great on the twelve and a half inch version but it's a solid device. The Dell XPS 13 is also really good. The design has been around for a few years now, so it's a little stale to me, but that's about it. I mean I wish it had pen input. There's an XPS 13 2 in 1 that does have pen input, but I don't really like that device. The regular XPS 13 is boss. And if you're on a tighter budget, you can always get the older versions, like the 9350, for a pretty steep discount, and those still kick ass. Alright, the Surface Laptop was supposed to be built for students and visually, it's appealing with the cool colors and stuff. I do like the keyboard. I like the fantastic screen. I don't like that the screen wobbles when you're using the pen. The other thing I don't like, is the alcantara material. For students, you're often eating and drinking while using your computer, so, it' gonna get gross. And lastly, we have the Surface Pro and I still think that this is the best all around device for students. It's expensive. Especially once you add all like the pens and keyboards and stuff like that, and it's not the prettiest device. It looks okay but its not like super gorgeous, like the Surface Laptop, but it's very versatile. And a lot of the feature set is geared towards students and productivity. Now, I wish it was cheaper. There's always the option of getting the Surface Pro 4, the previous generation, that's a little bit cheaper than this, with really similar qualities. But yeah, I mean, any one of these devices are good. This is still my favorite. [Music] 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. And in front of me are two phones, the Apple iPhone 8 and the 8 Plus. And...if these were the only two phones that Apple put out this year, this video would be a lot easier because I would just give you my honest opinion on these phones, and we'd be done...But that's just not the case. The iPhone X is a couple weeks out. And it makes it difficult to give you an honest opinion on these things, because there's just a bigger and better phone, a few weeks away. So...ok. I'm going to talk about these phones about the things I like and dislike about it, And then we'll kinda get into a more meta-discussion at the end. The things I like the most about these phones, just three big ones, The first is wireless charging. Now, wireless charging is one of those things where you only start to appreciate when you've used it a lot, and I'm surprised Apple took so long to stick it into their phones. But it's finally here. See the thing is with cables like, finding the cable, sticking it into the slot and charging your phone that way, there's something about that extra step of like plugging your phone in that is enough to dissuade everybody around the world to leave their phones half charged very often. It's just, cause we're lazy species or something. Having wireless charging pads is really convenient. The thing is, wireless charging isn't cheap. Apple doesn't include one in the box, you have to buy them. And they're like, 20, 30 bucks at like the mid-tier, and then go up to 50-60. Maybe even more if you want to get some really premium ones, So yeah, it's expensive to equip everything in your life to have wireless charging capabilities, but, it is convenient. The other thing I really like about the iPhone 8 is the processor. And they talked about it a lot during the presentation and the whole A11 Bionic Chip, to the point where I thought that they were overhyping it. But it's very impressive. I think it's the most impressive thing about the phone to me. It benchmarks incredibly fast on multicore stuff. Now, whether or not it really matters, I mean, if you look at any of the phones that this thing beats on that chart, those phones are still super fast. The actual UI feels really smooth on any of these phones. But where this thing will start to make a difference is with Augmented Reality stuff. So that is a very processor heavy application, any kind of AR thing. But right now, in like mid 2017, we're not seeing that much AR stuff being used. Like there's a lot of tech demos and impressive apps... But most of that stuff isn't everyday useful. But give it 8 maybe 12 months, and I think we'll start to see that AR tech kind of trickle down into more everyday stuff. And that's when really powerful multicore chips will start to shine. But right now, it's cool, but it's not super useful. The last feature I want to talk about on the iPhone 8 is the camera, and this was way better than I expected it to be. So, Apple's cameras are always pretty good, but last year, the iPhone 7, I felt like that camera, to me, wasn't as impressive as the Pixel's camera, or the cameras on the Samsung phones. Either the Galaxy or the Note. This camera impressed me. Particularly in low light. I feel like the images are a good blend between what you see in real life, and a bit of software optimization to make it look, a little bit better. The portrait mode on the iPhone 8 Plus is still something I'm not into The tech is good, and they actually do a good job at it, it's just, I never take photos like that. The studio effects on the 8 Plus are pretty cool, and again the tech is impressive, the images look very convincing to me, But I feel like I'm not the target user for this feature. Like, I don't take photos of myself, or my family and friends And kind of wish they were professionally lit. But, the technology is super impressive. So those are the 3 main features about the iPhone 8 that are important to me. The camera, the wireless charging, and the new processor. There's some other stuff, Like TrueTone display, but I want to talk about things that I dislike about the iPhone 8 And the first one, is the design. This is a very long running design, This is year 4 of this shape. And, I think it's the longest running design that Apple has had on an iPhone. And at this point, it's a very iconic look, you recognize it right away because of bigger bezels, And the shape of the phone, but it's super stale. And when a brand new phone from 2017 looks pretty much the same as a phone from 2014, That's no good. The glass material on the back is nice, It's definitely less slippery than the full aluminum on the iPhone 7 It's a nicer material to hold at least, it's still slippery, I don't know if I'd put a skin on it, I mean, it looks like it would crack pretty easily but I do like the colour of it. The white back is cool, but the dark gray one looks really nice to me Another thing I dislike is the cost of all the accessories. So this is Apple, they love selling accessories, but this time around, I feel like it's an extra bitter pill to swallow Because this phone supports fast charging, but they only include a regular wall brick. You have to buy a different adapter and a separate cable to take advantage of fast charging. And I feel like in 2017, every flagship phone out there, if it supports fast charging, it includes the fast charging cable and the wall adapter. But not here. They include...this thing. Ok. None of that matters...Because, the thing that bugs me the most about the iPhone 8 Is the fact that the iPhone X is just around the corner And any conversation that anyone has about the iPhone 8 right now is shaded by the incoming iPhone X And it's not that the iPhone X is a significantly better phone and it just crushes everything, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that, right now, if you're buying a phone, or if you're interested in buying a phone, You're buying a phone that will instantly become quote-unquote, obsolete, the moment the iPhone X comes out. Just because it has a home button and it's not Apple's flagship phone anymore. I mean this is still a good phone, despite...how aged it looks, But it's weird that the iPhone X is going to be the phone that everyone wants. That 's the phone that matters, that's the phone of Apple's future. So it's weird to invest any kind of money into this thing, something we already know is on its way out The home button is gone, we're not going to be using that in the future, So...it feels like a bad investment if you're going to spend money on a phone. Now, not to say that this is a bad phone, these are good phones, but because of the iPhone X, it makes these things significantly less attractive for someone who's enthusiastic about tech. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! 
Hey, how's it going Dave2D here. So, this video is a guide, a guide for people that are interested in purchasing a gaming laptop going into 2018 and it's specifically for a gaming laptops. So, this isn't super comprehensive and I'm just going to talk about something that are important when it comes to the decision process for purchasing a laptop for gaming. So, when it comes to the art of making a laptop, I think manufacturers go through that struggle where they are trying to find that perfect spot between price and performance and portability. It's basically pick 2 of 3. If you want want ultra light portability and really good performance, it exists there's some really thin 1080 Max-Q laptops out there but they're really expensive. So, you got to decide pretty early on in your process of how much money you want to spend and where you want to spend that money. So, cheaper laptops tend to be little bit thicker and heavier and they usually have more plastic materials, which isn't necessarily bad, it's just not as premium feeling or premium looking. But when it comes to the thickness of a laptop, sometimes thicker laptops can have an advantage, because when you have a big laptop to work with, you have bigger heat pipes, you have bigger fans just everything can be a little bit bigger and those things tend to do a better job at removing heat from a system. So, let's take a look at some examples. This is an Alienware 17 this thing is a relatively thick 17 inch gaming laptop and it's quite a bit thicker than the Razer Blade Pro. Now, when this thing first launched this thing had a GTX 1080 in it. It's quite a hot GPU and one of the issues this thing had was keeping up with the thermal output. Here's the thing, when this thing comes out of the factory it's tuned just right. Everything is running fine so the temperatures are acceptable. But the thing is the moment this thing has any kind of like dust buildup, or if you want to play with this thing on your blanket or like on your lap and you are covering up the vents on the bottom, the thermals rise, and it just doesn't do as well. The GTX 1080 on the Alienware, still produces a lot of heat but this laptop is thick like, thick with the cc (thicc ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) and this thing has just a lot more thermal headroom. This thing comes out of the factory running fine as well, but because there's more room in there, there's just more tolerance for dust to build up and stuff like that. So, a device like this because it's thicker, it isn't as elegant-looking, but it'll get you further along when it comes to dust buildup and stuff. You definitely need to take care of a Razer Blade Pro or basically any thin and light gaming laptop. Okay, I want to talk about build quality, I want to go back to build quality. So, basically when it comes to how well gaming laptops are made, in 2017 most laptops are made quite well. There's more emphasis from brands to build things that are thinner and lighter, because that's just what people seem to want right now, but there is still a really good market for bigger laptops, the more durable they tend to last longer and quite frankly, thin and light gaming laptops aren't for everyone, you definitely need to take better care of them. I won't talk about ports too much. I just want to mention a couple things: thunderbolt 3 support is something that's cool on paper, especially if you're into the whole idea of like external GPUs, but in reality they are really expensive to set up. So, it's not something that I think you should really gun for like if your device that you are looking at doesn't have thunderbolt 3 support, I don't think it should make or break the deal. The other thing is, if you're purchasing a device, make sure that the exhaust of the fans isn't on the mouse hand. So, I've used some laptops that the fan exhaust literally right beside your mouse hand and your hands just getting baked while you play and it's no good so avoid that but otherwise ports are a pretty easy decision. Okay, let's talk about CPUs. The Intel U processors have just been refreshed. So, the 8th gen U processors are those Kaby Lake R chips,  those are 15 watt CPUs and despite what companies are trying to tell you, if you're really looking for a dedicated gaming laptop, don't get a U processor, get a H processor. So, the 8th generation H processors are just about to come out and these are 45 watt CPUs that are traditionally quad-core CPUs, but these new Coffee Lake ones are 6 cores and with the new Coffee Lake architecture because of faster clock speeds and the two extra cores, you're going to get some better performance. Now things like multi-core applications are going to be significantly better but, well optimized games should notice some nice boost in performance as well. Ok, let's talk, about graphics cards the Nvidia GTX 10 series GPUs were amazing for laptops They basically brought, they basically changed the entire industry. This whole thing about gaming laptops was basically a joke 3 years ago. Gaming laptops were just, they were stupid you would pay huge amounts of money and not really get the performance that you would need to be able to play the current titles. Nowadays, you can spend like eight, nine hundred bucks on an entry level gaming laptop and depends on the game, but you can float at that 60 frames per second target on ultra graphics for a lot of games. It's pretty crazy, like look at these games, these are triple A titles from Blizzard, Activision, EA, basically the most graphically intensive games are able to run at  really good frame rates on an entry level gaming laptop. That's awesome. Now, as for what's next, it's Nvidia Volta that should probably launch like, late spring, early summer of 2018. So, we got some time but ask yourself. Do you really think you're, gonna need, that extra GPU performance? Like, look at that chart, those are the games are you able to play at 60 frames per second or more with a $900 gaming laptop so yes Volta's gonna be better obviously, but I don't know if we'll really need that extra performance because I feel like we've already hit that sweet spot where inexpensive hardware can play the best titles. Okay, I want to talk about the screen and if you look the screen is one of the most important decisions when it comes to making a laptop decision because when you purchase a GPU, like when you've decided on a GPU and a CPU combination, it doesn't matter which brand you go with, performance is gonna be relatively similar but the screens differ a lot So, my first piece of advice is don't get a 4K screen unless you really need it for content creation or something because when it comes to gaming, you're gonna get better value and just get a better gaming experience if you spend that money on higher quality 1080p screen. A 120 hertz screen is so much better than a 60 hertz screen for gaming. You'll need to be able to push out those 120 frames per second to really appreciate it, but when you do, the gaming experience is just so much smoother. You can react faster, things just look better on screen, it's night and day. Unfortunately, it's one of those things I can't show on this video because you're watching this at 24 frames per second. If you see these things in person you'll love them. The other thing is don't be afraid of a high quality TN panel. I know traditionally TN panels are freaking terrible, they're bad for everything let alone gaming, but the new ones are really good like Acer, MSI, they are using panels on their laptops, that just look gorgeous. I would consider those high quality TN panels significantly better than most IPS panels on gaming laptops. So, check them out and just the direction of the whole industry, I think is gonna moving towards high refresh rate screens, 120 Hertz panels look so much better. Look at this thing, the Razer Blade Pro. This thing launched originally with the GTX 1080 and a 4K 60 Hertz screen. So, games looked really pretty, really color accurate, but they were only capped at 60 Hertz, you could only see 60 frames per second. This new variant has a GTX 1060 and 120 Hertz screen and I much prefer playing games on this thing than the old one. It's just a gorgeous 120 frames per second screen. It's so much nicer to look at, so much more enjoyable to play games on. So, if you're looking for screens and your budget can allow for it, check out 120 Hertz screens, they're gonna be the hot stuff for 2018 and one other thing, if you do buy a cheaper laptop like an inexpensive laptop, if you really want to, a lot of them have the ability to replace the screens it's not easy and it's probably not covered under warranty in fact it's definitely not a warranty covered operation, but it can be done you can buy some really inexpensive screens for like 100 bucks that are 120 Hertz and look pretty good. So, I'll leave a link should I do it? Do it at your own discretion I will leave a link. Okay, last thing I want to talk about is customer support and this is something that I think gets overlooked in a lot of laptop videos. The whole industry, in my opinion, does not have good customer support. If you look at every single brand, everyone has like horror stories of Customer support that they had with basically every single brand, except for Apple. They, have like these million dollar laptops that cost a lot of money but when you go to the store there's a really good chance that if you have busted a device in the first year, you are going to walk out of the Apple store with it repaired or replaced. You don't get that option with basically every other gaming laptop company My honest opinion is that the big companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo, any company that has a lot of big like business accounts and stuff like that they have great customer support available just for their business customers and they kind of extend that to the consumer level if you're looking for good customer support, check out Dell, HP, Lenovo, Alienware, they all have that next day support thing where they try to send someone to your door to try to fix it or repair and I've had mixed experience of that some good some bad but at least that option is available. Smaller companies, like razer they don't have that kind of stuff. You have to send it back to the factory to get it fixed. So, if you're looking for really good customer support, well don't get any gaming laptop but if you're looking for a better customer support go for the bigger companies. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs, if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And this is the newest Razer Blade Stealth.
This is running the 8th generation CPUs from Intel, Kaby Lake-R, so it's a quad-core CPU and I did a review of the previous version of this, the, I guess the 7th generation Fantastic device, I feel like they had updated a lot of stuff that people wanted, and this is just kind of revision that's just a little bit better. Now, I want to clarify one thing before I go too
much further into this review A lot of people think that this device is a gaming laptop I know most of you don't, but there's a surprising
number of people that are like, "Hey! Does this thing play games?" It is not meant to be a gaming laptop It's made by Razer. Razer makes gaming peripherals
and gaming stuff, but this is not a dedicated gaming laptop Not to say that it can't play games like, by itself It can't. It's running some like non-gaming internals But you can plug up an external GPU if you
do want to play games which I'll explain further down the line But just to clarify, this is not a dedicated gaming laptop. Okay, so let's talk about things that haven't changed. The build quality hasn't changed Nothing actually from the exterior has changed that much The one biggest difference is that this model is the gunmetal grey version So they still make the regular black one with the green Razer logo and RGB lights and stuff, but this one's gunmetal grey, and I like this one more Maybe because I've seen the black one so often But this one's just a cleaner design to me. The logo is more subtle and everything
just looks a little more muted The one thing that is a good thing or bad thing is that RGB's on the keyboard that are on the regular Razer Blade Stealth are not present on the gunmetal gray version They only light up in white. The keyboard, the trackpad, basically everything is exactly the same on the exterior It's a good keyboard, good trackpad They updated the trackpad in the previous version to use the Windows Precision drivers which is just way better And the screen options aren't changed This one here is running at 3200 by 1800
screen, IGZO panel It's not the brightest thing ever but it's fairly bright, and it has a pretty good color gamut lt also is a touch screen if that's your thing. If you really like the colored RGB keyboard from the black model But you want to clean finish, like this, you can always get a skin from dbrand, just cover it up and it'll mute the logo and protect your laptop The ports aren't changed. There's got two USB 3.0's and HDMI and then your Thunderbolt 3. Now this Thunderbolt 3 port is for power like you powered up through here and also supports four lanes of PCIe so if you connect an external GPU to this thing, it gets full bandwidth The one thing that's a little bit different between this one and the previous generation of gunmetal grey is that This one's a little bit darker, so this is the other one, the earlier 2017 one It's really hard to tell from this camera, but this new one is slightly darker than this one You know what? There's also another difference On the inside, the little Intel stickers, the 8th generation one is like a quarter of the size of the old version Now, I've seen some other eighth generation laptops that had a regular-sized sticker So I don't know why this little one exists I know this is really important right? You guys should be aware of all the little details about this laptop Okay, the internals have changed a little. The layout is just a little bit different from previous generations. The RAM is still soldered on and the SSD is still removable, but they've actually used a much faster drive this year Which is nice. Now, in terms of coil whine, my unit here does not have coil whine I have seen a lot of reports of people getting Razer Blade Stealth's with coil whine issues. All the review units I've ever had didn't have it so I can't really comment on it But this one yet again does not have it. Performance is excellent This one's running the i7 and 16 gigs of RAM and these new Kaby Lake-R chips are quad-core CPUs that get really fast for short bursts. They benchmarked really well. The built-in GPU is still pretty weak You're still not gonna be able to play some amazing games on or anything You can play some light games But even moderately demanding games are gonna make it choke So if you want to play games, you either get something completely different like a gaming laptop Or you're gonna have to connect an external GPU to this thing Thermals under load are fine and same thing with fan noise It doesn't get super loud or anything and we connected to an external GPU Temperatures are also good. The external GPU handles most of the graphical stuff so the laptop stays cool Now if this is the type of setup you want so it's like a thin and light Ultrabook combined with a external GPU There's a lot of companies that do this kind of thing, but I still think the best company is Razer They were the first people to do it so they probably have a little bit more like experience with it But the connection is rock-solid, and it's just it just works really really well, and I'm running the first generation Core still They have a newer version that has an updated Thunderbolt 3 controller, and you can connect external devices that work on a different pipeline But I mean the performance is going to be identical to the first generation, but yes If this is what you're looking for, I cannot recommend a better setup than these two. Now Now, it's still not a hundred percent efficient. There's some issues with using Thunderbolt 3 GPUs, but for the most part They're pretty good. Now, if you want to learn more about them I've done a video that kind of details this whole process a little bit more I'll link that below. Okay, the performance and video editing is not as good as you might expect This is a quad-core CPU, but it's a 15 watt CPU. There are quad-core CPUs like gaming laptops that are 45 watt CPUs And those are just able to maintain a higher clock speed for just longer periods of time this can hit 4 gigahertz for a little burst and then it'll drop down to its base clock and when you're video editing That's just not ideal. So you can get stuff done if you're working with 1080p footage or just not video editing very frequently Sure, it can kind of work especially with an external GPU, but if you want something that's just more long-term Are you working with higher res footage? Go with something like a quad core gaming laptop Those just do much better for edits. Okay, battery life has not changed. I'm still getting seven hours on this thing I know with the Kaby Lake-R's, it's supposed to be slightly more efficient I'm still getting seven hours, and I think it comes from the screen. The IGZO panel looks nice and the colors pop But it just uses a little more juice It is still like, for the most part, of full day batteries So I'm not too worried about it If I had to nitpick on some things on, if I, I mean I do like this laptop a lot but if it just had to be that guy that just hated on something, it would probably be The speaker's. They're not bad They're like really well positioned, but they don't sound amazing they sound very like you know, run-of-the-mill Ultrabook There are thin and light Ultrabooks like the MacBook's that just sound amazing And it would be really cool if a Razer could stick something like those into here Then this thing would be like really really cool, but yeah, not amazing speakers. The other thing is the backlighting on the function key So like F2, F3. It also controls volume down and volume up, but in complete darkness You can't see the secondary controls because they just don't light up, and it doesn't bother me because I rarely work in complete darkness But for people that require that, yeah, can't control brightness and stuff unless you know exactly which keys do what, but that's basically it. Those are some minor complaints about this really good laptop They did a really good job that last revision, and it's just even better now with the 8th gen CPUs I'm gonna talk about one last thing. It's customer support because I talked about in my previous videos
with other devices Razer's customer support is, I would consider a pretty mediocre They're not a laptop company, right? They were originally a peripheral company, and they got into the laptop game And they do a good job at it But their customer support is lacking, and they don't have stuff like next-day support So if you have something with your laptop some companies like Dell and HP They'll send a technician to your house or your work And they'll kind of try to fix it Razer doesn't have that, you have to send it back to them So that's a bit of a bummer. It depends on what you want or need if your laptop support I mean if it's really important to you, then you might want to look elsewhere, But they make great laptops And I think especially their Stealth line is thumbs up, all around. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time! 
Hey, how it's going, Dave2D here. So Apple just announced their new iPhone and a bunch of other hardware So I thought I would do a quick video kinda talking about my first impression and all this stuff... I'm gonna skip the Apple TV I mean it's really cool. 4K, HDR, great hardware in there But... TV is not how I consume most of my media anymore
so it just doesn't interest me personally, I'm just gonna pass on that.
the Apple Watch... I've always liked the idea of a smartwatch. I've tried several
and I've always found them. I don't know... the battery life on smartwatches is what
ruins it for me, like having to charge them every day or at best like every two to
three days for a flagship smartwatch That's just that's just not my thing.
This new one, the Apple Watch Edition 3 the same idea I still have to charge it
frequently but because it has cellular capabilities, it could theoretically
replace a phone for certain users, now I don't think this is gonna make everyone
switch over to Apple watches and dump their phones, in fact I don't think that
you even can, I still feel like you need to have a phone, but I think it kind of
breathes new life into the whole smart watch job right now. This isn't the
first time we've seen cell capabilities in a smartwatch, I've tried a couple I've
even tried to use a Samsung smartwatch. as like my only cellular device. It went terribly, but I feel like because Apple has big market share in the whole
smartwatch industry... I don't know, I feel like this could be a good thing for them.
The big thing though is the iPhone announcement and I got to be honest,
going into this thing, I thought the iPhone 10 or the iPhone X as people
thought it was called originally, I thought it would be way cooler and way
better than it actually ended up being. So the iPhone 8, the regular-looking
iPhone, I feel like that thing is... OK, in 2017, every single flagship out there has
a better screen-to-body ratio to the Apple iPhone, so it's so weird that Apple
is pulling out another, like thick bezel phone right now. It just, it makes me die
a little bit on the inside when I see that thing but it is what it is. Now the
specs on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are significantly better than the specs on
the 7 and the 7 Plus. That's just the
nature of a next-generation product, but the bezels on the iPhone 8, it just looks so
thick  to me. I don't know, I- I'm in a loss of words but I'm sure the phone has
great hardware. It seems to have a significantly faster processor
especially for multi-core stuff, where I was charging, the slightly better screen,
all good stuff but because of the bezels I just feel less enthusiastic about that
phone. The iPhone X however, really cool looking phone, I mean we saw this thing
all over the internet, it was leaked like crazy but it still looks really cool
when they did the official announcement Now $1000 for a phone feels insanely
expensive to me, it's like what, 200 bucks more than the iPhone 8 Plus... Is it
worth it? I don't know, I haven't used it but I will say this, I made a video a
couple weeks ago that talks about how the Note 8 was a poor value because you
can get an S8+ that was almost identical in everything, except for the
pen and the dual camera thing to the Note 8 and so I said that the Note 8
wasn't a good "value" because you get S8+, a great phone
for so much cheaper and had so many similar characteristics. With this thing,
the iPhone X, you can't get anything like it. If you want to, you mean
like you can't get an iPhone 8 Plus trim off the edges and be like, hey I have an
iPhone X. That's this is why it costs as much as it does and this is why I don't
feel like it's a quote, unquote "poorly-priced phone". It's expensive as HECK and
I don't think that it's a good value but I don't think that Apple mispriced the
phone. Granted, it's a terribly expensive phone. So, with this expensive price tag
comes, I guess some neat hardware, the camera features on the front seem pretty
advanced I guess, but after watching the keynote and seeing what those cameras
can do, okay yes, Face ID seems kind of interesting, I don't think I would prefer
it over Touch ID if I had to choose between them I feel like there's no way
that in its current iteration, Face ID will be as fast as Touch ID. But, that's
to be see. But the big thing for me is that all that camera hardware, they're
showcasing stuff that I would never use like animated emojis and other AR stuff
for the front-facing camera. It's neat and the hardware is very impressive, but
how often am I going to use that, like for the
first couple of days and then the novelty for that kind of stuff is gonna
wear off, real quick, for most people. So is there that much value in that
front-facing camera tech? I don't know. I do love the way that the phone looks
though, like the rounded edges, the bezel-less look, I love that. I mean the Essential Phone which is
what I'm using a lot of recently, like that bezel-less look is
really cool. Now there's one thing that bugs me, when they show the iPhone X
displaying videos, the black bar cuts off the video screen, which I thought was
really weird because on the Essential Phone which is another bezel-less phone,
they leave a black bar where the video is so you don't cut off any part of the
video. And on the iPhone X, the video just runs right behind that black area,
so maybe you'll get used to it but I think that's a little bit strange. See,
the thing for me is for developers like if you're an app or a game developer,
you're gonna have UI elements that like often go on the left side of the screen,
whether it's for games or for like you know, a calendar app or whatever it is,
you'll sometimes have stuff there and now if you want to make your app or your
game compatible with an iPhone X, you don't have to reconfigure that whole
side of the screen, and if you have like an existing game like an older game,
you'll have to go back into that stuff, redevelop it so that you kind of shift
everything over. And the other thing is like if you adapt your game so that it
looks proper on the iPhone X on the regular iPhones or on an Android device,
you now have a gap on the left side where those UI elements used to be, just
so it look proper on the iPhone X. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video!

Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here and this is the Essential phone. And I wanted to thank TELUS for partnering with me on this video. They're the exclusive launch carrier for this phone in Canada. So if you're interested in the Essential phone and you live in Canada, you should check out their website. There is a link in the description. So, I'm going to start off with a quick unboxing here. We get a slide out tray inside and you get the phone itself, a 27-watt charging brick, a braided USB-C cable and then a braided USB-C headphone jack adapter. You also get a sim tool shaped like the Essential logo. One of the headlining features of the phone is the build. It's made from titanium and ceramic. And when I first heard that Essential was doing this with their phone, it didn't seem that special. I mean, it sounded cool but I didn't think that the build materials would make that much of a difference in how the phone feels. but, it does. Titanium is a very hard metal. If you look at the tensile strength of some metals, titanium alloys can get way harder than even the best aluminum alloys, so the frame should be pretty resistant to damage. The ceramic slab on the back is also super durable. I thought it was glass at first because it's so shiny, but it's actually polished ceramic, and this surface is very resilient to scratches. I'm not going to call it scratchproof, because there are very few things in this world that are actually scratchproof, but my keys can't mark this surface at all. And I think they've done a really good job combining the two materials. It's a very nice device to hold in your hand. In terms of the design, it's a very simple and clean aesthetic. It's comfortable to hold, but because of the ceramic material it's heavier than you imagine a phone of this size to weigh. It's not heavy per se, it's just heavier than you might think it would be. The earpiece is pretty much invisible. It's tucked away into this tiny crevice between the screen and the ceramic perimeter. There's a notification LED tucked in there and the earpiece sounds good. The fingerprint scanner on the back is quick. I can hear the verification sound right away but sometimes the screen can take a split-second to fire up. On the back there are two contact points and these are where the wireless accessories can connect. These pins are just for power; any kind of data transfer is done wirelessly and there's a 360 degree camera module that looks pretty cool. There's no headphone jack, and even though they give you this USB-C adapter, I still miss the headphone jack. But that's the path. That's the path that the entire phone industry has chosen to take and we'll have to live with that. Now in terms of the speaker on the bottom it sounds pretty good and it gets loud, but it is a mono-speaker and I really wish they'd've gone for a stereo set-up. It's just something I really like when it comes to smartphone speakers. Now if there's one thing I would knock about the design, it would be the back panel. It looks almost too simple to me, there's no branding or design lines. But you can always put skins on the back to give it some texture and some grip. This is a marble one from dbrand and I think it looks nice Alright, let's talk about the screen This phone caught a lot of people's attention because of the screen It has very thin bezels, it has rounded corners But the camera is still positioned at the top and you have this gap or cut out in the screen where the camera is And some people may not like it because it looks so different from your regular smartphone But I think it looks good Now if you're wondering why they didn't put the camera at the bottom, if you're taking a picture using Google Hangouts This is what the image looks like with the camera at the top, it's a normal image, but when you put it at the bottom This is what the image looks like, it's just a bad angle and you can look up your nose You can still swipe down from the top of the camera and it works the same, you don't have to adjust your swipes because of it And when you're watching videos it's just a black bar along the side, the image doesn't have to go up to that point And when you're browsing the web, using the cameras, playing games, very few apps actually put content up there You might have a strip of UI buttons or something, but most apps have a black bar So functionally right now this super-thin bezel at the top doesn't do anything super useful But where this thing shines is base level UI So the lock screen, home screen, and settings and stuff, it just looks so cool to me And every time I use my phone it feels like a very futuristic device. The display itself is an IPS panel, QHD resolution The colors are on point, but it's not super bright though It's a 500 nit screen - excellent for indoor use But the screen can get hard to see on really bright days. Looking at performance the components in here are very fast. It's got a Snapdragon 835, Adreno 540, with fast UFS 2.1 storage. All the technical components in here were obviously picked to give this thing some really good speed. The performance feels like a 2017 flagship phone One thing I noticed: this phone doesn't get that hot, So even after running a bunch of loops and stuff for benchmarks, it felt cool to the touch Not like cold, but lukewarm at most. I'm not sure if it's the ceramic material or something, but yeah, it's kind of neat The camera has two lenses, one has an RGB sensor, the other is a monochrome sensor And the idea here is that they're taking two photos and then combining the data To produce something that's as clean as possible, and the images are pretty good. Now to be honest I thought that the Essential Phone wouldn't have an amazing camera Because they don't emphasize it that much on their website, but they're good Photos taken in good lighting are nice, not that these are difficult to capture with a 2017 flagship But the low light photos are also not bad Dynamic range could be better in general, but overall I do like the camera I'm not into black and white photography but it has a dedicated monochrome option. I don't love the stock camera app, it's a little too basic. If you're big on photography you'll probably want a different camera app The front camera looks good as well and both cameras, the front and back, shoot video in 4K Pricing off contract isn't cheap It's a premium, 128 GB phone It starts at $700 in the US, and I think $1050 in Canada It's on par with any big screen flagship phone I wish they offered this phone in a cheaper 64 GB variant But $700 for a titanium, thin-bezeled phone like this feels very normal right now. Battery life on this thing is average to maybe a little bit less than average because of the bigger screen So normally screens of this size are fueled by bigger batteries, right? But because it's a small phone with a large screen, the battery is only 3040 mAh, so it's not huge I can comfortably get a full day of heavy use, but not much more than that It does support quick charge and it takes about an hour and a half for a full charge. It's running Android 7.1.1, and it feels very stock to me, which I love The two apps that they've included that aren't very stock are their profile migration app that's called SwitchBack, I never used it And their camera app - It's called Click, and I don't love the icon And like I mentioned before it's not a very full featured camera app, but everything else feels like stock Android As for updates, I can't tell I mean every phone company promises an unending stream of superfast updates but they often don't deliver As for this phone, because of Andy Rubin's involvement, my gut feeling is that we'll get pretty fast and frequent updates Essential does promise two years of major software updates, and then another year of security updates And even this pre-release phone, this thing did receive the August 5th update on time So that's probably a good sign Okay, the Essential Phone with this device you're getting excellent ergonomics and build quality The titanium and ceramic materials are really nice Up front, the ultra-thin bezels look really cool It's not highly functional, but it adds to the super clean aesthetic of the phone The front facing and rear facing cameras are both strong performers Clean images, even in low light The fingerprint scanner is reasonably quick And the ceramic material on the back gives the phone a very unique feel, but it adds a little bit of weight Inside, the Snapdragon 835 delivers awesome performance, as expected The storage is also really fast, but the phone only comes in a massive 128 GB variant So you're forced to go pretty big, and the battery will last about a day of heavy use So the feature list isn't massive. It's missing things like wireless charging, it doesn't have official waterproofing So if you're trying to 1-Up your friends with a spec-list on your phone, this is not that phone There are plenty of other phones for that, but with this thing you're getting a highly functional device That has all the important specs, but looks and feels very unique and just straight up awesome Okay, that about wraps it up If you guys are interested in this phone there's a link in the description If you're in Canada check out TELUS, they're the exclusive launch partner for this company Okay, hope you enjoyed this video.

Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here and this is a video on the Google Home Mini and the Amazon Echo Dot So this thing just came out, the Google Home Mini. It's 50 bucks It's relatively inexpensive, but it's just so much cheaper than its predecessor, that thing was 120 bucks I think? This is like less than half price and... it looks nice, right? But just because it's new and it looks a heck of a lot nicer than this... It doesn't mean that's... inherently better than this, right? I've been using this quite a bit, the Amazon Echo Dot and it's a very good product But, depending what you do and what you don't do, one or the other, might be a better fit So that's what this video is, it's going to talk about what these products are, what they aren't and... I guess kind of a guide as to whether or not, any one of these are actually a good purchase for you So I'm gonna focus on three things. First, let's talk about using these things as media controllers So they're both pretty good as media controllers. This thing, the Google Home Two things kind of bugged me about it It doesn't have an audio jack out So if you have a pair of speakers that you want to connect it to like a hardwire You can't do that. And it also doesn't technically have Bluetooth, like it does You can't just connect it to a Bluetooth enabled speaker, you need to connect a Chromecast Audio, to some speakers and then now they can talk wirelessly And I mean that's just a bit of a money grab from Google And they're just basically trying to keep the Chromecast Audio product alive, and it's fair... But... if you're looking for good audio, and just like a simple audio with less wires and stuff like that... It's gonna cost you a little bit more with this device With the Amazon Echo Dot, it's got an audio out So it's just, you plug it up and you're good to go Both of them can be used as speakers. The Google Home Mini's probably a little bit better sounding It's not like, much better, because neither of them are very good But does sound a little bit cleaner and just a little more depth to the audio It does have upward firing speakers I'm not sure if that's making a big difference, whereas the Amazon Echo Dot has downward firing speakers, so when it's on a table It's just the sound is projected off of the surface. They both handled TV well. This thing needs Chromecast, this thing needs the Fire Stick Um... They both have their advantages inherently just from the products of Fire Stick versus Chromecast, but... they both work And I wouldn't say that one is like, massively better than the other, in terms of their video playing capabilities One thing I have noticed with the Google Home products, and it's not just with the Google Home Mini It's with all of the Google home products You can speak more naturally to them, whereas the Amazon products You need to just hit those keywords for a bill to trigger the command that you're trying to make it do. "Hey Google, show me a video on YouTube about Overwatch." "Alright, playing on YouTube about Overwatch videos from YouTube on office TV." And because of that difference, I find it easier and just more enjoyable to control my media using Google Home products. The one big advantage with this though And this probably won't apply to most people, is that if you are an Audiobook user or just more particularly Audible, this thing can do like, text-to-speech and it can just read out stories, which is super cool. It's so simple I feel like this is something that Google Home's should be able to do, but it doesn't. I use Audible and I like Audiobooks, so... yeah The next thing I want to talk about is using these devices as an assistant So either a home assistant, or a work assistant or any kind of like voice operated assistant, and both of them are pretty good Um, but the winner to me is the Google Home product. This thing has just better connectivity for what I use So everyone's gonna be different. I use a lot of Google services Particularly Google Calendar, and this is excellent for that. "Hey Google, what's my calendar like tomorrow?" "Tomorrow, there are three things on your calendar. The first one is at 12:30 a.m., and its title is 'Busy Stuff One'" Google Home can distinguish between different voices So if you have one device in a household with different people in it, they can ask it with their own voice and it'll react accordingly so if you have a different calendar from your wife, or your family members It'll just, read your calendar out to you and tell you your schedule and same thing with like, making calls so if you say or if I said, "Hey Google, call my mom," it would call my mom But if my wife said the same thing, "call my mom," it would call her mom, because our voices are different. "Calling Mom, mobile." Now the Amazon Echo Dot is actually connected to even more services In particular, Microsoft Outlook So if you're an Outlook user, you got to go with this thing It doesn't even work on the Google Home products. When it comes to asking it questions And this is something that I don't use very frequently I mean, it's very cool to kind of like trivial time, but it's not something that I use regularly, Google Home crushes Echo It's just not even close I want to say it's like 1 to 10 in terms of the number of questions that are answered. It's just so much more... Um, robust in terms of its knowledge base and a large part of that comes from the data collection Google has been collecting data forever and I feel like it'll be really hard for Amazon to ever catch up in that regard. "Hey Google, do you like Siri?" "You know Siri? What a small world. Hope she's doing well." Now the one assistant type feature that Amazon is just amazing at is... shopping because of Amazon's e-commerce power. Right now It's pretty good like if you need to refill something You can just request it, and it shows up in your Amazon cart But I think the future of Amazon's Echo products are going to revolve entirely around the whole e-commerce thing and that could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it But I really do think that's the future of Amazon. Now, in terms of using these products as home automation I got to be completely honest. I don't love home automation right now, because I live in a relatively small condo It's like a small space. Home automation isn't that important to me There's like one large living space. All the cool stuff that you can do with home automated stuff just is less appealing in such a small space, but I recently got a house And I've been looking between these two to kind of see which will be better from home automation, and surprisingly even though This is called Google home The Alexa products or the Echo products are just so much better Just, they're able to connect to way more home automation stuff, so if that's your jam, if you're looking for home automation The Echo products are the way to go, but you can't go wrong with either of them They're both really inexpensive if you're looking for something that's aesthetically pleasing, the Google Home Mini looks nice, and it's better at answering questions, making phone calls It's just not great as an audio controller because it lacks connectivity But the Amazon Echo Dot has a line out, so it might be a little bit cheaper, and better For music controls, and it's gonna have better home automation connectivity So everything I've talked about so far is pertinent to right now, in late 2017 and All it takes is Google or Amazon to just tweak a little bit of their software and these things suddenly have new functionality and new features, and you don't have to buy new hardware, right? This is always gonna just have a speaker and a mic and A power source and it can do all of the stuff that we've talked about and it can do any future things that Google wants these things to do like, doesn't do very much processing So yeah, I mean these are so inexpensive, 50 bucks You can definitely get into the game of whole home automation or just smart stuff, and check it out! Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it!
See you guys next time! 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And the Google event just went down and there was a lot of hardware that was announced, more than I thought they would. The few items that kind of stick out for me is being like the most interesting are Well actually like the Google home devices, so the mini and the Max both were more interesting to me than I thought they would be. So I'm not huge on smart home stuff I normally just don't invest in that stuff, but because of how inexpensive the Google mini is I feel like it's something that a lot of people could easily pick up and adapt into their house and make use of it and because so many people are kind of using Google services I feel like this is the turning point for Google home, or just the whole Google home ecosystem. I feel like that at 50 bucks, so many people are gonna get it. It's gonna change how people perceive the whole Google home thing. The Google Home Max device was a bit of a surprise and that thing looks really impressive to me. It's unfortunately really expensive. It's 400 bucks, but the thing is: It, to me, just kills any Interest that I ever had in the Apple Home Pod. Not that I was in love with the home pod or anything but that thing is $350 and like let's forget about everything about speaker quality and stuff like that I'm just gonna assume that they're both really good. But for the services that the Apple home pod can connect to, and that's being only Apple Music, it makes no sense for people to purchase that thing unless they're so deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem. Google home max is like I think it's just a better product all around and I like the fact we can put them straight up or lie them flat and assuming the sound quality is good, which I think is a pretty safe assumption I think they're gonna sell way better than Apple home pod devices just because of how much versatility these have in comparison. Okay, The other devices are the pixel devices the Pixel 2 - and the Pixel 2 XL. To me the one that's most interesting is the Pixel 2 XL not that the pixel - is bad or anything But because of those bezels, I feel like the excel is just so much nicer to look at. This is a phone that you use and carry with you all the time, It's got to look nice and the regular Pixel 2 just doesn't cut it for me. In terms of the tech on the new phones like they were demonstrating AR. I mean every phone company's doing AR this year. It's super impressive, and I'm sure you need some pretty powerful hardware but it just doesn't appeal to me. Maybe it appeals to you guys. I'm curious though, like when you guys see those things does that turn you on like does that make you go: "Hey, I want to buy that phone", because Apple did it, Google did it, and I'm sure there's other phones that gonna drop this year that have AR demonstrations. But... it... I don't know it ... Am I like an old or something? I look at that stuff, And I'm like "who the hell wants to see this stuff, like who's really gonna want to have Creatures from Stranger Things running around and...," I don't know it seems weird. The things that I am excited about on the phones are the camera. It supposedly gets a DxOMark of 98 which is The highest yet again And I'm really stoked for this new feature on the pixel 2 where the phone will actually listen to your ambient environment for songs and try to identify them without even you tapping the screen or anything like that. I love that There's so many times where I've want to know the name of the song And I'll be too lazy to hit up Shazam or by the time. I hit Shazam up It's too late, and the song is gone. I love that! I think it's such a simple thing, but hopefully doesn't drain batteries like crazy, but I love that, I think I'll use it pretty frequently. Okay the device that I'm most interested to find out more information about though is without a doubt The Pixel Book. So, the Pixel Book if you didn't watch the event is this thousand-dollar Chromebook, which is Super expensive, right? That's the first question that comes to mind: Why would you pay $1,000 for a Chromebook when you can get Chromebooks for like three or four hundred dollars - a pretty good ones? And I think the answer to that is that you can always find Chromebooks, inexpensive Chromebooks, easily you go on the market you can buy like two three $400 Chromebooks everywhere. So if you want to buy something a little more expensive you could there's some Samsung devices and Asus made a really premium one But this one kind of steps it up to the next level, and I'm interested to try this thing, I really want to see if $1,000 gets you a device that's actually worth it. The other thing is and I think this is the question that's most pertinent to me and probably you guys - even if you do have a thousand dollars to spend on something, is it really worth, like, you have to really think about that thousand dollars. It's a lot of money, but if you have that budget is really worth buying a pixel book over something like an XPS 13 or an LG gram 13 or any kind of the top-end 13-inch devices that have a thousand dollar price tag and I think that's an interesting question, that I mean the the immediate reaction, the knee-jerk reaction is no there's no way because you could do so much more on a Windows laptop or even like an older MacBook. You can do so much more on those devices than a Chromebook, right? That's the immediate thought, but there's a reason why this thing exists. I want to explore it fully I want to test it out. I'm super excited about that thing. I will be going to the event in Toronto tonight Just to check out the different devices, and if I find something interesting I'll do a follow-up video, but otherwise I'll be doing reviews on the stuff as they come in. Okay I hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it See you guys next time! 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here, and today's video is about the Pixelbook, the new Chromebook from Google. And there's a lot of good reviews about this thing, but I want to do something a little bit more encompassing because I feel like some of the reviews out there are a little misleading, not intentionally so they're just not looking at the bigger picture of what this product is or what this product isn't. So I kind of wanted to go through its paces. So let's just talk about the hardware first. The hardware is fantastic. Everything that you've read about how good the hardware is, is exactly that. It's literally the best built Chromebook available on the market. It's expensive— it's $1000—but it is really good. The keyboard is excellent, backlit, and way better than most other Chromebooks. I would say it's better than a lot of other regular laptops, even. The trackpad is pretty good. It's built really well with great material choices and a good button mechanic, but there's a little bit of a stutter in Chrome OS. The white rubber pads are nice. They're supposedly quite resistant to dirt or any kind of staining and they position them all over the device to kind of protect it when you have it closed or just give it a little bit of grip, so when you're using it, you just feel more confident in its ability to not get damaged. The tablet mode is less awesome to me. It's not super bad, it's just not as comfortable as I'd like my tablet to be. The keyboards on the bottom, so you kind of touch that every time you use it. And it's a little bit thicker and heavier than a dedicated tablet would be. But any kind of two-in-one foldable device is gonna feel like this and as a tablet, it's not bad. One thing that seems a little bit buggy right now though is that you can't run the apps in split-screen. So if you're in tablet mode, you're running in a full screen all the time. Hopefully, they'll be able to fix that with a software update. There's an optional stylus called the Pixelbook Pen, which I didn't bring into work today to film. But, it basically works as intended. The lag is very minimal, as long as the apps have been recently updated. It's a good stylus, as you would expect, but there's this feature where you can circle things in Chrome and Google will search for it, which honestly feels really gimmicky. I tried it a bunch of times and just the accuracy isn't there. For whatever reason, it's just pulling up stuff that is somewhat related, kind of, to the thing that you've circled, but it's just never something that I really wanted to search for. Performance is good, it's running some 7th-gen Intel chips. But it's a Chromebook, right? I feel like the average person that's gonna be using this Pixelbook, probably won't be able to tax it all that hard, and the battery life is... okay. I mean, it's good, but I just expected it to be better, considering how low demand this whole system is. I'm getting around eight hours of battery life. Okay, I want to talk about the OS and Chrome OS is probably where this whole thing starts to break down. I like Chrome OS. I think it's a great system. I think a lot of people call it a limited operating system. I disagree. I don't think it's—I mean, limited is just the wrong word. I would kind of want to approach it— it's just a different way of using your computer and I think a lot of people out there can use Chrome OS perfectly and just get through everything that they need to do, and they don't even realize it. They think that they need macOS or Windows to do what they do, but they don't. They actually could do everything that they need to do with Chrome OS. The problem, however, and I think this is where, I think, everything breaks apart, is the price tag. This thing is a thousand dollars and, when you look at the price of any kind of competitor product, so a 12-inch MacBook, a MacBook Air, and XPS 13, Razer Blade Stealth, iPad Pro, all of these things can do what the Chromebook does, but more. Much more, and I feel like that is why I... That's why this product is so hard for me to recommend to people. I think it's a good product. I think it's good for what it is, but it should be priced at like seven or eight hundred dollars. See, I did a video a while ago called, "The Best Chromebook", and this was sometime in the spring, I think, or like early summer of 2017, and to me, at the time, the best Chromebook was a product that was five hundred dollars. It's the Asus C302, I think. And that's a great product. But, it's very expensive for what it is. A Chromebook for five hundred dollars, kind of, took people aback. I mean, you can buy Chromebooks for two, three hundred dollars that are really, really good. A $500 Chromebook was, "Whoa, easy now, Dave." Like, "Are you sure you want to recommend a $500 Chromebook?" This is a thousand dollar Chromebook. And, it is better. This is the new best Chromebook, but, like, WHO'S GONNA BUY THIS? And, the thing you have to keep in mind is that, if you're gonna spend a thousand dollars, and that's so much money, you have to justify its purchase. Like you gotta be able to use this and prefer it over any of the other devices that I've mentioned and, I think, for most people, that's just not the case. If you want better battery life, there's other options. If you want the ability to play games, there's other options. There's just so much more versatility with the other choices over this. Even the iPad Pro can do more than this can, just, for the average person. And It sucks. Because this is such a good device, it's just overpriced, and, four or five years ago, when this original Pixel came out, like the original Chromebook Pixel came out, it was really impressive because hardware looked so amazing for its time. But, nowadays, everybody who's got a hand in the laptop industry, is making really good hardware. Dell has good stuff. HP, Razer, like there's so much good hardware to choose from, that is difficult for this thing to stand out just on hardware alone. I think a lot of the review out there are so impressed by the hardware, they're like, "Ooh, shiny, pretty", but the usage experience is still... very... it's just not there. It just doesn't have the versatility that a thousand dollar device should have. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time. 
Hey ! How's it going ? Dave 2D here. So traditionally when it comes to buying gaming laptops, The CPU is a pretty easy decision. I mean There's just not that many choices to choose from. So, last year It was the i7-7700HQ, and if you couldn't afford that You'd get the i5, and the year before that it was the 6700HQ, And it's just always been really few options which was a kind of a good thing, 'Cause it just made the process a lot easier, But right now, in 2018, for whatever reason, There's so many good CPU options for  gaming laptops. We already have the 8th-gen U processors, the Kaby Lake Rs, And those are quad-core 15-watt packages, And if you pair that up with an MX 150, which a lot of laptops do, You actually get a pretty respectable gaming laptop. It's not like a hardcore gaming laptop, But you can play a lot of games with really respectable frame rates. And as long as the laptop is cooled properly, which not every company does, But if it is, you're good to go for, like, light to moderate gaming. Now the H processors coming out are more exciting. The i9 is gonna be nutty, but the two more common ones are these two : The i7 and the i5. That i7 looks ripe. 6 cores, strong turbo, And it's in the same 45-watt package as the previous generation, So you don't have to have any kind of crazy thermal solution. And we've seen some preliminary benchmarks pop up, and it really does look promising. Compared to the current i7-7700HQ, It's like 30 - 35 percent better for multi-core benchmarks. Now, in the past, A lot of developers haven't put in the time to optimize their games for just more than 4 CPU cores, But because of Ryzen last year, and just the state of the industry now, Where core count is kind of creeping up slowly, I think companies will put in the time. So there's another batch of CPUs made by Intel, the Kaby Lake G, And there's five of them. These are kind of a collab between Intel and AMD. So they're running Intel CPUs with an AMD Vega GPU. There's two different GPUs : The Vega MGL and the Vega MGH. GH being the stronger, more powerful one of the two, The performance is good, like, really good for the wattage. And I think that's its biggest advantage, efficiency. It's energy efficient, It's space efficient because they're packing the CPU the GPU and the vram all into one chip. It's still not an APU, it's a CPU and a dedicated GPU, But it's just packaged into one thing, So you can build something that's smaller thinner and lighter Than a laptop that uses a discrete GPU from Nvidia. Now, the preliminary benchmarks have been pretty interesting, We're looking at something between a 1050 and a 1050 Ti for the GL, And then for the GH, the better one, the performance is gonna be something around a GTX 1060. And they'll both be quite energy efficient, But the big disadvantage I see with these is pricing. The GH model in particular is gonna start at like 1,200 bucks, maybe even more, And you're getting... Remember, GTX 1060 performance, for $1,200. And I feel like at that price point, you can get something that's like a 1070 from Nvidia. It's gonna be thicker, it's gonna be louder, it's gonna be bigger, but You're gonna get better performance for your money. Um...The last ones are the AMD chips. So they have eight-core and six-core Ryzen laptops that are using these desktop CPUs, Which are really powerful, but I mean they're desktop CPUs, So that doesn't really count in this conversation. They're also just stupidly expensive. The ones that are most interesting to me are there new Ryzen Mobile APUs, And their integrated GPUs on these things are so much better than the integrated Intel GPUs Like the HD 630, or even the UHD 630, It's just... miles ahead of the Intel integrated GPUs. It benchmarks well, but the games are just so poorly optimized, With these drivers that just looks like a crappy card. If they can fix those drivers - and they will, But if they can fix it quickly enough, It'll be a strong competitor for casual gaming. And if you see what devices are putting these into, Like we're talking ultrabooks and just really thin devices, It's pretty cool, you can bring something like this to school to work, And just kind of kick it for some light gaming at home. So, this video has been filled with tons of, like, nerd numbers and stuff like that, I'm just gonna break it down really simple : Right now if you're looking for a CPU for a gaming laptop, There's obviously a lot of choices to choose from, It's obviously harder this year to choose one than last year. If you want something that's like the best of the best and you have the money, Then, the i7 and the i9 that's popping out from Intel soon will be a good bet, But if you have something like a smaller budget, And you're just looking for a thinner device That gets decent gaming performance, Take a look at the Kaby Lake G from intel. So these are the intel cpus combo'd with the AMD Vega GPUs, It's good performance, and you should comfortably break 60 frames per second for most games, And if you don't care too much about image quality or resolution, You can drop down to U processor paired up with the nvidia MX 150, But if you want something that's like really budget And you're looking for something that's like thin and light that doesn't cost too much, Those upcoming Ryzen Mobile APUs should be pretty good. Some of them are already out, is just that the drivers aren't great, And if you just give it some time from the flash out, I think they can be great for just the casual gamer, with a smaller budget. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video, Hope it clarified some things, Thumbs if you liked it, Subs if you loved it, See you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. So Microsoft launched their Surface Laptop the other day, and I think it's a really cool product I'm personally very interested in it. I think it looks awesome I think they're going to sell lots of them, but I think there's some potential problems with this product And I wanted to go through them with you in case you're interested in purchasing one So the first thing is the design. I really like the design I think a lot of the interest about this product comes from the fact that it looks as good as it does because let's be honest if this thing was super ugly, it would be a much less exciting product, but it's really good-looking. So here we are. It's one hand openable. The keyboard and trackpad look really promising. But the most interesting thing about this product is the fact that they're using this Alcantara material on the keyboard deck, and if you're unfamiliar with it. It's this fabric type material It's a synthetic fabric that Microsoft uses on their signature keyboard on the Surface Pro product and it feels and looks really inviting to use. It's much more durable than what you would imagine a cloth type material to be but that being said it's not metal It's not plastic, so there's going to be 
some wear over time. Now, I've seen Alcantara keyboards that looked really good after six months, and I've also seen some that looked really worn down after six months So I don't know it's going to vary from person to person but one thing's for sure: you can't just replace the keyboard the way that you could on the Surface Pro because if you really wanted To and you had a gunky Surface Pro Type cover, you could just buy a new one for a couple hundred bucks This is built into the laptop. It's kind of like fused onto the keyboard deck I don't think it'll be as easy to just replace that. Okay. Let's talk about the operating system These come with Windows 10S and, if you want to the first year, you can upgrade it for free to Windows 10 Pro. After that first year, or after 2017, it's going to become a $50 upgrade. So the biggest difference between Windows 10 and Windows 10s is that 10s can't run any kind of executable program so any kind of like .exe file You can't run it. There's not even a command prompt. This is crippling to a lot of users. There's no steam There's no Chrome you're going to be stuck with Microsoft Edge and you're going to be running bing for the search engine It's streamlined and it focuses on the core of Windows, and I think for system administrators It's a lot easier to get something like this deployed. And for the user, you're getting a better battery life You're getting a faster experience like a more optimized experience, but it's a very limited experience. So if you're using just regular Applications that you're used to you're gonna have to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro Okay. Looking at the hardware, the base model comes with four gigs of RAM, and that is tight I really feel like they should have put an eight gigs and the argument is that for most people that are interested in this base Model So like the University student that doesn't have a lot of heavy computer tasks, four gigs should be enough Especially if you're not using Chrome. So if you're just web browsing editing PDf documents, typing up word documents Just doing very productivity focused tasks then yes, four gigs should be enough But the thing is, if you ever want to do something that's a little bit more RAM intensive You can't upgrade that. Now, I understand they had to do this to create the price structure that they wanted but I'm just not a fan of that base configuration in terms of USB ports We're looking at a single USB-A and no USB-C ports and the thought process behind that is that right now their Target demographic Of students is a predominantly USB-A market so thumb drives, external hard drives, mice they're just all type-a and I understand that, but this is a device that's supposed to last multiple years, so You won't be upgrading this thing or you won't even think about upgrading the same for like two three Maybe five years and in that amount of time, USB-C will be everywhere Why not give it to them now so that people have access to universal charging? To universal display output? It's so weird that they're using USB-A and they even had USB-C ports on prototypes. We were so close Okay, next up is pricing even the base surface laptop isn't meant for high school or grade school kids It's meant for University students and up and when I'm looking at pricing that base model feels a little expensive and I understand there's a premium with the Awesome build quality, the design, the amazing screen, the material choices and it's very nice-looking But in 2017, you're just not getting good long-term value with four gigs of RAM The mid- and top-tier models seem to be priced well or at least in line with the competitors It's just the base model that I'm concerned about. But one thing to note, if you are students You're able to apply your student discount to these you're going to get about ten percent off So the base model is at nine hundred dollars US. The display panels are awesome with basically 100% sRGB Gamut And they're all individually calibrated at the factory for color accuracy the 3X2 aspect ratio I mean, this is great for tablets because you get a little bit more usable space vertically But on a laptop only device, I would prefer the 16 by 9 screen just for consistency for other devices more importantly though even though the screen supports the surface pen Writing or drawing on a vertical surface like a laptop screen is not an enjoyable experience During the presentation pano's had to hold the screen to annotate on it But I feel like this product wasn't designed around using it with a surface pen. If you want to write or draw Frequently, I would get a Surface Book or a Surface Pro instead So I want to talk about some things that I think Microsoft did right just to kind of close this off They're running PCI-e drives for storage So those are going to be really fast, way faster than the ones on the Surface 3 The CPU selection is good that top end i7 actually has an Iris+ graphics chip I'm really glad they went with that instead of the more common 7500U. The battery looks promising. They're claiming 14 and a half hours running Windows 10s I'm assuming. But the way that I use my computer, it's probably gonna be 10, 11 hours Which is still really long. Overall, I think this is a great product despite having a couple concerns I think Microsoft did a really good job on this thing So I will be doing a full review when I get the unit in If there's stuff that you guys want me to kind of take a look at in particular Let me know I'm going to be spending more time in a comment section of this video Just because I know a lot of you guys are students, and you might have an opinion I'd love to talk to you guys about it. Let me know! Questions, comments I'm going to be down there for quite a bit in this video Hope you guys enjoyed this! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. I'll see you guys next time 
if you know me or if you follow my channel you'll know that I like small computer cases particularly ITX cases when it comes to custom builds but this is a prebuilt bare-bones system made by ZOTAC this is the ek7 1080 and this is one of the smallest if not the smallest system out there with a full sized GTX 1080 so not an MX M card on a laptop card it's the full fat GTX 1080 from a desktop stuck into a very small 5.8 liter case so previously ZOTAC made a very similar product this the en 1080 K it was a very powerful water-cooled system but there were three kind of issues to it first it used an MXM card it didn't have the full size gtx 1088 ii it was expensive that thing started at $2,000 thirdly the en 1080 K needed to AC adapters basically had to 300 watt AC adapters I would plug into the back end it was just honestly unsightly and just unwieldly for a product this small to need to a see adapters so this one the ek7 1080 has been updated if you want to call it that but now it starts at $1500 which i think is a pretty fair price for what this thing includes so for the base model $1500 you're not getting Ram you're not getting storage but you're getting basically everything else which we'll discuss a little bit now if you think you're one of those people that can build a custom PC for seven bucks that's gonna compare to this I mean in this market with the crypto mining happening and all the GPU pricing being as wonky it's really difficult for me to kind of compare this thing to what a regular building cost right now if you're trying to buy a GTX 1080 at a regular five or $600 price point it's gonna be nearly impossible people are charging like eight 900 bucks for that stuff which sucks so the pricing on this thing is actually pretty good if you consider the current market it's fair if you consider regular pricing this system runs a single AC adapter it's this one the 330 watt behemoth it's really large but because it's external it keeps your case size small so this 5.8 liter device can sit on your media center your table whatever you want and this thing can sit under your table in the cab whatever so it keeps this thing kind of cleaner and smaller now they're able to do that because this thing is running a laptop CPU the 7700 to HQ so this is a 45 watt CPU the previous generation was a desktop CPUs more energy and it produced more heat now obviously that one's gonna be a little more powerful in terms of its boost clock but this thing is very comparable and it uses a little bit less energy so you don't have to spend as much effort cooling this system down the last main feature about this mini PC and probably its best feature is that this thing is holding a full sized GTX 1080 this is the reference card the founders edition and they're able to fit all the processing power from this into here and this has a full computer inside this is just a graphic card and the performance on the GTX 1080 combined with the 7700 HQ is excellent the desktop grade version of the 1080 is a very capable card and it'll push an excellent frame rates across pretty much every single game that I played now I don't play super graphically intense stuff like gt5 and stuff because the truth is I don't find those games all that exciting I like more competitive stuff like I don't do the single-player games that much but single-player multiplayer competitive non-competitive this thing is gonna crush it it's also a strong performer in VR and because it's small you can put in your backpack and you now have a relatively portable VR capable system now the thermal performance is something I think a lot of people are interested in because it's such a small case and the previous generation the en 1080 K had water cooling but this one is air cooled and the FEA noise is controllable in the BIOS but if I just left it at standard settings it's quiet on idle but during games it can get pretty loud now you're not putting the system in front of your face like a laptop like you're not playing right on top of this thing so obviously the decibel rating is just for reference so you understand what's going on it really depends on how close you sit to this machine when I set this up on my table I had it about three or four feet away from me and I didn't find the fan noise annoying or anything now there is some thermal throttling not a lot it's hard to pick up on it unless you're actually running a monitoring program so I actually didn't notice that there was throttling in game the frame rates didn't drop but when I looked at the logs there was some throttling around the one hour mark now you can't control the fans in the BIOS so if you set the fans more aggressively it'll get rid of the throttling but it becomes louder so this system 7700 HQ GTX 1080 great performance and if you pump up the fans yeah it doesn't throttle but I kind of expected this system just run a little bit quieter the performance is good and if you said it right it won't throttle but it's a little loud on standard settings it's quieter it's just that it can throttle if you play for long periods of time reports we're looking at five use pas a USB type-c which doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 and we have an SD card audio jacks and a pair of Ethernet in the back it's obviously not as port filled as like a full desktop system but for content creation or gaming they should do the trick in terms of upgrade ability even though it has a desktop GTX 1080 in there it's not an easy thing to upgrade I actually think that they say it's not upgradable but I think you could if you really wanted to you can see the riser in there and you can see the PCIe connections so I feel like if you had a small enough card in the future that could fit into the space it could just connect up but I'm not entirely sure in terms of the other stuff the drives and the memory are all located on the bottom and you can swap that stuff out pretty readily there's room for a to drive and one stick of Intel obtain memory and it can hold up to 32 gigs of RAM so overall the upgrade ability is good it's just not as good as a regular desktop system I do like this thing a lot it's not for everyone but if you're into small cases like I am and he likes something that's just really clean and relatively modern looking that can sit on your table or your media center if you have this up in your living room or something this is a pretty good pickup okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it sub zv loves it see you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going. Dave2D here. So this is the video on what I believe to be the best laptops for content creation. So your mileage is going to vary. Everyone's idea of "content creation" is a little bit different, but mine is video editing. So this is obviously a video that's kind of geared towards video editing. The other thing is that these laptops are all 14 or 15 inch screens, and I chose them because I prefer working off of larger screens, so just to kind of see what I'm doing. But it's also because you get the quad core processors with these larger devices and quad core processors are important for me. So yeah, that's what we're getting: 14 inch or 15 inch laptops with quad core processors. Let us begin- Actually, before we go in, I've done individual reviews for each one of these, so if you're interested I will link the individual reviews below and... Yeah, first up: XPS 15. This is the device that I used for most of 2016. I want to say, like, eighty percent of my videos from last year were done on the XPS 15- the older version. This is the newer one. My favorite features: the 4K screen, extremely color accurate, and the thin bezels are nice. I also like that you can stick 32 gigs of RAM in here, and the battery life is also good. It's an easy seven or eight hours on this thing. The things I don't like: the speakers are not very good. They're in a bad position And they're small. It also only has three USB ports, One of them being Thunderbolt 3. I would occasionally run out of ports when I had a lot of drives and stuff connected to it. But overall, really good performance, really good device. Next is the Razer Blade. This is the Kaby Lake model running a GTX 1060, it's really similar to the Sky Lake, just a little bit more efficient. So obviously one of the big advantages of the Razer Blade is the GTX 1060 in a relatively thin and light chassis, and that makes it pretty unique. But one of the things that I recently started doing was customizing keyboard shortcuts, so in Premier, I bind things for video editing, like zooming in and out. Instead of the plus and minus keys or even using the mouse scroll, I'll bind it to '3' and '4' so I can just do with one hand. And this isn't just for Premier, you can do this with most applications. But recently I tried changing the colors of my keys to these shortcuts, and because it has individual RGB for each key, I really like it, and when you're done you can switch the profile back to normal. I don't like that the RAM on this is soldered on. I'd love to get 32 gigs on this, but I'm stuck at 16 and fan noise can get loud. The Kaby Lake model runs a little bit quieter than the Sky Lake model, like the fans don't come on as readily so it's a more efficient chip. But it's a GTX 1060 in there, when you're doing heavy stuff, fans kick in, it's going to be loud. Okay, the third thing in this mix is the 2016 Macbook Pro. I have, like, a love-hate relationship with this thing. It looks awesome, and pricing has improved quite a bit, because it's now in the Apple refurbished store. Things I like about it: I like the build quality. I think it's phenomenal. Speakers are amazing, I can edit videos right off of these speakers. Screen is really good. Keyboard is... well... Everyone's a little bit different. Some people hate it, some people love it. My personal experience: I like it. I legitimately like it, but everyone's gonna be different -- some people are just going to hate this thing forever. That's okay. The touch bar is whatever. At this point, I think it's a gimmick, I never use it. I also don't love the port situation, and the graphics chip in here is the Radeon Pro 460. For the right application, it's good, like if you're a Final Cut user, it's perfect. But if you're an Adobe user, and I'm an Adobe user, it doesn't really perform that well. And for most people who are on a tighter budget, but really want to get a Mac for content creation, I would steer them towards the 2015 Model. You can get some really good pricing on this, and they're just almost identical in performance to the new model. In case you're wondering, all these laptops have skins on them. They're like a marble skin. If you're interested in picking one up, there's a link in the video description. And none of these are cheap, and I need to stress the fact that you totally don't need equipment like this to make really good content. Like these are expensive, but the way, I see it is this: if you can get equipment that speeds up your workflow -- Just makes the whole content creation process that much better. One of the reasons why these are so expensive, aside from being thin and light machines, is because the screens are really good quality, they're color accurate and bright, and the Razor Blade has an updated 4K panel that's coming out soon. Okay, I want to briefly talk about performance. Last year, most of my content was shot on a 4K camera called the Panasonic GH4. This year, most of my stuff is shot on a 5K camera called the Scarlet-W. Now in general, it's just bigger files, higher resolution files, so editing that stuff takes a little more horsepower. The GTX 1060 on the Razer Blade doesn't make a huge difference for 4K content, over the 1050. But when you go to higher resolution files, the difference is more noticeable. The biggest difference though comes from switching from Nvidia graphics to the AMD graphics, which you find on MacBooks. Adobe Premiere performs much better on Nvidia chips, because of the CUDA cores. AMD chips, like the ones in current MacBooks, use OpenCL or metal to render. The short of it is this: if you use Adobe Premiere you're going to get way better performance with Nvidia chips. But if you use Final Cut, those AMD chips are great. Now, I use Adobe premiere but the only reason why I use it is because that's just what I learned on. Any of the editing programs are great. If you look at the render times, like, some people will really fixate on this and think that Final Cut is the better program because it renders faster. It does, but really, when you make a video, some of these are like 20-hour jobs, who cares if we wait an extra five or ten minutes. It's really not a big deal. Any one of the editing programs are great including the ones that I've never even heard of or used. If they exist on the market, you can make YouTube videos really well with them. Okay, I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here so Amazon reached out to me And they said hey Dave we'd like to partner with you to make a gift guide for tech under $100 and I said sure that sounds like a great idea But I didn't want to cover tech that was geared towards tech enthusiasts I wanted to do stuff that I would give to my family and my friends for the holidays and in front of me are four Relatively simple items that are tech related. They're for people that enjoy tech, but they're not super complicated. Okay, so first up We have the tile Pro combo pack these are some new tractors from tile They're basically tiny Bluetooth beacons and you can stick them on anything your wallet your purse your backpack your keys Basically anything that you want to keep track of through a location device This is perfect for it it can be something that you misplace once in a while like your keys And you can keep track of it Or it can be something a little more substantial like if you're traveling you can stick it in your luggage And if you're within 200 feet or so you can keep tabs on it And these new ones come in a nicer design than they did before they have better range and they're still super easy to set up Next up is the data traveler from Kingston, so this one looks like a simple USB key And it is it functions as a USB key when you want it to but if you'll notice it actually has a lightning connector So this plugs right into your iPhone And it allows you to offload and store Photos and videos and obviously you can use this device to transfer between your computer or your family and friends Or just use it as a backup device. It comes in a few sizes This one's 64 gigs and it holds a lot But it's a great gift for anyone who has an iPhone especially the older ones with smaller capacities But just anyone who has an iPhone who doesn't have access to a computer Or doesn't know how to use your computer to frequently backup their stuff It's a tiny device, and it gives you a lot of extra storage at a reasonable price. Okay, next up We have the Dymo mobile labeler And this thing is a Bluetooth label maker which might seem like a dorky gift at first because all it does is make labels But for the right person this thing is awesome for someone who's really organized or with likes to be organized and wants their stuff labelled And printed out it's so cool You're labeling jars storage boxes any kind of household stuff Or if you'd like to have organized cabling or storage Basically if you know someone who likes having stuff organized they're gonna enjoy this and this particular unit is Bluetooth enabled So there's no buttons and keyboards on this thing to complicate it. It's all done through an app on your phone You create the label in the app, and then you print it out remotely. It's super easy to use. Okay, last up we have the Amazon Echo Dot and this is probably the most techie device of all the things in here because it Can be used for some very advanced home automation and stuff, but for the people that aren't super techy This is a great hub for voice-activated music controls, or just as like a personal assistant. And it can even read out audio books from Audible. It's really easy to set up and super inexpensive. So that's basically it, four great gifts for people that aren't super tech savvy. All of this stuff is linked in the video description below. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it. Subs if you loved it. See you guys next time. [Music] [The render went longer than the video length. Oops!] 
Hey, how's it going? Dave 2d here. So, this is the 2017 27-inch iMac and this is their fully spec'd out one. It's got the 7700K and the Radeon Pro 580 and if you purchased this from Apple from their website, it would be closing it at $5,300 which is
disgusting. Now I purchased the 8 gig model and I added my own RAM to get up to 64. So if you purchase a 27-inch iMac I highly
recommend you do the same, because Apple charges crazy amounts of money for their RAM. Now, just a quick hardware overview. This year, the 5k display has been improved a little bit. It's supposed to get 40 percent brighter, you can notice it in a really bright room, but it is measurable with the Spider. The drive speeds are faster this generation, particularly the write speeds. Now, this is the two terabyte model, I'm not sure if the smaller drives are slower. Now, in terms of the ports we get 4 USB-A and a couple of USB-C that support Thunderbolt 3. It is just a wider spread of ports than the previous generation. With a Thunderbolt 3 port external GPU connections work really well in Windows. I tried both the Razer Core and the Bizon Box 3, those connect without a hitch, but in Mac OS I'm still getting hiccups. Now, I don't know if I just need a newer version of Mac OS, so High Sierra is supposed to support external GPUs a lot better. So I'll probably revisit that in the near future. The dedicated GPUs this year are the Radeon Pro 500 series. And the one in here is the Radeon Pro 580, which is based on the RX580. It's not the most powerful GPU in the world, I mean on paper it's not too bad, it looks like it's between a GTX 1060 and a 1070, but that's what I want to do: test the hardware to see what it could do for games and video editing. So first I played some games on Mac OS and the performance is better than I thought it would be. Apple claims that you can get up to 50% better frame rates compared to the previous generation and playing some Blizzard games I'm actually getting around 40% better, so that's not bad. Now Blizzard is a developer that put a ton of effort into the Mac content, but overall pretty impressed with the gameplay. Now playing some Steam games, I don't have anything super demanding in my Steam library for Mac OS, but for the curious here's some data when running at 1440p. Now if I play at 5k resolution, as expected, framerates get choppy, but let's be real here. Macs aren't meant for 5k gaming and at 1440p
at this screen size games look really good. Running Bootcamp Windows, the Radeon Pro 580 actually gets to show off a little bit more, the biggest difference that you can play Overwatch in Windows. You still can't play anything in 5k but... whatever. Some games have scaling issues because it's not a standard 16x9 screen. You get some black bars at the top and bottom, nothing too bad and in general this card does well for gaming and bootcamp. Very comfortable performance in 1440p for moderately demanding games. Heavier games and also poorly optimized games, you'll have to drop quality or run at 1080p. But if you want to play games on the Radeon Pro 580, you're good to go. Now I tried to connect my Vibe to test out VR games, but I couldn't get it to connect. I'm not sure if it needs drivers from HTC or if I need to get High Sierra running up on this, but yeah I'll have to revisit that in the future. Right now, can't get it to connect. Ok, video editing in Adobe Premiere Pro. Now, this is where I found the most surprising results. The previous top end iMac with the M395X was never great in Premiere, but these new Radeon Pro GPUs, they're pretty good. The 580 keeps up with the GTX 1060 for 4k footage and for 5k footage from the Scarlet W, it's actually a little bit faster. And i tested this a couple times. Now, let's keep in mind this machine is stupidly expensive. I mean you could build a PC with a 7700K and a GTX 1060 for like $800-$900, it wouldn't have this amazing 5k panel, but it would be a lot cheaper. It's hard to compare the two because of this panel. The takeaway is this: the Radeon pro 580 in here is a better card than I thought it would be, it's an Apple iMac and if you build it like this configuration, it's idiotic. You're still overpaying through the nose. If you build a more reasonable configuration, I think for like 2,500 bucks, you can get something that still has this great card and has good components. That's a better value. It's still an Apple, it's still an iMac, you're overpaying, but it's a better value than Apple iMacs have been in the past. Ok, hope you guys enjoyed this

See you guys next time. 
Hey how's it going. Dave 2D here And in front of me is a laptop that will turn you into an MLG pro gamer This is the Asus 703 SCAR And they have two variants to this product. So this is the SCAR version That's geared towards first-person shooter games And then they have something called the HERO Edition Which is geared towards MOBAs So things like DOTA and League But I'm more interested in first person shooters I'm just better at those types of games So I was interested in this particular variant Now the thing that makes this thing special The thing that makes this a first person shooter oriented device is entirely the screen Now when you look at the hardware I've done a review of it's smaller brother, the 15 inch 503 And surprisingly the components are very similar Like the build quality, the keyboard, even the battery size is like almost identical So I'm not gonna do a full review of this device Because just I've basically done the full review I'm gonna focus mostly on the screen But I'm just gonna go through I guess its main components just in case you guys are curious Ok, let's start with the keyboard Pretty good keyboard, nothing super special about it. Good layout, roomy, with RGB lighting But the keys are a little bit softer than you might expect The trackpad uses Windows precision drivers, so you'll probably like it The keyboard deck is this like faux carbon fiber finish It's not real carbon fiber obviously, at least not at this price point But I think it looks nice And I guess everyone's gonna be a little bit different But I think it's a nice design overall One thing you'll notice that there isn't a single drop of red on this entire laptop When it's off. When it's on there's like a red power button And I guess the top logo lights up red But it's a really kind of plain looking laptop which I like I think this is a nice transiton away from the classic Republic of Gamers thing that Asus has done in the past like just red everywhere I like this and I think next year we're just gonna see even more not super red laptop, which is great The build quality on this thing, really good $1600 for a gaming laptop is certainly not cheap So you expect good build quality and they deliver The one thing that I don't love about this in terms of the build quality just, the build in general, is that the bottom panel is very difficult to open I had this problem with the 503 as well There's a hatch that you can get into just for the necessities, like the RAM and the storage and stuff like that. But if you want to access the fans or the Wi-Fi card or just stuff that's inside, this bottom panel is not easy to remove There are screws that come off, but it's just a pain Now the laptop has 16 GB of RAM pre-installed You can easily upgrade it to 32 by adding a single stick The fans are definitely audible, but they don't get too loud in game And thermal performance is not bad as well. You can definitely play for extended periods of time without issues The battery life on this laptop isn't great. It's a 64 watt hour battery And I'm only getting around 2 1/2 hours of battery life with the screen at 250 nits Now, there are devices with a 17 inch screen that have like 99 watt hour batteries But the reason why this one is short, well, as short as it is, is mostly because of the screen So, this screen is the main attraction of this laptop and the reason why I'm even doing this video is because I think that this is one of the most impressive screens I've seen on a 17 inch device So, it's a 120 Hz panel and it's a TN panel. Now, before you just want to take a huge steaming dump on the fact that it's a TN panel Understand that I've seen a lot of laptop screens, and yes for the most part TN panels are terrible But this one is very good. I've seen another laptop It was the MSI Raider's. Those also have a TN panel which are also really good But this is 120 Hz But it's 5 milliseconds, so it's very fast response time And when you're playing shooters, it feels like you're playing on a high-end desktop monitor. It's just a really nice looking screen The visuals are good, the colors pop, everything looks really smooth. And, unfortunately you're watching this video at 24 frames per second So you can't see the full 120 frames per second But it is a really impressive looking screen Now there's two kind of issues to this thing First, it doesn't have G-Sync and that's not something that I, like I'm not worried about it But I feel like on paper some people might be upset by it Because there are other laptops that do have 120 Hz panels that do support G-Sync But, I mean, this screen blows most screens out of the water Just because of how quick the response rate is. Now depending on how you run your games This may or may not affect you and I think that Kind of leads to the next question of the fact that this laptop is only running a GTX 1060 and this makes this laptop very niche of a product. And, okay let me explain I think a lot of people are gonna look at this and be like, why does this thing only have a GTX 1060 Why don't they put a 1070, or even a 1080 in it Forget about the heating issues and all that stuff but you would think that a laptop with a 120 Hz 5 millisecond screen should have like a really high-end graphics card in it, right? And, I would agree. But, if you're looking at the price point You want to be able to supply a laptop for people that are really hardcore, like competitively into games And if you look at any competitive gaming, they're always running their stuff at the lowest graphics settings Because they just want the highest frame rate possible And when you do that on this laptop, if you take any of the competitive shooter games, like I don't know, Overwatch, CS:GO if you run those games that even high graphics settings you're already above that target of 120 frames per second So, yeah, you could put a 1070 or try to put a 1080 in here But a lot of those frames would just be wasted because you're not even able to see it And the person who's buying this doesn't want super high graphics quality. That's just not what this was for So, if that's what you're in the market for if you want to play Witcher 3 at like 10,000 frames per second, this is not that laptop But if you're looking to be slightly more competitive in your first-person shooter games This is a great pick up. It's not cheap But I think of all the laptops that I've seen, for people that are really hardcore about a particular shooter, this is a really really good one Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time BGM 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here! And this is the Xiaomi Air 12. Now this is a device that a lot of people have been asking me to do a review for. I never did it when it first launched because it's a product that is difficult to purchase, if you're in North America, and there's some inherent risks that come with purchasing a device from a smaller company like Xiaomi. But the thing that makes this thing special is that it's kinda like the "rip-off version", the "knock-off version", of the MacBook 12". It's often compared to this because of it's shape, it's size, and it's components, so I thought I would kinda do a video to showcase the two, so that you guys can have a realistic comparison between the two. One of the more important things about this device is the build quality. This is a very high quality device, it's built really well compared to a lot of ultrabooks at this price point. So this thing actually starts at around $500, maybe $550 depending on where you purchase it from. This one in particular was from GearBest, and it cost around $530. Now the design language is quite similar to the MacBook, not that they're identical, but you can see that it's obviously been inspired by Apple's design. Simple, flat slab, and this one actually has no branding or marking on the top of it, it's actually difficult to tell which company this product came from just by looking at it. Now in terms of its thickness, this one's thicker and heavier, but it's very comfortable to hold still. The device is well made for the price, it's not super solid, I wouldn't say it's as well-built as a MacBook, and I wouldn't say it's as durable as a MacBook, in terms of, like, when you press on it and how much flex there is. But it's surprisingly well-made, and I would say it's better-made than almost any other ultrabook at this price point. So the keyboard has some flex to it, it's not a lot. Uhh... I mean, it's not as rigid as a MacBook, I'll demonstrate on the MacBook. It's a little more rigid, but it's not a huge difference. The display that they're using is a 1080 panel, it's not as high resolution as the MacBook panel, it's also not as bright, nor as color-accurate. But it's a really nice screen nonetheless. It's also not a touchscreen, despite it being a glossy finish as well. The keyboard on the Xiaomi is actually pretty good, I would say it's easier to get used to than the MacBook keyboard. I like how everything just feels like a regular keyboard on this, there's no super-thin butterfly switches or anything, it's very comfortable to type on. The one thing I don't like is the trackpad, not that it's a bad trackpad, but I definitely prefer the MacBook trackpad. This uses a Synaptic driver, so it's not ideal, but it's not bad. Okay, let's talk about ports. So Xiaomi was smart, they realized that not everyone likes that whole "single port" thing on the MacBook. These guys have a single HDMI port, an audio jack, and then on the other side we have the USB-A and USB-C. Performance on this machine is pretty good. I mean, on paper it doesn't look amazing, it's a Sky Lake m3. But when you compare it for just actual use, regular use, day-to-day stuff, it performs really well. It's not as fast as an i5 or an i7, but unless you're doing more CPU-intensive stuff, you probably won't notice a difference. One thing to note: the MacBook from 2016 is actually running the same processor, but the clockspeed is a little bit higher, so this particular chip, you can kinda ramp up the speed if you throw enough wattage at it, and that's what Apple has done. They're running the stock speeds, so 0.9 GHz, but when I use them, they feel really similar. If you want to play games on the Xiaomi, you can play some really light titles, but anything even mildly intense just won't run very well on this system. The speakers on the Xiaomi are actually not bad, they're better than most ultrabook speakers at this size, but they're still not as good as the MacBook speakers, and I'll give you a little quick speaker test. So, obviously, MacBook has better speakers, but this thing's a lot cheaper, yeah. Okay, we're going to take a look at the inside, pretty easy to get in there, it's some torx screws. On the inside, you can see the single SATA stick that they include. The weird thing is that they have two M.2 slots, there's only one of them that supports SATA, and then the other one supports PCIe, you have to use specifically those interfaces for those two sticks. The battery's pretty big, it's actually 37 watt hours, the MacBook has a 41 watt hour battery, and you're going to get slightly better battery life on that thing. You're going to get around 9 hours on the MacBook, around 7 hours on this, even though this has only a slightly smaller battery. The RAM is unfortunately soldered-on, it's 4 gigs and you're stuck with 4 gigs regardless of the configuration. And lastly you'll notice there's no fans, it's a completely silent system, with the ultra low-voltage CPU. But everything in here looks nicely packed together, there's no wasted space in here or anything. Thermal output is comfortable, I mean, it is an ultra low-voltage chip, so nothing gets super hot or anything. If you're curious about the webcam, it looks better than the MacBook webcam. 720p, the MacBook has a 480p cam. So the ultimate question is whether or not the Xiaomi Air 12 is worth the price, because as you could see in this review, the MacBook is better across the board, except for a few things. So like, the keyboard on the Xiaomi is better, arguably, the ports selection is better on the Xiaomi, and, well, the webcam is better on the Xiaomi. But aside from that, the MacBook is better all around the board, other than the fact that it runs OS X, that's a preference thing. So is it worth it? I think it is. It's really difficult to compare something like this when the price is so different. But if you're looking to purchase something that's like a thin-and-light ultrabook, It-- I've always felt that the MacBook was just too expensive for what it offered. This thing gives surprisingly good value at this price. The only thing, and really, the only thing that holds me back from just being like, "Hey, everyone just go buy this thing!" is the fact that it has to come from China, or somewhere in Asia, and if there are problems with this laptop, you're going to have a tough time getting it fixed. That's the end of this video, hope you guys enjoyed it. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! I'll see you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here, and this is the review of the Gigabyte Sabre 15. This is not a particularly well-known laptop, but it's in that $1000 gaming laptop market, and I think it's pretty interesting. So, this is one of the first laptops at this price point that I've reviewed that didn't have some kind of color accents on it. There's no red, orange; it's all black, inside and outside. There's still some edges and it's got a bit of an angular design, but there's nothing obnoxious about this laptop. I like that. The build quality on this thing is decent, it could be better, the top panel has a bit more flex than I'd like. Chassis has some flex, nothing out of the ordinary. The keyboard deck itself is sturdy when you're typing, the hinge also seems to be good. As a whole, it doesn't feel delicate but I wouldn't want to drop this laptop. The other thing is that it's got a matte finish, so fingerprints show pretty readily on this thing. There's a good selection of ports, there's ethernet, three display outputs, and SD card slot. Four USB ports, one of them being 3.1 Type-C, and lastly some audio jacks. I don't like how the ports on the right are clustered on the bottom. If you're right handed and you're all connected up, it can get a little jungly down there. I like the keyboard a lot, part of it is the backlighting, the base model comes with a white backlight. The upgraded models have RGB backlighting that's controllable in three zones. Not individually lit, but it's a nice spectrum to choose from. And honestly, it's just nice to have options that aren't red. Now, I might laying it a little thick with the whole "I don't like red" thing, But seriously, every single gaming laptop at this pricepoint has red on it. This is so refreshing to see. Okay, the keyboard is also nice to type on, layout isn't bad, it has a 2mm stroke. More than most laptop keyboards, but I don't know if it makes that much of a difference. Mechanism feels a little soft, but I like it overall. The trackpad, it's a plastic surface, feels smooth, and because it uses Windows drivers, the accuracy and gesture controls are great. It uses dedicated physical buttons and I like them, not everyone likes physical buttons, but they do a good job on these ones. The click feels good and it's not too loud or anything. Okay, in terms of performance, it's your standard-issue Kaby Lake i7 and GTX 1050 or 1050 Ti combo. And if you want to see detailed benchmarks for this combination, there's a link below. But if you get the 1050 Ti, it's a device that'll get you really solid frame rates on most AAA titles. Light-to-moderate demanding games, like Overwatch and Doom, will break 60 FPS on ultra graphics. Heavier games, like Battlefield 1, will be in the mid-to-high 50s on high graphics, it still looks really good, though. The heaviest games, like Watch Dogs 2, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Witcher 3, those need the graphics to be on medium to get really smooth frame rates. But for the price, this has great performance. The screen is an IPS panel, 1080p. Bezels aren't too thick, viewing angles are also pretty good. It could get a little brighter, though. This is just bright enough for me at work, and if you bring this outdoors, it'll be tough to see the screen. Color gamut and accuracy aren't the best, but it's on par for a laptop at this price point. 720p webcam, looks pretty average. Opening the device up involves removing a bunch of screws, including some in the battery area. Inside, you can upgrade or replace the RAM sticks, they've included one stick of 16 gigs. And you also have access to both drive bays. The included SSD in this unit uses a SATA interface, but it does support NVMe drives. The 47 watt battery is removable, I'm actually surprised that this thing packs 47 watt hours, that's not very big. The obvious advantage is that you can swap out batteries, if you purchase spares. It feels like something from the 1990s, but for the right user, this can be super useful. Battery life is short, you're looking at around 3.5, 4 hours of regular use, with the screen at max brightness. Playing games, it's going to be less than an hour. The single heat pipes that they use aren't my favorite. And for the GPU, the heat needs to travel quite a bit before it gets to the fins to cool down. Now when I play games, I don't notice any kind of throttling. I literally played four hours of Overwatch one night, and it didn't skip a beat. But it gets hot. GPU temperatures in game can get to around 85 degrees. But on extended stress tests, it's closer to 90 degrees. External temperatures are fine, even the warmer GPU doesn't make that part of the laptop uncomfortable. Fan noise is moderately controllable, through their software. With performance mode, fans kick in frequently on idle, and it's noticeable but not too loud. And then on full load the fans get a bit louder. The speakers sound okay, but they're not in a great location. They're facing downwards onto the table and audio clarity isn't great. The volume gets reasonably loud, though. Okay, the Sabre 15, it's Gigabyte's entry into that whole $1000 gaming laptop market. It has a plastic build, decent structural integrity, but the exterior feels a little less sturdy. The screen is about average for the price point of a gaming laptop. Slightly more color accurate, but slightly dimmer. The keyboard is good, the RGB backlighting is particularly nice at this price. Trackpad and buttons are also both pretty good. Inside, the Kaby Lake i7 and the GTX 1050 can deliver really strong performance, but the thermal management on the GPU isn't the best. The RAM and the storage are easily upgraded if you need and there's a user-swappable 47Wh battery that'll give you a little less than four hours of battery life. So, with the Sabre 15, you're paying for a device that doesn't have black and red, which is a win in my books. But you're also getting a device that doesn't have the best thermal management or the best build quality. Now, if you're looking for a device that has this type of look, you won't be disappointed with this. I mean, you're not going to have the best thermals, but they're pretty good, and I think, overall, this device is a great performing laptop. Hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! I'll see you guys next time. 
Hey how's it going? Dave 2D here. And this is the Aero 15 from Gigabyte. This is their new all-purpose thin and powerful laptop. Now I get a lot of devices that come through this office, but once in a while I get something that just really exceeds my expectations. This is one of them. It has a plastic build, it feels very similar to the Aero 14 materials. It's a little bigger but the idea is the same. The top surface comes in various colors. If you want something a little less loud the black looks pretty good. The Gigabyte logo lights up. I'm not the biggest fan of light-up logos but that's just a personal preference thing. So, for a predominantly plastic laptop the build quality is good. It starts at $1,900 which is pretty expensive for a laptop and I know some of you are going to say that you can get a laptop with a 1060 for like a thousand or $1200. The thing is they aren't going to be this thin and they certainly aren't gonna have the features that this thing has. So, when you build something this thin and this light, you're going to have to pay a premium because the manufacturer has to get custom PCB, custom thermal solutions to cool something this thin and this powerful and keep it in a package this small. Ok, the port selection is above average for a device like this. You get Ethernet, HDMI   2, DP 1.3, an audio jack, 3 USB3s, a Thunderbolt 3 port and an SD reader. I did ask about the Thunderbolt 3 port just to see if it was by 2 or by 4 in terms of PCIe lanes and they said it was four lanes of PCIe so that's a good thing. It's pretty easy to open it up and when you're in there you have access to the two RAM slots. You can load up to 32 gigs of DDR4. But the best part and I really mean the best part is that there's two M.2 storage bays in here. Somehow over the course of time it became the standard to have just one stick of storage for these thin and light performance machines. This has two. I really like that. Now the included drive uses a slower SATA interface but it does support NVMe Drive so you could just use the included drive as like a storage drive or something. The battery down here is 94 watt hours. Battery life is pretty good. With the screen at 250 nits I'm getting around 7 hours of battery life. Playing games, I'm getting about an hour and the charger has that bonus USB port. The keyboard has individual RGB lighting which is always fun to play with and it can actually be really useful. I adjust the colors to match the shortcuts and apps and stuff. The layout is good, nicely spaced out, the keys themselves are a little stiff. It's hard to describe this, but it needs more pressure than I'm used to just to activate the stroke. But once you get used to it, it's a good keyboard overall. The trackpad uses Elan drivers and to be honest I'm not a fan of Elan drivers, but this feels noticeably better than the one on the Aero 14. It could be from updated drivers or potentially updated hardware. I'm not sure what it is but the tracking is improved. It's not perfect, but it's not bad. The screen is awesome. It's the headlining feature of the laptop it has a super thin bezel matte finish and the panel has great color gamut and accuracy. It's 1080p non-touchscreen. It has this X-Rite Pantone certification and out of the box the colors are just bang on. It could be a little brighter and I'm seeing some mild ghosting. The laptop is geared towards productivity and content creators so brighter is always good. There's supposed to be a 4k option down the line but this 1080p panel looks really good as it is. The webcam is down at the bottom because of the bezels so you get that upward nose angle. And this is what it looks like. I should probably shave this. Ok, let's talk performance. I was pretty sure this would have some kind of heat issues, because it's thin and light and you're stuffing a GTX 1060 in there. But it's cooled well and performance is strong. It has really extensive fan control through their software and I like that and - I don't know maybe it's just me - but I really liked the fact that you can control the fans. Like if you want to, you can run it on quiet mode, which is basically silent And, you'll throttle it if you're benchmarking or you can let it go on automatic mode Or you can manually crank up the fans to get maximum performance. Fan noise on automatic mode is actually quieter than I thought it would be under load. Performance is so good and the external temperatures are comfortable. There's no nasty hot spots. Gameplay is really nice on this thing. It's a Kaby Lake i7, GTX 1060 in an ultraportable, it's awesome. If you're playing at 1080p you'll comfortably break 100 frames per second in Overwatch on ultra. In Doom it floats in the low to mid 90s on ultra graphics as well. It's really weird seeing these kinds of frame rates on a laptop with five millimeter bezels. It's like luxury gaming. Something heavier like The Division, you'll need to drop the graphics to high in order to stay near that 60 frames per second. The hardware is great for games. If you want to see more details and benchmarks there's a link in the description. Now, with a color accurate display and two drive bays, the Aero 15 is clearly made for creative professionals as well. This thing is going to do really well with Photoshop and Illustrator workflows. In regards to video editing, this is one of my favorite laptops I've used for edits. This is only the 1080p panel, I'd want the 4k panel for my content but performance is great. With 4K footage the 1060 isn't a huge jump up in performance from the 1050 but it pulls further ahead with a 5K or higher resolution footage. The speakers are located underneath, like the Aero 14, and they sound really similar, if not the same Good clarity, good volume but not much bass. Alright, the Aero 15 starts at $1,900. You're getting a thin and light laptop that's housed in mostly plastic. Build quality is good for the materials. The screen has super-thin bezels with excellent color accuracy and viewing angles. The keyboard is pretty good. It has a nice layout, but the keystrokes can feel a little stiff. The trackpad feels reasonably accurate even with Elan drivers. On the inside it's running a Kaby Lake i7 and a GTX 1060 which deliver strong performance. Cooling is done well. It's loud if you're going full-tilt, but the temperatures are good. The RAM is upgradable and so are the two drives. Did I mention it has two drives? The 94Wh battery is big and it will last you a comfortable seven hours of battery life. So there's so much I like about this laptop: the performance, the screen, the battery life, the two drive bays. It's just an all-round fantastic machine with great performance, thin and light, ultraportable. Is it the best in this market? It's tough because the build quality isn't as good as its two main competitors: the XPS 15 and the Razer Blade. Those have better build quality but for the price this has better performance all around than the other two. So it's kind of ... you got to pick your poison. I like this machine a lot. I don't know if I would recommend this as, like, the best of the three, because it really depends on what you're looking for. But if you're looking for this type of machine this should be on your short list because it's fantastic. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it; subs if you loved it. See you guys next time. 
- Hey! How's it going? Dave2D here. I hope I'm in the frame. I can't even see
the screen of this phone. Obviously, I'm not filming in my office,
this is just at home. I want to shoot something just during the holiday break. Thank you so much for a million subscribers, I appreciate it so much like, I can't... Thank you, all the new people that subscribed, the original people... People that like, watch me out of love,
the people that hate watching me, It doesn't even matter, I appreciate every single one of you guys. When you start YouTube, At least for me, You don't really think of a goal of like, A million subscribers is not one of
the goals that I personally had It was just not even in the radar and
then, over the course of this year, Like, it's just- it happened, and it's just... Thank you so much! I really appreciate it. I thought I'd just make a little like montage of stuff that I've experienced over the past three years, I got to experience because of you guys... Okay. - My name is Dave2D.
- This is Dave2D. - This is Dave2D. - This is the worst idea ever... [Lewis] - First of all, you need to take it down a notch because you're... [Dave] - Because I'm too loud?
[Lewis] - I mean you're scaring people in this video... - Oh my ****! This is so heavy! - I know it seems kind of silly to make a thank you
video after 150 subs, but seriously, I never thought this channel would've meant to anything, I didn't think I'd have any subs. I just did this for fun, So it's super cool to have people on board that are interested in the stuff I'm making. - I'm about to hit 2,000 subs, or maybe by the time this thing gets published, I will be over 2,000, but that is-
that is just awesome to me, I mean to me, that means that 2,000 people actually
care about the videos I am putting out. - I can't even express in words just how... appreciative I am for the support that you guys have given me over the past ten months
because, it takes I mean, I put a lot of effort into these videos, a lot. I mean, some of these videos take
like 15, sometimes 20 hours to bang one out and like, I do it because I really give a sh*t about these videos. I spend way too much time on them. My wife thinks I'm crazy, and my friends think I'm nuts. My work suffers heavily because of this YouTube channel But I do it because you guys are awesome. The community that we've built over the
past 10 months is just like phenomenal. - You guys has basically turned a channel that had 
zero subscribers last year, in January of 2015 I had zero subscribers, into something that
is such a big part of my life now and like, You guys are to thank for it. Thank you
so much. We've made this community that's just awesome and every time I get to make a video and share it with you guys It's just, it's the best thing in the world. Thanks a lot. - So yeah, if you like my video, like it.
If you want to sub, sub! Now, I know you're thinking, you know... "Dave2D, you have one video, and I've already
seen it, so why am I subbing?" So... You know how sometimes you hear about that guy who bought apple stock at like, 10 bucks. Now you can be that guy. 
 Hello, everyone! I'm Dave2D   MWC is now being held   There are already several devices released   I will briefly introduce them to you and then give my opinion   The most important flagship of this expo: Samsung Galle S9   Most of the information mentioned at the conference was disclosed very early   But it's still a cool mobile phone   If you don’t know much about this phone, it’s basically   The design is basically the same as the previous generation S8   But there are four changes: its screen is brighter. Faster processor, better sound, and enhanced camera   Camera looks good on written data, with adjustable aperture between F1.5 and F2.4   In a popular point of view, the amount of light entering the sensor can be controlled by changing the aperture of the body.   It sounds cool, but my intuition tells me it's actually overstated   My opinion may change after I get real machine evaluation   But you just think about how they do marketing for this   Samsung expects to release a large number of apertures of S9 F2.5 and previous S8 F1.7   If there is a big change, they will be publicized   Because it will make people who want to buy a mobile phone to pursue the quality of the camera.   But we did not see it. What we see more is a cool slow-motion image   But I still hope to see amazing photos   But after all, the S8 last year was really a very good phone.   For many people, the S8 is a perfect cell phone with a little flaw.   And S9 has fixed these small defects   So now you have a perfect Galeone mobile phone   S9 also has a less well-known feature   Which is an upgraded heart rate sensor   I'm not sure what the principle is, but based on their publicity it can measure blood pressure   In the past, sphygmomanometers were measured on the arm of the wrist   All clinic hospitals use traditional sphygmomanometers   You have to wear it on your hand, inflate it, and then take your blood pressure   This is basically the only way humans can measure accurate blood pressure   S9 is said to use an optical sensor to accomplish this task   If this is really useful, not Samsung's tricks   Being able to measure blood pressure with an optical sensor on a mobile phone is a very big invention   I know this does not have a great impact on young people but for the elderly   Can measure blood pressure on the phone   Can be very useful   In addition to this, S9 has nothing new to attract me   It's a good phone, but if you don't have S8, S8 is a good alternative to S9.   Continue to say that another attractive mobile phone is the Vivo APEX concept phone   This is just a concept phone, not even a engineering machine   This is just a very cool concept machine   Screen capture ratio breaks through the sky, and the front looks very stunning   The top and left and right frames are 1.8 mm   At the bottom is a 4.3mm border   They were able to do this because they made some adjustments to their position   The traditional handset is replaced by a bone conduction handset   Pop-up camera replaces the front camera embedded in the frame   Flexible OLED screens allow them to plug more stuff on both sides   There is also fingerprint recognition under the screen   But this is only a concept. It was estimated that it cost $5,000 to make a mobile phone.   But this is really cool. I think this is the future of smart phones.   This is the smallest mobile phone we have ever seen   When it comes to borderless devices, the newest Huawei MateBook X Pro is the one that catches my eye.   This may be the best looking laptop I have seen so far   It has a very narrow frame and a very beautiful design   Configuration is also good: It is equipped with the eighth generation of low voltage processor   There are MX150 graphics card   It is also a pop-up camera because there is no place on the border   So they put it under a button   It looks very good, but to tell the truth this camera's angle will be very bad   On the LG Gram and XPS 13 with the camera on the lower border or hinge   Their angle is not very good, but users can at least reach a better angle by rotating the screen   The camera angle is fixed on the latest MateBook, but I think this sacrifice is worthwhile for a borderless screen.   Previous generation of MateBook: MateBook X released last year is very good   But battery life is very bad   This generation has a 57 watt-hour battery that has been improved from the previous 40-watt-hour battery   In other words, the battery capacity has almost 50% increase.   This means that this battery will have a full battery life   I think there should be 8 or 9 hours of battery life   According to Huawei, it can reach 12 hours, but uses a very power-saving setting   No one will adjust the equipment to 150 nits, completely unrealistic   In terms of hardware, it is very good except for two points   First, I don't really like the previous Huawei logo   Another point is its security   I don't know how safe it is, but it is a Chinese company   Hardware is not monitored   Certainly some people will have concerns   For me, this will not affect me at all   However, there are some problems for people who consider network security.   This video is almost over here. There are three products on the MWC that surprise me.   More good products will be released in the next few days   I hope you enjoy this video, and you'll like your subscription. See you next time.  
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And this is the Asus ZenBook Pro for 2017 This is the UX550, and this thing was announced quite a few months ago I think was like March at Computex when
this thing was revealed and I finally been able to spend some time with it It's a very powerful machine It's one of those thin-and-light work-oriented machines that also has a GTX 1050 Ti So if you want to play some games, you can... And this is the type of stuff that gets me excited. These are the type of laptops that I'm most interested in because I mean, they're kind of stealth like, they don't look like, they're not designed for gaming, but because of the video card, you'd think they'd be able to bang if you really want them to This one... Errrgh, you'll see the end of the video as to why it's not so much of a gaming laptop but it is a very good laptop for what it was meant for. I want to talk with the design first. First thing, black. This is the first Asus laptop that I've used that is black, so fully black finish, black top, black bottom There is a silver chamfer as you go around the edges But the whole idea of this thing is black. The build quality on this thing is... Good, better than expected and let me explain. The UX501 from last year and the year before had... okay build quality, not amazing, as the panels were a little softer when you press down on them. This thing is... definitely more rigid. It's definitely better build quality than the UX501 but, it's still not perfect There's still a little bit of flex on all the panels, the top, the bottom, the keyboard deck. The screen itself If you try to torque that, it's super solid. I couldn't get it twisted very much. The hinges are also well-made. The laptop on a whole I would consider to have good build quality, not excellent I wish it was better but, it is good. The port selection on this thing is good. There's actually two Thunderbolt 3 ports and those run on all four lanes of PCIe so If you plug up an external GPU, you're gonna get max bandwidth The thing that I don't love is the inclusion of a microSD slot. Now, it's cool that they have an SD slot at all, but it's microSD and this is a pro laptop, right? This is the ZenBook Pro and working professionals Very few of them are using microSD's as their main like, form of data transfer It just doesn't make sense that they put that there. It seems almost useless because You're not gonna use that. I would much prefer to see a regular SD slot, but you're stuck with that And that kind of bugs me. There's a lot of good stuff about this laptop. I like the screen I like the speakers. The speakers are actually very very impressive It has the Harman Kardon branding and usually when you have that kind of branding on a laptop It means nothing. This time, There's four speakers, two on the top, two on the bottom. The ones on the bottom are down-firing And they sound really good. I was quite impressed with it They don't sound super loud, but the audio quality is there. The mids, the lows, the highs They're all present, and they sound good. Back to the screen up top, this one's running a 1080p panel They do make a 4K panel if I'm not mistaken But this one's 1080p. Touchscreen. The color accuracy is there. It's not super bright... I wish it was brighter, but the overall image is nice And the bezels on the screen aren't too thick, it's like, I don't know It kind of looks like the newer MacBooks in terms of the bezel thickness, but it's just an improvement over their regular Asus ZenBook Pro line. It's just a thinner, cleaner looking design up top. Okay, to get to the inside of this laptop I've removed the screws, but it's pretty simple. There's ten screws. They all pop off pretty easily, T4 And when you get inside, things get less awesome? So far, it seems like a really good laptop, right? Okay. On the inside We have a fast SSD which is good We get a great Wi-Fi card, the Intel 1865, which is good The RAM is soldered on and this bugs me This is not like one of those super-thin laptops, right? So, it doesn't make sense to me that the RAM is soldered on. Now, maybe it was a space issue Maybe it was an energy efficiency issue because you know when you solder on RAM, when it's built on board It uses slightly less energy, and if that's the case... Fine, but I just don't like seeing soldered-on RAM But the thing that bugs me is the thermal design So, we're looking at two heat pipes to cool a GTX 1050 Ti and an i7 7700HQ, so these are pretty hot components, it's not like the hottest stuff out there but they're not cool components and You'll see in the thermal performance later on that they don't do great. And the battery down here is a 72 watt-hour cell. It's getting around 6 hours of battery life with the screen at 250 nits. So this is probably in the middle of the pack in terms of battery life. It's because it's not a huge battery It's kind of a small chassis so the batteries, there's only so much space in here But if you're gonna bring this thing to class or to work, and you're expecting a full day of use out of it You're probably gonna have to bring the charger with you Just because it's a little bit tight. Um... before I get into performance because I know that's what a lot of people are interested in, I want to talk about the keyboard and the trackpad. So Keyboard is a very standard Asus keyboard. It's a good keyboard. The Home, Page Up, Page Down buttons are on the side and I like them there but not everyone does because if you're not used to them being there, if you're trying to hit Backspace or Shift or Enter, you might hit those keys But I like them there because if you want to,
you can use them And you will get used to their positioning, it doesn't interfere with my regular typing anymore But for people that haven't used an Asus keyboard like this before There's a bit of a learning curve. The keystrokes themselves are a little bit soft, but firm at the same time It's hard to describe but basically the pressure that it takes to activate the switch is a little more than your average keyboard, but the spring feels softer So, it's a different type of experience than I'm used to. I just haven't used an Asus keyboard for a while but... You'll get used to it quickly because when I use this thing for like three to four months before, not this one, but a keyboard very similar to this You get used to it, and it's not a problem. Trackpad, good trackpad Probably its best feature in terms of the inputs It uses Windows Precision drivers, so it's got accurate tracking and has a fingerprint sensor for quick logins and stuff in Windows Hello. Okay, let's talk about performance because that's probably the most important thing because if it doesn't have good performance, Nothing matters, right? Okay. The performance on this thing, I got to open her back up to kind of show what I'm talking about, is... good for certain people, and not so good for other people so this is running, like I said earlier, the 1050 Ti and a 7700HQ, the Kaby Lake i7. And... Because the thermal output on these two chips is quite high It's difficult to cool something like this in a chassis this small and this compact, and with the heat pipes that they have, there's only two, maybe even one and a half heat pipes You're not gonna get the best cooling. If you're doing work stuff If you're doing like video edits and renders and stuff This is sufficient because You're not stressing the GPU at 100% all the time and your workload because you're kind of using the GPU here and there as you do stuff in Photoshop or Premiere. So I ran some video edits and I ran some renders. This thing runs really well. You're getting the performance you would expect just on the paper specs. The 1050 Ti is a good card for video editing, but when you start playing games That's when issues start to rise The temps creep up and after like 20-30 minutes of gaming, you're gonna notice some serious thermal throttling and you could probably resolve this If you re-paste it, or if you undervolt it and I mean you can, I'm not gonna do it on this unit and I'm positive that if you did, if you repasted this and if you undervolt this, you would get better performance. But I wouldn't pick up this laptop if your main purpose is to play games It's a really nice looking laptop, and it's slim, but because of the thermal issues I can't just openly recommend it for people who are quote, unquote, "gamers". The fans don't come on very often. When it's idle, it's actually very quiet, but at full load, It's a little bit loud, not super annoying or anything, but it can get loud So this is a laptop that was designed for professional users, right? It's a ZenBook Pro and I think because of what it's equipped with, because it has a 1050 Ti, because it has an i7, I think a lot of people are drawn to the specs and think, "Hey, I can pick this up and play games really well on it," but that's not what it was designed for, unfortunately. It's a really nice looking laptop. It's not super expensive I think the base model starts at 1400-1500 dollars. This unit here with everything I've decked it out with, $1700, but... Yeah, if you're a gamer and you're hoping that this would be like, the gaming laptop that didn't look like a gaming laptop, This is not that laptop, I'm sorry. I was disappointed, and I feel like a lot of my viewers were really interested in this thing because it had such potential... But, no, it's not the one. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! If you're curious like, if you're looking for other options I don't know if anyone is still sticking around to this part of the video, but, if you're curious, I've been using... the Aero 15X so this is the upgraded model This is not that different in size from the ZenBook Pro. It's a completely different price point This is significantly more expensive, but they've designed this thing to house a GTX 1070. It's a significantly more powerful video card, but it's similar in size But the way that they're doing is that they have to crack this thing open and like, they're putting a ton of venting on this thing to make it more viable for gaming and That's not what the ZenBook does. They try to keep it clean and minimal, and just very nice looking It does look a heck a lot nicer than this. Like, look at this But this thing is where you're gonna get performance. If you want something that's built for gaming, look at other options like this Errr, the Aero 15, this is actually the Aero 15X. Okay. See you in the next video. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And in front of me are three wireless earbuds that don't suck. Everyone knows this one – the Apple AirPods. These are great. I would consider these to be one of Apple's best products from this year, but there's three issues with them. First, they're expensive. $160 is a lot of money for any kind of wireless earphones, and secondly, they fall out pretty easily when I'm running with them or if I'm doing anything active. If I have them in my ear, if I'm like, moving my head a little too much, they will fall off and I think a lot of people have that issue. And I know there are third-party products that you can kind of hook up to it to make it stay in your ear, but if you don't have them, they fall out pretty readily. But, the thing that I think is, kind of "universally known," is that they are pretty ugly in your ear. So, they've been around for like, what? Six, seven months now, maybe more? And still, when people have them in their ears, they just look... they just don't look good. It's very iconic, it's like the super ugly Apple Q-tips, and I just don't like the way they look. So, I have found two – I guess, new – products that have come out that I've been testing, that I like a lot. And...let's go through them. So, the first one is a Zolo Liberty+... (I should take these out of my ear...) ...Zolo Liberty+. So these are, I guess, the second generation of their wireless earbuds? This is like the parent company to...this is Anker. They normally make like battery packs and charging devices, but they make some good wireless earbuds. Now, the original wireless Liberty were not great, I had connectivity issues. These new ones don't, and I think that's a really important thing when it comes to any kind of wireless device. If it ever drops connection, like, to me that just makes me not like the product, but these ones do not have connectivity issues. They're very reliable and that's one of the great things about the Apple AirPods. So, the Liberty+ comes in this pretty premium looking box. It's all metal and it's heavy. It definitely has some weight to it, and I think a lot of that weight comes from the battery. It does have a relatively large battery in there, and I think the aesthetic of the earbuds themselves look nice. It's a larger design than the Apple AirPods, but there's no appendage so you don't have that Q-tip look going. And, I would say that the unit is kind of bulky – like, it's just bulkier than the AirPods – but, they don't feel heavy. I mean, when you put them your ear, you don't notice their weight or anything like that. The connection is good, it's very easy to pair and setup with your phone, and I find that the audio is good – not amazing though. I don't find that any of these have amazing audio. I think that these are slightly, ever so slightly, better than the AirPods. But, again, similar sound quality between the three. And when it comes to fit, the Liberty+ has these rubber tips that you can attach to it, and I find that they fit my ears really well. Obviously, everyone's gonna have a different ear shape or ear size, so everyone's gonna have a different experience with this, but they work well for me. All right, some other thoughts. I don't like how this thing uses micro USB to charge. It's 2017, and this thing's made by Anker, right? Anker has a ton of USB-C products. I just find it really weird that they would use Micro-USB on this device. So if you're unfamiliar with how these things work – or just how any of these things work – It's like, you have this case that holds a battery and then the wireless earbuds themselves have batteries inside them, so you use them for a few hours and then when you're done – when those things are depleted or just when you're done using them – you put them back in the case, and the case has a battery inside and that in turn, charges the batteries inside the little earbuds. So, you gotta charge the thing pretty frequently. It's just really weird that they use Micro-USB in late 2017, that's a bit of a bummer, but the thing I do like about this thing – a lot – is how easy it is to put the actual earbuds into the case. And I know it sounds like really simple because we've seen the AirPods – they do it really well, you just drop it in and it works perfectly. Same thing with these guys you just put it in, there's no fiddling around as long as we have the left and right one sorted out. You just drop it in and you're good to go. Now when it comes to battery life, they claim three and a half hours per charge for the earbuds – I'm actually getting closer to four hours – and then you can get up to 48 hours of use just by charging it up through the case, which is a relatively long lasting set up. Okay, let's talk about this thing. This is the crazybaby Air (NANO) – that is a mouthful of a name. This is a much less premium feeling case. It definitely has more plastic to it, and it just feels a little more flimsy, but the product is good. So, this thing uses USB-C to charge –
which I love – but there's definitely a less premium vibe to this casing. It's not super cheap or anything, but it's not as good as this thing. This is all metal, this is all plastic. And even compared to the AirPods. Like, this is a polycarbonate case, very plastic case obviously, but it does feel more, no. Just feels more refined. This is definitely more flimsy. Okay, the actual devices themselves. They come out readily, and they're small. So these are white – these come in a bunch of colors, but I got the ones in white. But strangely enough, these don't stick out like a sore thumb when you wear them in your ear. And I think part of it – or, a big part of it – is that they don't have the appendage like the AirPods. These just sit in your ear and they look normal to me. But if you want, you can get them in a bunch of different colors. In terms of fit, again, It comes with a bunch of rubber tips and rubber hooks that you can use to make this thing more custom to your ear, but I don't find these as comfortable for my ear. But everyone's gonna be a little bit different. Audio quality, again, is good – not amazing – but, it's earbuds right? Unless you're paying huge amounts of money, You're never gonna get great audio quality from earbuds – especially not wireless ones. But these ones, I would actually say are the worst of the three, just by a bare amount. I mean they're all very similar, but if I had to just label them in terms of rank, I would say Zolo sounds the best by a little bit. AirPods in the middle, and then the Air (NANO) last. Now battery life on these are short, relatively short. These are three hours, and I'm getting –
maybe a little bit more – but close to three hours. But charging these things are not my favorite things. So, when you open up the case, Unlike the other two, you have to line these up quite well to get them to charge properly. Now it's not so much an issue of getting used to it, because I've been using them for a while, it's more about just how the charging mechanism works. You have to place it and kind of rotate it perfectly, and it's just hard to line it up each time. But, it's not bad. It's still relatively easy to charge all of these. I do like the size of the (NANO) air. It's a very small and clean looking device when you have it in your ear. It's just unobtrusive and then, same thing when it's in the case. It's just a relatively small and lightweight case. It's just smaller and lighter than the case on the Liberty+. So all three of these are relatively good options, I don't think you can go wrong with either of them. Here's a comparison chart, so you can guys make your own decision. But to wrap it up, if you're an Apple user and you have $160 to spare, the Apple AirPods are an obvious choice. But if you're not, and you want to spend a little bit less money on your earbuds, these two are great options. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here So this is a video that's not one of my regular hardware videos It's about something that has plagued Windows laptops for a really long time It's this issue that keeps popping up here and there, and it doesn't matter if your laptop is new or old, or... expensive or cheap, it doesn't matter, because you can still have this issue It's the trackpad There are Windows laptops out there, lots of them, that have really crappy trackpads, and that boils down to one thing... Software. If you have... great hardware like this one, glass surface, great button mechanics... But... It's got crappy software. It's running Elan drivers And, if you're one of those laptop owners that's running something with an Elan driver or Synaptics driver You're not having a good time with the trackpad At least, you can have a better time with the trackpad using Windows Precision drivers. And this video explains how to put those drivers onto your existing laptop So first you have to figure out whether your laptop is running Elan drivers or Synaptics drivers, and to do that, you just go to Control Panel Check out the Device Manager and you'll be able to see what you're running And if you're not running either one of those two, you're either running Windows Precision drivers already Or you're running something weird that this video can't help you with Okay, once you have figured which one you have, either Elan or Synaptics, You download one of the two files that are linked in the video description One is for people with Synaptics trackpads, and the other's for the people with Elan trackpads, and depending on which one you have, you just download the appropriate one. But in case you're wondering Both of these files are actually from Lenovo; they weren't meant for this kind of "hack" that we're doing. They were meant for something else obviously But, it worked perfectly for this kind of replacement of the Synaptics or Elan trackpad drivers So, once you have the file, you extract it by either running the "exe" or unzipping it, and it will place all the files into a folder called "Drivers" in a route, and then you go into your Device Manager again, right-click your trackpad whether it is the Elan one or Synaptics one, and then you go "Update driver", "Browse my computer" Choose "Let me pick" and then click on "Have disk" Now if you have a laptop with Elan driver, you go for the "ETD.inf" file And for the laptops with Synaptics trackpad, choose the Synaptics driver. So basically, you're replacing the existing drivers on your laptop, whether they be Elan or Synaptics, and you're replacing them with Windows Precision touchpad drivers which are SO MUCH better, and the biggest difference you'll notice is, I mean tracking is smooth and everything Tracking is just much more accurate with Windows Precision drivers But the big one is gestures Being able to use the Windows 10 gestures both accurately and reliably makes the trackpad so much better Okay, before you run off to do this, I need to leave a couple kind of disclaimers with you First, you do this at your own risk I've obviously tested this on many computers Probably 40, maybe 50 laptops, and for the laptop that has worked on, they have been great But for the ones it didn't work on, they exploded. No, for the ones that didn't work on, the drivers just won't update. Windows will be like, "Sorry bud, we can't take these drivers," and that's the end of that But the other thing you have to keep in mind is that, you can't let Windows overwrite your new drivers with like an automatic Windows update That's very, very annoying, because sometimes you won't even know that it is updated And all of the sudden, the trackpad's gone back to its old, disgusting self, and you'll have to figure out that Hey, it's because Windows overwrote it And you'll have to redo the process, so you just need to make sure that you're downloading the appropriate update You don't wanna download something that's like, the new Elan, or the new Synaptics driver. You wanna avoid those And, the other thing to keep in mind is that, If you want to, you should probably backup or find a backup of your old existing drivers In case if you wanna revert back to them, so go to your manufacturer Download that driver in advance before you do any of this stuff, before you try. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! I really hope this was helpful because... (sigh) This has existed for probably over a year Kind of, it's gone better over time especially with the new Lenovo driver that's just recently came out like maybe, two to three weeks ago, it's way better now. This works on a lot of laptops, enjoy. Okay, thumbs if you liked this video, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time! 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here So this is a Lenovo Yoga 920, and this is their hybrid two-in-one device, their 14 inch screen device And this is a product that's been very well received by the media by reviewers by critics They enjoy this thing a lot, and I've actually been using mine for about three weeks I didn't do a review earlier because I've actually been using this thing as a required piece of equipment at work because I needed a two-in-one tablet there and I've been using this one and... I would agree that this is a good product overall I think there's a lot of stuff I love about it, but there's one thing that really bugs me about this product, And it's the tablet mode. Now, I don't talk about things that I do like to but first, it's a very well-built device I would say this is one of the best-built devices from Lenovo especially at this price point. They went with good material choices It's aluminum all-around and the design looks good But there's a lot of sharp edges around this whole product and when you use it in tablet form Those sharp edges are really pronounced like you're looking at basically, edges on the top, the bottom, the sides It's sharp all-around and I really don't like holding this device in a tablet form [How To Peel A Carrot The Correct Way] I feel like a two-in-one tablet device shouldn't be this sharp on the edges Now, the hinge that they use is the classic Lenovo watchband hinge and it's awesome It's just built really well. This thing has two major benefits First, it allows you to fold the screen all the way down to the back I mean that's what makes it the hybrid two-in-one device that it is And it's also a really stiff hinge in the sense that it doesn't matter what angle you put the screen at. It'll hold its position and just won't flop down or whatever It's also nice for like, artwork if you're using the pen on it. It doesn't wobble around too much You can open it up on the bottom, it's just a bunch of Torx screws, but when you get in there It's a little bit disappointing because the RAM and the drive are extremely difficult, if not impossible to replace The drive is super fast which is great but just make sure that you configure it the way you want right on the factory because you won't be able to easily upgrade the RAM and the storage. Now the ports on this thing are... good, but limited, so you're getting one USB-A and two Thunderbolt 3 ports You'll be charging the device using one of those ports And they actually support four lanes of PCIe so if you have an external GPU, you're getting maximum bandwidth on this device Performance is really good It's running the new 8th gen CPUs from Intel and the multi-core applications really flex on these CPUs But most applications won't feel too different from the older 7th generation CPUs Just because a lot of applications aren't capable of taking advantage of the multi-core stuff The GPU is capable of playing some lighter games, but nothing crazy Fan noise and thermals are also really comfortable never gets uncomfortably loud, or hot The performance is quite good on this thing The keyboard is excellent. Lenovo is known for making really good keyboards, and this is one of them I got used to typing on it really quickly and it's just a comfortable, spacious keyboard The trackpad has good and bad. The tracking is good, Windows Precision drivers, can't go wrong with that. The button mechanic is mediocre It's not a bad click. It's just not as tactile as I'd like it to be. You can hear it, It's just more hollow than I'd like my trackpad's to be. It's a fine trackpad, just not my favorite Screen, 4K panel on this particular one It comes at a 1080p panel in the base model, but the 4K panel is colorful with good viewing angles But, it's not super bright. See, on laptops like dedicated laptops I guess I'm more forgiving for not super bright screens, but on a two-in-one device I kind of want to see a screen that's just brighter because, you often use it as a tablet or as a tent mode thing and when it's in those modes, You kind of need brighter screens because you're not always sitting at a perfectly angled desk and stuff like that I would have liked to have seen a brighter panel, but this was not bad The 4K screens come with a pen and this feels actually really similar to the Surface Pen's, at least the new ones 4096 levels of pressure, and it's a nice pen The battery life is really good It's a nine hour battery with the screen at 250 nits, and that's with the 4K panel. If you're running the lower-res screen, the 1080p panel, my guess is 11 hours, maybe 11.5 hours, so full day battery with ease - The webcam looks like this, like the image quality is decent It's not super high resolution, but the colors look okay The image is actually shot from the top middle of the screen which is rare because on a thin bezel screen like this, it usually shoots in the bottom, looks up your nose this looks normal, which I like The speakers are pretty mediocre. I don't love them They don't sound bad. It's just that they're positioned poorly So in laptop mode, they're positioned right on the bottom They just literally fire right into the table with like a millimeter of gap. It just distorts the sound really poorly. In tent mode, it's a little better, but you basically have this echo chamber where the sound bounces back and forth and again It just distorts the sound. It's also not great in tablet mode because the speakers are right behind the screen and the sound just kind of gets distorted and muffled by the position again. So overall, I think this is a good device, a great device, if you use it as a laptop predominantly, so if you just almost never use it for other things other than a laptop, this is a great pick up I think this is one of the best two-in-one hybrid devices that I've used when it comes to a laptop device But the moment you use it as a tablet, things just don't feel comfortable for me I just don't enjoy the weight, I don't enjoy the ergonomics I certainly don't enjoy the sharp edges like it's just something that... Yeah, and I've been using this for three weeks now, pretty regularly I don't think I'll ever get used to it so, if that bothers you, then you probably shouldn't get this device, which makes it weird because that's what this was for, the whole two-in-one thing, but... Yeah, that's what we have. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here and this is the MSI GE63 Raider So the whole idea behind the Raider lineup is that they're taking higher-end components or higher-end features like 120 Hz screen and individually lit RGB keyboard, and they're sticking that stuff into a more affordable lineup and so that's how you come up with this, so the 62, the GE62 from last year was probably their best-selling gaming laptop because it was an inexpensive laptop with a GTX 1060 This is much improved across the board. So the stuff that's trickled in, that 120 Hertz panel looks amazing. If you've never seen one in real life you gotta see one because You can't showcase how cool these things are or how good they are for gaming just by watching these videos, you gotta see it in real life. The new individually lit RGB keyboard is pretty crazy and the last thing they're going for is just improved performance across the board so because of the improved thermal solution, you can now stick a GTX 1070 into this chassis. So at this price point you can expect a certain level of build quality right? And it's there for the most part The top panel is metal. It's got that brushed finish, and it looks pretty good I don't love the red dragon, but whatever, and the keyboard deck is metal as well There's no play or soft spots or anything It's a very well-built laptop. The bottom panel is plastic, not that it's bad or anything. It actually feels well-made but it would have been nice if it was metal. Ports election is as expected There's three USB-A's and a USB-C, but it doesn't support Thunderbolt 3. Okay first I'm going to talk about the things that I do like. The screen is really good It's 120 Hertz screen, looks good, the color accuracy is there, the brightness is there It's a great screen for gaming It has a 3 ms response time, which is actually the fastest laptop screen on the market right now I'm obviously not a pro gamer, but games feel incredibly fluid on this display It is a TN panel, but that's how you're getting the super fast response rate And it's great image for a TN panel. The one thing I would have to complain about though is that because it's a TN panel, the viewing angles aren't as good. The moment you tilt it on any axis There is noticeable color shift The keyboard is also something that I really like. Just base keyboard itself is very comfortable to type on, great layout, Good keystroke, the RGB lighting on this thing is seriously the most comprehensive lighting system I've seen on a laptop keyboard. You can light up every single key That's not that new But there's like a whole bunch of features plus there's a hardware button here to switch between the different configurations on the fly. The trackpad is surprisingly good. It uses Synaptics drivers Which was kind of disappointing, but it feels really good. The gestures are a little off like, they're not super accurate But the tracking is good, otherwise, and the dedicated hardware buttons are nice. Now I think the best thing about this laptop is actually its performance, so this thing's running at GTX 1060 You can get a 1070 but the 1060 runs really well and performance in light and even moderately demanding games is just amazing with this 120 Hz screen. You can obviously play more
demanding games But you won't be able to show off the screen as nicely. So that's one of the things that I think this whole laptop industry has been shifted towards You want to be able to showcase your amazing graphics cards by getting really high refresh screens if you're not, if you're capped at a 60 Hz screen there's no point in having a GTX 1080 on a laptop, like you're not able to see those extra frames that your card can push out so this is a really nice combination The fan noise is also very acceptable on idle. It's pretty quiet. On load, it's not too bad, but if you want to, you can hit the
Cooler Boost button And it'll just crank the fans to max, and this will give you the best possible frame rates It's super loud, but if you're rendering a video or playing something That's just really intense, you'll want to hit that button and the fact that they have it is really nice I wish more laptops had something like this. The thermals on this laptop are good It has seven heat pipes in there which is pretty nuts I can't speak for the GTX 1070 configuration, but on this one, the one with the GTX 1060 There's no throttling and the external temperatures are very comfortable as well There are a few things that I dislike about this laptop, and they're not super important But I feel like I should mention them in case it affects your purchase decision. First are the speakers so MSI markets these things as having three times the size of their old speakers And they are really large if you look inside, they almost look like batteries, but they still don't sound great They sound kind of average. I mean they sound like a $1,200 gaming laptop would. I was expecting something more substantial because of how large those speakers are but they still sound very normal to me I wasn't particularly impressed. The other thing I don't love is the battery life It's a 51 watt hour battery And I'm getting just over three hours of use with the screen at 250 nits and that's kind of below average Considering all the components in here and it doesn't have G-Sync, so this panel is just a simple 120 Hertz panel It doesn't have G-Sync so it does have Optimus, but even with that technology... (sigh) Battery life is a little short It doesn't affect me because I'm not using this for like, extended periods of time when I'm out there But for people that wanna use this for school or whatever, you're gonna have to bring your charger with you, because three hours is not going to cut it. The last thing I dislike about this laptop is the accessibility or the lack of it. Now MSI laptops are not the easiest ones to open They usually make it a little bit more difficult, and they often have a sticker That says you know, don't open this thing, but this particular laptop is extra hard, and it sucks because inside there There's two NVMe slots, There's one SATA drive and two RAM slots, so there's a lot of room for upgradeability and stuff But it's very difficult to get in there without Chipping or breaking the frame, and because this is a review unit I don't want to go ham, just crack the thing But that's basically it a few things that I dislike about it, but the overall laptop I really like it. I think MSI is gonna sell a lot of these. If you're interested There's a link down below with the most accurate pricing. I think these start at $1500. They go up as you kind of add more stuff to it. Hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And in front of me is the XPS 13 This is running the latest 8th generation CPU from Intel, the Kaby Lake-R And I don't know if this laptop really needs an introduction because it's really well-known but for the people that aren't familiar with it I'll just do like a quick overview kind of thing for the stuff that hasn't changed Basically, this is a really well-built thin and light ultrabook with a 13-inch screen And this was one of the original 13 inch screen ultrabooks that rivaled the whole MacBook experience This is well built, it looks good, and it's just a really strong performer, and that was three years ago And they've kept upgrading them and refreshing them over the years and at this point This is really really solid. These are now running quad core processors so the stuff that hasn't changed it's still running a great screen. It comes in two options for the screen a 1080p panel and a quad HD panel you can't go wrong with either of them They're both very very good. Thin bezels They call them InfinityEdge displays and because the bezels are so thin the experience when you're looking at these screens is really immersive There's just very little material on the edges to distract you from what you're watching or what you're doing. Now the screen I'm running is at an 1080p panel. It's not touchscreen, but that's just a personal preference I don't really like using touch screens on laptops. I know a lot of people do but the one thing that XPS laptops are really good at is the touch screen thing. It's not that the screen is more sensitive It's because of the hinge so, the XPS lineup, the 13 and the 15, has a very stiff hinge It's so stiff that you can't even open it up with one hand like you can kind of do it But you got to jiggle it But the stiff hinge has a huge benefit when it comes to touchscreens because when you're poking at it There's just very little wobble when you're tapping at the screen, and a lot of laptops have loose hinges that are nice to open, easy to open But once you start touching them, it's really wobbly and that's a bummer, but this one they do it well. The keyboard is also unchanged It's got backlighting, the layout is good and most people will quickly adapt this keyboard and enjoy it It's not the most comfortable or the best keyboard out there It's actually very average for an ultrabook, but it is good, and if you use it for long enough You'll learn to type really quickly on it. The trackpad is also unchanged It's a little small, but it's running Windows Precision drivers right out of the box so tracking is good, gestures work perfectly It's a really good trackpad overall. The build quality has not changed, and that's a good thing I guess? I mean it's built really well It's actually very tanky for its size and weight, but I'm getting bored of its design It's not a bad design. It's not ugly or anything That's just we've been seeing this for almost three years at this point And I really wish they would at least change the color They are offering an Alpine white version, which isn't available yet But I really wish they'd had like a black version like they have the XPS 13 2in1 and this really nice black finish But in the meantime, I'm running a dbrand skin. This is actually black dragon. I think it looks pretty cool Now before I talk about performance and some of the things that have changed I want to touch on some things that haven't changed that I don't particularly love First is the issue of coil whine. I know this is something that bothers a lot of you guys It doesn't bother me too much I don't see it very often in laptops, but the XPS 13 and 15 some of the units have coil whine And this is actually the first review unit I've ever had that had coil whine and it's slight It's very very subtle, but it's there, and it doesn't bother me And I know that some people are really irked by this it's still present so that's something that really bothered you It's still there and if for people I don't know what coil whine is it's this slight hum or just electronic noise that you can barely hear, but it's there Another thing that hasn't changed is the location of the webcam It's still at the bottom of the screen so it looks up your nose when you're using the webcam It's not the most flattering video angle, but it's kind of the price You have to pay when you have such a thin bezel screen basically Every manufacturer that has an ultra thin bezel like this has some kind of weird webcam angle, okay The last thing that hasn't changed are the ports and this is kind of a good thing because the port selection is always good there's an SD card slot, 2 USB-A's and a Thunderbolt 3 But the things that I don't love the Thunderbolt 3 port yet again only uses 2 PCIe lanes so if you're running an external GPU you're not getting the full bandwidth which on a laptop like this running a four core Kaby Lake-R chip It would be nice to have four lanes of PCIe for an external GPU. I understand It's a very limited number of people that would actually use it for that But it would have been nice. The other thing is that the power connection still uses a barrel plug It would have been really nice to see a USB-C port there This thing can easily handle it, 45 watt adapter, plug it in USB-C, universal charging, everybody wins except It would have cost a little bit more for them to make. Oh well, okay Let's talk about the things that have changed and the big thing is performance, Kaby Lake-R processors, the 8th generation CPUs are phenomenal. The jump that you get going from the 7th gen stuff to the 8th gen CPUs We're talking like a 50 to 60% increase in multi-core performance and depending what you do or what apps you use That can be a huge difference in your workflow, and it's crazy because the 5th to the 6th to the 7th generation CPUs I mean those always like incremental increases like we're talking 10-15% each year, this... 50 to 60%. It's huge and it all comes from core count Not every application can take advantage of multi-core like this But you'll notice a significant increase in speed for processor intensive stuff This is running the Intel UHD Graphics 620 Which is a little bit of an improvement over the previous generation, the HD 620 If you're trying to play games, you're still not gonna have a great time You're gonna be able to play some really lightweight titles with low resolution and low graphic settings But if you want to play something even moderately demanding It's not gonna be good. The externa GPU like I mentioned before you're only getting two lanes of PCIe I plugged up a Razer Core to this. It does work It does connect, but it's not designed for gaming and that's the other thing I noticed this laptop doesn't have a High Performance mode. I don't know if it's because it's the review sample I was sent, but normally in Windows you can adjust your power plan and you can choose between Balanced or High Performance But I didn't have the option for high performance on this laptop So I couldn't really test it the way I wanted to. One thing to keep in mind though, this is a 15 watt CPU so Even though it's quad-core, there are quad-core gaming laptops out there that are 45 watt CPU such as triple the power consumption So you're not gonna be able to get the same kind performance on this quad core laptop as a gaming quad core laptop They're just not built that way But I will say this, this laptop, the 8th generation CPU is such a big improvement over the previous generation That it doesn't make sense for anyone to purchase the 7th gen CPUs It's just too much of a performance difference, and the battery life has improved a little bit I'm getting around 11.5 to 12 hours of battery life with the screen at 250 nits on the 1080p panel. If you have the quad HD panel, it'll be a little bit less I'm thinking, nine hours of battery life Maybe ten for lucky, but all-around great laptop. The drive on the inside is fast The RAM is still soldered on, it's an XPS 13 through and through Now I want to touch on one last thing before it closes off and that's customer support. The laptop industry doesn't have great customer support That's just the nature of the business I would consider Dell's to be slightly above average, not amazing, not even great, it's just slightly above average But if that's important to you, if you really want long-term customer support for your laptop I would put these guys a little bit higher on your list of short choices because we have, what I considered to be, above average customer support. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! It's an easy choice if you're looking for a thin and light ultrabook, 8th generation XPS 13, two thumbs up. Okay, thumbs if you liked this, subs if you loved
this video! See you guys next time! 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And in front of me is the Asus GL702ZC It's the easiest name in the world to remember. There's actually a bunch of "702" devices This is the most powerful one because it's got an eight-core CPU So if you don't know that much about CPU cores, the average ultrabook has two cores, the average gaming laptop has a four core CPU This thing is rocking a new eight-core CPU from AMD, called the Ryzen 7 1700 It's actually a desktop class CPU, super powerful, and they were able to stick it into a laptop That's not like, super thick or super large. It's still a little bit bigger It's not like the thinnest laptop out there But it's a very portable device for an eight-core Windows PC. Now, the design isn't my favorite It's not the color or anything. I mean there are some red accents, but it's more just the actual aesthetic It's more of a dated Asus look The current Asus laptops like the ones in the end of 2017 look pretty clean They're more like brushed metal with silver and gray accents This is more like the classic black with a bit of red The port selection is pretty standard for a 17 inch laptop There is a USB-C port, but there's no Thunderbolt 3 support. The build quality is not bad It feels kind of like average Asus laptops,
it's not bad or anything It's just not ultra premium. Now, to get inside this laptop It's not the easiest thing. It's doable There's a bunch of screws, but you have to put quite a bit of force to get the plastic off But once you're inside, the RAM and the drives are user replaceable Interestingly, the CPU looks to be replaceable as well. I think I see a little bit of a socket on the motherboard It's not just soldered right on The battery down here is 76 watt hours and battery life is not great We're looking at an hour and a half, like 90 minutes of battery life for the screen of 250 nits with everything I just like, normal settings. It's actually one of the lowest battery life I've seen on a laptop, and the AC adapter is also pretty large It's a 350 watt brick But keep in mind that this is a desktop class CPU It literally is something that they pull from desktops And they stuck it in here, and it's an AMD GPU so you're missing things like Nvidia Optimus So a battery consumption is going to be high But the other thing is AMD could technically improve on this stuff with some software updates over time The keyboard and trackpad feel pretty similar to Asus laptops I mean it's a very standard looking Asus keyboard. Comfortable to type on Slightly mushier keys than I'd like but,
it's good otherwise Trackpad, Windows Precision drivers, plastic surface. It's a good trackpad I think most people like it. The speakers are actually way better than I thought they'd be. These are actually one of the best Possibly, the best Asus speakers I've seen on a laptop. I guess it's because it's a bigger chassis There's like more room for stuff in there, but they sound good, not super loud or anything But the clarity is there and the base is more pronounced than you'd expect Alright, performance in this machine can be very impressive Single core stuff is kind of run-of-the-mill, nothing super special But the multi-core stuff is crazy good. This laptop flexes so hard on basically every single other laptop that I've tested before In the Cinebench CPU test, this thing scores over 1400 points That's like 40 percent better than even desktop-class CPUs like the 7700K The thermals on this thing are actually not bad as well Temperatures are good, cooling eight active CPU cores at once It's obviously not easy, but they're able to do it, but fan noise isn't super quiet. It's not crazy loud, but it's definitely audible The gaming performance gives me mixed opinions It's not bad per se, it's running at RX 580, the mobile version and that's similar to like a laptop GTX 1060's, very respectable. On the 1080p screen, I'm still getting very good frame rates even on max graphics But this is the kind of performance if you'd expect for like 11 or maybe $1200. GTX 1060 laptops aren't super expensive This thing starts at $1500 and where this thing shines and quite frankly this is what people should be buying this laptop for, is video editing. This thing crushes so hard in Adobe Premiere So Premiere has always been a relatively weak performer on laptops It's a very CPU-hungry application, and even high-end gaming laptops with four core CPUs don't do nearly as well as desktops that have like eight or ten core CPUs. This thing keeps up This thing's actually faster than a lot of the systems that I've used in the past year It's actually faster than like the $10,000 Mac Pro in Adobe Premiere, which is crazy. It's a $1500 system The screen is okay. It's good for gaming. It's a 1080p panel It's bright But I wish it was high-res because that's what I would use this computer for I wish it had like a 4K panel with really good color accuracy and stuff, but that's just not the case. So again, I feel like Asus made something That's a little bit niche but this time I feel like it's A little bit confusing because they have components in here that are very gamer-oriented So I mean it's the ROG brand, it's got some red accents It's got a 1080p screen, and I think they're actually making a 1080p 120 Hz screen option But at the same time, the strength of this device is seriously in multi-core stuff, which most games in 2017 or even like early 2018 won't be able to take that much advantage of This thing really shines in video editing But it's stuck with a non 4K panel and not a super color accurate panel either So if you look at the price of this thing, it's actually a pretty good value for people that are editing videos. To be able to get this kind of performance in this kind of portable form factor for $1500 like, a year ago This would have been impossible, but right now If you're trying to pick up this thing for games, I wouldn't recommend it It's not a bad machine for it, but for $1500 You can get devices, that even ones made by Asus,
that are just more suited for gamers Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time. 
Hey how's it going? Dave2D here, 
and this is the OnePlus 5, and OnePlus is a company which, at this point, 
doesn't need an introduction. This is their flagship phone for 2017. I think this is the best-looking OnePlus phone to date.
It has a double camera on the back and because they placed it in the top left corner,
 it's going to look similar to the iPhone 7 Plus. It's a very clean and minimal-looking design, 
super thin phone, it's coming in at 7.25 millimeters. It's their thinnest phone yet, and I like how it looks. I think a lot of people will mistake this for an iPhone 7 Plus. I guess depending on who you are or what you want your phone to do that could be a good thing or a bad thing. I don't love the antenna lines. I know they have to be somewhere, but these look a little too Apple-y for me. And if you want to hide them, you can just get a skin from dbrand, that'll also protect the finish and make it less slippery. 
I'll leave a link for them below. It has great build quality again, and in its naked form it's comfortable to hold, but it's really smooth. I'm not sure if it's the anodization process or the finish of the metal, but it's a very slick device. It has the alert slider again, with three
positions and an LED notification that has user customizable colors. The display is still 5.5 inches and it's still 1080p and I think it's the right
choice outside of VR because it's like the
perfect balance between good resolution and good battery life. It has Dash Charge
again, if you're not familiar with Dash Charge, it's basically really fast
charging for the phone, the OnePlus 3 had it, and I got to be honest I think
this is the best feature of the entire OnePlus line. If you ever fall asleep and
you don't charge your phone when you wake up in the morning you're like oh my
god I have no battery you plug it in for 20 minutes while you're getting ready
and you're good to go for most of the day. Now there's a few things that
haven't changed that I'm not a fan of they didn't change the position of the
fingerprint sensor and I know this is a subjective thing I would have preferred
it on the back and just prefer them on the back it's still in the front and it
still only has a single speaker on the bottom I know a lot of people don't care
about that but it's something I care about and it's also not IP rated it's
probably water-resistant to some degree it's just not officially certified with
any kind of number. It's running Oxygen OS again, and a lot of companies put a
thick coat of like third-party sauce on their software I've always liked the way
that Oxygen OS feels, it's basically stock but with a few extra tweaks to
give it some more functionality. So a few things that have changed: It has
Bluetooth 5.0 so you get better speeds better range and support for two
headphones at once, it's running a Snapdragon 835 and it uses some speedy
UFS 2.1 memory so the combination of a fast processor with fast storage makes
it very zippy when doing anything so when you're unlocking the phone,
launching the camera, launching apps, using apps it's a quick phone. The
battery is 3300 mAh, which is bigger than OnePlus 3, but smaller
than the OnePlus 3T that was 3400 mAh, and there were rumors there would be 4000 mAh, it's not; it's
3300, but because of the more efficient processor, the OnePlus 5 has better
battery life than the previous generations. It's still a full day
battery though, it's not even close to being a two day battery but with Dash
Charge on this thing, I'm content with battery life. There's another thing I
need to mention, OnePlus as a company has matured over the years, and one of the
issues that had in the beginning was customer service. I had one of the
original OnePlus Ones and I had a nightmare returning that thing for
repairs, it was just, I think was like a 2- or 3-month process and it's just jumping
through hoops and flames was just not a fun process. OnePlus 3T, a week and a half, two weeks without a phone, sent it back, no issues and if you go on forums, you
look at XDA or just go on reddit their customer service has improved so much
over the years, at this point in time I would consider them equal to some of the
bigger companies out there. Now the big upgrade this year is the camera, dual
camera system with a lot of buzz about this thing because OnePlus announced
that they were working with DxOMark to make something pretty awesome and well I
think it is. So right off the rip, the camera launches super fast and that's
step one of any good smartphone camera double-click and you're in. Photos I took in
well-lit environments look great. The colors look proper nothing feels
oversaturated or over-processed, photos in low-light look good as well as long
as it's not too dark they're exposed properly there is obviously some grain
but it's nothing too bad. I did notice though when it's really dark the camera
seems to overcompensate and tries to make it brighter than it needs to and it
just ends up looking really grainy. The autofocus is fast and it has portrait
modes from the dual cameras for some of that creamy bokeh, but the most
impressive thing to me was the dynamic range on this camera. So dynamic range is
how well a camera can differentiate between the darkest
and brightest areas of a single photo so this is a photo of the Sun and some
buildings, this is a very difficult shot to capture. The Sun is so bright that
everything else is going to look dark in comparison. This is how the OnePlus 5 captures
it, it's pretty good right? I think the camera on this thing is really solid. Now
image quality is subjective and it's kinda hard to crown one as like the
best camera or the winner of the cameras, but I will say this, at this price point,
that sub $500 price point, this thing has the best camera right now.
Now speaking of price, the OnePlus 5 cost $480 for the 64 GB model, which makes it really price competitive. The OnePlus 5 is
packed with awesome hardware for the money, it's like the poster boy of the
appropriately priced smartphone. It has a premium aluminum build, it's a little
slippery, get a dbrand skin for it. It has a 5.5 inch 1080p screen and it's got a fast fingerprint sensor up front, on the back we have the dual
camera system: 16 megapixel main shooter, 20 megapixel telephoto and combined they
deliver some very impressive photos especially in regards to dynamic range.
Inside it's packed with the fast processor, fast storage, and 6GB of
RAM for the base model, the upgraded model has 8GB of RAM if you're
interested and then the battery is 3300 mAh and it will comfortably last you a full day of heavy use. There are a lot of phones in the sub $500
market and a lot of them are good but If I had to make a recommendation right
now in mid-2017 it would be this one, OnePlus 5, really impressed with it this
year. Hope you guys enjoy this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it, see you
guys next time. *End of another amazing D2D Video* 
Hey Dave, can you do a review of the Dell 7577? (cloud of request comments forming) (So please review it ASAP) Hello, I hear you're looking for an Inspiron 7577 video. Okay. This is not that laptop. JK, it is. I've had this for three weeks And I took my time on this one because this is an important device I feel like a lot of people purchase this thing or the Inspiron 7000 line And I wanted to make sure that I kind of tested it fully before I made this video. Okay This thing for the uninitiated is the inexpensive gaming laptop from Dell, it's their Inspiron 7000 line And this is their third iteration of it. When you have an inexpensive gaming laptop, there's got to be something, right? There's, you want to find that one thing that the company cut the corner on or did something weird with to Provide it at that price point and these guys They nailed it this year, okay First of all, let's talk about the screen. Last year, they launched with a TN panel That was unimpressive to say the least. This year this launches with an IPS panel right off the bat, and it's pretty good It's not amazing It's a reasonably color accurate screen with decent brightness. The viewing angles aren't great, especially for an IPS panel But it's way better than the old TN panel and actually slightly better than the IPS panel that they used previously There's a 4K panel option, which I obviously don't have but based on last year's panel That was actually quite good, so if you do need higher resolution, I wouldn't be afraid to get that 4K upgrade. Okay another thing they've added is a Thunderbolt 3 port. So they have all the regular stuff, USB 3.0, a bunch of them, three of them Ethernet port, SD card slot, and the Thunderbolt 3 port is nice because this one's running 4 lanes of PCIe So if you're plugging up an external GPU to this thing, you're getting the maximum bandwidth. They've changed a few other things, some for the better, some for the worse. It's a design refresh. This one feels like it has some Alienware DNA creeping in. The grille is different. I wouldn't say it's better or worse from last year's. I personally like the design, but everyone is gonna be a little bit different. The soft touch material is gone. It's not on the surface It's not on the keyboard deck and I feel like that was a material that felt and looked really cool when you first got it but, as you use the computer more and more and it got gunky, it was just weird, so I'm personally happy that they removed it. The hinge is unchanged and I didn't love the positioning of this hinge even last year. It's kind of closer to the middle. It makes it easier to torque. Like if you open this laptop from the side, it that you just tend to torque the screen a little bit more, and every time you do it if you do it hundreds or thousands of times with the lifespan of the laptop, I don't know how it will do for the longevity of that hinge. But last year's hinges seem to hold up well, so I feel like this one will be the same. The screen in the top panel have a little bit of flex to it, nothing too bad. But the keyboard deck is rock-solid. It does not feel like a thousand dollar gaming laptop. It's metal and there's no play or soft spots on this thing. The corner down here still bugs me so last year's 7567 had the same kind of corner and depending on your wrist positioning and just how you kind of use your keyboard, this can be an issue. It doesn't bother me, but if you have a very flat resting position for your arm, you might want to watch out for that. The keyboard itself is good, not amazing. It's an inexpensive gaming laptop, so you're not gonna get the best typing experience, but it's not bad. The keystrokes are a little bit short, and I wish I had white backlighting instead of this red stuff. The trackpad is also solid. It's a plastic surface, but it uses Windows Precision drivers, and the tracking is good. There's also a fingerprint sensor on the power button this was actually something I didn't expect. They didn't advertise this. I didn't even see this at the IFA announcement. It might have been a late addition to this thing, but it's awesome. This thing works really quickly and accurately to get you into Windows. Webcam looks and sounds like this, nothing amazing. I feel like the image quality hasn't changed in like three years. It's not terrible, but it's not great. Getting inside the laptop is super easy. It's a single screw and when you unscrew it off, it actually stays on the back panel There's a c-clip that holds it in place so you can't even lose a screw if you wanted to. Inside, we have a 2.5 inch hard drive bay. This slot is empty because I got an SSD with it But it comes with the cable, comes with a caddy, so you don't have to buy any of that stuff if you want to add a hard drive to it. You have access to the SSD. The one that they include is actually really fast. The Wi-Fi card is good. It's the Intel 8265 and you also have access to the two RAM slots. The battery is down here, and it's smaller than last year which was disappointing. So last year it was a 74 watt-hour battery. This year it's 56. And I'm getting around 4.5 hours of battery life, screen at 215 nits. Okay, I'm not sure why they did this because the bigger battery on last year's model is one of its best features. It's one of its like most distinguishing features from all the other gaming laptops that were available. That bigger battery was just like it was like a six hour battery So you could go through most of your day with just a single charge. This now puts it into the "you gotta bring a charger with you" laptops, and I don't know. That bombs me out It is a gaming laptop, so I can see why they did it, but it's disappointing nonetheless Another thing that's changed this year is that there's no sub. So last year had a sub right in the bottom of the laptop which helped give it a little bit more bass I didn't have amazing speakers, but they were pretty good. This year the speakers projects at the front again But because there's no sub, the bass is lacking. They sound good. They actually sound better in just terms of audio clarity. The mids and the highs are just, there's just more body to that sound, there's no distortion, but you definitely notice the lack of bass. Thermal management on this laptop is good. The external temperatures are good, the internal temperatures are good. There's no throttling even during long gaming sessions. They did an excellent job with the thermal management. The fan noise is also not bad. At idle, the fans don't run, and on load, it's still quiet. Okay, let's talk performance. And this is probably the most important part of this video. This laptop is running a GTX 1060 Max-Q and a Kaby Lake i7 The 7700HQ. Now Max-Q chips tend to run at lower clock speeds, both the core clock and the boost clocks are slower. But for whatever reason on this laptop, the boost clock is actually quite high. It's not as high as a regular 1060 laptop, but we're hitting like 1645 MHz, which is really really close. Now the performance I'm getting from this thing is not as good as a regular GTX 1060 because it's not always gonna hit the maximum boost clock, but everything except for the most demanding games will run really smoothly with really high graphics quality. Now as for the reason as to why they're able to run their GPU a little bit faster, I'm not 100% sure. My theory is that because thermal management is as good as it is, they're able to bump up that boost clock and the fans will take care of it, but honestly I'm not 100% sure. But whatever the reason it doesn't even matter because you're getting a really fast laptop that's gonna be faster than most GTX 1060 Max-Q laptops out there, and consumers win! Okay, if you're interested in this thing, I give it two thumbs up. It's really like, there's not much to dislike about this thing. Maybe the battery life, that's basically it. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! 
Hey, how is it going? Dave2D here So, I like the Surface Pro products. I have always liked them, I think they're one of the most versatile computer you can get on the market right now. Like that whole 2-in-one form factor, super cool But there's a couple thing that kinda bug me with about surface pro First is the price point even the base model It's not particularly cheap And the second thing is that Over the years and we're on the fifth generation of Surface Pro products right now And they have not improved that much I mean incremental improvements every year But it's still the same kind of product That it has been since day one And there's nothing wrong with it But it's a pretty conservative approach to the whole 2-in-one tablet thing This is the Eve V And to explain what this product is, I think we have to go a little bit into story time About a year ago, so like July 2016, I was approach by this company And they said, "Hey Dave, you know you do laptops we wanna send you this product..." "...that's gonna be like this laptop killer. It's gonna be industry changing product." And at the time I was like, really? You know, this is like an unknown startup company thinks that they can make a product that can be an industry changer? I mean, I'd love to believe it, but send me the product when it's done and I'll gladly take a look at it But I really didn't think anything would come from it Now fast forward one year later and they actually sent me a fully working prototype Now keep in mind, this is a prototype So I'm not gonna do like a full review on it But there's one to go through some my first impressions of it First the device is very similar to a Microsoft Surface It has a kick stand and the even the keyboard looks and feels like a Surface And I think a lot of people could mistake this for some kind special edition Microsoft Surface Pro It's very similar The material is aluminium, it's not magnesium like the Surface lineup But it's still a very solid feeling and it's very well-made Now one the coolest thing about this product is that the whole concept of it was crowd sourced So they asked a ton of people, I think like a thousand people What they would want in a laptop and this thing was born And one of the things people really wanted was good I/O Because the Surface lineup doesn't has a great port selection So we have two USB A's, two USB C's, one of them actually being thunderbolt 3 There's an audio jack that has a good quality amp in there The power switch also has a fingerprint sensor for logging in with Windows Hello There's four speakers that sound pretty clean, a lot better than I thought it would And the display panel looks really nice It's high res, individually calibrated with the factory so it's color accurate right off the box And it comes with the stylus for pen input and stuff And it's compatible with Microsoft Surface Pens if you want They have a few configurations. They're all running Y processors But these guys have done an amazing job cooling it passively So it's fanless. This one is running a Core m3 and the temperatures stay low even when the boost kicks in I could actually play Overwatch at the lowest possible settings It wasn't amazing. I was hovering around 35-40 frames per second But totally playable, and remember, this has a Thunderbolt 3 port So if you wanna go nuts you can connect to an external GPU for games The keyboard is also really nice. This is actually the first 2-in-one keyboard that I've used That has RGB backlighting, you can switch between a few colors Typing is super comfortable The trackpad is good, it's a glass surface with Windows Precision drivers. The inputs on this device are really good But the best part is you can remove it and this RGB backlit keyboard suddenly becomes a wireless keyboard It's got Bluetooth 4.2 in it and it's got a small battery in it So you can control this thing remotely So if you have it connected to a projector, or for like presentation whatever That's a pretty cool feature Now the battery in the main device, 48 watt hours It's bigger than the Surface Pro 4 from last year, it's similar in size with the new Surface pro from 2017 The Eve V is heavier by around 100 grams or so, I think a lot of the weight comes from beefier heatsink And I'm not gonna lie, I think the extra the weight is noticeable But even if you hold it one handed, it's an extremely comfortable tablet to hold Now, the cameras on this thing aren't as good as the Surface Pro So if image quality on your tablet is important to you then this is probably not the best product for you Another thing the stylus has less pressure levels But for me, these are things I don't care to much in a tablet There's all these features about the Eve V that are pretty cool So, like the fingerprint sensor, the RGB keyboard, Thunderbolt 3 The average guy that walks in the Microsoft Store Like the business guy or whatever that goes in there looking for a 2-in-1 tablet They don't care about these feature So Microsoft isn't gonna put these feature into their tablets anytime soon But these are the features that you guys and myself included, like the enthusiast level guys We like this stuffs And this is the type the stuff that makes this product special. Now, the pricing of it is very fair It starts at $800 which is the same price as the base price of the New Surface Pro But the Eve product include a keyboard and you're getting 8 gigs of RAM instead of 4 So I think you're getting a solid device for the money Now just to be clear, I'm not saying that the Surface Pro is garbage in comparison to this Not at all. I think the Surface Pro is a fantastic product And it's a good fit, a better fit for some people than this But if you're in the market for 2-in-1 I would say, "Hold off on the purchase on the Surface Pro..." "...that's what you can get..." "...Let this thing come out in the market, let it kind of proliferate, let the review come out..." Because I think for a lot of people, this is a better fit than the Surface Pro. You're getting better value for the money, and it's just a more enthusiast level product than the Surface Pro is Okay hope you guys enjoy this video, thumbs if you like it, subs if you love it, I'll see you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here, and this is the Asus GL503. So this is a laptop that's equipped with a GTX 1050. It's on like the lower tier in terms of gaming laptops but it's relatively inexpensive. It's built quite well and this is something that Asus has brought into the market to, just be a little bit different from every other gaming laptop. So the first thing I noticed when I picked this thing up is that the design language on this laptop is a little bit different from what they've gone for in the past. Normally, the ROG line is very much Black and Red. I think that Asus is like one of the original companies that did the whole Black and Red gamer thing. I feel like this is like the transition phase. I feel like we're on the edge. Next year, I really think that we will not be seeing as many Black and Red laptops as we've been seeing this year in the gaming industry. So this thing has no external Red accents. There's some Red in the exhaust vent and the ROG logo lights up Red but that's it. Everything else is Black, even the Keyboard lights are configurable to whatever color that you want. It has a metal top surface and the design of this is actually very similar to the Asus GX501 which is like their flagship laptop. And it's kind of weird to see the same kind of design language on a laptop that's significantly cheaper. So this thing starts at around $1000 and the build quality is quite good. The hinge is good, the paneling feels solid all around. And overall, it's a well built laptop. Now the bottom panel does not remove readily so There's like an access panel that you can remove to access the RAM, the Hard Drive and the SSD if you want to put one in. But the rest of the bottom panel is very difficult to remove. I tried for a little bit and I couldn't get it to come off. So if you need to kinda clean out the fans or access anything else like, maybe the Wi-Fi card in there, I'm sure it's doable but I didn't want to break the review unit. It's a little bit tougher than your average gaming laptop. If you'll notice there's only one RAM slot. The good thing is that it already comes with 16 gigs So if you want to upgrade it up to 32, you just need to buy a single stick of 16 and pop it in. The port selection on this thing is pretty good. You get one USB-C, it's not Thunderbolt 3 though. You get four USB threes, a couple of display outputs, an ethernet and an SD card slot. The audio jack that's on here is one of those combined ones so it has headphone and earphone at the same time. So you might like that, you might not. I personally prefer this type. When you crack it open you get a great Keyboard. The layout is nice, it's got a number pad and everything so you got that leftward Shift. But the keyboard feels very nice to type on. The keystrokes are a little bit softer than some gaming laptops. But I think that most people will like this thing pretty quickly. One feature I do like are the audio keys up top so you get volume Up/Down and Mute and it just makes it a little bit easier to control your sound in game. The fourth button is the ROG button and it launches the Asus ROG App for performance stats, fan control, and other things like that. The other app that Asus has is the ROG Aurora Core and This is the App that lets you switch the colors on the Keyboard. So there's four different zones and you can switch them to any color you want. The Trackpad down here is nice. It's smooth, it's plastic and it uses Windows Precision drivers. Which, in 2017, that's what you want. You want a Windows Precision driver based trackpad because everything else is not as good. The button mechanism is okay. It's good, it's just not perfect. There's a little bit of play before it actually depresses as I click. It does feel good though overall. The speakers are about average for a thousand dollar gaming laptop. They're not bad or anything. They're just not amazing. They get reasonably loud but they're not particularly clear. The screen is where I feel like this laptop shines. So a lot of times when you spend a thousand dollars for a gaming laptop, you're gonna get some better performance, but you're gonna get some not great displays. This display panel is quite good. Color accurate, bright and it just feels like a high quality display. Now there are variants of 120 hertz and other types of panels, but even the standard panel looks really good. So if you want to do some color accurate Work or video edits, this is a great screen to do it with. For the people interested this is what the webcam looks like. I guess this is what the Mic sounds like. The image looks a little dark, I mean it's a little bit underexposed. The resolution is there but, Underexposed Performance on this machine is going to vary depending on how you configure it. This ones running a GTX 1050. You can get a GTX 1060 for it. But for the 1050 model, it performs as you would expect. I ran some light and moderately demanding Games. And, because it's a 1050 you're not gonna get blistering performance. But, it's not bad. And the thermal output on this thing is easily handled with the cooling system. But if you configure yours with a GTX 1060, performance will be better but it will run hotter. The Fan noise on this laptop was louder than I thought it would be. It's a GTX 1050 right? So I was hoping for it to be a little bit quieter but this is is just how thinner gaming laptops are. The good thing though is that it is able to maintain comfortable temperatures when you're playing games. So with the Asus GL503, you're getting a laptop that starts at around $1000. You're getting great build quality and very little Red accents. The screen is great. It's only 1080p, but you're getting great color accuracy and good brightness. The keyboard is comfortable to use and you get four color zones to customize. The trackpad is accurate and uses Windows Precision drivers. On the inside: the GTX 1050, and the Kaby Lake CPU are good performers and are properly cooled. The RAM and the two drive slots are upgradeable. And down over here, the 64-Watt Hour battery gets around five hours of battery life depending on what you do. I ran my tests with the screen at 250 nits. So, who is this laptop for? Because this thing starts at around a thousand dollars. You can get gaming laptops with this kind of performance for around $800. Granted, the extra money in this thing goes towards better build quality, and a significantly better screen. So if that's what you're looking for, check this thing out. I really like this one. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it. Subs if you loved it. See you guys next time! And, this thing's not black and red. I mean, that's worth $1000 by itself. [Outro music] 
Hey, how's it going, Dave 2D here. So I've always considered myself an enthusiast, or, at the very least a fan of external GPUs. And this video was originally going to be kind of like a showcase of some external GPU enclosures that worked with High Sierra, the new upcoming Mac OS, but, as I tested things and I got into the thick of it, the video kind of changed course. Okay, High Sierra, this is the upcoming version of Mac OS, it's in Beta right now, but external GPU support is really solid. The Razor Core is one of the more popular Thunderbolt 3 enclosures, this is running the TI 82 controller, this does not work in Mac OS High Sierra. So, there were workarounds for this kind of stuff in Sierra But that doesn't work in High Sierra. The enclosure that I used to test most of this video was this thing, the Mantas Venus. Now I'm actually running new firmware from Intel to get 2200 megabytes per second of PCIE Bandwidth, the older firmware had potential limitations because of the ports. Okay, inside the Venus, there's a big enough power supply in here to power ,and charge even the 15-inch Macbook Pro It can feed 87 watts I think, to whatever it's connected to, and there's actually a connection in here for a SATA drive so, off of a single Thunderbolt 3 cable, you get power to your Macbook, you get external GPU capabilities, and you get a drive in here for backup, or storage, or whatever you want to do. So I'm going to jump right into the thick of it. External GPU support in High Sierra is basically plug and play. It's running very early drivers on a Beta OS, but everything works really nice. The 10 series Nvidia GPUs run decent, the AMD GPUs like the Rx 480 and Rx 580 are really reliable, but like any external Thunderbolt 3 GPU, you automatically lose about 10 to 15 percent of the performance just by nature of the connection. The other thing is that I highly recommend running this thing with an external display. You can connect it using like a ghost connector to run it on to the internal display, but I really don't recommend it It's a 15 to 20 percent hit. So here are some native Mac games running on a 1080p external monitor, and if you look at these numbers, it doesn't look bad, right? It's way better than anything you'd get from a stock Macbook GPU, and as long as you're putting a powerful graphics card into the enclosure, you can get some strong frame rates for games. But then when you compare this Mac setup to a Window's setup, the difference is substantial. You need to get a significantly more powerful GPU for the Mac just to keep up. And that's my whole issue. Even with great support, good drivers, and expensive hardware, performance isn't great in Mac OS. the only way to get good external GPU performance here, is to run Boot Camp Windows. And I noticed the same thing in Adobe Premiere. The external GPU helps a lot, I mean, it's so much better than the Radeon Pro, but the same external GPU gets better performance in Windows. And it's been like half a year since I've benchmarked external GPUs on Macs. They've become much easier to setup There's no more scripts, and the whole thing is just a lot more reliable, but performance is exactly the same, and I'm convinced at this point that this is as good as performance is going to get for these cards, which quite frankly, sucks. So one of the biggest issues With external GPUs is pricing. The enclosures themselves aren't cheap, and then the GPUs you need to put in them are pricey as well especially with all the crypto mining happening, so you're looking at four or five hundred dollars for the enclosure, and then at least three, maybe four hundred dollars for the GPU inside there. I mean, you could go lower, but then the whole thing isn't really worth your time. Then you need an external monitor, and those are a couple hundred, maybe a little bit more, and if you want to go something higher-end, like, you're pushing six, seven hundred dollars. At the end, this whole set up, just for the external GPU stuff, can easily break eleven or twelve hundred dollars, and at that price you can build a gaming PC, or you can get a solid gaming laptop for the money. See, if you're investing in an external GPU set up, but you're forced to run Boot Camp Windows for performance, I feel like you should spend that money on a dedicated Windows setup instead. External GPUs have always been very expensive already for windows laptops, but then on Macs, that price to performance ratio is just even worse. And it's not Apple's fault. None of this is Apple's hardware, it's just that many games and applications are optimized for Windows and just perform better there. Now maybe the next generation of GPUs will make this better, like maybe Volta or Vega will just make this somehow more cost-effective, or maybe enclosures will come down a lot in price, but there's something inherently wrong with this whole Thunderbolt 3 connection, maybe we need Thunderbolt 4, maybe we need more bandwidth available so that you're not losing so much performance when you're piping it through. I'm not sure what it is, but right now, for Macbook users, unless you absolutely need this thing in your workflow, like you need something for work to make this happen this, mm-hmm, it's just not cost-effective. 
Hey how's it going, Dave 2D here. Day two of CES, and if you thought yesterday's footage was bad and grainy, be prepared because today's even worse. So, I got to check out the Razer suite and that's an extra dark room, so the footage is just really grainy, I've been filming this on phones. The first thing I want to talk about is their thing called Project Linda. This thing looks out of this world. They're using the Razer phone and placing it into this chassis to create this really impressive device, like, I don't even know how to describe this thing. It's kind of like a laptop, but it uses the phone There's like, there's no internals of this laptop to give it processing capabilities. It's literally the phone is powering everything. I mean there's a battery in there and it's got a screen but all the processing power and the touch pad comes from the Razer phone, it's crazy. So the phone turns into a touch pad the moment you drop it in, and the connector plugs in, we have a fully functional device, so this thing is just running the Android software on the phone, and you use the screen of the Razer phone as a touch pad. Now as of this moment, there's no developers that have created custom software for this thing, but the idea is that you have your program running on the main screen like the regular Razer Blade Stealth screen, it's got a 13 inch screen, and then on the screen of the Razer phone you can use it as a touchpad or the developers can put a custom UI on there so if you're using some like Lightroom or just an Adobe product, you'll be able to see the settings and different controls in there. Or if you're playing a game, like, you can see the UI or different skills or potions or just an inventory, whatever it is, there's just a lot of potential for this hardware combination. So in theory you could just carry your Razer phone around, and then for people that need a little bit more computing capabilities or they want a keyboard they can just connect it up into this device and use a mouse to navigate around. It's obviously a prototype and it's obviously something they're just testing the waters with, I think it's just well executed considering how early in the development process this thing is. So they call it project Linda, and I have no idea when it's going to come out or even if it will come out, but I really feel like the concept is cool. And they're not the first people to do this, but they're definitely the first people that I've seen to do it well and to actually have it executed so seamlessly. And the other thing that's really cool is the mechanism that comes in and out of the device to plug into the phone, like, this is just a prototype, but it works so well. I think everyone that got to play with this thing was really impressed by that particular hardware mechanism. Okay, another thing they announced was this new Mouse. So we've seen inductive charging on mice from Logitech and other companies, but this one's a little bit different. This mouse has no battery inside. It's a very lightweight mouse, and it can hold a charge for maybe like, five, ten seconds the moment you pull it off the mat, but the idea behind this thing is that it's this really lightweight, high performance mouse that uses an optical sensor that's completely wireless. They call it the Razer Mamba hyper flex and the mousepad that it's on actually has an interchangeable surface. So you can have a hard surface, or you flip it over and you have this nice cloth surface depending the preference of your mousepad. But two really cool products from Razer. I'm particularly interested in Project Linda. I just really want to see how far Razer can take that thing, because the idea of it is really cool on paper, it's unfortunate that it's like a single device that can work with that chassis so only the Razer phone will fit into that thing, but just the idea of having a phone that can connect into a chassis, and then that device becomes essentially a laptop is really cool, especially with how powerful the CPUs and the hardware inside smartphones are getting. Like we've seen benchmarks, this stuff is equivalent to laptop performance, so yeah, I think the idea is really neat. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it, see you guys next time. [Outro music] 
Hey, how's it going guys. Dave2D here! This is a quick video on the Alienware 17 R4. So this is their flagship model. It's their biggest, it's their baddest, it's their most expensive. Just a quick hardware overview, it's got an overclockable i7, GTX 1080, kick-ass speakers, Tobii eyetracking, that's not something I would use very often, but it is there, it's got four drive bays, it's a beast. Now it's expensive, but if you're in the market for a hardcore 17" gaming laptop, this is my favorite on the market right now. So before I get into the things that I do like about it, I want to talk about a few things that I don't love about it. First, are the RAM slots, there's only two slots, so you can get up to 32 gigs of RAM. If you do, like, tons of VM or if you run crazy CAD software, you might need more than 32 gigs. So if you do, that's a limitation. Second thing are the ports. It has a decent number of ports, but for a 17" laptop, I feel like there could have been more USB ports. There's a total of four, two of them being Type-C. The third thing is the overclocking software. Like I mentioned before, it has an overclockable CPU, but there's no "Alienware easymode software", you have to go into the BIOS or run stuff like ThrottleStop or the Intel XTU program to overclock, and I wish there was something that was built by Dell. There probably will be in the very near future, but right now, there isn't. The other thing is that the power supply is really big, it's 330 watts. If you're going to properly power a GTX 1080, you kinda need the wattage. So those are some things that I don't like about this laptop. There's obviously a bunch of things that I do like, but I'm going to focus on three things that kinda really separate this laptop from the others in this space. First is build quality, of all the 17" laptops in this price range, Alienware does it the best. They aren't super thin or super light, but this thing is a tank. It's got steel and magnesium on the inside, carbon fiber composite for the exterior, it just feels really durable. I think this is the toughest 17" gaming laptop. The Alienware lighting is also cool, light-up trackpads are always fun, the light strips on the side are especially cool. Now, I don't think that this is a design for everyone, but I do think they're made really well. The second thing I like is the performance. It's running the Kaby Lake i7 7820 HK and a GTX 1080. The performance on this machine is obviously really nice, but any laptop with there components are going to deliver something similar. What make this laptop special is the thermal management. I don't know if I got lucky with a really good thermal paste job, but I was ready to open it up, re-paste and re-pad it, but looking at these temperatures, I'm not even going to bother. The fan noise on this system is good, I expected it to be loud because of the video card, it's definitely not silent, and the fan often runs on idle, but under load, it's quieter than most GTX 1080 laptops I've used. So we're getting good performance with good thermals and good fan noise; what's not to like, right? The last thing I really like about this laptop, and this is a big one for me, is the screen. In particular, it's this Quad HD panel. It is a TN panel, but before we say GTFO because it's a TN panel, trust me, it's really nice. Great color accuracy, 120Hz with G-Sync, this thing was built for gamers. So there are gaming laptops out there with 60Hz panels, it's not that it's wasteful because these cards are capable of pushing out so much more, it's more that you're missing out on really good gaming experiences if you're just capped at 60Hz. Playing on a 120Hz panel is so much better, stuff just looks super smooth. Now, my videos are shot in 24 FPS, so it's really difficult for me to showcase this to you, you'll just have to trust me, or see it in-person, a 120Hz panel looks phenomenal. In terms of pricing, Dells tend to fluctuate a lot, they have, like, seasonal sales and stuff like that, but right now, you get this system, so a GTX 1080, overclockable i7, and a 120Hz G-Sync panel, for 2,400 dollars. It's expensive, but if you can afford it, you'll be playing buttery-smooth games for years. Okay, with the Alienware 17 R4 you're getting one of the best-built 17" laptops for the money. Heavy, but it's built to last. You're getting a 17" TN panel that gives one of the best gaming experiences. You get the classic Alienware keyboard, it's not the more common chiclet style, but it's a nice typing experience and it's easy to get used to. You get a solid trackpad that lights up with RGB LEDs. And inside you get a Kaby Lake i7 and a GTX 1080 that are cooled really nicely so you can comfortably overclock. You get four drive bays and two RAM slots, all of which are easy to access and upgrade. And then you get a 99Wh battery, which is actually the legal limit for bringing this laptop onto a plane, Can't go any bigger than that, and even then, you're getting four hours of battery life. Overall, it's a really good laptop, obviously it's super powerful, obviously it's very expensive, but if you're in the market for something like this, like a really high-end, top-tier gaming laptop that you can competitively game with, take a look at this one, it's pretty awesome. Hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! I'll see you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. And this is the Dell Inspiron 7775. It's a bit of a mouthful, but this is the world's most powerful all-in-one desktop computer, it's running a Ryzen 7, which is an 8-core CPU, and it's a pretty unassuming machine right? It's grey, it's not black and red. It looks just like a thick workstation display, but all of the components are housed in the back, and it's a pretty powerful system. It's pretty easy to open up. It's just two screws and this configuration is loaded up with the Ryzen 7 1700, 16 gigs of RAM and the RX 580 from AMD. There's room for an M.2 stick of storage and a two and a half inch SATA drive. Performance is where the system excels and any kind of application that can take advantage of a lot of cores is gonna do great on the Ryzen 7. For single core stuff, Ryzen 7 is really good, but it's not the leader. But for multi-core stuff, these 8 cores do work, and if you do any kind of 3D modeling or rendering or math or science software, video or certain types of photo editing, this 8-core system is gonna do incredibly well. It's weird to see a system like this just crush a quad-core gaming system that's even running a 1080 Ti, like CPU cores are really important for a lot of applications. So, in terms of pricing, this thing starts at $1000, but the configuration I'm looking at is about seventeen, eighteen hundred dollars, which is priced really well. If you go to PC Part Picker, once you get all the parts, including a cheap 4K 27-inch screen, we're looking at pretty much the same price and the Inspiron looks way more streamlined. In terms of gaming performance, You're not gonna get smooth 4K gaming here, but we're looking at very solid performance at 1080p. Light to moderately demanding games run really well. You won't have any issues to keep it above 60 frames per second. Even if you bumped up to 1440p, most lighter games will still be over 60 frames per second. Something heavier like The Division, even on ultra quality, it's pretty close to 60 frames per second. It's only really heavy stuff like GTA 5 and The Witcher 3 that are a little bit slower. It's not quite 60 frames per second, but it's close. The RX 580 is a fantastic card for kind of mid tier gaming. If you want to stream or record your gameplay while you're at it, this is a fantastic system for it because of the 8-core CPU. LET'S GO! DAVE #1! The fans are very quiet when idling, but even under heavy load, they don't get that loud. I feel like we could have bumped up the fan speed a bit for just better thermal performance, but, overall, it's a pretty quiet and properly cooled system. In terms of ports, we're looking at seven USB ports, one of them being Type-C. There's also an HDMI in and out, so you can plug up a console to this thing to use the screen and there's an SD card reader and a headphone jack. Alright, back to the front panel, this display is really nice. It's the 4K option. It also has a cheaper 1080p variant, but the 4K IPS panel gets pretty bright, with good color gamut, and, after you calibrate it, color accuracy is on point. It's a matte finish, and it's not touch sensitive. It's a great screen for content creation and for casual gaming. But my favorite feature about the screen are the bezels. They're super thin and it just keeps the entire product looking sleek. I actually think it makes the product look more expensive than it actually is. The build quality is pretty good. It's made with mostly plastic materials, but they're well-made. The paneling feels solid and the design is simple, but it's clean. I mean, there's another all-in-one products made by Dell. It's in their XPS lineup, and that one's more premium version. It's more expensive products, but I mean that one just looks so much uglier in my opinion than this one. This is simple, it's not super fancy, but looks good. The speakers are located on the bottom one, on each side, and they're good, not amazing. I was hoping for some really awesome speakers because they have a little more room to work with, but it's just good. The webcam is also down here. It supports Windows Hello for quick logins. Image quality isn't great, and, since it's located at the bottom, it's not a great angle. It kind of looks up your nose, but I'm okay with it because it keeps the bezels thin around the rest of the screen. So, I don't know. I think it's worth it. The system comes with the wireless keyboard and mouse, and they rely on this dongle for the connection. The keyboard is actually really nice, way better than I thought it would be. Good key travel, great layout, and the wireless connection is really solid. The mouse, I don't like. it has a shape, kind of like the Microsoft Arc mouse, which I've never been a big fan of, but it just feels cheap. It's too light, and the ergonomics are no good for me. Now, kind of related, I've been using these headphones to test out the games on this system. These are the Corsair Void Pro. They're relatively new. They're eighty bucks, and they're awesome. Excellent build quality, metal yokes, metal headband, RGB lights, Dolby 7.1 sound. For the money, this is one of the best headsets I've used. Now, it does require a USB connection and, on laptops, that's not ideal. But, on a system like this that has seven USB ports, it's a great fit. So in general, I really like this system. There are a couple issues, though. First, I don't like the fact that the GPU isn't upgradable. Everything else in there is: the CPU, the RAM, the drives. Like everything in this thing can be replaced, except for the GPU, that seems to be baked on. Now I understand that, for the target demographic, for content creators and for casual gaming, an upgradable GPU isn't that important because you're not switching them out with that often, but it would have been nice. If this thing did have an upgradable GPU, this thing would have been a lot cooler. The other thing I don't love is the tilt on the stand. So it has tilts, but there's no rotation or height adjustment. It's a great height for me, but if you have an unconventional table height, or just a weird table setup, you might miss that adjustment. The last thing is the lack of a Thunderbolt 3 port. Now, I know this is not a super expensive system, but a Thunderbolt 3 port would have added a lot of expandability and user upgradability. So that's basically it. The 27-inch Inspiron All-In-One. This is a very clean looking system with great performance and a very reasonable price tag. The thing that makes this thing special is the eight-core CPU. They're able to fit something this powerful into a form factor like this. They're the first people to do it. I'm sure more companies will do it soon and Apple has their iMac Pros coming at the end of the year, but those will be a lot more expensive than this one. But, yeah. Cool system. Hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it. Subs if you loved it. See you guys next time. 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here? And this is the cheapest gaming laptop on the market with a 6 gig GTX 1060 and it's kind of weird because it's coming from a brand name company acer and the hardware in here is very powerful but the question that I think a lot of people may be asking is it worth it and Whether or not you should purchase this laptop versus something that's slightly less powerful, but a little bit cheaper And that's what this video is here to help you with so right off the bat We're kind of deep into the product cycle for both the cPU and the gPU I'm not going to go into too much detail about their performance It's a Kaby Lake 7700 HQ and a GTX 1060 so it's going to crush most games And I got to be honest I was expecting the fans to be loud because of the pricing but the fans are quiet The thermals however aren't great the temperatures are a little warm nothing too bad It doesn't throttle at all in games, but I would just like to see lower temperatures regardless We're seeing excellent frame rates on this thing for 1080P gaming So first the good stuff the build quality is surprisingly good It's got a metal top panel plastic everywhere else, and you'd think it would have a lot of Flex on the Chassis But it doesn't it's really solid and even the screen and hinges are built well. I think they made some great material choices here It's not particularly thin and it's also a little bit heavy, but it is durable the speakers are ok They're down firing and they get pretty loud you can play game audio over the fans But they don't sound particularly clear And they lack bass if you want positional audio for gaming you're going to have to get headphones going The port selection is pretty standard for the price points There's three USB-A's and a single USB-C which doesn't support thunderbolt 3 if you're interested in upgrading the internals There's two doors on the bottom one door lets you add a two and a half inch Sata Drive And then the other is for the two rams slots they include 16 gigs but opening the rest of the case isn't easy I got Kind of far, but I chickened out because they don't want to break the casing I'm sure it's possible, but if you plan on changing the ssd You got a nut up and go on pretty deep and the ssd They include isn't super fast so you might want to do it The keyboard has a number pad the layout feels not bad the shift key is kind of weirdly positioned But I personally didn't have any issues using it the mechanism for the keys feel a little spongy But I can still type pretty fast It's strange because each individual stroke doesn't feel great But when you type on it, the whole it's a very comfortable keyboard to use now I think part of that comes from just personal preferences. I think the average person is going to find this keyboard decent the trackpad uses Windows precision drivers It's got great tracking clicking is a little stiff you got to press down harder than normal to register a click But it's good otherwise, and if you're a tapper and not a clicker, it's actually really good now There are a few things that I don't like the temperatures like I mentioned earlier. It's not that they're super hot or anything It's just I wish it ran a little bit cooler, but the thing is it's difficult to get into the internals of this device So if there's any kind of dust buildup in the fans it Might be hard to clean them out the other thing is that the battery life isn't great It's a 48 watt hour battery and I'm getting around four hours of battery life with the screen at 250 nitts It's passable And I guess expected considering the price of the system now the last thing I don't like and this is a big one for me It's the screen. It's 1080p not a touchscreen the color gamut is a super bad. I mean looking at the numbers It doesn't look great, but visually it's not too bad, but the thing that really ruins it for me is the brightness It's really dim if you're using it in Bright environment And I found it difficult to play games in the daytime in the evening or if I close all the blinds It's fine, but yeah, it's not a very bright screen now The screen is where a lot of companies will kind of cheap out if they have to keep their laptops at a certain price point And I feel like that's what they've done. So you're still getting an amazingly powerful device for the money. I mean a GTX 1060 is Almost overkill for 1080p games on laptops because we're capped at the 60 frames per second on the screens I think the purchase decision boils down to which games you actually play if you're someone that plays a lot of kind of mid tier triple-a shooters and stuff like That those aren't super demanding. I would actually opt for a 1050 Ti Those are going to last you a couple years with great frame rates, and you'll save a little bit of money And you can spend on faster drives and stuff like that but if you're someone that plays like Open-World games like Gta 5 witcher 3 then go for the GTX 1060 because you're the type of gamer that this laptop was built for 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And this is the Triton 700 from Acer and this was
actually one of the very first laptops that was shown to the world with a whole thin and powerful but super quiet laptop designs, and this is actually my favorite laptop that Acer makes. So they also make
that super powerful $9000 gaming laptop, and as impressive
as that thing is, It's just not practical for most people. This thing is still very powerful, but it doesn't look like a super obnoxious gaming laptop. It's just a simple laptop, and the reason why they're able to
make it like this, is from the whole Max-Q design approach, and if you remember some of my older videos that I've talked about it, Max-Q is this thing where manufacturers will focus on energy efficiency and make laptops that are like this. Thin, powerful, but really quiet. And with all the laptops with the GTX Max-Q 1080 This is my favorite one. I want to talk a little bit about the build. This thing has incredible build quality. It's got a full metal design, so metal top panel, metal bottom panel Metal keyboard deck, like this thing is built like a tank even though it's three quarters of an inch thick or not even, it's actually very difficult to twist. I'm also partial to its color. It's not black, it's kind of like this really dark aqua color and I think it looks amazing. The other thing is there's no red on this laptop at all There's no red power button or red logo or red exhaust fans like, None of that is red, it's a bit of blue and there's dark aqua color, it's straight up my alley! There are a good number of ports. There's two display outputs (DP + HDMI), Thunderbolt 3, Ethernet and 4 USB ports. If you'll notice, one of the USB ports is recessed and it actually comes with a cap you can kind of put in and out of it, and I'm not sure but I think it's for wireless gaming mice and keyboard so if you have one of those wireless mice with a required dongle, so not a Bluetooth connection but like a radio connection, you can leave it plugged in all the time and you don't have to worry about it getting knocked off or damaged or whatever, It's a small detail but I think it's really cool. If you want to, you can access the internals by removing some screws and then lifting the keyboard off There are two ribbon cables that are connected So if you want to remove it, you have to be super careful. There's a pair of NVMe drives in there, running in RAID 0 and there's 32 gigs of RAM so that's two sticks of 16. It seems unlikely but if you want to, you can upgrade all
of that stuff inside. You can open up this laptop with one hand The hinge tension is pretty much perfect, and when you do You get to see one of the most unique keyboard decks you'll ever see in a laptop Starting up at the top, there's this glass panel and when the laptop is on you can see the fan spinning in here. The whole thing is a window. You can kind of peer inside and look
at the heat pipes and the other thermal stuff, but the main purpose of this thing is it's actually a trackpad Which is kind of crazy. It's a smooth glass surface, there's no texture and tracking is good. It's interesting that a trackpad like this that uses a completely unconventional glass surface like this is still able to use Windows Precision drivers so tracking is super accurate without any kind of skipping issues Gestures also work perfectly on the surface. The button clicks are a little different Left-click is still just single click, right-click is a double tap Kind of like a MacBook, but it's the fact that there's no tactile response at all. You're basically tapping on a glass surface but it works accurately. The click-and-drag is a little weird. You have to double-click something to start dragging it around and again, it works well and it does accurately detect when you want to start clicking and dragging things around but it's so different from anything I've used before that it took me a couple days to get used to it. But the reality is you're gonna have a mouse connected this thing for most times if you're using it. The keyboard is comfortable. It's close to the edge like The whole keyboard is shifted down to give the internals some better cooling And when I first saw photos of this thing, I thought it would be weird to use because there's no wrist rest but it's actually very comfortable. It's a mechanical keyboard but the switches aren't your usual Cherry switch kind-of feel. They feel more like Micro switches Very short travel with a short click. If you're used to a regular mechanical keyboard like a regular desktop mech, you're not gonna be able to come over to this thing and just type regular speed So you gonna have to have a bit of a learning curve It's not that it's a bad keyboard, it's actually a great keyboard but it's just really different from a regular mechanical keyboard. You get fully customizable RGB lighting Individual key lighting with tons of colors to choose from and you can go as crazy as you want or you
can just turn it all off. The fan up at the top also lights up into 
whatever color you want as well Performance on this laptop is really impressive. It's a Max-Q 1080 Kaby Lake i7, 32 gigs of RAM and because it's a Max-Q laptop This thing runs at around 40 decibels when you're playing games and even the most demanding or the most unoptimised games run really well on this thing. The Triton 700 also lets you overclock the GPU. You need to push the fans a little harder to keep it cooled properly, but in Turbo Mode The performance is surprisingly good. It actually comes close to a full fat GTX 1080 laptop Thermal performance is also really good. You get full control of the fans in the software. If you want to push this thing hard for like, a video edit, or if you're playing a game competitively You can, just crank up the fans and just let it rip. But if you want to play something a little more stealth, you can lower it back down and just keep it in Whisper Mode So I wanted to see how hot this laptop would get when I was playing this thing For a long time in Whisper Mode so the footage you're about to see Was this game running for about three hours in Overwatch and I just kept this thing with G-Sync on, with fans at 40 decibels Temperatures are a little hot. They never got
worse than this but the frame rates don't dip too much. The speakers are positioned really well. The stereo separation is on point They project upwards, one on each side They're good speakers, they're not excellent. Decent clarity but the bass isn't as strong as I'd like. The screen is really nice. It's a 1080p 120Hz panel. Supports G-Sync And when you pair it up with the 1080, games run so smooth on this thing. The color gamut and brightness are good as well. Now I've said this before in other videos, but when you have a laptop like this with high-end components, you have to put a good quality screen like this in. A lot of laptops are still being made with good components Fast components but 60Hz screens and that just kills me. They've done it well, 120Hz panel, G-Sync, Max-Q 1080, it's a great combination. It's an IPS panel, you don't get the super fast response time of TN panels but with an IPS panel, you're getting better looking image quality and viewing angles are better as well. The battery life on this laptop is probably
its weakest point It's a 54 watt-hour battery and I'm only getting around 2 hours of battery life with the screen at 250 nits. Now most people that are picking this up aren't gonna be using it for like extended gaming sessions on the road But if that's what you're looking for, it's not the best option... The Triton 700 is one of the best built laptops I've seen from Acer Full metal construction with excellent build quality and a nice design Pricing starts just under $3000 but it comes in fully loaded. You're getting a
120Hz G-Sync screen It's excellent for gaming with good enough color accuracy for content creation The mechanical keyboard is really clicky and it's comfortable to use but it doesn't use your normal
desktop keyboard switches. You'll need to get used to these. The trackpad is built into the glass window with great tracking accuracy but clicking is a little bit weird Inside, the Kaby Lake i7 and the Max-Q 1080 deliver really impressive performance. The fans are quiet but you can overclock the GPU and adjust the fans to your preference. The RAM and the two NVMe drives are replaceable if you need but Acer loads this thing up with some really fast stuff out of the factory The battery life is shorter and clocks in at just over a couple of hours. Okay I think Acer did an amazing job on this thing. It's such a cool device. The design, that build, the performance, the trackpad, everything about it I really really like. Now it's not for everyone. It's super expensive that's also makes it like unachievable for most people including myself, like this is review unit I got to send it back, but of all the laptops I've seen in 2017 This is the one that's most impressive to me. I've seen other ones that are even more extravagant but it's not about that. It's about building something that's practical, that's viable as like an everyday machine and looks really good while it does it. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! 
Hey, how is it going? Dave2D here. So, WWDC for 2017 just happened. And that's Apple Developers Conference that they have every year. It's normally more software focused. And this year, I mean, there was a bunch of software that was announced. But the one thing that kind of stuck out for me was the adoption of a file system for iPad. So iOS 11 will have a new app called Files. And I think for a lot of laptop users, that have tried to switch over to iPads to replace their laptop, they hit that obstacle where they just can't manipulate files the way they want to, but this new Files app looks pretty cool. But I want to focus on the hardware that was announced. And this year there were quite a few. So, first, the entire MacBook and iMac lineup has been updated to KabyLake chips. This KabyLake CPUs are basically chip drops into the 2016 MacBook Pro. So they were just you know put in a new CPU into the existing architecture. That was pretty simple. The advantages of KabyLake... well there's three big ones. The first that you'll notice is the faster clock speeds. So these base clocks are about 15% faster than the previous generation. It's not a huge difference in terms of actual user experience, it'll benchmark faster, but the 2016 models will feel pretty similar. Another thing that you'll have with the KabyLake chips are the speed shift technology. So, that's running a new version of speed shift. And when you launch an app or do anything that needs a short burst of speed, these CPUs use something called speed shift to fire up a turbo. The KabyLake processors turbo up quite a bit faster. The last thing is video encoding and decoding. So the KabyLake chips have hardware on the chip to decode and encode h264 and vp9 codecs and the end result is that you'll have better battery life when you're streaming 4k content on your laptop. The integrated graphics on the MacBook Pros are also a new version, so instead of the IRIS 540 and 550, the new ones have IRIS PLUS 640 and 650. In regards to a performance increase for 3d gaming or 3d applications, it's pretty insignificant. But in general the KabyLake chips are nice, it's just more focused on energy efficiency more than anything else. So, if you're running, I guess the 2016 models, there's really no real reason to upgrade, but if you have one of the older ones, like the 2015 or 2014 models, there's just a bit more incentive to upgrade now. The iMacs also received a KabyLake upgrade and they have more options for RAM and the screens. And video cards have also been updated. The base model has an integrated GPU. The higher res models have some new Radeon Pro GPUs. They're going to have similar TDP to the previous generation, so it's not going like a massive increase in performance, But it's nice to have new iMacs. I will be doing a full review of those new iMacs when I get them in. I want to see what those video cards are capable of. Now, the thing I was most interested in was the new iMac Pro. It launches in December and it's pretty
expensive. It's going to start at $5,000, loaded out with nice hardware and packaged in a very compact iMac shaped case. But what makes it special is the processor. This is the first iMac that has more than four core for the processor. And I mean that's special, because it's difficult to cool something with six eight or ten cores. And in this case their top-end model has 18 cores which is insane. I find it difficult to believe that they can cool a properly utilized 18 core Xeon processor in that chassis. I'll be impressed if they do. But the other thing that kind of sucks about it, is the price tag. They haven't revealed like the full top-end price, but you know that, it's Apple and the price jumps up exponentially when you go up in core count. So, 18 cores, I think is going to top out like 10 grand. It's crazy. The iPad Pro also had a hardware revamp. 10.5 inch screen with smaller bezels, a bunch of nice new features, the strange thing for me though is the 120 Hertz refresh rate. So, 120 Hertz panels are really nice for gaming, animations look really smooth, stuff just looks very fluid on it. Movies and videos will still look the same, but any kind of high frame rate stuff will look really fluid, provided the developer or the creator of that content has allowed for higher frame rates. So, things like UI animations and possibly some games, those are just going to look really smooth. Now the faster refresh rate is going to allow for a faster response time with the Apple pencil. The old versions had a response time, I think, of 38 milliseconds, so noticeable lag when you were using the pencil. This has an advertised rate of 20 milliseconds, so quite a reduction in response time. As for whether or not 120 Hertz panel is useful otherwise, aside from the artists application, I would say no. It's really difficult to justify the extra frames, that's just an aesthetic thing, but it is nice to look at. The Apple home pod. I don't know how I feel about this thing. At $350, it's not crazy expensive, but the integration feels, I don't know I'm not that impressed by it. I mean there's cool tech in it, there's seven tweeters, there's technology inside this thing to kind of measure and map the room that you're in for adjustment of the sound waves and stuff like that. It's cool, it's just that I feel like any kind of
high-end Bluetooth speaker could have done something very similar to this with
your phone. Now the one thing I can say is that, this is the first generation of it, if they add stuff to it so if they add like an Apple TV built into this home pod thing, so let's say home pod 2, there's a built in Apple TV or there's built in like mesh Wi-Fi into these units, and you can place them all over your house, that's kind of cool. That's cooler but in its current iteration, I'm not that impressed by it. Anyways, that's the end of this video, I mean there's a lot of hardware from this WWDC. I've covered like a very small amount of it, just the superficial stuff. I will be doing individual reviews for anything that I personally find super interesting. So, be subscribed for those. Hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs you liked it, sub if you loved it. I'll see you guys next time. 
have you ever wanted to be Lou from unbox therapy or anyone else for that matter today's video a little bit different this is a fun one there's this software in the news right now that's gained a little bit of attention it's something called deep fakes and for the uninitiated it's this software that basically allows for face swapping so we've seen face swapping before at a low level we've seen on the Instagram app we've seen it on snapchat but this thing has some pretty high-level face swapping it's machine learning to create face swap to videos now in the past you needed a little bit of knowledge of coding and just an understanding of how all this stuff works to be able to work with it but a user on reddit created this application that totally simplified the process you basically shove some images into this thing it uses your GPU and it spits out a fake video so I took one of Lou's videos a loop from unbox therapy took one of his videos took one of my videos ran it through the program and I let it do its thing now the computer used to do this was the most powerful computer have access to it's a thread Ripper system 16 cores 64 gigs of ram a pair of gtx 1080p eyes it's a pretty powerful system so this particular application is called fake app and it does three things the first thing is extraction it identifies and pulls faces out of your source files so I'm using video footage here it'll find the faces and then take a snapshot of them the second thing this app does is something called Train and this is where the magic happens I think this is where the deep machine learning takes your reference images from different facial angles different facial expressions lighting conditions a whole bunch of different types of facial images and then through deep learning it creates a model and this process takes a very long time basically the longer it runs for the better the image quality will be so I've been running the training for about nine or ten hours with the two videos now the last thing this thing does is converting and this is where it takes the model that that's created and creates still images with that model so I've been running this application overnight I literally ran it overnight and I have not looked at these images before I'm about to I've done the conversion and we're about to go in and see this for the first time now I was actually gonna go through these images first just to make sure that it worked but I just trusted the process because it looked like the algorithm was doing its thing and I really want to share this reaction with you guys okay let's do this so what I've setup right now is I have my macbook it's obviously not running on this I have this running TeamViewer and we're gonna access the PC that did all the another thing to keep in mind as I did this in 720p obviously the higher resolution would have been better but it will just killed the training and rendering time so I'm just gonna go with what we have your wanna see what this looks like okay so it obviously didn't do a perfect job we're seeing like some artifacts obviously oh my gosh okay I'm gonna convert this into videos we it strings out properly and I'll take a look at it then okay so I've run the still images through premier just to string it into a video file we're gonna take a look at it I don't think it came out that great oh my god I have a feeling that lose face and the way that his lighting conditions are on a set are so different from my kind of typical for the algorithm to kind of read it properly and do it properly but it's so okay no the application allows you to actually reverse it so if they can take my face and put it on lose face and lose video so I'm gonna be right back do the same thing but on his videos okay we're back now keep in mind this is 720p I really wish this was like high res but [Laughter] they got the glasses and everything oh man this is so good okay I like this one more I don't you guys do but this one looks better to me then when lose face was in my videos this is so good from a functionality standpoint I mean you noticed the battery pack you're kind of a weary I mean it feels like you have a wallet in your pocket sort of oh I feel like it will hurt this pretty days all right I've been to another run so I'm gonna do someone else I want to do someone who's got like a bigger facial prescence on their scene like Jon from TLD he's really close to the camera I want to see if it's like better image quality now I don't have that much time for the end of the workday probably like six seven hours before I have to leave so I'm gonna run it and at before I leave work today I'm just gonna play it just to see what it looks like I'm so curious okay this is so weird well see you later okay so it's been around five hours of training with John and my footage I really wish you'd make it go longer but it's pretty late in the workday ready and I got to get home so I just had to end it short five hours I mean looking at the clips the still images it looked okay it's not I'm gonna be amazing but I want to see what it looks like and here we go John on my face this one's pretty convincing like John's eyes are I think he has bigger eyes than is weird it looks like a mutated version of John my channel so it looks like this program did a better job putting John's face on my head than lose face I think it's because John and I look more alike not that we looked the same or anything but because Lou has glasses he's got a beard it's just more difficult for the program to kind of figure everything out but it's somewhat convincing with John's face I mean it's obviously fake but it looks more believable than lose but it's pretty cool I think it's so weird still this is crazy I feel like I could download all of John's videos and just put my face on them because it's reasonably convincing I think with enough training time this would look pretty good a couple things if you're interested in doing this thing first you need NVIDIA it won't work with an AMD card you need CUDA Corso and video card secondly and the big one is be responsible with your content obviously you can do some fun stuff with it like this but you can do some terrible malicious stuff with it as well so be just be responsible understand that this is people's privacy and stuff John and Lou and my friends so they're obviously cool with this but don't be a jerk with it okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs be liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time you 
Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here so Amazon partnered with me for a second gift guide this one's for smart home tech so if You know someone who's interested in smart homes because they moved into a new house or a new apartment Or if they just want to bring technology into their home this video is for you I actually recently moved into a new home and I had to do a little bit of research to figure out what I wanted what I didn't want and These are my top picks I thought I'd share them with you. The most important thing of a smart home is seriously the Wi-Fi backbone because if we don't have good Wi-Fi none of the smart home stuff is gonna work well and the one I went with was the EERO mesh Wi-Fi. It comes with one EERO hub which connects to your modem and a Couple of beacons which you place around the house now good Wi-Fi is super important because if you have devices that drop connection once in A while your smart home experience is going to be so much worse, I highly recommend getting a mesh system You can go with the router, but the thing is when you have bigger spaces with multiple floors You just want Wi-Fi that blankets everything with strong solid connections, so I highly recommend a mesh system I've used a lot of mesh Wi-Fi systems the one from Google, ASUS, D-Link, but my personal favorite is seriously the ERRO There's the reason why this thing has four and a half stars on Amazon It's just super simple to set up really great software And this is the other bonus these devices at least the second-generation one Doesn't have a power cable that needs to connect to this thing, it plugs up right into the wall And it even has a nightlight feature that you can control within the app Okay, next up is the outdoor smart cam from Nest And I've actually purchased quite a few smart cams from Nest over the years. Their hardware is always good, very well Built and reliable I still use one of the original dropcam's from 2010 And it still works perfectly This one here is meant for outdoor use so it's waterproof and includes all the hardware that you would need to kind of install it Wherever you want it to be and it makes a great gift for someone who wants to keep an eye on things when they're not At home and because it has a mic you can interact with the people that appear on the camera so if a delivery man shows Up and you want to tell him something you can through the mic Okay, so the next gift idea is a little bit bigger, but it's actually one of my favorite pieces of tech I have right now. It's an air purifier it's called the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool Link and it can be a fan to cool you down or a Heater when you want it to be and the whole time It's an air purifier. That uses a HEPA filter It has remote so you can adjust things like air speed the angle of the air the oscillation and things like that but there's also an app which gives you control of all of this and Within the app you can see the current air quality of the room It's a really advanced air purifier, but it's a great gift for some who wants better air circulation or better air quality Okay, next we have the Philips hue white and color ambience starter kit now This is a kit that comes with four bulbs and one hub and of all the smart lights I've used This is the thing that's most connected basically any big-name home automation service can connect to this thing The lights are your standard bulb shapes that will fit into your standard sockets, and it has great software you can use it to change the ambient colors of rooms and stuff or you can use the app to turn your lights on and off remotely for a little bit of home security And because this thing has such a good integration with so many home automation Services if you want to you could technically make all of the lights in your house Operated by voice, which is really cool. Okay. I've linked all of these items below if you're interested in purchasing them Hope you enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it See you guys next time 
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. So this is the second AMD rig I've ever built in my life. The first one was in like the year 2000. It was an AMD Athlon Thunderbird or something like this. 15 ,16 years later... no, 17 years later I have this, the AMD Ryzen-7. So, running a Ryzen 7 1700X and a liquid-cooled Vega 64 and I put it all into this ITX case because I'm all about smaller cases and the liquid-cooled Vega 64 actually fit inside this thing. The case is a shift from Phanteks. It has a volume of around 20 litres, so it's not like the smallest ITX case ever, but I think it looks really nice, and I wanted something that looked stealth, but could cool an 8-core CPU with a powerful GPU. In terms of the other components, it's running 32 gigs of RAM from Corsair. It's running out of stock 21:33 and a 600-watt power supply. A Samsung 950 pro NVme and I'll drop links for all this stuff down below, but none of this stuff is overclocked. It's all running at stock right now, and I'm still tweaking things, so don't laugh at my award-winning cable management, but yeah I built a fully AMD rig I just want to share some thoughts with you. So first let's start with the GPU, the water-cooled Vega 64 It's a silver casing, red accents. AMD sent this thing out for me to take a look at earlier So I'm still running beta drivers, but the performance is good It's a stronger performer than a reference GTX 1080, so right out of the box without any kind of overclocking, it benchmarks better and it performs better in most games. It's a very powerful GPU. I had mine connected to a 1440p 144 Hertz FreeSync panel And the gaming experience is phenomenal. Super buttery visuals with graphics quality cranked up. I did have hiccups in a couple of games but I'm just going to chalk it up to immature drivers that will get resolved. I ran some benchmarks for Crypto mining And I don't know, these numbers felt really low. It could be a driver issue, or maybe it's just a mining client issue I'm not sure, but these are some numbers in case you're curious I want to talk about power consumption for a bit The liquid-cooled Vega 64 uses a lot of juice, more than a 1080, more than even a 1080 Ti You can reduce the power consumption through the catalyst software, and there's even a physical switch on the card for low-power mode But performance is reduced if you do that It's about a 20% drop in performance to go to Power saver mode And it's only a little bit of an increase in performance to go up to turbo mode but it uses quite a bit more energy so balanced mode is probably the sweet spot. Now the liquid cooled Vega 64 is clocked a Bit faster and the Rad fits perfectly into this Itx case, so I gave it a shot. Now I tried all three of these cards with the GTX 1080, a 1080 Ti and the liquid cooled Vega 64. The 1080Ti is a little bit of a tight squeeze But all three of them fit. In terms of performance the liquid cooled Vega 64 sits right in the middle The 1080 Ti is quite a bit faster Now this rig was built for video editing and looking at Premiere the lead that Vega 64 normally has over the reference 1080, it disappears. It might be something with the drivers or maybe Adobe needs to optimize premiere to work With Vega, but the 1080 is slightly faster and as usual the 1080 Ti is in the lead The Vega 64 is nice and a halt but really the heart of this Rig is the Ryzen 1700 X so this thing is awesome after years of building pricier intel systems Having access to an 8 core CPU at this price point is so weird the performance is really good for the money the fan noise of the liquid-cooled Vega 64 never gets super loud or anything even when you're playing games and the temperatures stay comfortable as well
They do a really good job with thermal management and pricing for the liquid Vegas 64 starts at $599 the air-cooled version goes for $499 and at this pricing the dollar to performance ratio is not bad I mean, it's not a door crashing deal. It's fair, but if crypto miners want these cards again it's going to screw with the pricing and I think these cards will not be appropriately priced for gamers to purchase If Crypto miners get their hands on these things. Overall I think it's a solid card it has the same GPU tachometer as the fury x Performance is strong and as long as AMD continues to improve on their software I think vega is a good option for a lot of people as for me personally for this particular build I feel like the vega GPU is a little bit too hot and a little bit too high power consumption for This particular case size 300 watts is pushing this case size and the power supply 600 Watt Power supply a lot of that is taken by the video card And I just think that I should go for a lower TDP for this system Okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs  if you loved it. See you guys next time.
