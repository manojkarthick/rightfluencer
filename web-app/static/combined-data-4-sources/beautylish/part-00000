everyone okay so today I'm going to be giving you my thoughts on these two products and this has been truly one of the most requested videos of late so I'm going to compare them both and give you my thoughts so now we all almost all of us need to set our makeup and there are two products in this category that are iconic the first one is Laura Mercier and this is the translucent powder and then it stands up against the ACMA original no color powder so a lot of people want to know what the difference is and is there really a difference so I'm going to get to it I'm going to it bloody quick now the links of these products are in the description bar and they're right down below let's say Laura Mercier you get for $36 you get one ounce of product now this product is iconic and it works beautifully it gives it doesn't alter the color of your foundation and it makes skin look immaculate now those of you with very very oily skin may find that your foundation sets longer with this compared to ours here make but and this is a really big but it is so minuscule yes there is more oil control from this one but it is minut compared so you need to bear that in mind the other thing is if you have blemish prone skin this contains cornstarch and cornstarch likes to feed on bacteria so if you do have blemish prone skin this could be problematic so next we have the RC Magnum color palette and I've talked about this few years and it's been around for decades you get twelve dollars and you get three ounces I believe which is it is a lot of product it is a lot a lot of product a lot of product so comparing the two you get more for your money here absolutely but if you're looking for more longevity this wins but it wins by that much you can technically just use a little bit more powder to be done both of these can be used with baking and under cheap hiding so you can do that absolutely it's the only powder I carry is this one however actually does not I also carried the youth center arm souffle which is a pink powder but I really don't need it I can get by with this absolutely you can set your face with all of this and including the cheek and baking highlights however you wish generally speaking I prefer our CMA because it's cheaper and you get more product which i think is a no-brainer but this is truly a fantastic product the translucent by Laura Mercier but just bear in mind that if you do have acne prone skin you may and it is a big man but you may experience some problems due to the cornstarch for generally speaking if it were me I would just buy this because I think it's really really good our CMAs are amazing the fact they've been around for decades they keep selling out it is a massive massive bonus now all the links including doubles and triples of these are available and they're right down there that's my thoughts frankly I'd rather have this but there you go each their own Hema know what your thoughts are lean right on that and I'll see you soon bye bye 
here everyone identi today I'm going to be giving you some makeup tips that I received directly from Charlotte Tilbury and before I get on with it is let me show you how it all happened so just before Charlotte launched her makeup line and I obviously knew who she was long long before any makeup line I returned to her PR department because I had heard that there was going to be a makeup line and it was really really kind of quiet about it and they go back to me and said yes there will be makeup line and she's going to be doing some press and this was months and months and months before anything got released and would you like to come along to it I look fantastic so I went to London and I went to Charlotte studio which is in London and there was this really huge table and all of these journalists were there and then there was me just a single makeup artist there as well and she came into the room and I just remember being absolutely blown away by just what you see on YouTube is exactly as she is she's exactly like that in real life she is incredibly passionate and incredibly inspiring and it was the most incredible morning hearing about how she created these products what she was trying to achieve and it was just so mesmerizing and inspiring to listen to it and for somebody who may or may not know I use a lot of Tom Ford products and Charlotte Aubrey was responsible for the Tom Ford make it mine she was a genius behind that line and a lot of people don't know that but it's true she was and so I had this incredible day and the line launch and it was phenomenal as you all know and I use well I use all of it and then what happened is I contacted um Charlotte people and I said to them do you think I could hire a shark for a day I would like to be taught by her I would like it everything that she knows and I've no idea they were going to say and they were like yeah sure so what happens is role fast forward is the end of December and this is years ago now and I'm going to see hero and it was the end of December and the date came up and I went to London and I got to spend the entire day with Charlotte and she allowed me to film the entire day and the model and everything that she was doing so I could not only watch it there lighter but I had a reference point when I came home so I could absorb all the information that was being given and I'm going to be sharing with you now the tips that I learned from that day so let's make a start first thing was the moisturizer shall I use a huge amount of moisturizer and this is something I've talked about before she used an incredible amount more than I've ever seen not only on the face on the neck down the arms anything that was visible because you can't have if you go reading matte face but then there's lots of shine on the arm Charlotte likes everything to be very cohesive so there was an incredible amount of moisturizer and then an incredible amount of wonder glow put on as well another tip is that sometimes she will also find one to go over the foundation as well to keep his skin and extra shine depending on the little finger going for but the amount of moisturizer was key because it gave the skin an incredibly chewy look so the next thing was that she allowed her moisturizer to sink into the skin after she'd applied it she would come through the lashes should come through the brows this is the moisturizer time to absorb this go on to the second thing which is foundation she used the foundation brush to apply the makeup with but she then used her fingers she blended everything with her hand and her fingers she would concealer she used the thing is there was not a single sponge used the entire day so that was just because you know we're all he's going to be the guy that she just used her hand everything was blended then then this is the key bet she moved on and coming through the price again come through the lashes she scrubbed the list to make sure that they were soft for the application of lipstick later on and while that was being done it allowed the foundation time to set naturally on the skin because foundation you put some on your hand and go away in sauce the set and that's the key because then she could use much less powder because she tends to patent just the t-zone only but because she's left that time nothing's moving when you're applying the powder because it's already preset so that was really interesting because I always want to track she was able to apply blusher to say this area when she hadn't tired of it and it's because she took the time to allow it to set or preset before applying powder down the center so that was just incredible again minimal powder as I mentioned down the t-zone Charlotte almost always at least for training with me elongates the brow and the reason being is because she quite likes very one of the cat's eyes were putting the IO and if you don't elongate the Brian because then the tail of the eyeshadow meets the tail of the brown I talked about this Lots in videos but that way you get the illusion of wider said eyes or more feline eyes so always about elongating the brown shows I mentioned about face shapes as well if the fascia is longer then she all makes the eye shadows underneath the eye thicker to compensate for that to kind of shorten the face in in that kind of regard the same if you've got a very very small thing it would be much smaller underneath with regards to I shake this same principles were actually pretty much the same Charlotte as far as I'm aware she will use shimmer on anybody at any time regardless of whether they got hooded eyes or aging eyes doesn't matter she's a fan of shimmer and I found as well with clients that tends to be when you reach over 40 intend to start loving Shemin even more and it really is about how they feel and that's something that I took into consideration because I was always very much about matte shades on the eyes and I realized that if something makes you feel good that's really what's most important another thing that she did that I almost never did was she sharpened a pencil when she was doing the ice eyeliner and lip liner when she's doing the lead line - sharpen a pencil she would draw the outline here then she sharp a pencil then she'd draw the bottom and she child again so it was like four times to complete the lid when doing the eyes he sharpened at least twice to get that eyeliner perfect she also use q-tips off by definitely interview the foundation ones above all magic room to clean up any edges ran the lip underneath the eyes whatever was whatever needed doing she was also a fan of something actually this is totally totally different but she has her own brush line and brush the brush is crazy on to a pencil brush and a crease brush and when I first first met her my brushes were already in production they'd already been made they were just waiting to be shipped and when I saw her two brushes I was like thank God because I didn't have any flat eyeshadow brushes in my original collection they will all crease brushes and I said to her why don't you have these flat brushes and she literally reiterated what I said they're just too much to work with with a crease brush you can do the lid work you can do the crease where if you could blend with it I was off and it made me feel better that about how I use brushes because I only use crease brushes to apply eyeshadow with never flat brushes but anyway and finally and I think because the tips that I gave you are honestly truly true tips I've seen from up with regards to patterning because it's tease an application because the foundation has a really preset at the end of the make up of charlatans to look at the face and see if there's any more powdered necessary and where those areas might be necessary but it's almost always in the to zone during my time with her and watching her because I got film videos with her as well for YouTube she never once applied any excess powder around the perimeter of the face but she would use bronzer and highlighter but she would never prepared of those areas because of that setting process and that's it that's the tips I learned from her and it's incredible I still got the video it's just a wonderful wonderful reference point to me and she's such a good honest decent person as well and what you see is truly what you get when you watch her you're inspired because she's so knowledgeable about her skill and it comes across and her willingness to share all her tips and secrets with everyone is what sets her apart from a lot of makeup artists there you go thank you watching and I'll see you all next time bye bye 
okay so today I'm going to be talking with you my favorite instant result products now I've talked about this range before it's the same range that I love I've been using for a couple of years now and it's good I recently stopped using the eye product I noticed an immediate difference in under-eye bags so I'm back on it because I was trying something else out no didn't like it so I'm back to this so let me talk you through the products the first one is the tight eyes now they've got a tight eye we've got the tight neck and we've also got the new tight lips now both of these all of these products work in a similar way which is their cumulative so you get an instant result with tightness and you can feel the timer's and you can see it the skin looks tighter in the areas you've applied it but over the days as you use it you keep using it it builds to a greater and greater effect there's a synergistic effect to this and again I am an absolute testament to that my he did wonders for my eye area when I stopped using it to try something else at that bag that was irritating me for so many is started to come back so I'm back on it excellent way to prep the skin particularly if you're over 30 it's a wonderful way because it tightens and smoothes the skin therefore you can then use your primers and rest of your makeup and it goes on smoother and the skin looks tighter which is the goal of it obviously if your necklace in an area you may want to skip then I can just go on to the eye or if you want to do the whole kind of shebang you've got the eye the lip and then there you apply the product underneath the eyes on the neck around the lips whatever it is you need to do then you wait five minutes or so and then you just rinse it off with cold water or with a like a cloth to just get rid of it then you go about your day truly these work and they work well the other product that I'm really fond of particularly if you're over 30 is the moisturize this is an the intense formula that works to rehydrate underneath the eyes apply all underneath you concealer goes on incredibly smoothly with this so you can use this as an eye cream and absolutely day and night but you'll notice it particularly if you use it in conjunction with say the tight eye the effect is noticeably better and again it's worth stating even though there's an immediate effect this really is about every single day it always close as you can get to every single day but for me these are mine they live as I mentioned with all of the reviews I've done for 2017 they all live here there's nothing here that I'm talking about that like just like a little bit it's only the stuff that I use and it's right in front of me so there you go links and codes and all that stuff right in the description bar and I see you're seeing bye-bye 
hmmm okay so today is the video which is the best drugstore products of 2017 and this is not your standard video where I'm going to list off a whole host of products the truth of the matter is is that I don't use very high use very very few drugstore products and in order to compile a list when these videos that I've been doing the only product I speak about our products that I personally use and have used consistently so I know that they're good at least in my opinion I can't produce a list I mean I could I could just you know read off a list of objects or products and say they're the best but I don't know if they are because I really don't use them and that's the honest to God's true in fact truly the only real drugstore product I use is the L'Oreal Karla black and that's it that and I think that that is one of the best mascaras ever but that's about all I use so rather than giving you a fake list of products that I think are really good or going out and buying a whole host of them actually Maybelline I don't know if they still make it but I love the fit me foundation that foundation was amazing almost everyone else hated it I loved it but also the Maybelline fit me can see that that really is an amazing concealer and that is one that I do use so I used to but that's about it and I don't want to make up stuff so this is where you come in rather than me giving you a fake list why don't you tell me and write in the comment section your favorite drugstore products and then all the other people that are watching this video they can look in the comment section and see your recommendations and you can see there and we can compile a really big list and I think that's the best way forward for this video because I don't want to be disingenuous and talk about products that I don't know about and I really don't and that's why with these videos for the 2017 series they're very specific because they are truly there are so many more products I like but these are the ones that I use so let me defer to you you create the list for me create your favorite products I will look at all these lists as well and everyone else can look at them then we can all find something that's within budget today I hope that makes sense and please if you have a really good drugstore part that you love leave in the comment section it would be amazing I know that myself and everyone else will probably be really grateful okay thanks so much I'll see you soon bye bye 
yeah well okay so today is my favorite mascara sup 2000% let's make this that Javon shoot this is their mascara and it is absolutely amazing the one that this is stunning and it also bends so it breaks into like that it is really really good really good I still love this it is absolutely beautiful and it is the power glass mascara it comes with this scary-looking one and you go to primer and you get the mascara and you just unscrew it you dip it in and then you apply it like that and it will separate lashes like nobody's business so if you find that you miss cars clump on you this one almost certainly one it's incredibly expensive just bear that in my favorite drugstore want L'Oreal carbon black is the best this is a great mascara called multi effects it's the Estee Lauder one and it's waterproof thank you beautiful beautiful mascara charlotte talkies the original full fat lashes is a bloody good mascara that's a great mascara this is this is a great one superhero by it cosmetics is amazing it really is amazing knock off the excess please because it can build up really quick that's an amazing the sky if you've got nice little amounts of money to burn then this is a great one by sizzling so intense I mean it judge over that is a really good mascara have a look Becca for ultimate full lash effect mascara touching myself that one again this these are great now these are lash builders and these are fibers I use these all the time they're absolutely wonderful do your eyes first because the powders can drop but once they seal then they stay forever one month ago but they stare in really long time this is great for lower lash line this is the it cosmetics tightline you can also use this for your upper eye as well really good that's a great one and I'm going to talk about this one this is still my favorite but it was so problematic as many of you point that this is legendary lashes by charlotte tilbury it does give you spectacular lashes and they are really black but a lot of people said that within a few hours it can start to spread it makes you look like not good now I tend to proto really heavily under the eyes and then just sweep it away so the transfer thing isn't an issue with me but a lot of people it can be an issue now I still really like that mascara so if you want to give it a go give it a go I love it it's still my favorite but I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see an updated version of this because so many people complain so I don't know if that's the fact that don't know it's making it up but I wouldn't be surprised at at some point we see a better version of that because it's so good but if I could only pick one out of all of these I would pick the superhero by pink cosmetics and as a runner-up I would probably pick ok the hourglass over them all but superhero beta Cosmetics followed up by multi effects which is the Estee Lauder line that's it curly lashes and BW and I see y'all soon bye bye 
I'm she saying an affirmation here please leave my paws please leave my paws everyone okay so today I'm going to be giving you my thoughts on this new product now this is by Clinique and it's called the blackhead solution self-heating blackhead extractor yes you heard that word right extractor so I thought I bite give it a good test run and then come back to you and let you know what I thought and as you can probably tell it's not that good so as as somebody that has blackheads yes I do this was very appealing to me now of course deep down inside I know its absolute bollocks but I want to believe just like everyone else I want to believe in the product and unfortunately it's not that good so let's have a little look so what you get is a little tube contains a whole 20 mils of product which is not that much now its standard to have 30 nails unless you're talking about an eye cream where they might give you practically lucky 2 mils see here 20 mils of product for 22 pounds which is quite a lot of money not for not that amazing amount of product now what you do is you take the cap off and then you take sort of unscrew and then you push out an amount and you rub that on your nose and then you apply a little bit of mortar and then this ingenious product will heat up slightly and then you use the kind of silicone side looks a bit like a painful sex toy and then you go all around your nose for 15 to 30 seconds and then as if by complete magic and serendipity your blackheads are extracted and you look gorgeous so let's have a little look so according to Clinique is it Jen effective it will gently and effectively extract blackheads now it actually says it will extract blackheads without pain squeezing or damage to the skin it does not extract blackheads it didn't extract a single one of mine they were exactly the same as they were before I did it that's just my opinion that's they looked exactly the same my skin looked a bit brighter but guess why because I know I just washed my skin it looked a little bit fresher they're all about their back they didn't extract a single thing so when you mix this with water it creates a unique calming sensation and this opens up the pores and allows you to you know extract all that dirt and oil and debris and all that kind of stuff right this does heat up it doesn't get hot it barely gets warm you can feel a warming tingle certainly not enough in 15 to 30 seconds to allow your pores to open up and expel all their debt rias or less finding the right way all their filth right it's not long enough you could get a much better effect by putting a hot flannel not too hot on your nose leave it for two or three minutes to really open up the pores that would be a much better option but this is a 15 to 30 second treatment so it doesn't really eat up that much and certainly not enough to open up a pore but it's there minded technology according to clinic so okay now this contains a potent blend of salicylic acid salicylic acid is absolutely one of the best treatments for buckets because it will penetrate into the pore through the oil and unclog the pore it takes timeless acetic acid I've been using it for years I've still got blackheads so there you go but it does work on blemishes it's a really good product but it needs to be left in in contact with this for an extended period of time not 15 seconds you know that clinic you have a team you're an order you have a team of dermatologists I'm sure you ask them first and said how do you need to leave some sort of hospital and I bet you're not one of them so 15 seconds it's just not true I really wanted to believe that this product would work I thought it was going to clean my pores make them look like there was nothing in them and prevent what hunger and hopefully free petrol but that's not the case this will make your skin feel much smoother when you use it because you're exfoliating it however it will not extract a blackhead not a single one of mine is ever been extracted with this might be using it for over a week nothing zero Tolu so there you go that's my thoughts thanks for watching these ramblings and I'll see you next time bye bye 
have one okay so today's video is on any marvelous product and this book is one of those rare few that can make a massive difference in the way that the skin appears so this is not permanently get rid of wrinkles or any like that but what it does do is give the skin a much smoother appearance which is so good so we'll get on with it before I do though I just want to thank everybody for their lovely lovely comment on the video I did yesterday I really really appreciate it they were so nice and some of them have been incredibly helpful so I'm doing research on those if you do have any comments on that particular video it would be great if you could leave it on that video because that's what I'm launching as reference points but I just want to thank everyone for the comments because they have been it's been overwhelming and I really appreciate it and all the emails I've been sent so thank you okay so moving on to this product so let's take a closer look obviously it's from the ordinary and it's caught by cheryline and this is a solution of 10% which is really great now many many many moons ago many moons ago some of you will remember the Victoria Principal she had a skincare line and our Geralyn was really heavily involved in that and the agreement was very heavily involved in that line and that line did incredibly well I sharing gives the appearance of smoother skin you need a couple of drops and applying this to your forehead and around the eyes the areas where we tend to age just apply it to the areas that are aging that are looking a bit lined and just see what happens that's really all you need from this product contrary to popular belief I do not use every single product from the ordinary because they don't all suit my skin so all the information is in description bar right down there including what I consider to be my favorite products from the ordinary these are the ones that I use personally and it's not a big whole twenty page list of them because I don't use them all but these are the ones that worked me and are sharing is in there because it works in terms of it gives a smoother appearance if I'm going to prep somebody's skin and I prepped with lots of different things as I've mentioned before in videos tight I'm tiny I prep with those I prep with Argireline too because the appearance underneath the eyes and the forehead are amazing the reviews on this has been spectacular and you can see why because it's seven dollars you get thirty millions of products one other thing to mention quickly before I go the products from ordinary can be used like boosters so you can get a few of them and just add a couple of drops to your skincare routine to boost the concentration of those ingredients to allow for those greens to work with your skincare it's entirely up to you but this is such a good program one that I've been wanting to make a video on for a while but there was stock issues as there have been constantly with the ordinary so information is down there for us and UK links all down there and again thank you for your comments on the brief video you're all lovely and it was incredibly appreciated thank you see you next time Friday bye bye 
here my okay sir today quickly as always I'm gonna be giving you my thoughts and swatches in real life plus swatches on screen on models of both white and black skin so that way you can see how they're gonna look on different skin tones because that's very important so is the hot lips by Charlotte Tilbury and these are the new liquid lipsticks from Charlotte Tilbury so let's just get right into it and we'll start with the first one and I'll give you a little bit of I'll give you it now actually these are different to most of the kind of liquid lipsticks on the market and that all of these shades by neutral base so there's a couple of reds but the rest are reading neutral shades we see a lot of Blues a lot of greens a lot of Gray's so this is quite the breakthrough in terms of these real neutral colors so the first time I'm gonna swatch in the background is put platinum blonde and on the screen now you'll see it both on two different skin tones of models so these go on actually they're a little bit more like a mousse than they are your traditional liquid lipstick so I'm getting a bit closer okay so that's the swatch of platinum blonde on my hand here so again really neutral shade okay so next we have what do we have too bad I'm bad that ain't me believe you me so again I really want to kind of get this out there that these almost truly are like a mousse as opposed to your genuine lipstick you know that liquid texture makes them a little bit more easier to upon the lip okay so here's our swatch in your life so you can see this is a really really great shape this actually tends to remind me of a shade that I would kind of gravitate towards more on women of sort of 30 to 60 because there's just something about this that would be so brightening to the skin okay so next we've got Charlotte darling now this just shine tillery's sicknesses shown so you can see here on different skin tones for models and also on the back of my hand so you can see it is a new lipstick color it is a baby pink but it also has a touch of brown you can see here okay we've got pinup pink necks which is a really beautiful beautiful color so let me show you in person you see that really beautiful pink color again really gray on 30 actually 22 67 0 this is such a great color okay so next we've got Donnie bird again it's watches on screen and you'll see in real life now this is more of your nude pink as opposed to a vibrant pink or a fuchsia pink this is your nude pink this is where an autofocus camera would be really good but no spend a few grand on a camera and you doesn't want to focus well okay so the next show you're gonna see on the screen is called rising star this is one of my favorite shows it's really beautiful and again this is the kind of shape that would look really really good on with a kind of with the dr. Peter Pan all right let me go close so there you go that perfect nudey pink with a little bit of peach in absolutely gorgeous so next we've got showgirl now we're moving into a slightly deeper category this is more of a berry shade those of you that like the berries this is the shade for you because it's got that real deep berry feel to it almost wine the next we've got dangerous liaison yes I wouldn't mind one of those this is thick vintage Valhalla this is your deepest wine color and it is gorgeous so you can see that real deep wine color it's not a red but it's that real burgundy touch to it gorgeous so next we've got a scream siren this is a true red and it is I'm not a fan of Reds I'll be honest with you I've never really liked red lip colors but this is beautiful - let's see in real life so it's that real way but it's not my blood red it's more gonna touch a fuchsia in it and it is absolutely stunning and I am really not a fan of Reds that's it there you go again things to consider all the links to the products are down there things to consider are these are more like a mousse and a liquid there is a longer drying down period of these beforehand but I quite like that because then I can just go the lip prints or anything else like that before it really dries down you can then put a lip gloss on it if you don't the matte look because these are matte lips but otherwise they're absolute spectacular in the fact that we have neutral shades I'm going to sneeze but excuse me the fact that we have neutral shades here makes it so good because there's so many liquid lips and so few neutral nude shades and this is why I think this range will do really well links down there I'll see y'all soon bye bye 
everyone okay so today is a makeup tip now when we think about makeup and it's transformative qualities we think contouring or maybe is buying a new color lipstick or blush or whatever it is we're always kind of looking to redefine our faces but sometimes it's the most simple things that can make the biggest difference and even though I spoke about this about 18 months ago maybe two years ago I really want to reiterate it before the next video which is the makeup trends that need to die in 2008 so I want to make this one because to me this is this tip has the biggest impact and even if you've heard it before please just stay tuned to the end because my videos are very short when you think about your eyebrows forget whether they're arched or thin or thick all you want to think about is how big the spaces between the nose so right here how big is that space the general rule the more space you have here the wider your nose will look in photographs and in person so the general rule now you have to use a bit of common sense here but the general rule is use your either ring finger or middle finger place it between your eyebrow okay now there should be the minimum amount of space that's there now try filling in your if your eyebrows kind of start war so here try filling them in so that they meet more with in line with your finger or your middle finger or even your thumb if you're a bit nervous however but try bringing them in sliding no monobrow no mano row but just try bringing them in because you'll notice that your nose will instantly thin out and that's the beauty of it it's just an optical illusion so generally speaking the more space we have here the wider our nose looks particularly in photographs so the narrow weak make it the better but again use common sense because there's going to be some people going you're talking about a model bro you're talking I'm not talking about anything I'm done talking about using your own common sense to bring in the bro ever Society if you need to to create the illusion of a thinner nose that way you don't have to contour your notion up to anything else just bringing it in a fraction can make a big difference my eyebrows if I bring them in just ever so slightly it makes a big difference to how I look I don't do it because well one I'm a boy - I don't care and three because I just don't care but you may care and this is a really quick tip so there you go Friday makeup trends that need to die 2008 it's a good one and I'll see you 2018 I'll see you all soon bye 
 userhead   us for to do   Booby you do do   4 soare deusel taster Aare   wii emo nos ek 4 tanker goon noster are you   Gaa N do do   Popolare   you do  
my guess it today nice and quick as usual with me we only be talking about ways to not set your concealer so how to set your concealer without using a powder because it's very very common a lot of women and men no discrimination don't like to use powder and leave their eyes and that's absolutely fine so let's talk about the ways you can go about doing that rule number one don't set your concealer now this I learned from Ray Morris who's an amazing makeup artist and with cream or wax concealers you can apply them then just go on in about an hour if you're lucky your concealers going to start to crease with a wax or a cream you can just smooth it back into place if you don't mind retouching up consistently throughout the day then using that technique will work for you great and it does give the illusion of a more beautiful under eye area because there is no powder and you're just smoothing back in particularly with a wax based concealer now all consumers everything else I mentioned are in the description bar below the second one is use a concealer that doesn't require setting so the new Bobby Brown concealer which is the instant full coverage concealer this does not require setting with powder and it truly lives up to that claim under the eyes or around the mouth I've already done a video on it but it's an incredible one that doesn't require setting for our the next one is to use a concealer that is not prone to creasing so the Bobbi Brown one the one that I tend to favor is the NARS radiant creamy concealer that's a very very good concealer that is prone to that is not prone to creasing it still can but it's the least problematic of concealers so that's a great one to try the other one you can do is to take a little sponge take a setting spray so skin today is something like that whichever your favorite is and then just give it a little spritz knock it all off wait for it to absorb into the sponge and then go under the I can tap around the area of the concealer that will set the concealer without using a powder which is wonderful the other thing you can do is use your standard face primer apply this all over the face but pay particular attention - underneath the eyes apply a concealer then apply this spritz technique and go over it and finally and this one's really really good use an eye primer so decay one works really well as does the Natasha ten only one but the Natasha - another one is a colored one so you need to bear that in mind but you're going to put concealer over anyway so it's going to cover it by using an under by using a eyeshadow primer apply underneath the eye area where the concealer is going to go apply the concealer on top and they will hold the concealer in place for an incredible amount of time this in really really hot weather or weather where I know there's going to be issues what I tend to do is I use a setting spray all over the face first downplay foundation then I set again go and do the rest then I set again then I apply a eyeshadow primer underneath the eyes apply concealer over it then I set again and that's how to really get around it but there you go so the tips are not apply anything and then just smooth it out as the day goes on user concealer that doesn't crease or doesn't need to be set which is the bobbi brown one use of primer for the face and apply texture underneath the eyes or use a setting spray spritz onto a sponge and Pat it into place and for the final one using eyeshadow primer underneath the eyes then apply concealer over it and if you really want to be amazing apply a tiny bit of the setting spray on a sponge underneath that area that is my tips for not setting your concealer with powder if you have any more that I don't know about leave them in the description bar below of the comment section below that would be amazing and again that's it nice and short and I'll see you soon bye bye oh and let me know in the comments section what videos you'd like me to make there you go bye bye 
everyone okay so today I'm gonna be showing you the one to ten method and this is a method that's often taught in makeup schools so I thought it'd be interesting to show you what you want to do is start with your liquid cream or whatever foundation you're using and apply it to the center of the face this is zone one you want to create most of the coverage in this area so you can see I'm stippling it around with my foundation brush now you want to stay in zone one to begin with and really build coverage in the center of the face now you're gonna move on to zones two to ten which means you're going to start to move the product from the center of the face out out towards the hairline out towards the outer portion of the face you're doing this without adding more product this will give the skin the coverage you need where you need it but also allow it to look sheer and beautiful on the rest of the face where less coverage is needed and this is why it's often taught in schools because it works beautifully to create a more beautiful natural look on the skin without overloading it with product so you're just moving the product back from the center area and you can use as much foundation as is necessary in zone one powder to set once you've set the makeup you then just apply a little bit of color because otherwise with just foundation we all tend to look a bit sickly and that will complete the tutorial let me know if you've heard of this technique before leave it in the comment section and all links and products are in the description bar thank you bye bye 
everyone okay so today is the best time the Quick Pick had a nosebleed it's kind of live best exfoliants for all skin types including acne and aging of 2017 so I've got morning flaming these are my favorites and I will also tell you which ones that I actually use so the first one that's really good is by NeoStrata and it's called lotion plus is the step up 15% alpha hydroxy acid don't bother getting this if you have never exploded before it's very strong 15% is pretty high so bear that in mind let's talk about the affordable ones the ordinary whether it's the lactic acid at 5% whether it's the 10% whether it's the salicylic acid which you only get 50 mils of salicylic acid the rest you get 30 or whether it is the gigantic 7% glycolic acid they're all good they all work incredibly well and the ordinary are within most people's budget so all that information is down there they're really really good so I highly recommend them next is one that I use and this is the 2% lotion by Paula's Choice this is this acetic acid I prefer the lotion they do a liquid but it's quite oily so I tend to use out at night if I use it at all I prefer the lotion and also I use the 8% Paula's Choice alpha hydroxy acid I do half a pump of each so I've got both exfoliation on the service and exfoliation in the pore for those of you with redness 1% BHA from Paula's Choice is a really good product one combining both if it's within budget is the drunk elephant in 12% BHA and 2 percent 12 percent AJ and 2 percent PHA this will exfoliate the surface and the pore Barnack lotion which is a PHA that's 15 that's pretty gentle for most people's skins so that's a good one and also the ordinary do a 30 percent alpha hydroxy and better hydroxy acid peel you can use it once a week twice at most but once is really pretty much it drunk elephant also do one but the polar but the order one is so much cheaper but I like both the formula wise I prefer drunk elephant but the results are the same all the information is down there and that is the best exfoliant 2017 see you soon bye bye

heroin okay so this is a video I thought I would never make one of the best bits of advice that I ever heard or read was it's never too late to mind your own business and that's how I truly feel about almost everything that doesn't concern me mind your business way and that's how I feel what I dislike is public floggings I don't enjoy that I don't like reading about it or witnessing it I don't watch the news I don't want to hear anything awful and bad because it makes me sad and I don't want to be sad you know there are things in my life that make me sad I don't need more so that's how I feel my business mind your business but the stuff that's happening at the moment I absolutely understand the concerns and I'm going to try and address them as best I can and I'm going to miss stuff out and that's just the nature of being human so I understand concerns but the way that some people are going about it and trying to make a penny off of somebody else's misery is is very unpleasant so I want to try and address it how I feel that things should be just because the amount of messages I have received about these products is ridiculous now I know about food I don't really know about supplements so I can't give you a scientific explanation to things because I don't know about it it's that simple I don't know but I want to just try and talk about it from my perspective so let's just talk about some of the things okay first of all the moment I heard that it was a supplement I was very very surprised and I was very I was pretty like that's a brave thing to do because it is a supplement right it's not something you put on your face and oftentimes when you work in with the laboratory the testing is so incredibly vigorous and so expensive trust me on that so when I heard it was a supplement I was thinking oh okay it's very brave and that's what I thought of it didn't think anything else so first of all will I try it no I won't and this is why nothing to do with anything about the product is that it doesn't state it's icy friendly now I have something called painful bladder syndrome which is very depressing and it means that little Wayne down there gets very very upset inside little Wayne gets very upset and if anything has too much acidity in it or there's anything I have to look for products that say I see friendly because they're very low in acid and that means that my body can tolerate it so I don't have to go to the bathroom or need to go to the bathroom 50 times a day it's no fun I talk poor little thing so that's why I won't be trying to now they might be icy friendly it's just as not listed at the moment so I don't know so that's my only reason and it's just because of him that I'm not going to try them now clinically proven this is something that I'm getting a lot of right it means nothing and there's nothing wrong with using that term either it's perfectly fine and legal to use it it's a meaningless term it's like dermatologist tested right dermatologist says it doesn't mean anything it means that a dermatologist tested it they make it painted it they may have said this is the biggest heap of I've ever used but they tested it so his dermatologist tested right it's just a term it doesn't really mean anything and maybe there are clinical clinical trials of done or maybe there is clinical proof I couldn't see it on the website but that doesn't mean it hasn't been done or that it won't be published or produced for all of you to peruse I don't know at the moment and we're going to be talking about this a lot that's the beauty of hindsight okay so again not a scientist so lamento now I tried supplement oh for home because it can help sometimes particularly with men with waterworks issues now didn't work for me so you know sauce just wasn't for me now if you go on to drugs calm or anything like that there's absolutely a concern about whether or not so lamento can make contraception less effective you know therefore increasing your chances of pregnancy now it absolutely says it can doesn't say it does it says it can but there are things you also we also need to know such as or what percentage is there a percentage so is it one 100 milligrams or a thousand or twenty thousand or sixty that stuff that you need to know but people are saying it will cause pregnancy if you take this it doesn't say that it says it can cause and yes your concerns are very very valid but again this is information that just needs to be shared and now I don't know what percentage or if there is a percentage who knows I don't know yet nor do you were just waiting to see and also if supplemental is combined with all the other ingredients in that product does that have a synergistic effect so what it doesn't make it less likely that there'll be complication with pregnancy or more increased response who knows we just don't know yet once again that's the benefit of hindsight now would it have been better if all of these questions and things have been answered before absolutely of course and that's the problem with hindsight of course it would have but it wasn't and yes it's it's not amazing but so what you bought the product I get it and you're concerned about taking it because of the things that have been mentioned about it so don't take it at this moment just wait until your concerns have been answered she's already said that she's gonna answer them and I'm sure she will and I'm sure she'll do it as best she can and that's all we can ask for again yes of course it would have been better to have it first but we didn't so what can you do you can either hold off until you have this information you could visit your doctor and ask them or you could return in I'm sure you'll get a refund but let's just see okay let's just just wait and see cuz we just don't know at the moment and your concerns about any and all of this are very very valid and of course there is all the information about what I left a valid comment and now I'm blocked in all of this let me try and give you my perspective they are blocking and things like that sometimes I get very very valid questions that are asked to me and they can but the question is valid but the way it's put is so unpleasant and it's so attacking and aggressive and ugly block is very easy to do that it's not an e it's actually is a very easy thing to block someone but you don't want to do it you don't a block anybody now I don't know why she got people I don't care why because it's not my business but from my perspective of somebody on YouTube it is so awful the way that you can be crucified over things and again we're always going to be keep coming back to this hindsight thing of course we should have had all the information available first but you didn't so what can you do that's the thing but writing aggressive messages isn't gonna make it better is only going to antagonize an upset and cause problems return it or wait for the information to become available yes final time of course it should have been first but it wasn't so let's just see what comes up and that's really my thoughts on it I can't use it personally because of the issues with little Wayne and that's just the way it is would I use it otherwise well I'm not at any risk of pregnancy so yes I would and talking of little Wayne he's been operating water for many many years so the chance of pregnancy there is slim to none that's what I can tell you I have never met tatty I have never communicated with her ever not once and we coexist in the same universe doing around about the same thing hers is the complete antithesis of mine right so my review will be 30 seconds gone and hers is a much longer take on something and we both deserve to be in the same universe and do the same things and your concerns are very very valid and I respect them and I believe they should be answered but a public flogging before you have the information isn't nice and isn't Ness Cerrie and everybody is trying to get on board and they're going to write mean things that I'm going to say mean things then they gotta fill mean things and they're going to get all that information from the internet because the internet never lies and so let's just wait for the information and I will probably never ever do a follow-up to this because we're going to go back to the same thing which is that it's never too late to mind your own business and that's how I feel I don't know Tati but she comes across as very nice to me I don't know her but let's just wait and see that's how I feel about the subject don't take them if you're worried wait for the information or speak to your doctor or return them however you want to go about it but let's just wait and see wait for the information before we start attacking I know you have concerns and your concerns are valid and they need to be answered but there are ways of doing it and we can all be kind and nice to each other now I'm not going to block or disable any comments in this video but I will ask you to be nice not just to me but be respectful to each other and the way that we ask and say things because in real life is unlikely that somebody would be screaming in your face about things and that's how we should be on comments we're just a reflection of ourselves on there so please be nice to each other and that's really all I'm going to say on the subject it's a subject I know nothing about so I can't give you a scientific approach I can't say this ingredient works I mean if you google vitamin C I mean Vinnie bean see right there are people telling you that you can be taking 20 grams a day about stuff right now chances are that will give you incredible loose stools but if you google Bittman C it will give you a whole host of miserable symptoms like bleeding when you urinating right from the lemon see it's like almost soul benign but you still listed there because they have to do it they have to list it because somebody somewhere may have blade we don't know how much they took or what levels because none of that stuff is actually mentioned when it says side effects bla ba ba ba ba didn't say how much they took I mean was it like a little nail awful or was it a big bucket full of the stuff that they were chugging down that's the stuff that we need to know but what we do is we see we see now can cause bleeding so we say this can cause bleeding but we don't have all the information we just need to wait for the information so please please be nice to each other on here and in real life okay because I just I might just be because I'm getting old but I really think it doesn't hurt to be nice that's how I feel if you are nice to me I will be really nice to you back and if you are mean to me I don't like you and I don't want to not like anyone I want friends I want people to like me and I want to be liked and I want to like you so just be good to each other okay that's the end of it bye 
here on ok so welcome to the best of beauty Tuesday so I thought to take the Tuesday's to go through some of the best products that I have in front of me so let's just make us that up because that's what I like to do the first two are really large and they are natasha de Nonna and these are the diamond and blush palettes and these are absolutely stunning so the first pallet is palette number two which is called citrus so let's get a close-up for you you can have a look so basically what you're getting here is blushes highlighters and that kind of stuff the top section here these are your they're more a cream to powder formulation and they are incredibly dreamy like you have no idea how dreamy these are they're just so so beautiful and on the bottom you've got the more of your standard powder texture here so I'm just going to try and swatch these but they're not going to show up that great just because of the lighting issues that we've got going on here yeah they're not really going to show up but I promise you these are absolutely Stein so that's a citrus and let me show you the other one which is called this is called Daraa oh no here it is again absolutely beautiful the textures of these see you're not really gonna see but oh it's like it's like diamonds it is so beautifully delicious let me show you this color here on my little little finger it is so beautiful and they just blend really really lovely so it is absolutely so speaking of gorgeous things mentioned it on my second channel this is the brightening youth glow this is by Charlotte Tilbury and it's her new primer now I've got this on here and I'll talk about what's on my skin in a minute an incredibly beautiful brightening think the more korea-based primers now this is truly truly great the one thing to mention over this other than the fact that I absolutely love it the probably the sixth or seventh ingredient in this is alcohol which is quite strange now I no longer dislike alcohol the way that I used to and this works beautifully but I want to bear that in mind for some of the people either that are sensitive this is a really good product but you get almost nothing which is such a shame is the Becca eye brightening setting powder so is this tiny little pot that you only get 2.7 grams of product in which is just nothing but it is absolutely beautiful it gives a brightening effect underneath the eyes now some women of color have said it's perfectly fine as some have said it's a little bit actually so you need to bear that in mind if your deeper skin tone this is a great product by beauty pie it's called the one powder you get eight grams of product in this and it is a near identical match to the NARS one and you'll know the one I mean it is incredibly flattering it is completely translucent and for the price of this now we're duta fine you need to be a member which is ten pounds a month and then you get things at cost value so bear that in mind next is this gorgeous palette from wrodar and this each contains 2.5 grams of product there's eight shades in here and you can see these are all beautiful neutral shades used on the face or eyes depending on how you want them blusher bronzers contouring highlighters pigmentation I'll show you on that medal I'm a cute little fingers here really really nice a beautiful palette rose oil is very similar in my mind to hourglass that very little wrong speaking of our bus these are their new highlighter sticks now these there is I said it really eloquently before the hourglass don't make shite they just make really good products so this is I mean look at that that is just a little bit of heaven I can see a bit of stroking in the background on that side I'm sorry about that I'll have to sort it so this shake here that you're gonna see is called bronze flash much much more suited to those of you with deeper complexions I mean look at that color gorgeous I'm going to show you just a couple more because everyone and their mother has been reviewing these so I'm just gonna rub this one this is called rose gold so you can kind of see that they're probably not too good you know I've even got the ISO on this on auto and there's still a bit problematic that strobing is getting on my tits I'm going to change that in just a second and look and one day you can't see it's gorgeous that one that's the invisible one called pink flash nothing to say about these negative they go on like a cream they end up like a powder and they are just truly outrageous okay it doesn't seem to be strobing see there's a problem with this camera it autofocuses really beautifully but there's this strobing issue is just in bothersome to me I'm constantly having to piss around with it this is a great powder soothly collect from you so long this is a great peddit now the pink one is the one that I use underneath the eyes and things like that on the face ball highlighting is selling it's a great powder they come other shades as well but I use the pink one pretty much exclusively and I've got a few other bits and pieces here by you son Ron talked about this primer before but it is amazing it is 30 mils and it is called the - Shekhar a primer and it is absolutely stunning and it comes in this gorgeous clear glass and it's got sparkles of gold in it it is absolutely outrageous I love these two Chicago shot so I'm just gonna put a bit of this on the back of my hand and this is a gorgeous color which is yet to be do you know who knows what color is it's bloody pink that's what color is and it is gorgeous under over foundation under is just off the skin is just so gorgeous and glowing with this also color correctors now these are like my fifth set of these and this is the two shiplap ones but you've got your green you've got your sort of mode you've got your yellow you've got you just gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous to subtract or wonderful now this is absolutely amazing let me grab it now come on this is nice and this is their new raideen a chiral radiant long wear foundation now 30 mils comes with a pump it is everything you could ever want in a foundation I set you earlier on what forgot on my skin I've got on this and I've got on this it is so so good yes it gives you long wear it comes in a mammoth mammoth shade range and look at this color here color is called Molly and this color is the deepest richest foundation and it has the most wonderful undertone to it for those of you with richer skin tones I mean this is beautiful I mean granted it's true that often times with deeper skin tones one foundation isn't enough and you need to have a couple of shades in order to balance out and bring out the brightness in the skin but the shade range for nos is beautiful and this foundation is truly what a liquid foundation in 2018 should be it is absolutely glorious I am over the moon with it and you'll see it in another tutorial with an application and finally a very expensive mascara by Terry and this is go great mascara so there's the wand looking fabulous and then you just twist and it turns into a liquid a wand so you can get two different effects this is absolutely great truly really expensive mascara so you need to bear that in mind but otherwise it's spot-on and there you go that's my best beauty bits I'm just checking and looking around see if there's anything else that is in front of me then I might've miss but I don't believe so that's it there you go how delicious is all of that I'd say but it's not stripping no it's not I'd say that's very very delicious so there you go that's my box that's my review and I'll see you all soon bye-bye 
everyone okay so today I'm going to give you five tips on how to say shine through we've all been there you do you mean help inserting me to say that you are looking delicious thirty minutes later you're like a beacon of light just beckoning the ship in we've all been there so in this video I'll give you five tips on how to say shine through so let's make a star tip number one and this is probably the most important tip is to use a finishing spray a true finishing spray will hold your makeup in place all day long as you look at delicious in the morning as you do an evening this is very very important they're not all setting sprays and finishing sprays are created equally and that's the problem most on the market straight lines they remove the powder residues but they do not hold the makeup in place which is why we're talking about skin de- for almost a decade now and wife the one I recommend now because we're talking about shine and oil control the one that I'm going to recommend is in the Navy and this is the finishing spray in the oil control formula and this is incredibly important because this control shine and this video is about shine we don't want shiny skin so this is the formula now what's really really good about using a finishing spray other than the fact that it will hold your makeup in place is that the shine control or actually slow the process of oil coming through which means your skin is going to be less shiny hallelujah and that is what we want but we also want to make sure that it's going to stay for morning tonight and that's what a true finishing spray does it holds the main ship in place and when the oil control you're getting that you know that beautiful effect the skin but with out the shine it's going to control the shine and that's so important again with any finishing spray you just shake the bottle and you apply it in a cross and then an air and that is all you do it is that simple and that will hold the makeup in place and control shine throughout the day okay so tip number two very very important and so technically is on it's a huh load up your powder puffs with powder and load it up and press and roll all over your face this pressing and rolling moment will seal in your makeup in the foundation the powder the powder will seal it in creating a really fun grip on the skin this will make your face less shiny as the day goes on which is really really good but it holds everything in place which is a wonderful wonderful things again you're doing a pressing and rolling motion really really important okay so the tip number three is to use a primer manner whether you use your standard primer or anyone any primer you want it's good because primer adheres to the skin and that's really what we want with makeup is free to hear to the skin and stick to the skin that way we're just sharing more longevity now you can use your standard primer or you want absolutely great you can also use a setting spray or a finishing spray primer again skin danava do one they do the all control version this is about oil and shine so you can do that and the exact same prince pores you just spray wait and then apply your foundation over and you get that longevity but regardless you can use a spring you can use a cream a liquid whatever you want the prime it is great for control and shine tip number four use powder this is a responding strange way of doing it you want to take a pressed powder and apply it in the areas where you are going to get most shiny so most people it would be say the t-zone area so you apply your powder in that t-zone area and you apply it heavily in that area then you take in really big brush and you shoeshine off all that excess powder then you do the same process two or three times by applying the powder heavily and then really shoe-shining it off you only saw amazing amazing or two things actually it's going to give you a beautiful picture in photos but it really ensure that you say shine-free okay so tip number five actually I think I've got six tips but tip number five and this is to use a little trying to sponge wrap it in a tissue and after you've done your foundation for anything else press it onto the skin this will pick up all the oils and excess from the foundation drawing them out leaving behind the pigment that means that your foundation is going to get less oily as the day goes on this is a really cool tip and actually tip number six and this is one you can do which is a layering process so what you can do is if you really do get ultra shiny is you can start the layer so you apply your primer then what you want to do is take your finishing spray give your phase a quick spritz then apply your foundation when your foundation is done then it's ripped again and by doing this process over throughout your makeup application you are ensuring lots and lots of layers of finishing spray by being applied and that are going to control the shine in oil throughout the day so you're really getting that kind of extra ensuring that everything is going to stay in place and everything is going to remain shine free and I actually believe is why I'm just going to double check with ya I thought as much and the oil control formula actually makes pores look smaller which is a wonderful wonderful thing so there you go you've actually got six tips I think that's pretty good it is go me I think so so all the information is in the description bar and cinder a year are having itself right now and you get 20% off plus two free travel sprays and free shipping you're welcome there you go all the information although now in the description bar let me know in a comment section your favorite ways of reducing shine on the skin let me know they are because I don't know them and I'll see you all soon 
everyone ID so this video is about the Anasazi of Beverly Hills these subculture palate and the reason I'm making this video I chose to have this palette for southern eight days now and the reason I'm making this video is because I've been listening and reading all the reviews and watching them and today I saw something on Instagram and it just drove me crazy and it was somebody with their brush in the product and they were really grinding it right and there is probably going everywhere so I want to give you make this video and give you my thoughts on it now as you know Unseld gia has never wanted me to anything they never paid me to say anything I can say whatever I choose and I always do now I use a massage this products I use all their brows because they're the best and that's just the way it is so most people know that when it comes to our sorrows the new side shadows you know the double refills they're amazing and they're wonderful now when I got this palette my very first thought was when I started to look at it was and swatched it was all these are pure press pigments and what I mean by that is it is literally a pure pigment press and that's my belief right now they've not confirmed that to me because I haven't reached out to them but as soon as I touched it the amount of pigment that is released from the product gives me the give me the I believe it is a pure cracked and matte shade in general are notorious with fallout and they just saw some more than others now there's no point in pretending that this pipe does not produce fallout because it does but I want you to take it a look at this because I'm going to talk you through it so here you go you can see the palette what I'm going to do is I'm going to swirl my brush around and around the product and you're going to see the powder fly everywhere and just be generally irritating right so you can see it absolutely releases demon especially if you swore your brush round which is what waiting all the time on Instagram so let's look at another palette this product is by Natasha de Nona let's take a look so you can see whether my brush right saying man I'm using my brushes which are really soft guess what products going everywhere let's try the Charlotte Tilbury ones now these ones are predominantly shimma shimma shimma shimma even though she tends to be packed much better they produce less fallout but they're still going to produce swallow as you can see product is still coming off if you're going to go like bit like you're masturbating feverishly then product is going to get released and that's just the way it is now even with a light touch as you can see here with this pallet product is getting released but this brings me back to my first point which was these are pure pressed payment they are going to release product if you buy this on the theory that that is what they are then you will like this palette because truly pigmentation wise is probably the strongest you're going to get from a matte eyeshadow but you know without actually on say getting a loose pigment because they are so intense that's why their actual pigment they are intent and they are going to release product so I hope that kind of sums up and I hope that they gives you an idea of what I feel about the part I think it's a really good product yes it releases product and yes that's going to be problematic for some people but grinding away a product is just absolute craziness and watching it on Instagram is just insane of a whole day so I go again you know any product will do that but they let me know what your thoughts are on this palette generally speaking I think it's a really good product but matte shades in general release product and these release product absolutely more so than other palettes but all matte eyeshadows will release product if you grinded them no matter how soft the brushes if you're going to do that you're going to release product but if you're looking for that kind of intensity then you've got it - all my eyeshadows are problematic when blending they just don't blend it beautifully and shimmer shade is there's more emollients in them with math as you can tell by the name the emollients have been removed leaving you with a very intense treatment that has fall out if you struggle with fall out below your foundation there's a reroute remedy do your Onix first clean it up and then apply the rest of your makeup no not your thoughts on this palette I think it's a really nice palette I don't care what anyone else says on Instagram I know that it's for that and the truth be told this brush really doesn't bomb in there because this brush is a stiff brush it's quite a harsh brush but what can I say I don't mind it I don't hate it and I don't care if it doesn't get a million views this is my sauce there you go only know you think right down there in fiction bar I see y'all soon below

here in my case it today I'm going to be showing you the art of naked makeup invisible makeup social skin that looks really really good there are lots of ways of going about this but I think the easiest way because you could just apply this into moisturizer and then go in and spend the next hour with a strong concealer covering up and retouching things but the problem with that is it doesn't get the illusion of a skin that has dimension and you know because we've got lots of things going on in our skin so in this video I'm going to go to you through how to go about it we're going to be doing a lot of contouring and highlighting but as you can see you won't see it and it's going to look like skin that looks real there's gonna be a glow to it it's gonna be absolutely beautiful so this means that okay so the first thing we're going to do is heavily moisturize the skin now you want to use a lot of moisturizer with this because you're going to be using heavy duty products so use more than you think you actually need so I'm applying the moisturizer all over the skin next I'm applying facial oil and all the links the products used are in the description bar I'm blending the oil all over this moisturizer again you're going to be using heavy duty products next I'm going to start with the light this is the areas I want light to be in the face I'm using a cream concealer and applying these to the areas that I want to bring forward so these are the areas I want to stand out more so I'm just starting this across the face and then blending it in but I'm blending it before we go in and blend it with foundation I'm pre blending it as you can see so next we're going to add the dimension in forget about trying to create cheekbones place the darker color where you want to add dimension to the face so these are the areas that are best suited on my face I put quite a high forehead and then blend them in with your fingers it doesn't matter if it looks muddy because you can see from the beginning it's not going to end up that way and yes this does take some skill and practice but when you get it you can do it really quickly next foundation you're going to stipple so watch what I'm doing with the foundation I'm pressing it into the skin and this is a very light application of foundation because we've got color on our face we using this to bring all three colors together so press and stipple don't swirl the brush in order to create big sort of blending motions just press and stipple it into the skin and you can see it all disappearing and you can see the skin taking on this incredible lifelike effect where it looks incredibly flawless and that's the beauty of this technique because the concealer so strong the foundation so light the whole thing comes together in this beautiful application next I'm going in with my finger and a touch of foundation on the areas where a brush would be slightly too big so around the eyes and also the bridge of the nose where the contouring was so you can get right in next I'm applying a liquid highlighter to the high points of the face these are the areas that I would like a little bit more shine to so you can see where I'm donning them and then I'm just gonna blend them in with my fingers no brush required at least not yet but you can use your fingers or a brush whatever works for you you just tap and press these areas in these areas again we want to stand forward so when the light hits them you've got this beautiful kind of glow and I've also put a touch of highlighter on the outside corner of the nose next I'm going in with a lip stick and I'm applying this as a blusher absolutely nothing wrong with losing using lipstick perfectly fine now I'm going to blend this in with my brush in that same stippling motion I'm not swirling it I'm pushing it into the skin so that everything becomes one I'm going to apply a touch of it also to the forehead because I think it looks so pretty and I'm a 90's boy and that's what we did in the 90s we applied a bit of blusher bronzer not so much back then so you're going to press and push that into the skin see gorgeous now all you're going to do is absorb the excess oils with the tissue and I'm just patting and pressing this all over the face this is going to draw out any of the excess oils from the moisturizer the oil the foundation the concealer so that when we powder is going to go on beautifully and it's going to retain that look of real skin because we're getting rid of a lot of that stuff next time padding the areas where I didn't apply highlighter so I'm not going to powder down the center of my nose because I've applied highlighter there so crowd oohing really more the t-zone - the nose any areas where I didn't apply that highlight because I want that shine and you can see it here under the eyes it looks really pretty now because we've done all this I'm going to add back a couple of beauty spots that mist out without the foundation kind of covered and then I'm going to apply some really light splattering of freckles because I've got a few across my nose so I'm just gonna blend these in this gives the realistic appearance of skin and that pretty much is it now I know I made it look simple and it does require practice but I promise if you do this you'll look fantastic thanks so much bye-bye 
Erewhon okay so today I'm going to be talking you through how to match your foundation there's lots of different ways so let's make a start first one obvious one which is swiping from jawline to neck this works great providing that your neck and your face match which often times they don't because the net can be lighter so if your neck is lighter and you're going to do it this way then match it to the color of your face and use a bronzer to bring up the neck cut up so that the to match it's easier you really don't want to try and lighten the face because it's just it can be problematic he can make look ill or ghastly or actually depending on your skin tone so it's not the best idea the next way to test it is to test a stripe on your forehead this works best for women with really good medium skin tones or moving on to the Tanner spectrum because oftentimes the face gets a lot of light with the Sun and especially with medium to tan skin tones this is the area that tends to bronze up the most so testing it on your forehead is a great option again if your neck is lighter then you need to bring a bronzer down or your foundation but bronzer really to balance the two eye because your face and body shouldn't know each other they shouldn't be this floating entity which is very important the next step if you're going to expose this part of your chest and a lot of time with women's clothing this part is always always sort of on show if that's the case then you want to match your face to your chest and this is the easiest way just put a couple of stripes of foundation there find the one that matches best then apply that shade to your face and then you can warm up the neck with a bronzer because if generally speaking if you were to do this and put your chin to your shoulder then your forehead your chin and your shoulders should all be the same color but this way is the most reliable way if you're going to be exposing this part which is almost certainly going to be darker than your face so apply that foundation to your face apply it to you place and bronzer to neck so that the whole things balances out now women of color there are often times with color there can be something which is called facial masking which is where there is more than one color going on in any given time on the face which also is what makes it look quite beautiful the way to go about this first of all women of color tend to do better foundation striping across the cheek not the jawline or the neck so across the cheek the other way to go about it is to accept the fact that there may be more than one color going on and to use two shades of foundation one that matches the slightly deeper shade on the face and one which tends to be the interior which is the brighter shade and notice that I said there were brighter not lighter you want to with ebony skin tones you want to bring out the brightness of the skin because it's such a glorious skin tone that you want to bring life and brightness to that place using a pressed powder or loose powder that's like a burnt orange or something like that blusher wise tajmahal by nose is the most exquisite blusher on deep skin tones on everyone else it looks horrific because it's like this bronzy it's like this burn orange with a bit of gold in but on women of color it is gorgeous so when you're dealing with foundation shades again if you've got this two-tone look going on on your face don't worry about it you may need two shades of foundation one that matches the deepest shade and one that's going to bring out the brightness of your face and then match it with a gorgeous loose or pressed powder that has a burnt orange undertone to it and that's the ways of testing so to recap jaw to neck cross the forehead women of color three strokes across the face and or my favorite matching the chest if this area is going to be exposed depending on your clothing you may need to buy more than one foundation it's better be honest about the situation rather than just say you only need one that's it and again to just further emphasize the point if you are earning between a lighter or a darker shade always go slightly darker because lightening the skin can cause a lot of problems I can make genuinely quite unwell when you're not so there you go that's my tips thank you for watching and I'll see you all soon comments are there any links for best foundations see you soon bye bye 
everyone okay so today I'm going to be talking through how to find out your skin type because we've got the oily dry the combination but how do we really know what skin type we truly have because we apply so much and then we apply makeup over and so sometimes it's hard to know so here we go first thing you need to do is just wash your face use whatever cleanser you're using if you're going to be continuously using that cleanser but it's preferable to use one that is gentle on the skin and doesn't strip it too much wash your face towel dry it off gently then we do nothing else for 30 minutes 34 minutes so do this at night or the day whatever once you've done that then go and look at your skin in the mirror if your skin appears shiny and predominately soft congratulations you have oily skin and that is the best way of finding out if after 30 minutes your face does not appear shiny at all but feels dry to the touch or is very very flat congratulations you have dry skin and if your skin appears shiny in some places and dry or matte in the others then you have combination skin however if your skin appears shiny but feels very very dry to the touch very very dry there is high probability that you have dehydrated skin or basically that the skin barrier has been compromised I myself suffer from that or have suffered from that numerous times over the years over and over again it is a peculiar condition that absolutely can improve but requires different methods now in the description bar below I will list all the products that are really really good hopefully in different price ranges as well for oily skin combination skin and skin barrier damaged in so dehydrated skin and stuff like that if your skin after 30 min appears moderately reflected and is soft and gorgeous to the touch then you are one of the lucky few that has normal skin I've only ever come across a normal skin once or twice madly my friend sometimes in this video she is an example of normal skin her skin is perfectly normal it is never oily or dry she is a medical mystery but that's how you do it wash your face leave it for 30 minutes and check if it's oily and shiny oily skin if it is rough matte or flat looking it is dry skin if it's combination of the two oiling in some and not in others then you have combination skin and if it feels rough to the touch and is overly shiny on top of that then you probably have dehydrated skin or damage the skin barrier all the information in the description below it is short and sweet but there's no point going on about subject like this just wash your face then go in check in 30 minutes time best advice I promise thanks so much and I'll see y'all soon bye bye 
everyone look at my role today the same calls this is a foundation issue that no one seems to really talk about but is is actually incredibly accurate and important now foundation you can do wonderful things that can even on your skin tone it can make your skin it more vibrant more youthful more jewy more right - more beautiful it can do amazing things but every foundation that I've ever tested what I want you to do is just try it yourself draw a line down the center of your face and apply foundation just to one side you'll notice that this side looks more beautiful it looks more even more radiant the pores may look smaller everything about it looks more beautiful but this side will always look older then the side without any foundation I don't know why that is and I really don't know why that is but the side of the foundation will always look old it will always emphasize more wrinkles now I don't know in this day and age with so much technology I don't know why that is but the side without any foundation will always look younger when I say younger I'm just referring to wrinkles it is absolutely true that the psychic foundation will look better because it will look more beautiful more even toned you know all the things I've said there's absolutely no doubt that that's I will look more perfected and beautiful but the side with a foundation will look younger in terms of wrinkles and that is something that no one ever talks about because we here the foundation right this foundation bounces out light from a from the wrinkles now I've got a lot of foundations not one of them is ever bounced out a single particle light from a wrinkle on my face ever and I've got wrinkles and none of them have bounced light out and I would love them two years ago when Prescriptives around they came out with this kind of light reflecting technology and their parents I literally and I have no money at the time right nothing I saved up for that powder and I've got it and I applied it and it looked like shimmery powder you did backside off because I could see the light because it's real shiny but it didn't make any single wrinkle on my face appear less and it's it's naughty to say that unless there really is a formula that truly can make your skin appear less wrinkled and I've yet to find one because foundation on skin does tend to make the face look more wrinkled you will have more beautiful skin though it will have more even and more gorgeous and less pores and brighter more vibrant but it will look more wrinkled and don't know why that is I wish it wasn't but if you know let me know in the comment section because or if you know of a foundation that truly does make wrinkles look less than they are then aside without please let me know because I will be all over it I promise I thank you and I'll see you soon bye 
everyone okay today video peeing on a concealer that claims to not need setting you know means assessing powder although you could but you don't need to so it's quite high claims from a company that's that it was making a concealer with out the need to set because oftentimes we seller considers have doesn't become you know terribly bothersome or just generally live so this is a great product and when I first got this and I bought a whole load of them I bought it and instantly regretted it because it just it came out so dry and I figured it's just come out and smooth on then like Bernard radiant creamy concealer which is such a great concealer and it didn't it came out on much more dry if you're familiar with Laura Mercier your camouflage this is like a liquid version of that so I'm actually going to show you I'm going to use a warm beige and it's by Bobbi Brown and it's the instant full cover concealer now this claims it can be used all over the face and underneath the eyes now the one thing I will say on the face is it's truly phenomenal and it can cover a huge amount with such a tiny little drop underneath the Isaac does work incredibly well but I think I might say to a but as with most things that make up it does tend to work match up on younger tighter firmer skin but it tries on my mother today and she actually it did look really really good and she sort of 64 years old so that is an indication that it can and does work so let me get a little bit closer you can see the one and it doesn't actually look like it comes out with a lot of product which is kind of a good thing because you're not going to be wasting you know tons and tons of product and what we kind of do is you just sort of dot it rather than doing this whole swiping motion and then you kind of Pat and press it in and you can see that it doesn't really move so when you put it is where it's going to stay now an off the of the packing use for this would be that this would make an absolutely phenomenal I primer because it would cover discoloration on the lid which something for my tab I know I do so I'm just dotting I've done did a bit harder a bit more in this area and then I'm just going to kind of Pat it and kind of do it in place another thing to really really like concealer because I'm not a massive fan of um you know white underneath the eye as far as the claims go that it doesn't need setting that is kind of true it really doesn't need a huge amount of setting but a tiny tiny fraction of powder really does ensure longevity in this product again I'm giving this a really good review because it's really quite unique in the coverage of it the weight comes out that kind of thick heavy but then it just docked everywhere you're not getting his doodles of our product coming out I'm just going to use this I can't live to  I'm going to use cold sand and I'm just going to kind of do just a couple of dots along the cheekbone area just as a former highlight because often those are we use highlighter we always think going something shimmery but we go anything light is going to reflect which is good so you can see it really does blend and I'm blending this over my standard mineral makeup that I wear when I fill the one I've got on the moment medium beige by bare minerals and that's the the matte version so you can see it does look pretty good it doesn't necessarily is it going to go into lines wrinkled everything goes into lines and wrinkles evening to Beverly line but it is truly a really good product and particulars you have areas on the face of a stubble that need covering you want a more liquid format of it this is really really good just before I go because somebody like to comment the other day and they're like when you put your stuff on your face way you always leave this little bit here and that's because I've got the two really big hot ones here of like broken capillaries so I'm just going to cover that in case that person's watching and you know because I like to clean so there you go really really good product you get six mils of product in here which is relatively good for a concealer because some of them you know cover 1.5 mils that's a problem I'll never quite understand why we pay more for a concealer when we get less product but that's universal but this is a great concealer particularly those of you with problematic skin or those of you them really don't want to set your concealer with powder because you're a bit more mature and you don't like the look this is a pretty good one let me know your thoughts are I don't know Stephanie's actually reviewed this but I would be very interested to what she thinks because I'm curvy is always very spot on and she's you know she's very heavenly so I would like to see that anyway there you go that's my thoughts pretty good pretty clearly good indeed all the information links are down there in the description bar I see all soon aligned 
here at 100k see today's video is a little bit different to my normal ones but we'll begin back to that so let's start with the relatively benign moving forward in 2018 I'd like to go back to doing what I always thought I did best which was the explaining and showing and techniques now of course some techniques you may know some you may have seen someone may have reproduced from previous videos and some I hope will be new but that's where I gained the most amount of joy from filming videos was explaining and showing the techniques because I just enjoyed that immensely I find it really really interesting and last year's videos were a bit for me at least so I'd like to move on and 2018 go back to doing more videos and explaining techniques ok the beauty community so all the genres on YouTube they had twos the gaming any genre you can think of of all the genres the beauty genre is the most repellent of all of them it is the one that Garner's the most amount of anger and resentment and hatred of all of them the irony is that this is they are predominately channels and yet it's anything but beauty it is I found the past year but particularly the past several months incredibly difficult when you see and when you see and you feel the venom coming from certain people and their attacks on other people regardless of with us on YouTube or other social media outlets like Facebook or Instagram or Twitter or snapchat whatever it is there it seems that the sole purpose of certain people is to bring you down and to try and destroy you and whether it's through making videos or being malicious or leaving ugly comments or slander whatever it is it seems that the goal particularly for the beauty community and those in around it is to try and destroy you and I don't quite understand that because so fine for me to want to go out my way to hurt somebody I would try and avoid it at all costs to hurt somebody and it seems that it is the sole purpose for some people to try and destroy and break you down and the the and I don't really know where we go from that because I honestly think that we are going to see extreme cases of people hurting themselves if this continues to go on because where else do you take it from there if something is trying to destroy your life or they're trying to slam you or create false rumors about you whatever it may be you have no idea what that person is going through in your comment your video your message your tweet maybe the one thing that is enough to tip them over the edge because you don't know what they're going through or what their mindset is it it horrifies me when I look and I see everything that's happened particularly especially over the past over three weeks or so it has been absolutely repellent and it fills me with dread YouTube is an interesting place because if you break a YouTube guideline they can strike the video they're unhappy with you but they have no problem with slander with producing and the sharing of videos that are so highly offensive so incredibly inflammatory and YouTube gives them oxygen it gives them life and it keeps them going and I don't get it I really really don't I hope going forward in 2018 we can be nicer to each other there are people that leave very unpleasant comments on my on this YouTube page now I filter certain words and I don't filter swear words or anything like that but there are certain words that I filter now the people sit there and you know who they are because they're the ones that keep writing so they write this really filthy thing and they think that the whole world is going to see it because it looks like it's being posted but it isn't it goes threatening to me privately I get to then approve it or block them for all eternity and that's an easy way for me to do it it may just be also because you know I'm getting older I'm 40 this year but truthfully speaking I've never wanted cause anybody harm and I don't want to leave a comment or write a comment and this brings me to the final point often times when we find individuals or people that are behaving poorly they've written a comment they posted a video they've done something we're so offended by it that we turn into them by eating vile and unpleasant comments on their sites from their social media and that doesn't that brings us to him to their level we're not achieving anything by being like that and I just want if nothing else moving forward that we're a little bit nicer to each other if possible because we need to support the people going through this awful time but without resorting to the kind of unpleasantness and bile environments that they're doing because then we're no better anyway thank you for listening and I really hope in 2018 we can be good to each other please thank you so much and I'll see you all soon bye

here on okay see today is foundation tip day and this is a really really good one and it's very very self-explanatory but I wanted to share it anyway because it's almost unheard of that we would even do this every company out there their goal is to sell product and they and their goal is to sell good products I really believe that and so they sell you a prime and they sell your moisturizer and they sell you a million different things that can be beautiful and really beneficial to your skin but some skin types do better with nothing and this is where the tip comes in if you have normal skin oily skin or combination skin particularly if you have skin with large pores just try this next time you're applying your foundation apply it to your skin completely naked don't put any moisturizer on or any Prime on and before you switch off just hear me out oftentimes with the layering process which I do on clients because I'm gonna set it on a nude blast all day but just for everyday use by not putting anything on your skin it can prolong the wear of your foundation but for those of you with oily skins combination skins enlarged pores it can make a massive difference in how big your pores look by using nothing on the skin it's all just foundation you may get more longevity out of your foundation you will get smaller pores may get smaller pores but your foundation may just go on a hell of a lot better because when you put moisturizer on there's a lot of slip so when you apply your foundation there's a lot of slip if you are quiet to just naked skin there is no slip because our skin is just been cleaned so there's definition isn't gonna move the same way and it sets because foundation does set you leave it long enough it will set so much quicker you will need less powder but I just wanted to share this because it happened to me the other day where I didn't have something on me and their skin was great and I really didn't need it so I just apply foundation me and it just looked so bloody good with anything else on so that's the tip let me know if you follow this tip or in general in the comment section let me know what your skincare routine is before foundation whether you're one who just applies foundation or while you go through a whole skincare routine and then say use a moisturizer and a primer or whatever it is let me know in the comment section I'd love to see what your routines are but just try it for those of you who are able to just try applying foundation and concealer on skin that has nothing else on let's just see where we go from it alright and I'll see you soon bye bye 
Aaron okay so is really really late here I'm a late sleeper so I over to the video I've also got the biggest spot you see my second channel you know that this spies in a year off so saw anyone go away so I wanted to do this video is totally different to my other videos and I doubt very many people will watch it and that's fine but if you wanna say it's going to be longer than normal I wanted to do a video because I wanted to talk to you about more personal things just just cuz just cut the video I get on the volume of the makeup and the comments on it was so one before and it was such a it's a good topic it's a nice topic because a lot of times we look at YouTube people especially in the beauty community now have so much and it's just everywhere and people are watching in and just yearning for all of what they have and I just found a video on styling products that are really affordable but when I involve them but what I did was I bought them and the products I kept I then took um products from my case here gave those a way to make room so I'm not actually acquiring more wine the other products that were really really good I just gave them why some 19 I think so that's good but that's not videos about I can't want to just talk about me and YouTube and everything that goes with it because there is this really it's real I think it's a misconception that maybe it's real that when you're watching somebody and they've got a lot of subscribers right and they're in their new hacks right and it's beautiful and everything is gorgeous and this everything around them is wonderful and it's like how did you get there it's like they've got this part of life and you're dripping with glitter and gold they're part of the gorgeous and they're just loving life they're going to and they're doing this that and the other and I kind of want to talk to you about my life so right from here this is the same place that I've been in before YouTube nothing's changed my life has not changed there's no gold and glitter and anything else everything feel exactly the same because it just seems so odd to me that the artifice of apathy I don't know it was just so odd so I kind of want to just talk about that the way that I grew up was that there was just me and I was Fosters when I was 18 months old and there was just me and there was never I never went hungry and I was never I was clothed I always had things but there was no money there was never any extra money that's not five pounds for ever because it was hard and my mom is such a good person you she's such a good decent person and she worked hard of whole life doing multiple jobs to try and make ends meet and there was this time when my mother was well I was probably about 12 and 11 or 12 and I came into the bedroom and I mentioned this for she's rich she's surrounded in bills and it was really a catered on you know robbing Peter to pay Paul so she paid the gas and she couldn't pay the tricity and she paid electricity then she didn't buy food and that was the last last house that we owned the house went and we went with it and we were we went to a vendor office that was paid for by counsel because the nlogn and then we went and stayed with her sister for a while and then the council gave us a transfer flat and my mother did that council flat pretty much up until about a year ago or so and then she was given a a nother chainsaw houses above low this time it was silly council bungalow and she's been ever since and that's probable use in my view what I do and why I still is in the exact same environment and I still wear the exact same clothes and not wearing a mine or Tom fork or anything ridiculous I'm not going to be opening of premiers because I was involved in it and just because you're on YouTube and you've got a higher amount of subscribers it is ridiculous to me and fine why we go to a cinema opening of a film when I've had nothing to do the film darling but just because I've got you know nearly three million subscribers that means that I'm entitled to go to the Crimea no it's so I'm not buying up anybody that does but to me it's sort of fine it's just crazy in my mind and when I moved to South well I moved from some set my words are 19 I moved to South Wales and I moved to being my partner and when I came here with my partner saw about money my life honestly I came here and there was just more debt and the first two years of my working I gave all of my wages over to pay off his debt and then Arthur I think was a probably a couple of years as well after I think I gave about fifty percent over to try and get this debt down that was had accumulated not mine but it was now joined right but it was also the most wonderful time of my life because there was nothing to do and then my who actually this is amazing memory we had this black pot and in it was our money for the entire month in certain two days that's how much money we had each day and it sounds really bad but it was such a wonderful time because we under extra money it would literally say every single penny we had so that we were going to be once it reached a certain and it was the most wonderful time because we were just saying and watch TV we was really great and we would watch nonsense on the TV and watch films because it couldn't go out we had no money to go out and it was just glorious not having no money but that you realize the things that were important as well and when I started the makeup I had no money and I was buying busy pieces from the shot that was saying up all this junk me because I was so bad and it was all out of date but I was grateful because it's like a pound and I could use it and start to build my skills and while I was doing that on the side and had a job fact at one point I had three jobs on the go because I was trying to save money I wanted to be identified so I wanted to do I really really love but you still have to work so I start to pay and you have to live you know I think people watch YouTube video sometimes and they think that it's just going to happen for them maybe it will but in evidence me I have bills to pay and I had to work and I think that I think the you cheek you saw the illusion of grandeur of most you know this incredible life in government and it really really can absolutely you should change my life with the amount of subscribers I had I was able to start align brushes and then my brushes they are self-funded I pay that every single thing myself and if no one else involved no agency nothing and when I did it originally every single penny I have everything going to those brushes and then one day and they were stamped hot stamps right because I couldn't afford atom laser printed so as I get little bit hot that they look amazing but they go like scratch off because that's what heart-pounding done and scratches off and when all the brushes sold out all the profit I make on that I put back in so I could lay the stamp them so they could not come off and the brushes are so expensive in my agent at the time who is a major now but really nice sort of said to me or we can do brushes and we can get your name on and then we could probably get you into super job and my delegated to booze whatever but the brushes were never going to be mine they would never mind they were never they would have my name on it but I didn't make them they were going to private label and somebody else would own them and the way it works is that they own them and you make ten percent if you're lucky on all the sales but then that tend to send you have to pay your agent twenty to thirty percent of that feeling you've got from that ten percent and I'm all for sharing but what bothered me was that they were mine I didn't create them and sit down and draw the design so I don't know I'm not going to do it I'm going to do this on myself and majors like okay fine passion project I don't think that they thought he was going to you know I was going to go through with it and I did and you know it's been incredibly wonderful I'm very rewarding because brushes are the one thing in life that I truly am obsessed with because I believe that with the right brush you can make life so much easy to sell if you're not naturally talented like I'm not because I'm not now she founded it all his paint-by-numbers and I'm okay with that so reduce you and the brush is life did change and it's wonderful but I've not changed with it I'm still on the exact same money I was on my was working for the BBC that's my wages that's what I take home a year exactly a man hunt exchange I still don't learn anything contoured other than the makeup and the reason is because we're finally going to get here and I know that before turned off and so sorry but the reason being is because I am a goal I have no pension I have no insurance I want to reach a goal and that's why works are that's why in the eg that's why I have brushes it's why I work from the moment I wake up and come home with client because I have a goal and I want to reach my goal so I can relax because I'm tired I feel tired and my mumble is in Sunset and I live inside well and she is in a council house and there's nothing wrong with that I'd welcome to came to house accounts flat nothing wrong with that but I wanted here I want to buy her Hanks I want her really close to me not indoors with me all day but I want her close because she's a good person and she deserves that and she loves me and I love her I have a goal I want her here and that's why do you want to do that's why not privacy spending you know on this and the other and wife looks like the holding video because it was horrifying how I'd accumulated all this stuff so insidiously and that money should have been saved and it should have gone towards my goal and that's really the end of the video I don't know if there was ever a point but it's always good to talk and I think it's always time to see different sides of people because only is very sure that it's the point and I like that but sometimes I watch the video just today and it was so lavish and they the person involved look like they have the most beautiful like and I hope they do but it's so far the moon we have similar subscriber numbers as well but my life is so far removed from that you know I literally wake up I go to work I come back I film YouTube videos I check what's happening with the brushes and checking on the orders oh my god widely write widely arrived checking that I money in the bank to pay for those orders and the whole thing is just rolling rolling all the time and I'm tired and I want to reach at all to the item alack so that my mom can be near me I can buy her house buy her something because she has never had she said over entire life she deserves something and there you go there you go during the ministery letting out and I see y'all soon let me know your experiences growing up and money and anything else that you can relate to people in the comment section below and I read them thanks so much for my 
okay so today I'm going to be giving in my my the best brushes of 2017 now of course they've been mine now obviously if you don't know me probably do I make makeup brushes I don't make them myself they're made in Japan they're all handmade by artisans and I want to show you my favorite brushes and the ones that that I love the most so let's make a start we'll start with the eyes now I don't so your standard flat eyeshadow brush because I don't use that kind of brush myself so I never wanted to really make one so the closest brushes that we have are the 6 and the 18 and I'll show you what they look like so here you go now the white brush which is the 18 this can be used with all powders creams liquids whatever you want whereas the number 6 is just for powders only the number 6 is the softest but they are all if you know my brushes they are so soft you've no idea they are absolutely like silk now you can use this brush regardless you can use it completely flat on the lid but it's really technically a blending brush excuse me helps to pull out color it's just an all-around great brush this is the brush the number 18 and I reach for to blend out concealer it I brought my concealer with first with a brush and then going with a Beauty Blender if I really want to smooth things out that this is Mac sort of brush that I use but anything blending these are the ones so these are my kind of frog in my throat these are my eye shadow brushes so this is what they all look like so they're all January speaking crease brushes because I've never used the flat eyeshadow brush I always prefer creases so it really depends on the shape of your eye if you have a larger eye or you want a more fluid blend then the 16 or the number three are your brushes of choice go directly into the crease of the eye you can blend out with these you can also use the 16 to go under with concealer this is the brush alone will pick up one I'm applying highlight it to the face to be really really smooth the other brush is all vary in size so let me just kind of get close and you can see them so you've got different sizes here generally speaking the number for this is the brush that I would use for something with my eye shape and eye size because I can get right into the crease here the two smaller brushes the 20 the 19 and the 20 these especially the 20 you can get right into the corner here you can smoke out there just an absolute joy I'm I they're mine and they are so I love them and a lot of people for some reason there's this misconception that people think that these brushes are owned by someone else they are completely mine they are self funded they're all mine no one has any say so next we've got the 0-2 and the 10 so again the white brush can be this is the white brush it can be used with creams or liquids as well as powders perfect for your highlighter your blusher your bronzer however you want to use it entirely up to you you can pair it with this don't be put off by the butt that is small you can powder your whole face incredibly quickly and they are silky soft when it comes to foundation there are three brushes to pick from so you've got the two standard foundation brushes in different sizes and you also have the number thirteen brush now the number thirteen brush is one of those multitasking brushes that you can dip the stir into a cream or a liquid or powder buff it on then dip it directly into a loose powder but for your whole face it really depends on how you want to use it but this is the most multitasking the other two primarily for liquid and cream foundations press it on and then buff it into the skin and depending on your size of your face I prefer the small one but I use the big one a lot because they're mine okay so powder large powder brushes so here you go you've got two versions both made with the same hair but one is white and one is black all over powdering perfect for bronzing bizarrely enough because of the size of this you you actually do this in tap on the most beautiful amount of blusher with these brushes which is great so I'm going to move on to these four brushes now at least for all for the face so it dissipates on the size that you want to go for this is the first that I pick up most for blusher work I like to play it nice and high up great for dipping directly into a highlighter really deep into the hairline with bronzers so that's perfect brush number eleven is your standard shaped brush for blush up directly here you can use it for bronzer as well if you have never felt these they are so soft this is brush number twelve now this brush is what I dip into a cream or contour product and tap I also use this for bronzing because I can tap into the areas that I want to go in and it's great for a really sharp highlight or jewel contouring because it's quite flat this is just the most gorgeous brush bizarrely enough Mac also came out with a version and I bought it and it's nowhere near as soft as mine so this is number 14 this is so beautiful for powdering off for your blusher because it displays so you get these gorgeous sort of wash of color this is also perfect for highlighters it's just you know these two brushes are just so usable and last but not least you see if I've got another color here this there is two colors remember pop that color who knows where I dropped it as bottles are now you can't see so this is the airbrush and this comes in a rose gold which is the limited edition or it comes in the standard blank of all the brushes currently available there's one not going around here I can't talk about is the softest it is literally like silk powder underneath the eye anyway you want on the face hold it vertically and apply the faintest amount of highlighter great for cons gently underneath the cheekbones or the jawline use it flat and spray for blusher it is absolutely beautiful and so you will no idea how soft it is until you actually touch it and that's pretty much my favorite brushes the last two that I'm going to mention here are the number five and the number twenty now these are small pencil brushes depending on the size of your eye so generally speaking I would use the number five go underneath the eye because it's so soft you're not gonna tear up great for tear duct work smoking out the lid or you can use a slightly larger one and you get a heavier thicker line or you can use it to go in the outer corner of the eye in to create a fake crease and which is how I tend to do I shall work on at the time and pick up the number 18 and you just blend it out and that's your eye shadow done that's my favorite brushes they are all mine and I'm very very proud of them they have it's just it's always been a dream of mine to to create amazing brushes and I really feel like I have with these the fact that none of these brushes are touched by a machine they're all hand sewing their hand picked is all absolutely beautiful so I'm very proud of them all the information is there and see you soon bye-bye [Music] 
hey everyone okay Syd today is a new tip and this is regarding eyeshadow and your eye primer and most people know what primers aren't they're there to add longevity or eyeshadow and a more beautiful color payoff and they work however most people just apply eye primer and then their eyes shadow and then they wonder why stiff achill to blend and why things aren't working the way they were so I'm going to show you how to really apply eye primer and this works beautifully then I'll kind of hopefully answer a couple questions and as we go along so you're going to pick your own appointment doesn't matter if it's tinted or if it's a clear one I'm just gonna use this one because it's the first one that I picked up it's by an intention Turner and it's a really good one so I'm just going to apply eye primer and this has a tint to it pull over my eyelid and then I'm going to blend it and blend it out so I'm just using a triangular sponge this isn't damp I'm just applying it needs in fact for this cheater we're gonna use a bit more why not so apply your eye primer and blend it out with your fingers or a sponge it really doesn't matter now we would just go about applying our eye shadow except for the things that I just mentioned now what you want to do is if you're going to apply a liquid foundation or concealer or a cream you apply that now over the eye primer just trust me now I've got mineral foundation on so I'm going to play the mineral foundation on so I'm not going to apply this all over that eye primer if you using a cream or a powder or cream or a liquid apply that then powder your lid now I know people are going to be thinking well that is oh it's strobing slightly I can see it's strobing slightly in my monitor I'm so sorry about that most people think that if you pounded it you're going to take away the the whole aspect of using that primer but you won there are a couple of reasons one when we don't apply an eye our foundation color or concealer on our eyelids oftentimes in photos this area can look a little bit what's the word like it's a universe all to itself because there's no skin color under it it's our own skin color no matter how good our foundation is he doesn't match perfectly by applying foundation on you're not gonna have that halo effect that you can see in photos second of all it gives for a more beautiful blend it is true you won't get the same identical color payoff as a neat primer but it will be better than if you didn't use it even though we now applied a layer of foundation on powder over it you'll still get better color payoff and the longevity side of it will still be there just trust me on that but that's how I would go about it apply your primer then put your foundation your concealer or your cream or powder foundation over it powder the lid and then start to apply your eye shadow and trust me in pictures in photographs your eye area will look more beautiful and more a part of your face and kind of just staying and standing out there alone there you go that's my tip no apologies again for the strobing haven't got my settings right but I'll make sure they are next time leave your comments down there and I see your simple way 
here on okay so today I'm going to be introducing you to the newest collection in the brush range my brush range now this is a limited edition and what I've done here is I taken the original collection which was my first selection of eight brushes and I've turned them white and there are several reasons for this which we'll discuss as we go on so here they are now all the information and the link is in the description bar and they are solve exclusively on Beauty there's on this ship worldwide promise so the original collection is still absolutely beautiful but what I wanted to do with this is I wanted to think about the kind of brushes that I would want if I was a complete beginner if I was buying a brush set for the very first time and I wanted to keep the shapes but change them to kiss the original set other than the foundation brush they're basically all to be used for powders other than the foundation brush so I wanted to ensure that this set could be used with any medium powder liquid creams it doesn't matter it will work completely so let me show you all the brushes that you get okay so here's the first brush this is brush number one now this is your foundation brush now it's cut at an angle and this brush is just beautiful for all your foundation work so liquids creams powders minerals however you want now there are two ways of using it if you have dry or delicate skin you want to stamp it like this to stipple it the way the bristles have been cut they're in a zigzag motion so they push product into the skin beautifully this is also the method that you would use if you're going to contour and highlight under your foundation if you have normal to oily skin you can do the buffing motion and buff the product into the skin this is also great for using to apply your primer or moisturizer as well worked great also works great for face masks okay so brush number two so here we are this is the updated version so it is incredibly soft and that's one thing that's worth noting especially if you're new the brushes the brushes are ultra soft none of the hair is ever cut so it feels like nothing on the skin so my original brush looked very similar to this but now it's white now this one has a celerity as you can see from the face set but this has been rounded off slightly more now all I kept adding looks very small most people don't have a really big face it doesn't take long to powder great for underneath the eyes now contouring start from the ear work your way down then blend works beautifully highlighting applied just with the tip here and move it across the cheekbone area now this becomes a bigger brush so if you use no pressure you barely get any movement on the bristle and then if you use more pressure it becomes a bigger brush so it's excellent for applying your blush and your bronzer as well you can also use this as I mentioned with creams liquids it all works deliciously well okay so let's move on to the the eye brushes so this is brushes three and four again very similar to my original collection now they're white creams liquids powders you get the gist now these have similarities to the eye set but once again these are slightly thinner and they've been pointed out more now there's a reason for that if you have small eyes or hooded eyes sometimes you need to create a fake crease or more definition where there isn't by this point you're able to draw in anything you want now here's a really cool little tip take the biggest brush which is brush number three and apply it any color you want but make sure it's a relatively medium shade so say it's a medium brown build up the product really knock it off and apply this is a wash of color all over the lid then move up all the way to the brow bone so it blends out then dip it back in and then go directly lock in in the crease so you're locking the brush in and then go over the lid and then dip it back in again and just go over the eye and you have gradient eyeshadow effect that will look amazing so number three is the bigger brush and number four is a slightly thinner version so more detailed work you can always go underneath the eye with this both brushes particularly brush number three worked amazing for blending out concealer before you use a beauty blender or any other sponge you can really work the concealer you can also work it to shape and define the eye shadow so it's wonderful also good for highlighting and all of that kind of beautiful beautiful jazz so next we have brush number five a tiny tiny pencil brush again all mediums so you can dip this into your gel eyeliner and smudge it at the lash line to get a beautiful smoky eye you can go around the entire perimeter of the eye without it hurting or pulling or tearing up this is also a great crease brush because if you start at the outside corner and just draw into the crease you can draw whatever you want and then blend it so this is great you know I like in a highlight and keep its bow okey dokey so next we've got the blending brush so exactly the same design is the original collection now white similarities obviously to the eye set again this is slightly as in a thinner it's and it's slightly more rounded than the other one or I shadow work flat eyeshadow work take it on its side you've done your eye shadow touch it to the side pull and you get a feline effect it's so cool with that so it's one of the great brushes again concealer work is wonderful okay I'm moving on this is the final two so here they are never gonna see them again so let's start with brush number seven this is a flat lay down brush your standard flat eyeshadow brush ultra soft all I shall work absolutely you can use this to contour your nose because it's small enough to contour a nose we don't need for that take it on its side down the nose with the highlights all of that kind of stuff it works beautifully for those of you who want that kind of flat brush that I absolutely you know you never see it in my collection because they're all creased brushes this is a great one and finally brush number eight this is a large push liner now I've got a really small tiny tiny tiny number eight brush this is the bigger version now this will enable you to do push line up all across your eye really really quickly now push liner gives you blackest lashes without losing any eyelid space because this my brush is really if you can create brushes hooded eyes they work on all eye shapes this will give you the effect of liner without losing any lip space you can tight line with this as well all mediums work great especially creams work really really well you can use this as an eyebrow brush absolutely you can use this to sculpt your concealer underneath the brow bone and best of all dip this into your lipstick particularly a strong colored lipstick place it in your side of you keep his boat pull down other side and join up you've got a lip brush as well and that my friends is the collection now all the brushes are tan made in Japan as most of you know and they are made by artisans nothing is cut or altered or anything like that which makes it incredibly silk like to the skin and it's worth noting even though most of you will know the brushes are funded by myself there's no big PR machine there's no one else involved in any aspect of the brushes other than myself so I order them I pay for them no one else no agents nothing are involved in the brushes whatsoever so there you go that is the collection I think if I could do everything all over again this is the collection I probably would have come up with first because it's more versatile because you can use it with creams and liquids I think in hindsight this isn't one I probably should have released first but what can you do what can you do is hearing that information down there again it is a limited set so once it's gone it's gone because we already have a collection and other brushes is beautiful this one is very very special and holds a very dear place right here thank you for watching thank you for all your support all the information is right down there and I see you next time bye bye

paraone are cases today I'm gonna be talking you through my favorite eyeshadow palettes so these are my favorite ones or the ones that I have in front of me so let's talk about this yard first that busy art come in matte shades shimmer shades combination of both lots and lots of different shades this is an example of the palette this is the zero for dark mattes pigmentation amazing they are just the general staple especially for Maine coast they're just incredibly loved so they are a wonderful brand this isn't a palette but it's one that I made myself and I just want to speak about it it's by Bobbi Brown and it is the sparkle I chose I love Sparkle I chose the celestial eyeshadows you just wipe them on the lid with a finger don't use a brush and they have the most incredible sparkling glitter like effect I don't know if you'll see that in the camera probably not but it just radiates absolute just joy so I'm a massive fan okay the lilia palette from Natasha dallona that's all I'm gonna say on the subject and the sunset palette by Natasha dallona I think that's enough and again by an attachment in donor and when I saw these in Gotham Isles they aren't like the comments well what I really meant was I don't like the blue but I turns out I did really like them so this is my third law this palette here is the 0 1 and Sharia eyeshadow palette oh look at those colors I mean listen look at those reds look at those Burgundy's they're the two Burgundy ones and all that gold they are so refined and so beautiful and look at this middle shake here this palette is the two Aries it is look at that little shade I mean if that doesn't make you want to touch yourself I honestly have no idea what will and this blue that I was like I don't want it turns out I do want it look at that and don't lie look at it look at how good is that it is so beautiful off and this shade here this lighter shade it is like refined gold on the back of the hand it is so stunning so really we found anywhere Natasha knows she's a very nice person so that actually helps because you know if there was a really good brand out there in the person behind it was horrid I just refused to talk about it but that's my favorite eyeshadow palettes anastacio as well makes amazing single eyeshadows as those makeup geek all highly recommend so there you go that's my thoughts and I see you all soon bobbing 
everyone okay so I thought I'd show you my setup and this is how I film and what's in front of me when I'm doing it so the first thing is the mirror so you can see the mirror here it's a really really big mirror and it's by glam core and all the information on everything you see here is in the description bar and nothing in this video is sponsored so let me get a little bit closer and you can take it a look and I'll turn this mirror on okay so you can see the mirror is on and it has these LED lights all the way around it and these are daylight lights so they're really bright and they're very natural-looking so the skin and everything else looks very very normal this is a new mirror because the other one just wasn't cutting it so this really helps filming that and the skin looks so normal in videos which is great so you can just sort of take it you can just see it's absolutely bloody huge and I just love it it's one of the best things I've got because I can now film without having to notice that the skin is looking to yellow or to orange so to the sides are two acrylic makeup cases and these contain makeup so let's take a look so the first one is the bottom draw this is just foundations there's cream foundations in here and sponges and wet wipes then we've got a drawer full of powder very few products concealer so this is the concealers then we've got blushes and highlighters bronzers and contouring products we've got eyebrows and some eyelashes and then we've got mascaras and things like that up here we've got some foundations we've got some setting sprays and we have some eyeshadows all in palettes so moving onto this site I shadows again oh hang on nearly then we've got lipsticks we've got some lip glosses and some sponges I've hidden away this drawer is just miscellaneous is nothing really pencils and some eye lashes cream eyeshadows and sponges and then get in there and then we've got liquid foundations right down here we have my brushes and there's also this little mirror here and this is the one that I use when I'm filming because the big mirror is so far away now this again is from one-call and it's a mirror that lights up and you can check the brightness of it because it really lights up depending on how bright you want it and there's also which I don't really use but there are attachments here so you can put a magnifying mirror hold on a second let me finally there you go the sweet spot so there's a magnifying mirror see and you can also attach your mobile phone to this and there's Bluetooth functions here so you can take selfies if that's what you want again I just use it as a standard mirror because it's really bright I can have it really close to me and this is the camera that I use and this is the Lumix G H 5 so this films in 4k so you can get a really really good picture and we've got some products here that I have to review that's it that's my setup so everything here is what I use you can see it's not this massive bloody look at everything I've got kind of thing because I don't need a lot of makeup all of that stuff you see there is still way too much and I'm editing it right down I want to have one single a critic case and that's it but that's it that's my setup all the information the lights because I use the glam core light but I also use their portable one as well which I take with me which is really really good so all the information is in the description bar and I'll see you all soon thanks so much oh and one thing to kind of mention is that these that give me my dressing-gown you can also dim these lights to any kind of degree of brightness that you like so you can absolutely change it there you go thanks so much and I'll see you all soon bye-bye 
everyone okay so I've been looking forward to doing this video for a while man so it is the absolutely insane things that make up companies and skincare companies say to get us to buy their product now I do believe that companies want to give us good product but this terminology sometimes is so insane so let's make a start my favorite one is when they say you know when they have a woman on the advert it's like what's the secret to my smooth skin and she's like 20 that might be the secret to your smooth skin maybe I think it is now the other thing is where it says contains a list and in the list of a million different things that are just a mess of letters that mean absolutely nothing to us and they're all made-up names that we're never going to understand that makes drives me crazy because I'm like what does that even mean can someone just explain what that means there was one years ago it was something like start today for a younger tomorrow start today for a younger tomorrow or you're older tomorrow it makes no sense wrinkles appear reduced now what we hear a lot of times is wrinkles are reduced what they're saying is wrinkles appear reduce so they're not reduced are they widget now they're not reduced they appear reduce is so other things like like lines and wrinkles reduced by 75% or which lines which ones were they talking about facial lines lines around the eyes all lines and compared to what that's what I don't get it's like facial wrinkles were reduced by 75% compared to what they don't tell you what it was compared to compared to what so 80% of people said their skin felt smoother that's great amazing but smoother compared to what what was the age range of the group did they have dry skin oily skin combination skin normal skin see they don't tell us any of that stuff they're just like 80 percents of skin felt smoother but what does that mean unless we can with something that we can you know and then we actually know and skin felt a sense of skins not skin skin felt smoother but was there another partly used for a skin felt even more smoother that we didn't know about well never know because they never tell us no one lashes lashes were five hundred percent follow five hundred percent I'm not a mathematician is that even possible five hundred percent thicker non creasing concealer see no almost every concealer over or crease that's just the nature of the eyes they we laugh with them we smile with them they cruise things crease and they're like this concealer you know we tested this concealer it does increase well who did you test it on if you test it on a six-year-old there's a high possibility it won't crease because they've got just big round faces but if you tested it on a fifty-year-old it may crease more whom did you test it on to come out with the findings that does increase but we never know tones the skin what just it can't nothin can no you cannot tone the skin it's just that way we use the word but generally speaking you can't tone the skin it's just the way it is you can put the tone up on this game which won't remove oils makeup all that guys a bit as a tone the skin it's a different word means something totally different five hundred percent increase in moisture levels in the skin now first of all is that even healthy second of all was our product that gave more increase or less and which were those products because they don't say they just it's always so bloody vague it's like this was 50% better a hundred percent better or a thousand percent better but they never say prepare to war or how it was tested which just makes me mad so oftentimes they're using moisturizer on the face and then I say to people oh I skin feels so good what we don't see is that oftentimes they will strip the skin with alcohol to root and I mean really strong meat alcohol just to dry it out and then they all apply moisturizer on a girl how soft your skin - and they're like out it feels amazing that's because we just destroyed your skin dermatologist tested you notice it didn't say if the dermatologist liked it he may have hated it she may have painted it it just says it was tested by don't even say which dermatologist tested it or what they even thought of it just dermatologist tested or that gave me a lot of information thank you pause shrank by 50% now pore size is genetic I often times they get bigger as we get older you can't close a port once it's there is there you can't just shut it down and it's gone you can use products that can minimize the appearance of pores but they won't shrink them the way that they claim they will on things where it says shrink spot no you can't it's not gonna happen you can use products that can calm them that can smooth them over you can even use products that can irritate them so that they temporarily swell and look like they're smaller but you can't string them it's just the way it is there is a really cool on the other day and this and the woman was on the TV shows like lines what lines I'm watching the television I like the lines on your face though ones that I can see yeah those lines okay do you remember and this is still a good product right but do you remember the protect imperfect by boots it's a retinol product right now everyone knows most people know that retinol is a great antiaging product but there was a documentary and they talked about this product and they counted it like it was the second coming right like it was this amazing product what they didn't say in that documentary was that boots paid for the testing the studies everything so it's not like they just did this test blindly and fine it was really really good the company who make it boots actually paid to have this study done so they had a vested interest that it would come out really favorable it wasn't a double-blind study so you don't really know if there was a better product out there or anything else it was a study paid for by boots but no one speaks about this they just talk about this protect and perfect that whatever it is like it's really really good retinol is a great anti-aging product it's really good it has been demonstrated over and over again in scientific journals if you can get a prescription one of threatenin or retin-a they can do amazing things but the way that this was pushed upon us like it was something brand-new when it was paid for by the company is crazy do you remember years ago there was an infomercial on mineral makeup and it was the funniest thing and it was an I love mineral makeup I had on here it's what I wear and the the host was like the fan she not actually the founder of the company there was another founder and she left and then the other lady came in and took her and did the most amazing job but do you remember the commercial and it was like she had that she take the lid off and then she called the lady and she go and like a couple bits of dandruff would fall in there and then she swirl the but that's all you need now somebody that uses mineral makeup I can tell you that's not all you need you need a little bit more than a little bit of a head shaker dandruff in there from the product in order for it to cover the skin and it was like the most me see about if you will remember like the probably late 90s maybe early two-thousands it was that and then she swirl the brush and then tap off like there was anything on the brush I mean tap it off and then she buffered on the skin there was my use mineral makeup I have it here and I literally do this I do that and then I use what's in the lid which is usually quite a lot and then I use a bit more because you need product on your face in order to cover it which give smell to my favorite one now there's this new concealer at the moment and the company was saying supernatural right super supernatural and I watched the video to it and it was so supernatural I was like do you know why it was supernatural they literally did this the tiniest you need got the Hubble telescope just to see the tiny bit of concealer any concealer is going to look super natural if you apply all of it so if you apply almost nothing it's going to look really natural now if you apply a massive stripe across the face blending in and Daniel Silver's like nothing then you have got yourself a super natural concealer but uh go and then expect me to believe that it is the most natural looking concealer I've ever seen when you apply nothing another one this is called now I'm in the process of stuff that I can't really discuss on here at the moment but one thing that really irks me is when a company may look up and say this took ten years to develop right first of all you can create a ship a rocket ship that can go up to space in less time than that it doesn't take five years 10 years 15 years to create a foundation or concealer or a moisturizer it just doesn't it doesn't take that long it's not that there can't be a painfully long drawn-out process believe me it can be but don't say this was five years in the making give me illusion to five years to create this or this moisturizer is ten years in it took 10 years to develop this formula no it didn't don't know if you can create something that can send you into space trust me you can get moisturizer done really really quickly and that's an amazingly advanced formula but in ten years five years four years Pro concealer probably not there you go that's my rant over let me know what the most irritating things are on commercially speaking then when you see a commercial they're like and then they put on this mascara you can see like the fake lashes and you're like mmm let me know what though you're the most taking commercials after you where they say something it is so I Regis Lee you know it's so it's so naughty in that it really isn't gonna live up those things but let me know what it is that I would love to read them in the conversation below okay thanks so much for this thing can I see y'all soon bye-bye 
everyone okay so today I'm going to be showing you the best setting powders of press setting powders of 2017 now it's a very very small collection because I don't actually have a lot so I'm just going to jump right in and show you my favorites so the very first one is the Charlotte Tilbury and this is the flawless finish airbrush powder exceptional powder especially if you are on the drier side it's more emollient than a normal pressed powder so and it is truly an absolute staple now this one is gorgeous and I almost let me show you a different color and you'll see why it's gorgeous and then I'll kind of you know so here it is this pressed powder it contains 8 grams of 10 grams of product and it's by lemare and that's the problem truly you've never touched a pad like this it is exquisite the feel of it everything about this pad at this perfect except the price tag so you need to bear that in mind a really good powder if you're looking for a more luminous finish is Bobby Brown and this is the nude finish illuminating powder and this is a wonderful powder it has a bit of shimmer in it and it gives the skin a real kind of sense of luminosity and this is an excellent pad now these are often mistaken as highlighters these are actually a finishing powder or a pressed powder and there for the face now this is the hourglass palette these all come in singles now these are can be used all over the entire place and they recommend you do so bear in mind it will give you a very luminous finish to your skin so those of you who are oily may not enjoy that you know that kind of finish but those of you who drive skins may think it's a little bit more lovely because you're adding much more luminosity if I could only pick one powder I probably pick the Charlotte Tilbury flawless finish airbrush powder because it's truly beautiful but then the marijuana I mean the packaging on the lemare one right it's not that amazing but the feel of this powder and the texture of it is so finely milled it's like nothing and it mattifies in the most beautiful way I kind of wish I've never tried it but there you go because now I have not like but you'll see anyway thanks for watching and I'll see y'all soon bye bye 
everyone okay so today's video is slightly different it's a concealer video often times when we're watching videos especially on YouTube we wonder how the concealer looks so flawless so I'm going to show you now I'm dotting it around please don't pay any attention these dots I'm being facetious in this video it's absolute bollocks to do dots it makes no difference to swiping now all I'm gonna do is blend this with a sponge it's a damped triangular sponge I've cut the corners off of I'll explain why in another video because I like to keep these short and I'm blending this concealer all the way over the eyelid up by the brow and I'm bleeding it out into the rest of the face and it's very important that you bleed out because you don't want there to be a circle of light in the center and nothing else it has to meet the edges gently so I'm blending I'm gonna add more concealer to the inner corner for extra brightness now at the end of this video I pull out and I show you what it looks like with the lights that I've got then I turn them down so you can see the difference in a more normal lighting setting both give that really brightness to the face so I'm going to add more product here right to that inner corner now it's really important to note that this really is about blending this video for just this one side of my took me around about four minutes so if you've got the extra time and you just want to play and meditate go for it but this is just an extreme version of concealer it is not the be-all and end-all so please don't think that I certainly wouldn't do this to somebody else unless it was requested because they really wanted that kind of technique I'm gonna set this now with loose powder same sponge and I'm applying this and I want you to see what happens to the skin it takes on this velvet texture this is why it works so well with this technique because it photographs like an absolute dream and in photographs any creases in wrinkling under the eyes look more flawless in real life that is not the case so you need to bear that in mind so what I'm going to do next is keep setting and then knock off the excess powder with a brush this was a prototype brush that never made it because it was so expensive to make it was a so extreme that it was never gonna happen so I'm just buffing off all the excess powder I'm gonna pull out so you see and then I'm gonna change the lighting because the lighting in my studio here is very bright so here's a more natural light say pretty cool and I'll see you next time bye bye 
everyone okay so this is Vidya that a lot of you have been waiting for and this is the Fenty range so I've pretty much got everything but I haven't got the eyeshadows for some of the lip but otherwise it's pretty much stocked so let's go through everything and I'll give you my thoughts so I'll be completely honest to say that when I first got this stuff I really wasn't expecting very much from it I don't know why I just I just wasn't expecting a lot and I was very very pleasantly surprised so let's start on the first one which is the fancy beauty and this is the primer now this has an absolutely non silicon feel to it whatsoever it feels incredibly soft going on the skin you don't get that ultra silicone feel I absolutely detest I hate it and this doesn't feel like that at all it goes on really beautifully and dries completely matte which makes sense because the foundations are matte it's a truly truly beautiful primer that works beautifully with the foundation which we'll get onto next now all the information and the links are in the description bar for UK and us foundation okay so this has been more of a silicone feel to it with added Agnetha shade range is massive don't think there's forty shades from light all the way up to do one thing to bear in mind if you are light skinned that almost all the shades if not all have quite a strong yellow undertones of them so they won't suit everybody's undertone but majority people do have a warm undertone so you'll be fine with that it's beautiful obviously in spent abuse oh it's beautiful to see really rich deep deep shades which is beautiful coverage this is full coverage it's actually medium to full but we're really growing on the side of full coverage here you have 32 mils in the pump in the you know in the in the model which is really really good if you want to know how well my foundation actually laughs I do things for you I'll leave that description by right at the bottom this goes on the full coverage so expect full coverage it also dries that completely map there is drying down time so it doesn't dry immediately like a lot of Buffy Foundation's can but this does dry down it's completely a map for those of you with normal skins slightly dry skin or combination you may not need to pack this at all because the staying power of this is pretty bloody good I will say so myself I'm actually very very fond of the foundation I think it's a cracking cracking foundation if you're looking for that full coverage you can always share it out by applying it with the primer or a bit of moisturizer depending on how you feel so let's move on to these now these are all magnetic so they break apart and then they stick together and they actually stick together with quite some force now these are your highlighter contour concealer they're all matte will go on to the shimmer ones in a minute the shade range is beautiful so you've got them here there's a lot of shade ranges to choose from these are completely mapped and they dry matte but they go on generally speaking really dry skins are not going to love these because they will drag but that's the truth that everything with dry skin it is you know it is one of the most problematic skin conditions especially with something like me so I really need to exfoliate someone's skin before I can get to work on it but these darn beautifully you can use it to highlight and it's so good to see these in highlighting form without all that intense shine I love the fact the foundations of map the contouring and highlighting sticks of matte the primers map that makes me really happy because then you can add shine where you want great for highlighting under the nut on the nose under the eyes wherever you want you can use the deeper sticks for contouring or bronzing they're absolutely beautiful you get in here 7.10 grams of product which is really really good once again expect there to be another base to almost all of these apart from say the peach which is a great corrector so if you want to add a little bit of shine we're still clicking on with six then this is where your blusher and your shine will come in these aren't beautiful once again seven point ten grams of product so these will last you what I'm going to get on with some of the blushes they are so gorgeous I love the fact that you are applying color to the face with the sticks without touching parodies yet no powders no nothing and then you can add the shimmers over them to create this kind of glow and the skin truly radiates that glow because the rest is Matt because of the foundation in the primers and of course the highlighters that we've just used it is absolutely perfect I honestly had such low expectations for this and these are truly brilliant one word to know about oxidization because somebody's going to mention it it's impossible to say the foundation is going to oxidize anew that's the Foundation's properties mixed with your bio chemistry that creates the changing color no one knows that it's going to happen it's just you know poor luck but I haven't noticed oxidization on me when using it but again I don't know your skin is different so better than mine these are my favorite absolutely my favorite unicorny is probably unicorns probably that color that most people are going to want but it's my least favorite just because I'm not a fan of kind of lilac on the skin however on deeper skin it is phenomenal on pale skins and not that fussed with it but it's gorgeous so should we move on to some powder highlighters now we've all seen the video of Rihanna where she stripes on the golf and it is a mammoth effect and you do not have to use the term intensity and I want to speak about this color in particular because it's going to be the color that most people want to gravitate towards now the color is absolutely stunning it's called trophy wife and it is beautiful you want to bear in mind that God doesn't suit all skin tones if you have very fair skin I'm not a lover of gold gold to me is really for those with really medium married and dark-skinned goal just is not the color I will go to for my skin tone and light it just isn't doesn't mean you can't use it you can use whatever you want it's just not my favorite it goes on incredibly pigmented you do not have to use it to that kind of intensity what's great about these is you added the blush you've added the highlighter and the sticks then you can add a little bit more to the cheek if you want you've got the shade range with trophy wife which is amazing then you've got the duos and the Giro's have a more natural side and a more shimmery side again depending on application depends on how they're going to look on your skin but they apply it beautifully and the color spectrum of these is absolutely stunning there's something here for all skin tones so fancy Beauty we have the universal and this is the universal powder it is a pressed powder that has a almost invisible touch to it I've not had any issues with flash back so you need to think about that but I haven't this is a blotting powder and it contains eight point five grams of product because the foundation is matte some of you will not need to powder this is really used as a touch up throughout the day mainly in the t-zone area and the areas you haven't highlighted as far as touch of powders go it's really really nice and it is really really nice and I say that because it doesn't collect it doesn't have a lot of emollients so if you compare this to Charlotte Tilbury flawless finish powder that has more mo Lian's in it but she but there's definitely the shower tub is more hang towards the drier side of things this is definitely aimed towards more of the oily side of things but in Paris down beautifully I did not notice flashbacks it also had his concealer wonderfully and lastly I've got the lip boss now I only got this one and it is I'm going to tell you something see this years ago when I used about a year ago I was looking at doing some lip glosses and I asked for a containment I had the most horrendous trouble getting one turns out you can get them so there you go I wanted one that looked like and I wanted one that looked like a nail varnish but there you go here it is and this must be CH and it's not absolutely beautiful and it's so pretty I'm absolutely like this at the really shimmery glittery lip glosses that are in the range because they look so good like like so so good so I'm really going to be getting those but this is truly an absolutely standout beauty the only things that didn't appeal to me were the brushes and that's because I have my own brush range it's not because these aren't good they're all synthetic they work absolutely fine it's just I prefer buying brushes that's just my preference but they're great I also got I don't quite know why but I got the blotting powders I can't write home about these because these are like every other bloody powder on the market but they work and that's the thing so there you go that is the entire line and it looks and feels magnificent I am truly I was not a believer going in these are pretty pretty good there you go leave your comments all the information on the products is in there including UK any rest and I'll see you all soon bye bye 
however my locator today is a slightly different video but what I wanted to share regardless because I thought it was interesting makeup is such a glorious thing and it can do so many wonderful things you can make us feel better you can make us look better sometimes when we look better we feel better and I love makeup it makes me incredibly happy but for a long time the makeup that I had wasn't making me happy it was making me feel incredibly overwhelmed and this video is going to explain why what happened was and if you knew how I grew up you would this would be more understandable and I grew up like most people but we never had more we always had what we had and that was a struggle but we never had any more there wasn't anything more it was everything spare another good order I knew I didn't want to be that way and I had jobs and I worked at one point I had three jobs and over time and as my career took off inside took off I could acquire more and more things and this is a wonderful thing but there comes a point when you acquire too much stuff and like I said when you grow up like me you you I so longed for more than what I had and with my job what I do it's when I'm working on you most of the time one of you think I give to you and I replace and then the cycle continues and I like that part of the sea it's really good but I was acquiring more stuff over the years lots and lots and lots of stuff and I was just putting it aside because my makeup kits very very small it's the same stuff I've been using for years but it's very small I was acquiring more and more sup here's a picture now this picture shows you four cases of makeup that I didn't use ever as it was piling up more and more the joy of makeup was being lost to me because I felt so overwhelmed with it it was you know 90 brown eyeshadows when I use for the overconsumption and with YouTube right now I get the most beautiful pies I can really you think that it's really really wonderful I can tell you things that I think are really good and things I don't think a great but sometimes more is more and that is the case here and what you saw is four boxes full of products that I didn't use and then they were more boxes than that there were another eight boxes they were all fall I wasn't using them I didn't want it I couldn't get rid of it but I didn't want it and it was hindering me because I needed to just off love you can't chuckle that shied away because it's so expensive so I gave it away and the relief the feeling of being lifted away from all of that shite was amazing because there were people who argue needed it people who didn't have a lot people who would have done anything to have an on Russia a than the k-palette Mac foundation whatever and then they were charities that could really do and use with all of that stuff and so it went and it all went and suddenly my makeup kit is only white in front of me and I love it because it's just what I want it's just what I need and all the other stuff I buy now and I review and I want to talk about I just put it aside and give it away whether it's the people or charity or people and know who need it because that's the thing it's one thing to give it to somebody but to give it to people who you know will need it who really want if you haven't got the means in order to have it that is a wonderful thing and a lot of people particularly YouTube who get sent huge huge and I'm not one of them but the people that get sent so much stuff and then we see my later culture huge and it's everywhere oh my god I want all of that been done you don't really have a promises you don't need it and it is great to just think the all these people that have this stuff and they don't have to pay for it they just had it freed me and made me love my makeup again when I was so depressed with it because it was too much I was still holding on to a life that I don't necessarily live anymore but one I did on the past and there you go that is my makeup hoarding and it will never happen again because to know now that I can get something I can review it and I can just let it go and I can go into someone good someone decent that's the thing sometimes I give a bag of makeup away and it's like a really bad I only get it to good people people I know who are decent I hate the idea getting something somebody who's ungrateful nothing worse than I'm grateful giving it a spiel for good that's a good thing ok that's my story and I see you all soon bye bye

hello Casey today I'm going to be showing you how to get really long eyelashes without false eyelashes or anything scary now we all know about mascara fibers and a lot of people dislike them because they fall down and not just during application which you can flick away but during the day they fall back and there's a way to get around that and I don't have very good eyelashes at all they're pretty shocking and often times with fake lashes you need you need a lot of skill and a degree in it in order to get them on beautifully I haven't got that but if you're blessed with amazing lashes this tutorial is not for you hate those people however if you like me or other people with small short lashes that aren't for thick this is it 212 you you only need three things you're going to need either a regular mascara that's non waterproof mascara fibers and then a mascara topper that turns your mascara into a waterproof one now next you want it's really inexpensive if you don't have that then you need a waterproof mascara it doesn't work otherwise if you just use the waterproof as well but just follow this technique so mascara fibers and a top up or a waterproof mascara so let's make a start first you're gonna do is use your regular mascara and you're going to apply this to lashes apply in a zigzag motion because you want to build thickness first now I've got this habit now first of all the mirror is about a mile away from me so oftentimes it's quite difficult for me to do this because I'm going to poke myself in the eye so I'm gonna see if I can bring it forward that's made absolutely zero difference so applying mascara wiggle and try and get a lot of product onto the lashes don't worry if it gets clumping now you want to use your fibers so just apply the fibers to the lashes in a wiggle and pull up and a wiggle and pull up don't worry if it looks a little frightening all they'd start to drop because we can knock them down now you want to use your regular mascara again so you can see that you know these must these fibers work really really well so now you're attaching them to the mascara you're going to repeat this process one more time scared of all that nonsense on the back of my hand so again attach them and you can just apply to the ends but I to create a bit of a thicker base now you're going to move on see how big the lashes look they are so much there's so much better now you're going to apply your waterproof mascara but preferably a hopper this will seal them in and you done to the scale unto it do you know I can apply mascara for somebody else but to myself I find it quite frightening process I'm just saying it's not my favorite thing to do I've managed to get it on my lower lashes yay now before we end this tutorial look at that that there that I'm just tickling that's called a hateful eyelash now you may have one it's where all the others are beautiful but there's one eyelash I'm gonna sneeze it's gone nope oh excuse me I'm gonna leave that in there's always one that hangs down there it is it's a hateful eyelash I'm going to speak badly to it in a minute badly but you can see that it's made a tremendous difference the lashes are open they look really really thick in fact you can actually go in one more time if you really want to look mental and sometimes I do I mean I might I couldn't go get picture in a minute so I might just go like this because I like crazy like that crazy so one more coat this is the waterproof really seal them in but it really works better with a topper I can't find mine and just trying to all hang on just trying to give you a bit of a a closer look so you can just see the you know how long they look I mean they look really really long and I do not have long lashes be free fall off might cut it off you get the gist this is how to do it you get the long lash effect they're not gonna drop down especially with the top up and they just look absolutely splendid that's it video done long lashes see you next time bye bye 
honestly please do not take this video too seriously honestly everyone okay so today I'm going to be talking you through getting the most beautiful graphs for your face shape which is gonna be very exciting also at the end of this video is even more exciting there is a giveaway which is completely free it's not sponsored or anything like that it's just a big giveaway so stay tuned right in the end for that and all the information okay so on to the video before I get started let me just say that every single thing you're about to hear in this video in regards to your face shape in your eyebrows is absolute bollocks don't pay any attention to it too strongly as with all things that you would make up you know one size fits all is about the personality and everything else that goes into it so don't eat too much credence to this video in terms of the accuracy I'm going to give you the most accurate information I can but bear in mind nothing is going to fit everybody so with that in mind let's make a start the first spaceship that we're going to deal with you is the round face shape now with a round face shape as the name suggests the features aren't as defined meaning they're doesn't tend to normally be angular features on a round face so you get the most balanced with the round face we want to create a more angular Brown that means that it's sunny sharper has more of a point to it so we're creating angles on the face this tends to bounce out of the round shape of a face and give a more unbalanced look to a rounded face the next patient is the square shaped face now square shaped face and you can tell it's square shaped and what we need to do is add a little bit more softness to this fascia by creating a slightly rounder Brad we're not talking rainbows or anything like that just a slightly softer rounder brow that adds more balance to the squareness of the face and this really calming a big difference on square shaped faces messing on the oval face and the usual face the brand tends to be more suited to the oval face on some tronky or whether it's cracked is a slightly straighter brow we're not something like that or anything like that but just a silent stranger Brad tends to give more balance to a normal face and technically speaking according to studies which I don't believe for an instance the oval face is the most perfect shaped face I didn't think of ever heard more bollocks the man in my life but there you go I was reading those down like hmm I think not but if you've got an oval face is slightly straighter bribe but not extended to if I can really balance and create more bones to the already perfect oval face long face now with a long face the as you can see the face tends to have a lot of length to it what we want to do to add more balance is create with by doing this you want to extend the brows slightly farther out then you may do normally by training a longer Brad you're actually adding more width to the face also when you're doing your eye makeup by pulling it out you can cream more with that way as well and that gives that getting the illusion of shortening a slightly longer focus next week with a heart-shaped face or the hardship they tend to be wild acute and goes down to a narrower or more pointed chin and will how you look at it with a heart-shaped face you see the pictures now the easiest way to describe it it had a more groomed bride what I mean it is one of the few patients that can really take a very sharp and bright that means it's very very defined by adding a very defined rag to a hard shaping you actually add a beautiful dimension to the face this is also one of the e this way to Fargo to notify makeup by having a sewing stronger brow you create a more balanced so that's an absolution it's one of my favorite face shapes actually is the heart shape basically just think it's a really pretty face you know just go into this curve which i think is beautiful and finally finally we've got a pear shape now with a pear shape base is wider at the jawline now when you're going wiring the jawline what you want to do is add thickness to the brows that we're creating balance again so that our eyes are focusing on a balanced face by doing this all you need to do is thicken the brown ever society better generally speaking that is that thicken the eyebrows above them below unless you've got a huge amount of a big space then you can do whatever you want but if you survive this space like me you're better off thickening the growth above that way you still retain all this on all the shape of the eye and there you go that was absolute bollocks it please take it that way done playing it too seriously and don't throw or anything like that because suddenly variables come into play I'm also going to do a video on how to pluck the perfect eye shape which contradicts everything I've just said in this video that's the beauty of makeup there's so many different ways to go about it you can finish you whatever makes you happy makes me happy most of the time are from you keyboard warriors okay so now let's talk about the giveaway in the Navy on one of my favourite brands

everyone our cases today I may be giving you a tutorial kindly tutorial of the new Charlotte Tilbury products and this is the amazing the two amazing contract works and the highlighting product so let's just get a quick look at the contouring products and then the highlighting so we've got the Hollywood contour one and this is an easy contour one comes in two shades which is fair to medium and then medium to dark now you can pick your shade as an you know however you wish generally speaking for my skin tone going up to really medium good medium skin tones fairly medium is perfectly fine then you from sort of more more medium tan right through up to deeper skin tones you've got the medium to the dark and then you've got the horizon product which is the beauty light one and this is a universal shading spot and it has a mirror reflection shine on it it is an incredible i'm highlighter because of that mirrors shine it's almost slightly wet looking which is incredibly beautiful now I love contouring as you know some of my very first videos here on YouTube have been about contouring so I'm gonna do a little contouring video with you and kind of guide you through it because it for me contouring is about bringing out the bones of the face but bringing about structure because the faces aren't all one color so I want to add a bit more structure so let's make a style the first thing I'm going to do is just start to prime it by clicking it and then pushing at the base this is going to release a little bit of product I like to then turn it off completely by clicking it the other way and I just like to put a bit of it onto the back of my hand now generally speaking when I'm looking at myself here in the mirror hmm I don't know really want to bring out this area here I want to make this area here recede to give the illusion that I've got a stronger cheek area here began if you don't have a beard you could do the jawline and also I really like to comp a lot of people like to contour right here at the temple but sometimes on some people this area can already go in slightly so I like to contour right here above the arches of the eyebrows anyway so I'm going to apply a little stroke and then another one right in this area and I like to start off subtly and then build so I'm going to take the Hollywood complexion brush and rather than going in this way I'm actually gonna start right here at the end and then work it back and working it back into the hairline at the top of the ear here so I'm working it back because I can build this and the reason for doing this to begin with this way is so that I'm not bringing product too far forward because a lot of times there's nothing wrong with bringing it forward because you can really chill out this area here but it can look quite hard sometimes on certain face shapes so I'm bringing it back and trying to create the dimension alright the way back here and again if you want to just build that because you may want to create a little bit more I'm just gonna reapply in this area here and again I'm working backwards for this tutorial and bring it up past the hairline and into the other part of the ear now the great thing about this is it doesn't have the standard kind of really great own - it's a natural looking contour so you're not going to get any crazy gray stripes on the face or anything like that and you can blend with your fingers if you want so I'm going to start to apply a little bit of the console right here kind of just above the arches of the eyebrow and I'm blending it up and out again into the hairline and I'm moving it up and out so he can create more dimension so I'm going up I'm moving it back to the side slightly so trying to build a bit of depth here then depending on your forehead I've got a relatively large for it so I'm going to contour just around the outside perimeter and the goal here for this is not to make me look overly contour working it into the air line it's to make my face appear that it has they mentioned that there's color to it that this contour that maybe I've caught a bit of the Sun that it doesn't look flat and wore one color so next working out to the nose area I like to just take the product run it slightly down the sides of the nose to begin with now I'm going to use the flat side of the valuable brush and I'm just going to move the product before I do anything else I'm just moving the product in that downward kind of stroke then I'm taking off everything on the back of my hand and then I'm going to start to feather it ever so slightly because we don't want to remove the line but we want to soften it also a really cool thing is when you're contouring your nose don't forget to go up here into the eyebrow so that this area here connects to the nose this can open up the eye give more space especially when we start to have the highlight shade you can also contour the socket line of your eye as well and bring this lash you go over it with a little bit of powder but we're not trying to create an eye shadow effect just dimension to the base and again this area here you're connecting it round to that area we brought up to the brow so we're just trading that kind of dimension and again make sure everything is nicely blended and if you really want to kind of go for it we can just add a little touch more just to create that dimension bring it up now for those of you who want a little bit more intense contour going to bring it down slightly into this area but I'm using the small end of the complexion brush and I'm not really adding any product to it I'm just taking off and I'm just going to really I'm just going to follow die natural and then I'm going to smooth it out and again if you don't have a beard you can contour all the way along the jawline here and then just remember to come down in downward strokes so that you're blending everything so that the color is starting to blend down into the next you've got this uniform color so next we're going to add some highlights so we're going to add the spotlight which is the beauty wand and again I'm going to turn it on push up onto the product and then lock it back in so I like to use this subtly to begin with because it is a mirror shine so the first area obviously is going to be just in the center of the nose I'm also going to do the brow bone I'm going to be corners of the eyes but in a minute I'm actually gonna highlight the center of the forehead on this because I've contoured this area you want to add light to that so I'm just gonna add a stripe right away down here and then I'm gonna highlight the upper part of the cheekbone and both sides and also just a tiny bit going into it's going to start to move into that brow bone again take the small end of the complexion brush and I'm just going to start to blend that out and the best thing about this product in its creamy format is that if you decide to set the face book powder it doesn't take away that shine which is pretty good again I'm patting this area because I don't want to remove it I wanted to say in this kind of area so I'm patting it to press it into the skin without trying to wipe it away when I'm doing the contour here same motion I'm patting it into this area diffusing it but not wiping it away the same thing on the other side now I'm just going to just blend that in with my finger on nose now I really hope you can see the highlighted areas here in how they kind of move around so I'm going to take a little bit of this I'm going to apply this to the very inner corners here of the eye right here in that inner corner and you can also and this just kind of pulls the eyes apart as you'll almost certainly know but I'm also going to just start to further it just slightly up right here and this is going to further give the illusion that the eyes are a little bit wider and I'm just gonna smooth that in with my finger and I'm leading it into nothing so you've got all of the face pretty much sorted so now I want to put a little bit of powder on to set everything so means the airbrush the flawless finish palette in shape too and I'm going to start to powder the sides of the nose and underneath the eye so right here I'm also gonna powder this kind of section here and the nose area even though we've got that highlight there it's not going to disturb it I'm just going to very lightly powder this sensor part as well I'm going to take a sunny lighter powder so I'm actually taking shape one and I'm gonna go right here just underneath that contour color with a slightly lighter shade just to make it pop the cheaper airport a little bit more now we're gonna put some cheap cut on the face so I'm going to add a little touch of beach stick and I like to apply this for myself a little bit higher because I want this blusher to blend in to the highlight color and I'm going to use my finger to begin with and I'm going to take the complexion brush and just moving around in this style blended in they go that's it very very simple very very easy to do and because the colors blend into the skin beautifully you don't have to worry about there being left with stripes or dirty looking marks because it absolute you want to do that and these can use his/her liquid bronzer as well depending on your preference and how far you want to take it but as you can see you can see the way the light is bouncing on the face the spotlight for the highlights it is just truly incredible but that the face can still look natural but chiseled and dimensional all at the same time with active being that over very sharp contour of the often times we can see on social media this is about natural beautiful contouring that you can blend in and looks nice in all lights which is wonderful so there you go all the information and links are all down there in the description bar let me know your thoughts on if you try these books let me know in the comment section absolutely fantastic and I see you all soon bye bye 
karamaneh okay sir today is six us the amazing life-changing products if you let them be and I hope you do this makes that actually before we start can we just talk about one thing that's been bothering me most cleanser we all use cleanser my problem with cleansers are they're so bloody expensive now some of them are like 20 30 40 50 $80 Pro cleanser cleanser is in contact your skin for most people 10 15 seconds and then you rinse it down the drain you don't even leave it on so you're not even getting benefit from it and they're so expensive so this is one that I use now I don't recommend this one it's got fragrant this is right it's like this is good for children it's got fragrance in it is like the last ingredient but it's still got fragrance in but the reason I use this because it's like 12 quid you get a liter of it so that's why I use it but it is paraben free trial I mean a prophet was fragrance free especially using up middle of Kitty skins but it doesn't irritate me so I use it but I just thought I'd talk about cleansers I hate that they're so expensive I'd really like the Paula's Choice one but they're just really expensive there you go okay six-five changing products let's start with the first one now I did a first impressions on this and I wasn't that impressed that's why the only first impression videos because of your first impressions are not necessarily going to be amazing on something and then it turns out to be wonderful so if you meet somebody you like they could be the perfect person for you you gotta give it time so is the flawless of the Hollywood flawless filter by Charlotte Tilbury comes in different shades and people were kicking off when this was a nice because they were like this evaluation there's only seven shades then there is I think there's only six subjects but they all correlate to the foundations it's not a foundation it is who knows it is a primer highlighter illuminator hybrid I really think it's truly beautiful when used under foundation it will make your skin glow like you wouldn't believe in it's quite a thick product as well you can't really see that kind of on there but it's a really thick product and it does give the illusion of a poreless skin absolutely under foundation is great if you're going to use it over you have to literally this is way too light you have to literally dot it on the skin because this is too light too otherwise you're going to disrupt your foundation because if you sit there and really you're just going to move the foundation but under foundation it gives a porous look that is incredibly glowing and then you can dab it on afterwards if you really want to but under foundation it is absolutely stunning and really radiates light is amazing really really really like this foundation by nose this is in science very much is pretty much my shade it is the NARS radiant long wear foundation and it is absolutely beautiful a little bit goes quite a long way and it gives a really really beautiful finish to the skin it really does it is I don't know what other people have thought of this foundations is I don't watch you know the easy channels not because they're bad just not my thing but it is stunning it is so beautiful now this is a really cool product now normally stuff like this I'd be like I didn't trying that cheap but it's amazing so it is rock it's Jade my friend Jill who runs Victoria's health she said you've got to try this you meet this I'm like I don't think so lady and she was right she's always right and this is what it is you use your facial oil with this I mean the the company has their own oil you can use your own or you can use the thick moisturizer and you basically move it along the face it gives you instructions and then you kind of Pat it and press it no J is not to be cold if you just give this a go and once you've got this you've got it it's like 30 pounds or something like that but once you've got it you've got it it will de-puff your face and make your skin look so much better now there's a subtle instruction thing here right and it says in here it says a subtle reddening of the skin is likely to occur don't worry this just shows that your skin is eliminating eliminating toxins through the blood circulation I don't think that's true I can't prove it otherwise but I think the reason your skin's red is because you're scraping it with a very soft but you know it's real more and there's no jagged edges but you're scraping your skin with this that's why it's red I don't think it's boxing's but it works your skin looks lifted and deep Hough especially under the eyes and you can do on the acupuncture points as well you can go through your hairline with it it sounds like absolute shite but it really really works and it just is pretty amazing now this is an oldie but a goodie it's all B now this is the cover effect luminizing setting spray right dose pro trivia face cuz your look mental cover this section of your face spraying the outside perimeters it leaves behind you're never going to see this on camera but it leaves behind an iridescent on the skin that is so beautiful see you're never going to see that don't know why just you know no I don't do that you see what I mean it leaves behind an iridescent on the skin now if you're going to use a shimmery blush on Shanley High turn a shimmery bronzer you may not need this it is so beautiful I absolutely adore it it's not really gonna say makeup but it's certainly gonna make it look absolutely so pretty so another foundation this time toosha plan this is their all-in-one glowing foundation again I can't tell you what other people think because I don't know relatively good shade range 90 here this is the deepest shade I believe there may be a deep one I don't know but this is this is a really good shade looks lighter on the screen than it really is but it's a great shape now I love the packaging this squeezy packaging glass you know I always worry about it since I'm I'm clumsy but this works oh it's all pretty now is it gonna give you maximum coverage no it's not but it's gonna make your skin look so beautiful now in front of me are the foundations that I use and that I love they're right here this is where these go now they're that good they're amazing and speaking of another good product from the same company is they're new to ship and Bloor primus so you've got mental colors you've got a pink you've got a blue and you've got orange right so orange realm of color you never want to lighten the skin because it just says Ashley in horrible you want to brighten deep skin because then it just comes through and you see that gorgeousness this is great now what's good about this Primus is that they actually leave behind the tinted so you do need to apply a foundation over it but you can see it will leave it in now on deeper skin tones this is going to brighten up so beautifully for lighter skin tones you've got the pink and this will brighten up sort of sallow complexion is give more life to it and then you've got the blue and how let me show you this so you can have a little look come on come on this is what happens when you get a new one and not the old one this is the blue one is really really good again for sallowness but for redness the blue will really help to take down as far as I can wear well at least these are the ones that I have I don't have the green I'm not a big fan of green but these are really great for correcting primers I'm actually gonna throw in another one this is the final one this is Duchess and this is by Charlotte Tilbury it is the most beautiful pink because it has a hint of brown in it it reminds me of the old Bobbie brand days it is so pretty it is just the most gorgeous lipstick and doubled up as a blusher because you can use your lipsticks you've got loads of them so you might as well use them as a blusher so you all coordinate in there but it makes the most glorious Sun glorious sort of flush to the cheeks it's such a pretty color so there you go there's my six favorite products there you go that's it the end see simple 
here one okay so today I'm gonna be talking you through two maybe three foundation tips but infinitely more beautiful results now about four maybe five years ago I shared with you the oil technique which is how you apply oil to your foundation for more useful results now at the time of reason on video I can put any other videos on YouTube about this technique and it is such a useful technique because it gives the skin a more beautiful appearance especially as you get older in your forties onwards I will classify myself in that range as I'm 39 so maybe I get a little bit of credit for that technique know enough cheese stands alone so onto the techniques and then the tips and tricks with regard to getting more beautiful foundation the reason for adding oil to foundation needed to make the skin more luminous more hydrated and less likely of caking and the reason that we apply oil as opposed to water is water or thinned down and formulas anymore alter the formula or one we want diminish that only you're using now I tend to Bermuda waterproof foundation or a very very long lasting foundation and all the products I like are in the description bar below including really affordable options for these oils so the way to go about it is to add one two three drops of oil to your foundation I prefer to err on the side of more bit less so I have about three drops the foundation I mix it in a part of my hand then apply it to the skin with a Beauty Blender when it comes to and this will look infinitely better when you apply powder because paraffin cakey look heavy with the oil method if one it will look so much more beautiful so that's one of the greatest things to is to add one to three drops of oil to your Beauty Blender and then you apply a concealer and then go over with the Beauty Blender with the oil that is really applied to it again you will notice an infinite difference when applying pads the eye area the whole thing will just look so much more beautiful and less cakey less wrinkly just all around much much better when you're picking your foundation all I say is try to stay away from water-based foundations Mac face and body because oil and water do not mix very well at all but you can use it but they don't really mix silicone foundations tend to accept oil much much better and almost all foundations on the market are silicone base so you can bear that in mind now the funny thing is with the oil method is that you see a lot of Instagram but everywhere right and it's mostly young girls doing who truthfully probably don't need it unless they have very dry skin if you've got very nice thinning you're adding more oil to it maybe not the best thing you've already got that natural glow jizz going to come through in a couple of hours after your foundation is set but generally speaking the or method is one of the most beautiful plan your makeup to really give the most gorgeous finish to the skin and it's one that I use every single day on client now again all the oils are in the description bar we've done need a really fancy one you can absolutely just get one that's affordable to you and will work exactly the same way but I've listed all the products in the description bar which are truly wonderful wonderful oils there you go and don't forget to like this video which you probably won't do and don't forget to share it which I know you're not going to do are you sharing  Wayne yeah I know but it would be nice that's all I'm saying anyway let me know your thoughts and your thoughts on the Euler method leave them in the comment section below cuz I'll do all of peru's you know and I'll see you all soon I appreciate the time thank you bye bye 
hey everyone okay so for this video I'm going to be showing you the 80/20 technique for foundation which is really based upon the principle that we can get 80% of the results with 20% of the effort now a lot of people we love the new way of foundation where you're layering foundations and you're blending it for an hour and you get this amazing Instagram ready skin it's Celebrity red carpet Hollywood filter bollocks you know what I'm talking about but a lot of us don't have the time or the inclination to want to spend an hour and a half blending our foundation and I can get that and I understand it and I feel that way myself so I'm going to show you how to get really good results in a fraction of the time so just follow along exactly as I'm doing don't skip a step then you can start changing things once you've got it so this thing is done now first you need a mirror so I can see myself because this is not easy good vodka now I still can't see myself who cares so you're going to need two foundations you want one that's relatively similar to your skin tone and one that's darker the reason we're going for a darker foundation is because darker covers redness more beautifully than your own and shade because sometimes you need to layer your own shades to build up darker foundation covers red more easily now I'm gonna use a cream but you can use a liquid if you want so the first thing I'm going to do is pick the lightest of the shades and I'm gonna apply this right here at the kind of jawline area so right about there I'm going to add a touch of it just here at the nose and in the center of the face so that's about it I'm now going to pick the shady foundation that's a bit darker and I'm going to apply this to the bulk of the cheek the outside perimeter of the forehead and across the nose because that's where I get red you can also use your concealer at the same time as white so I will use a liquid concealer in light bisque because it's the first show that I picked up and I'm just going to dot this in this section so now take your foundation brush now obviously is better to use my foundation brush because it's heavenly link below you now you start to blend first of all you're gonna blend that the light shade to begin with so I'm just going to kind of buff the light shade into the skin first of all so I just want to buff it into the skin now you're going to do the same thing with the slightly deeper shade of foundation so buff it and morph it into the skin and don't be concerned if you start to as I just did move that foundation don't worry about with the concealer don't worry about it you can be blending in a second so just work the areas of the foundation as best you can into the skin next you want to take a damp Beauty Blender sponge that you've already pre dampened now you're going to just do the concealer and blend that in so just blend the concealer with that done we're not finished this is where we kind of take things up a notch now take your damp Beauty Blender sponge and really lightly for about 10 to 15 seconds Pat this around everything that you've just blended in now this may seem simplistic but this will go a really long way in ensuring everything is blended and is set now what that done is when blended the foundations of two shades the darker shade will cover the redness more beautifully the lighter shade will blend in with our skin tone more beautifully then we've used a Beauty Blender to push that into the skin further and then all you're going to do is take a little bit of powder get it onto the same Beauty Blender on the back of your palm or hand knock off all the exits until nothing is coming off and then Pat and set your foundation and trust me this will give you absolutely beautiful results in a fraction of the time it takes to do all of those layers in blending because we pick two colors because we buffed it into the skin and then because we pushed it with a damp Beauty Blender we get to get amazing results and you can see here that this side is much more beautiful and much more perfected and then we can go on and apply the rest of our makeup there you go that is the 80/20 technique thanks for watching don't get a comment rate and subscribe and I see you all soon bye bye 
everyone okay so today I'm going to be giving you an eyeshadow tip now some of you all know this some of you will not and I didn't know this when I first started out because eyeshadow for me was the most difficult thing to get right because I didn't really know where things ended and sometimes they'd need no wedding begin so by structuring the eye into segments it's so much easier to see where your eyeshadow should start and where it should stop so in this video I'm going to talk you through it and for me this really was when I find it life-changing because it enabled me to see the groove of where things went so the first thing you're going to do is make sure your brown brow is groomed and don't overextend a brown les you really need to so you don't need it to come all the way over here the next thing I'm going to do is place it highlight shade this shade is lighter than all the other eyeshadows you want to applied it to your eyelid if you can see your eyelid apply to your eyelid and apply to your brow bone but only apply it to your brow bone on the outside portion so this complete area here this is where you want to apply the art not all the way in now by doing this you are creating an empty space in the socket of the eye and this is going to enable you to know where the end where to apply but when to end the eye so because you see at the very end without highlighted you do not come out any farther than that area because a lot of times when we're doing eye shadow without there being a highlight or a point of reference we can kind way too far or stay way too in so we haven't come out far enough by using that reference point we can now go into the socket and know exactly where to end now you can also either effect go just go in a direct socket like motion back and forth or you can blend it up towards the eyebrow on the intersection that's a little bit more modern but it doesn't matter it's completely up to you but now you know where the arm crease color goes and where it stops you can then proceed to go on to the outside corner of the lid if you want because you know where it stopped when you connect the eyeshadow underneath you're going to get the immediate connection of the eyeshadow now I hope that that was simple and I really hope that M it helps some of you I know a lot of people will probably know that but I didn't at the time and it still saves me to David Tiffany one local people or what never met before if you're complicated eyes I can map it out so I know exactly where things are going to start and where they're going to stop I really appreciate you watching this video I really do leave your comments down there they can kind not to your tune 
everyone okay so this is a very short video because all the information is in the description bar now this video is getting you because you asked for it there were so many comments on this asking for all routines for skincare for the ordinary so we have routines in the description bar for oily skin acne prone skin dry skin sun damaged skin rosacea sensitive skin all team care routines are in the description bar and there are links for US and UK and the rest of the world - they're all there ready for you now just before I go because all the links are there I'm into my skincare routine as well it's worth noting that this video the previous video none of it is sponsored or paid for at all just in case you're wondering because I know some people like this is a sponsored video it is not a sponsor video I just thought the ordinary because they are incredibly affordable now I alternate routines because of the price point of the products i alternate routines are you set on Monday I use the routine specifically for wrinkles on Tuesday I use routine specifically for acne prone skin because I go back and forth so I just alternate every other day with those products one other thing to mention is the product I'm very very quickly because of the price point do what I do just get on a waitlist when they come in they will send you them I'm on the waitlist to some of the acids it's just the way things are there you go all the information right down there happy Cinco days and see you soon bye bye 
everyone okay so as I get older I my tastes in makeup and my preferences change which is very natural I'm not a big fan of contouring the cheeks in general anymore I'd quite like to contour the nose lightly and I like to contour the kind of hairline and sides of the temples but when it comes to the cheeks my problem is is that you're adding color here so you're gonna contour with either a bronzer a brown or a - a torpedo a brown which is fine it's going to Holloway but then you've got to add color so you're gonna add a pink or a peach or an apricot or red whatever you're going to use you then have to blend that into that contour and things start to get muddy now using is I've always used a fan brush to contour to highlight the cheeks and to apply blusher now this is my fan brush and it's a natural brush and it is so soft so I'm going to show you how I go about applying color to the cheeks to give the illusion of a lifted sculpted cheek without any contouring because I just I'm not a big fan as I get over so this is my palette it's a double palette and I'll leave the link but you can only get it in the UK I'm sorry here's my colors they're all nose so I'm gonna pick a color that I want to use on my cheek so I'm gonna pick this one now I'm going to use one blush so what I do is I take my fan brush and I just go like that just to get color on it so the colors on the center of the brush I just knock it off a little bit and what I do is I always apply blush a high up on the cheekbone I don't want to here because when we smile there's the Apple and then we love our smile and the blush is lower down towards the lip area and that never looks that beautiful in my opinion so I like to start quite high up and I start back here and I just come in a diagonal but I blend it up at the same time so I'm not going just in one direction I'm just moving it up and blending it in so I'm going to the other side so again starting quite high up now my mirror is a metre and a year and a half away from me so I can't see a bloody thing so who knows but that's how I do it so you start up high right by the hairline by the top of the year you just come down and you kind of move it back and forward not just in that one area and what this does is it starts to lift the chief but the really cool thing is is we're leaving this area the Saint close our skin tone so it's going to stand out even more I'm just going to make it a bit darker because I can't quite see it in my mirror so I'm just gonna add a little bit more color just in this section here and again I'm bringing it back and forward and the same thing again just gonna bring it back and forward nice and high on the cheekbone area if you want to make them stand out even more and this isn't contouring with color because we're not going on under the cheekbone we're going on top of the cheekbone where color goes but if you want to make this even more beautiful you can just go underneath with a bit of powder this is the powder that I tend to use and it's by you've Celeron and it's a pink it's called souffle and it's just a pink color and but by doing this you are further emphasizing the cheeks without any form of contour and then I just knock it off and all it does as it leaves this area slightly a fractionally lighter than the rest of the face so that everything starts to pull up and just look and I just love the way that that looks because to me I started working on women over 40 mainly over 50 and I wanted to pull the features up I wanted to lift the face and I found that this way worked beautifully and I've always been a fan I love our fan brushes ever since because yeah you can even curb it slightly so you can get slightly higher up but it just gives the most beautiful illusion people will wonder where highlighter goes it goes exactly same place but up a slightly higher on the tip of the cheek so I'm just going to get a little bit of this and it really is a little bit because these are the anesthesiologist so they're pretty pigmented and I just got over that top bit ever so slightly just to create a little bit of shine so that the blusher and the highlighter become one with the skin so if everything blends in perfectly and that was how I highlight and contour the cheeks with color but we don't go into the hollow we go on the cheekbone and blend it up and down slightly and we always angle it so you get this beautiful lift there you go thanks so much for watching all the information is right down there I'll see you soon bye-bye

seriously it's just a bit of fun no but when getting all worked up about it because I won't read it but on the before we get on to kind of the more fun stuff but it really is just a little bit of fun I want to start with a makeup trend that I really think needs to bow we're off in 2018 and this is a serious part for me because I think it's really important and that is filters over videos the problem with filters over videos is that they're so fundamentally dishonest and I'm not really talking about YouTube gurus or people like that I'm actually talking about the companies that are using them because they use them to promote their product and say their new foundation or concealer or powder whatever it is but oftentimes these companies they have so much money they've got a model in who's 20 years old she's got amazing skin if you need to use a filter over that kind of skin and that kind of beauty then surely there is something fundamentally wrong with a product you're trying to promote and oftentimes that product comes with a big backstory that took 20 years to develop it's the best foundation in the whole world it smooths wrinkles increases yet the user on the model who's 20 she's got a perfect skin and she doesn't need a filter but they stick one on anyway I think it's fundamentally wrong in every sense of the word because it gives the illusion that this product can do this to your skin when in fact it's computer trickery and enhancement that's doing it it's fundamentally wrong it needs to stop because it's disgusting okay so now that is over with let's get on with makeup trends that need to tie 2018 one eyebrow dear if you are my age or a bit older or a bit younger but I am that similar age baywatch I think was I don't remember her real name I think it was Shani in the show and she had almost a water breaking very close into the center of here it was really ready to go it was incredibly beautiful and sexy because it was her natural Brown why I'm earth anybody want to draw in and it's always black is why they're always like do it really done why you want to draw in an extra-thick monochrome I'm not entire and there's a lot of people out that I find very attractive they have almost a monogram but it's a natural one not drawing not with a black sharpie it's just okay eyelash nose hair now I actually saw this in real life in London and that's not a line I saw in real life I honestly thought it was a ridiculous thing line first caught a glimpse of it online then I actually saw it it just made me am sooo be horrified nose hair as you get a bit older you start to find that you get a lot of those there I'm quite a bit of their hair still not that much Chester no matter how much I do my affirmations but I'm getting over here here already I don't want war why would you pop a fake eyelash up your nostril I'm not even gonna talk about this one any longer because it's so ridiculous das over the face now dots all over the face might make for a wonderful Instagram picture and often times they do but that's it it doesn't do anything else you might as well just smudge it all over because those dots are still gonna get blended in exactly the same way if everything else and I'm seeing it a lot recently it's like a kind of revival then it went away now it's having another revival the dots do not think if you want to dot concealer a great go for it do it it's not the outcome is going to be no different to if you just swiped it on because can you blend it so if you makes you happy the dotted all over you go for it knock yourself out but would it make a difference no okay really really really skinny nose highlight now you all know what I'm talking about that ultra skinny muddy brown slightly orange ewwww it is not blended I totally get that their nose highlight thing their nose contour thing what the irony of what most people don't understand is that whatever color you using on your cheeks the nose one should be lightest the nose contour should always be the lightest it just looks more beautiful that way but that bronzy orangey ultra thin cut line on the nose and then show up and then don't blend it just walk around like that and just be like oh gee wait I'm gonna walk around like that I'm gonna like it people are going to look at me and they're looking at me because I've got a really skinny nose that's not why they're looking at you I can promise you that that's not it no skip highlight we covered this last time last year it's still here now I'm quite I like a little that's it literally it's barely that nose is in general most people want to minimize the shape of their nose sticking a beacon of light in the center of your nose is not going to minimize it it's going to draw attention to it just to reiterate anything that we highlight on our faces stands out why do you want your nose to stand out because most people want it to look smaller and yet we're doing something that's making it look massive is that really what you want because I'm thinking isn't but you'd like your damaged about trends don'tcha people well I don't thank you okay now PR box openings I have absolutely nothing wrong with people who want to do that I do not it is so far removed from what I like and what I think now if you love people to do PR box openings I'm not I'm just saying I hate it I hate fundamental about it bothers me fundamentally now I didn't grow up with a lot of money I didn't have any money growing up we were very very you know there was no extra cash not even a couple of pound as I'm older and I require more things is a beautiful thing but I work for those things the irony is that the more money you get or the the bigger your fame or the bigger your whatever it is the more free you get and now as I'm older I can buy that stuff to review great I love that it's sent for free sometimes it's wonderful I don't have to go and spend money but I can afford to go out buy it when I have my money where were those companies then they were nowhere to be seen no I had they were not on I wasn't on the radar they didn't give a about me but now I've got a lot of followers suddenly it's okay to send me free stuff I do not want to sit here with boxes and boxes of and just be talking about it he's showing you everything that I have it you don't have I and that's what it feels like to me look how spoiled I am look how I'm going for it just bothers me to the core I hate every aspect of it and I'm really not picking on anybody that likes to do the PR box openings I'm just saying is everything about that just fills me with absolute horror because I hate it I have and you do and you've got a you know I'm gonna move on to another beauty room tours right now let me tell you what a beauty room tour looks like for really really weak people stars on YouTube it is a room filled with expire makeup that's all it is it's a room filled with a million eyeshadows and 19,000 foundations and concealers and blushes that have all expired because you could never ever ever use them or ever ever but you are doing this video and people rather than you know I mean like that's something to aspire to having no mortgage is something to aspire to being a good person that's nice to aspire to writing those comments on my videos that's something to aspire to but having drawers and drawers of makeup that is so old and expired because you cannot possibly use it and there are younger people that particularly who are so impressionable who truly believe that this will make them this is a good thing it is not a good thing it is nothing to aspire to again I'd find it absolutely horrifying and finally because it's still not gone walking in London with my friend we're walking around and next to me now I always think and people don't always believe this money but you you're hard-pressed to find anybody that could care less because I honestly think you should do what you want I would rather see something look way overboard then just nothing because I think it's a part of your personality but the over sharp over blinding cheek highlight still up makes me go a little bit when I see it now there are a lot of people that can actually pull it off really really nicely and I like it that there's a certain look that they've got where they pull it off quite nicely because they all every feature is strong on their face so it kind of work but when it's this blinding metallic it just ends me but if you like it go for it it's just really not for me I don't know I dunno why I don't like it and if I don't like it that means you shouldn't - that's not the truth but I just don't like it there's something about it that just makes me not happy I think it's just because is the isn't when it's so thick and heavy it looks like it's not blended I think that's what bothers me more more than the light and the reflection and the screams I think it's more just the fact that it looks like it's not blended I think that's probably it so there you go that is the makeup trends that need to die in 2000 leave your comments right down there because it will be fun and coming up after all these videos are videos every two days of the very best products of 2017 and I'm not done them yet and it's gonna be a long day and he'll different those so that'll be fun I look forward to showing you them all looking forward to the comments in this video be nice and remember if you like everything that I just talked about that's okay I don't care you have no need to slide me off this is just a little bit of a fun video okay and I'll see you all soon 
everyone okay so this is how to get amazing skin and just look really really healthy in 60 seconds I'm applying a blusher applying this to the cheeks the nose the temples and this is my go-to look for filming for men for grooms and for women who just want to apply the least amount of makeup and look really healthy when the blush is applied I'm applying mineral makeup over all of that to blend it in because I want the skin to look slightly red as in it's been out in the Sun you've just caught the Sun and you're looking really really beautiful which is how this look came about because I love the fact that blusher is coming through the skin it's not sitting on top of the skin next I'm going to apply a little bit of RCM a powder just going to dot this around the face and buff it in to set things just to keep all control throughout the day then I'm going to spritz the face to take away any residue of powder and that is the look it's great and it's my go-to look for filming for grooms for women that beachy look thanks very much and I'll see you all soon thank you bye bye 
here one okay so today I'm going to be showing with you and you conceal a technique in Minami new for you who knows but let's get started so what you're going to need is a concealer a little sponge a tissue and a brush so the whole point of this tutorial and this concealer technique is to work product into the skin the Instagram concealer so to speak is going nowhere so we want to try and work it so that it's into the skin and looks like it's a part of the skin so it's beautiful and flawless so I'm going to be using this concealer by Bobbi Brown as the intensive skin serum and I'm going to be using bisque so I'm actually can apply it quite heavily for this tutorial and I'm just going to kind of go like this so I'm applying quite a lot of product more than you need then you're gonna take a brush now I'm gonna use my brush number 19 because this is great for this and I'm going to also explain a really cool thing you can do but I couldn't be bothered to show it so what you're going to do is you're going to use the brush first to work the product into the skin now I'm leaving the under-eye bit for a second because that's the bit I'm going to talk to you about so you're working the product into the skin into the inner corner and act now I'm going to stop here and explain if you've done your eyeshadow first which most people probably are doing now when you start to go here right here you can arch it an architect so you can clean up the line that you've just done with your eye shadow giving you the most beautiful and perfected look and also if you just knock off a little bit on the back of your hand anything that because you can get quite a strong line you can just really lightly buff it to make it look like it's part of the skin so you're working this into the skin with your brush and it goes all the way up to the lash line and down and you'll want to blend it and feather it out into the rest of the skin now you're going to take a tissue now trust me this is pretty much pointless but it works because you're just trying to take out any excess product but we really worked it into the skin so you just want to dab just to take any excess product act so there is a little bit on there as you can see now you're going to use a damp Beauty Blender sponge or a damp sponge and you're now going to press that into the skin so you've already worked it into the skin it is completely flawless there's bugger-all product left because it's all into the skin and now you push it into the skin with the damp Beauty Blender and now and this is the joyful bit you can now powder this I mean won't go anywhere and it looks like your skin because you work the product into the skin with my number 19 brush available in the link below because you've worked it into skin with the brush first you've also pleaded it out so it becomes a part of the skin so even though we've gone lighter is blending into the rest you've then blended it in with a Beauty Blender sponge and then you just set it with powder however you want and that is it and it is truly life-changing because for those of you who struggle with concealer looking heavy under the eyes or cakey you are working it in you are pressing it in and you're absorbing any excess product of which there is pretty much you know it's a really minimal amount because of all that work and that's it your concealer will look amazing and because you can do your eye makeup first and as you're working that concealer just work it up and out to give your eye in beautiful lift and there you go that's the technique I love doing these videos let me know what you think or comments down below and links and I'll see you all soon bye bye 
Caroline okay so today is a really really exciting video to me because I get to share with you products that I absolutely love or product as this thing and no idea what that is probably that is chocolate I hope I get to share products that I really really love and this one so I think do you remember probably two months ago I did a video on the ordinariness about their foundation the colors and it's the colors are amazing foundation and probably the biggest foundation launch of the year as I mentioned that video because they were so inexpensive this is nothing to do with the ordinary now there are two liquid foundations that I truly love and have done for years Ellis fast and make it a today Paris waterproof foundation they are my two liquid staples I love them this foundation is brand new foundation in my opinion is the best single best liquid foundation I have ever ever tried ever there is nothing negative to say apart of one thing which we'll get to in a minute so as many of you will have guessed it is and I'm going to show you a full demonstration is the double wear nude water fresh makeup by Estee Lauder now this isn't sponsored or even my grandma this is a water-based foundation now the river stream water base in silicon bases silicon bases tend to feel good and they slide around a lot before they set a water-based foundations tend to set very very quickly now this is an SPF of 30 which is wonderful and it claims to have incredibly long wear and I can attest for that or at espera even what I'm going to do is stick it on my face and then talk you through why it's so amazing now what you can't see but you could if you could feel me is right here and under here is really dry because I use retin-a and it makes your skin for a while feel really really unpleasant like your smile and it just turns white and cracks if I were to put foundation liquid foundation over this it looks horrific particularly silicon-based ones they've just clean like you wouldn't believe now I'm able to use this over those areas and buff it in with my number thirteen brush and nothing there's no sticking to it amazing so I'm going to use shade for c1 oh this is pretty much perfect color match as you can get so I'm going to got it onto my face and then we're going to talk about the negative in a second so I just buff it in and I like to be relatively vigorous with this because this gives the most tallest finish I mean really really paulus when you combine it with my number thirteen brush which is I think just the most amazing brush you get poreless skin with this so let me just so this is what I call one coat now the company says that it is light to medium coverage and I would absolutely attest to that some people will think it's really sheared is more sheer when you apply it with your hand or a sponge but with a brush my number thirteen it really really does give you a good medium finish so I see I haven't added any more I'm just smoothing out the edges underneath here nice light ellipse there is nothing it doesn't it still feels dry but it's not clinging to any patches it's not um being irritating or ugly or like all the other foundations that are still a time-weighted do and there's nothing wrong with silicon very foundations they're fabulous but they do not love dry skin that's why so many women get on with Mac waterproof on Mac face and body especially those with dry skin because it doesn't cling the same way so I think leaving the face of full of foundation that the ounce because the one way to make but quite ill so I'm going to do the what I call the blusher so I like to apply two dots above the eyebrows a dot on my nose and a couple of dots on the cheekbone area and then I'm just going to buff those in already so all the benefits are absolutely amazing there is one negative and that is it doesn't come with a pump and this is a really big deal right because this is a high-end foundation and with all high-end foundations they should come with a pump there is no excuse but for the price of five dollars you can buy a pump now I will continue to repurchase this foundation regardless because it is amazing I'm not happy about there not being a pump there should be a pump estee lauder we need a pump it should come with a pump is a high-end foundation we know they cost not a lot it's going to use bad word not least bad word it has to come with a pump just start with the nonsense about you know dull where the original giveaway is so good and I was so late coming to the game because I'm so faithful to my liquids and it's such a great foundation I want to come that times like I want to pump which I probably no I just want to pump or for this bottle that's all I'm asking for so let me know if you try this if you have an all inked are in the description box I promise you it is better than all of the other foundations I have ever personally spoke about all my liquid foundations this one is better than all of them every single one I ever ever mentioned and that blows my mind there you go right on there and I'll see you all soon bye-bye 
hammer-on okay so today I'm going to be going through the all-day eyelash technique and this is the trick or technique in order to keep your eyelashes called pentaiah day because they just fall out so what you're going to need is an eyelash color you're going to need a waterproof mascara and a regular mascara now I'm going to be using waterproof mascara but I'm actually going to be using the curator wand for this which is from hourglass and the reason being is because it applies such a tiny tiny amount of mascara so I'm actually just going to dip this directly into the waterproof of sky so the way this works is it's twofold you curl your lashes and apply the mascara the waterproof mascara first you apply that thinnest coat you've ever applied you then go and do something else do your face do your eyebrows whatever you want a coffee play with yourself who cares then when they're completely dry you come back so let's start this technique first thing we're going to do is just plant the eyelashes and you want to give them a really good curl so hold this curl for about 30 seconds a minute would be brilliant but 30 seconds is fine now when they're curled you want to get your waterproof mascara and remember you're not applying much and you want to wiggle this and apply this to the full lash completely so it's only a smattering of the waterproof mascara that's enough now let that completely dry and the reason we're using a waterproof mascara now imagine curling your hair with a heated Tom and then putting gel in it if the pool of Caroline because mascara is in general or water-based now a waterproof mascara is oil-based so holds the curl much better so this is like a primer for the ice we're gonna let is completely dry then we'll come back so when it's dry you're going to take your eyelash color again and you're going to Rico your lashes now don't worry we only applied the faintest amount so they're not going to be ripped out or anything like that so you want to just recall the lashes and you want to hold this curl for another 30 seconds now when it's all curled take your regular mascara so I'm just going to be using the l'oreal voluminous carbon black I'm just going to get rid of the excess and then just apply the rest of your mascara and then the curl will now hold all day long and that's the tip thanks for watching leave a comments down there and I'll see you next time bye bye

highlight at all this is all I have this is highlighted and I'm gonna talk about two of them because one is brand new and I'd kind of like that about whether or not it is going to stay in here but it's really good so it's not about the first one which is the artist could show this is the diamond glow powder these are the permanent additions and these are the ones I travel with these are so good they offer beautiful beautiful shimmering effect the really good thing about highlighter is that it changes everything you can have two or three blushes and each of the highlighter is going to look different over each of those blushes so you can change things up I love the diamond polish you get 4.5 grams of each container and they are truly truly beautiful so they're to win it and the ones I'm sorry I'm sure about not in terms of quality because they're amazing but just in terms of whether I want them to remain in my kids because I make it so small now and I love it are these new ones and thereby back up and these are the light chaser hose and these are for space and the ISO they double up to highlight of all as an eye shadow now they're different colors and each of these can be applied to the face or eye and they have a metameric quality about them which means they catch the light in a slightly different way and give off a slightly different effect there is one two three four five six to choose from the six archiving kind there is six and they are really really good the only reason I'm sure is just because I like to keep the tiniest kit if I decide to keep these in my kids may not need to have to remove some anything that depresses me because I don't want to have some ridiculous guru kit where you know you've got a mountain of exposure makeup so I want to keep

everyone on occasion today's video is five reasons to love cake save five reasons to love heavy foundation application now something going everything in I don't this contradict what you just said in the previous video that's the beauty of makeup it's only makeup it washes off it doesn't matter what my opinion is or your opinion is because it's makeup it's so you know it's a wonderful thing but it's just nonsense you know you do yourself a nice big smoky eye didn't work out you can wipe it off you can wash it off it is amazing so I'm gonna give you five reasons why heavy foundation is a bloody good idea so let's make a start the first one and this one I love your foundation costs a lot of money and you want everyone to notice it and this is a true true story a friend of mine uses foundations by Tom board and I asked her one bit she loves the Tom quadrant I also wondered why do you have so much foundation as in wine is so heavy she she literally said I was Tom Ford that stuff's expensive I want every  to know how much it cost I absolutely love that there is absolutely nothing wrong in in that thing I think it's hilarious I love Tom Ford Foundation's they cost an absolute bomb it is true I love that statement it fills me with joy when I hear that and I think of that you know it is just it's spot-on I think in my world is just a cracking cracking segment okay so number two you want to look beyond flawless now we all know that the more foundation we apply the more flawless our skin looks because the floors are being blurred away and there's nothing wrong with that a lot of people want to go that extra step to create that illusion of um you know mental skin really where the skin looks in a number looks real you know the look because we see it often now there's nothing wrong with that again it's just makeup but a lot of people love that heavy look they want to look beyond the and that is how to get there by using more foundation you're going to cover everything on your face yes you will end up looking like a kabuki it is true but you will have beyond flawless without a day number three you like the heavy look a lot of people like heavy makeup you know personally for me I like when the skin looks like skin it looks like you could touch it look like their own skin that is my preferred preference but a lot of people love a heavy look and they like a heavy look with their foundation and concealer no powder in them kinda suck em is just makeup yet I prefer really lifelike looking the skin but some people love a heavy look it's no big deal if you like heavy looks go for it no one can tell you not to I may not love it you may adore it and that's what really matters it is you you're the one wearing it you gotta love it and if you love it rock it number four you aren't a photograph amazingly it is true the matte skin photographs more beautifully than shiny skin what I mean whether in matte foundation but a lot of foundations on the market are juries so we don't pound them which therefore takes away the doing this and then we had in shimmers and highlights and all the rest and then we glow like star but it's true that heavy foundation photographs love you've ever been in a setting where there's a photographer and they're taking your photo or on like the set of an editorial you'll notice that the foundation for that is much much heavier than it is in real life because it's photographed so beautifully and it truly does it also films more beautifully sometimes remember the video I just did the one on the contrary right the end of that right did my skin look mental it'll look beyond flawless because you can apply that kind of makeup on camera or on a photograph and it will look amazing but in real life it's very very heavy and there are two different things but if you want to photograph really well adding more foundation and selling it with powder will really go a long way in making you look more beautiful more useful in photographs because it's photographs bloody well and number five you have skin issues that need covering now Laura Mercier singer camouflage is a wonderful thing if you've only got a couple of lemons you can use this tinted moisturizer and then just apply a dab here they're amazing but if you've got acne or lots and lots of blemishes going in with a concealer on every single spot or blemish is so dis harming and I highly recommend against it there is nothing to make you feel lower and lower and lower about yourself than going in and having to touch up every single spot if the cases that the majority of his skin needs covering use a full coverage foundation because your self-esteem is going to go up a notch because you're not having to just go over and over and over every little dot there are lots of skin conditions that need a fuller coverage foundation in order to conceal them and there's nothing to be ashamed of in that for years I've been promoting full coverage foundations because you can use them full coverage or share them and depending on where you need AB sponge adding water to it whole host of other things but the skin concerns full coverage foundations are amazing and they want allow your self-esteem to remain more intact than having to Spock until every single blemish on your face which is and as I remember from years ago incredibly soul-destroying so there you go that is 5 reasons to love heavy foundation now let me know in the comments section what your thoughts are in foundation whether or not you are one of those girls who just love or boys who love a full face of makeup and your life can't give a I love it or whether you want to look completely natural like got nothing on axle to be honest with myself and when I film not today but normally I put a mineral foundation on and then what I do is I take a tissue I like going out my face to get rid of is much alike a bossing you know get rid of which kind of makes me think you might have put so much on the threat space light bulb moment leave me comments in there and I will read them and I see you ought to tell me five reasons why you love or just like heavy makeup let me know by Mike 
everyone okay in this video I'm going to be showing you the biggest mistake that I see beauty gurus make and other sort of social media outlets such as Instagram when it comes to contouring and highlighting so the first thing we're going to do here is apply foundation liquid foundation is going over the skin so this is layer 1 next we're going to apply highlighter so I'm applying this down all the areas of the face that I want to stand out so underneath the eyes bridge of the nose to forehead down the sides of the nose you know any areas that you want to stand out so this is layer two layer three we are contouring so apply product to all the areas you wish to contour the nose the forehead the cheeks the jaw line any areas you wish to contour now I'm applying it in the same manner that I see a lot of people apply contour they apply quite a lot and they apply it very heavily around the forehead area in particular now I've actually use a lighter shade on the nose but regardless this is sort of the areas that I see a lot of contouring happen so let's hold it here can you see what's happened now what I'm talking about here is because of the amount of product that has been used such as the contour and the highlight the layer of foundation that we applied first makes this whole process non-existent we didn't need to bother putting that layer of foundation on because the amount of concealer and contour that we've used is so extreme that it blends onto the skin completely therefore making that layer of foundation completely redundant it was absolutely unnecessary and believe me that layer that one layer makes a huge difference when you're talking about layering products like we're doing in this tutorial because it's so heavy and it's so extreme that every layer builds up and it builds up thicker and thicker as it goes along and it's incredibly important when you're thinking about contouring your face or highlighting it that you're very very conscious about layering because while this this technique may work if you're 60 if you're 26 36 46 and Beyond it's going to look very very different okay so let's stop here again so you can see it's all blended in now if the problem we've got now is because so much consoles use we now need to go back in with highlighter to add more light to the face because we've over compensated with the dark so we're now going to add another layer so layer 4 in order to compensate and bring back life to the face and bring back light to the face so next we need to set everything obviously so we're laying layer number five all over the face and we're setting with powder we're adding layer 6 and this is the under I baked and underneath the jaw the cheekbone I'm sorry and of course the size of the nose you okay so now we're just going to dust all of that off now I'm a big fan of baking it does make a really big difference to the way the skin looks and certainly photographs but you can see that we're adding layer upon layer and we're not done yet I'm still going to add I'm not actually going to add bronzer but I'm still going to add highlighter and blusher next comes highlighter so layer seven applying this to the cheekbone area and I'm not applying it overly hard because you know I don't want to frighten anyone eh-eh and this is the final step for me which is the blushes so just a small amount of blush now there's no doubt as you can see from the footage here that the skin looks incredibly flawless but trust me in daylight this would frighten children it is incredibly heavy it's incredibly hard and while it photographs beautifully you need to remember that all these layers are completely unnecessary just by removing one or two layers can really make the face look more human thanks for watching and I'll see you all soon bye bye 
hey everyone I okay sorry about the attire and the shiny face just come back from the gym okay so this is my favorite products from Charlotte Tilbury because a lot of people have been asking what my hunt top picks are for this so let's make a start and it's not a huge amount the first one would be the instant looking at palette and this is the smoky eye look so you actually get a black in here and it's a matte is it absolutely beautiful this these Basha is first of all but in the matte version you've got bar of gold which is been pressed which is brilliant this is a beautiful palette there's a top it's just perfect I shadow palettes my favorite pits would be the vintage vamp which will always be look at that I mean that is a beautiful product then it would be the sophistica which is beautiful and following up with the iconic dolce vita palette that red is heavenly pencils or on the side of pillow talk because pillow talk is just the perfect pencil and rockin Kohl in black because it is so easy to smudge out and just be delicious with so that's the pencil side of it blushes are all good but my favorite is first love which is so subtle this is the shiny shimmery version it is so beautiful as mentioned in other videos flawless finish airbrush powder is absolutely divine it comes in three shades from light to dark and it is more moaning than most powders the retoucher if you're looking for a concealer because it blends out really really beautifully and it's just your kind of average really good concealer and highlighter film-star bronze &amp; Glow is absolutely beautiful and the shade of bronze is lovely I also really like the chameleon sticks which are the pencils and these are just really really long wearing and you can put them into your water time as well as far as gifts go this is good because of the colors so this is the lip archive and this is a set and you get me I'll show you the colors I'll save my favorite to the last so you get in here miss Kensington which is absolutely stunning I'm obsessed with new lipsticks I could give two shits about reds that's just my thought you also get between the sheets which is gorgeous as well more on the pink side and then you get my favorite which is confession and this is everything this lipstick color confession and bitch perfect on my favorite lip colors so that is absolutely gorgeous you can also try a lip masterclass which is a full set you get the lipstick pencil and lip gloss in here there are other things that I've got as well the beauty icon is quite nice and I'll show you in the box the box is kind of whether or not you want to spend that kind of money on a set but this is really nice you get full-size lip pencil and the rest is kind of the mini versions of skincare and then you also get the if you really want to kind of treat yourself or somebody else there is this now this is because I like to carry mini so this is good it opens up into a little box let's just plunk it down on the side here and you just open up and inside you've got supermodel model body you have got it's like Christmas is this you've got a makeup remover I mean who doesn't mean that what's in here you have got something delicious your eyes to mesmerize in Jean jeans a good color that's a good color actually one more we just do want to learn your name I'm good little baby lipstick a little baby mascara come on so you can always try that if you really want you know I'd rather buy full sizes myself but this is still pretty nice too it's entirely up to you but that's my favorites all the links are down there and that's my favorite shell top ring I'll see y'all soon boy 
everyone okay look at this in the way this is my skincare routine a lot of you have asked for it so I have decided to film it everything that I've seen this video is my exact skincare routine 100% all mine and therefore the results I get are based upon the products that I use for myself my skin is different to yours so bear that in mind I'll put all the links to the products in the description bar plus cheaper alternatives so let's make a start cleanser first cleanser I use is the Polish choice clear pour normalizing cleanser this is the one I like it's really nice for my skin and I still get breakouts despite Flatman approaching 40 soon still get breakouts this is the cleanser that I like he doesn't strict my skin it doesn't irritate it every day twice a day i tote my skin oh by the way nothing in this video and always sponsored paid for all been sent it's all my stuff just so we know okay so this is the toner I use twice a day again Paula's Choice skin balancing cleanser for normal to oily and combination skin twice a day morning and night I use that you're going to see a lot of Paula's choice here reason being I have been using them for about 17 years they are and always have been my favorite love other companies love some of their product but I always my skin is so problematic Paula's Choice does me good so I exfoliate twice a day chemically I don't scrub or rub at my skin because it irritates it and it causes breakouts and bumps so morning or evening depending on how I feel I use the clear anti redness solution so this is the one that I use and this is the 2% extra strength and then at night or morning depending on how I feel I use the resist and this is the new one that I'm using this is brand new i but I was using the H a before but this is the resist advanced smoothing with eh-eh so I alternate between BHA and AJ because one exfoliates the poor PHA and a chain exfoliates the surface once a night I use a retinol product now I use two different ones that I ultimate so Monday I'll use one Tuesday use the other and then I go back and forth so this is by NeoStrata and this is called the renewal cream it is a retinol product with 12% pH a so this is what I use and then on the alternate night I use clinical 1% retinol treatment and this is very very very very strong it is so strong so start off twice a week and build up it is really really strong once a week I will exfoliate incredibly well and I use the drunk elephant and this is the baby facial the TLC baby facial this is a really really good product now the ordinary as I've mentioned over and over we're going to make amazing amazing products and not all of them agree with my skin but they are truly phenomenal and the reviews are outstanding and I highly recommend them so for all of these products there are cheaper alternatives if you need them and they're all down there now three times a week I use the ordinary and I use the powerful of poic acid I use that three times a week because any more is too strong it is amazing evening out the skin tone so that's why I use it and I've never found anything better than that so that is Holy Grail eye cream I use Charlotte Tilbury and this is the magic eye rescue everything in charlotte tilbury sign is magic or it's Hollywood or it's something so this is what I use it's really really nice it's really hydrating I am nearly forty I mean hydrate my eyes sunscreen that's the last thing I put on now there are two that I used Connect SPF 30 mineral sunscreen for the body I apply this all over my face because I'm not by the body one because you get 30 emails for the same price new thanks when it's the same ingredients why would I do that so I use the body this lasts 120 days I use one point something mils every day all over or I use the trunk elephant sheer physical defense another reason I use this because it's bloody big that's why I use them am I using some 30 mil sunscreen that's going to last me exactly one month and it's going to cost me 30 pounds or 40 pounds yeah I'm not going to do that that is my entire routine a couple of times a week I might use a face mask and I go between using neon which is the mud I forgot the name of it is over there and I'm gonna have to move to get it come on it's not there it's in the bathroom flour mud I believe it's called it is amazing and when you rinse all this bright red and when you rinse it off this tingles this thing slightly that's a great mess or use the Paula's Choice charcoal mask really really good but that's the products that I use these are all mine not sponsored not sent these are mine not paid for hope I made that clear because you know people are all over your dress choose this line you know I do pretty much just use polished choice do use some of the ordinary when the drunk elephant runs out I would just be using the ordinary they've got the 30 percent the 30 percent exact same versions is basically but a bit different so I'm using that as far as oils go I absolutely do use an oil and I use the I know you're going I used the vintage thought one and the only one you gonna hate it's because of the price because it is outrageously expensive that is what I use at the end after I've applied the retinol because it is just so good I'll show you the bottle if you want to have it a week here it is it's absolutely still that skincare this basically all that skincare that you see there is all this stuff here in multiples come on I run an atmosphere that's all I'm saying so that's what I use that's it that's what I use that's my skincare now all the information is down there and all the other foot more affordable alternatives down there as well and I'll see you soon bye

hey everyone I created today I'm going to be sharing with you my top 5 products from the ordinary and the ordinary has literally taken the world by storm so before we go with the product let me just really quickly say to you that the product sell out very very quickly then they get restocked and then they sell it very quickly again please don't be kicking off to the vendors because it's not their fault that the products are not in stock they are constantly battling with stock issues so please bear that in mind now all the links for US UK and Europe are in the description bar below now one more thing before we get on I recently read a review from a company that I really respect and the main issue they had with the ordinary was that they were saying that it takes more than one ingredient in order to build a skincare routine and they're absolutely right the bit that they missed was the whole point of the ordering is that you build your own skin care routine whether it's two products three products five products and that's what they miss when reviewing these products is that if you were to use three products at night and three in the morning as an example you would still not be spending the same amount on a single high-end product yet you will be getting six times the amount of volume so for one really high-end product at 30 mils you could get six ordinary products and you would have I don't know 30 60 you would get a huge hundred 20 mils of product it that's what kind of curved me about the you know it takes more than one skincare ingredient of course it does that's the point of the ordinary oh let's make a star these are my top 5 products so the first one is the author um let me start again the alpha lipoic acid 5% now this is my favorite of all of the product range is also the most problematic if you have very sensitive skin this product is not for you you can use this a maximum of two to three times a week or on the side of caution with two this is the only product that I have used where you will wake up instantly with better brighter skin it is phenomenal but you can't use it every day you just can't it's too potent okay so let's talk about the next one now I'm still sticking with is a leak acid at 10% now is a leak acid has brightening effects on the skin but research has shown that it acts like a retinoid and event or peroxide product so meaning it exfoliates it disinfects the skin and it teaches the skin cells to behave younger so basically they're not getting called the pore lining is not getting clogged so for those of you with problematic skin is a lead acid is the answer or one of the answers this is my holy grail of eye cream the canting solution 5% this is very very strong for an eye cream so you need to ballad in mind couple of drops morning and night you will see an immediate difference in your IRA you get 13 mils of product for an eye product most eye products tend 15 mils if you're lucky and this is strong and again you're talking about building a routine for those of you who want a very specific routines for acne aging sun damage rosacea I will get them for you in another video and I will put down every single product for every single skin category moving on again for aging skin for acne prone skin for sun damaged skin retinol advanced 2% this is the one that will everybody needs the retinol it is the one product that has been shown to work to reduce wrinkles to reduce breakouts this is the product you need if you want younger looking skin fresh looking skin brighter looking skin if you have sun damage acne age spots that's the product and finally we're going to be talking about the high spreadability fluid primer this is the from the eye into prefer they have the other primer which is great but this is my preference again 13 of all of these products are 30 mil this works great as your primer islands use it just on the t-zone but if I'm going to use mineral makeup all over the face because it just adds for a nicer base and that is it that's my top 5 products remember in a video coming out I will be sharing with you all of the routines for like I said acne skincare sun damage aging skin sensitive skin you name it I've got routine to you thanks so much information all down there on these products see it Cymbeline 
heroin okay so I'm going to get a haircut next week this video is about longer eyelashes now in a lot of videos when I do in our tutorial oftentimes people comment well people have noticed I rarely put mascara on my lower lashes so I want to discuss that what you can do about that and I want to do it honestly and frankly because otherwise it's all just a little bit of nonsense so the reason I don't put mascara on my lower lashes is truthfully being completely honest I have got very few lashes I've got more here and almost zero on the outside corner they're not a great feature of mine I don't have really good lower lashes I don't have great upper lashes either I'm very jealous at men with dark eyelashes and it looks so sexy and handsome I don't have that so when I put mascara on my lower lashes they look absolutely dreadful it looks awful why would I want to make a feature of something that isn't great and a lot of people say and I see that happening a lot it's like you wanna oh you're gonna put mascara on your lower lashes even though that fuckhole there right and you just screaming look I have no lashes look how horrible I look never ever make a feature of something that isn't great if you don't have a lot of lower lashes okay you don't have a lot lower lashes big deal don't make a feature of it don't don't put a spotlight on it go look at my lashes they are dreadful there's no point in doing that never make a feature of something that isn't great and if you don't have good lower lashes you're never gonna get them really unless you want to put something on them like a lower false lash and they are problematic to say the least to put on no just go okay don't have good lower lashes and focus on something you do have that is really good and another thing is a slight shadow underneath the eye connecting your shadow your eye shadow goes a long way generally speaking originally lower eye shadow is used to give the illusion that the lash lower lashes were creating shadow because shadows are gray and they would use a gray tone around the eyes will give the illusion of a shadow so you can use eye shadow underneath the eye which is what I tend to do in videos but again don't make a feature in is not good a lot of people don't have really good lips reef full lips okay you don't have really full lips don't wear a really dark lipstick you know unless you really love a dark lipstick then wear the dark lipstick but it's gonna make your lips look there there's no way about it to me I always think and I really like a dark lip right actually that's not true I'm not a huge fan of red lips I don't know why I just I always like really nude lips that's just the way it is I don't know why but red lips are great but I just they're not for me for whatever reason like winged eyeliner through a smoky eye it's not my thing you know were each to their own we love what we love but always play out the features of your face that you like that are your best features whatever they may be maybe your nose and maybe your cheeks and maybe your lips and maybe your eyes and maybe your eyebrows whatever it is play out the features that are wonderful and try and remove the spot from those areas of our face there just aren't good for me it's my lower lashes they are shaped honestly I've sent them affirmations I've written them love letters I've treated them to a three-course meal at a restaurant of their choice they still don't want to know me what can I do nothing I've just got to accept that that's just the way they are and I don't want it I don't like it but it's tough titties and that's just the way it is there you go that's the honest truth about what to do if you have very few low eyelashes just don't make a few children and I see awesome let me know in your comments what your thoughts are and I'll see you soon bye bye 
I've got a little thing here right because this camera autofocus is really well because he myself so I don't know what's going on so anyway favorite lipsticks of 2017 now I only use I don't only use one brand but it pretty much 99% whose only one brand that's the Charlotte Tilbury ones mainly because I really like the color range and I like the texture of the lipsticks so this is the lipsticks and they indeed potted now this is my favorite palette generally speaking I what I do is it doesn't really matter what I do but I tend to sample these and just give the the bullets away out do it generally speaking I prefer all the nude shades I'm not a big fan of anything red ever it's just not my thing but my favorite shades in here if you start basically from the first five from this section here I will list them all but that first shade is called nude Kate and it's amazing now this shape here is called bitch perfect if you only get one shade for a nude lip get bitch perfect it is beautiful if you have deeper skin it is stunning and it's one of those news that will not make you look washed out or ill or you know generally unwell but they are all my favorite I'll put links but bitch perfect is my absolute favorite lipstick ever I'm just gonna move as you can see and I'm just gonna get this palette if you do want to kind of switch things up the new lipsticks by your makeup forever they're called artists Rouge now they come in a whole host of shades as you can imagine I tend to defer these anything nude but you get the chance here to mix if you use these colors you can mix and create your own shades by using the white and I like the blue the gray the blacks you can start to alternate shades but for those of you looking to create a kind cheaper version of lipsticks these pallets are the jelly venom products you know that happy jelly beans in I just haven't removed the sticker on this that's what I get get these eat them and then press your lipsticks into these these sealed shut and these stay really really good can't move so I'm going see you all soon paper lipsticks mix down there bye-bye 
fareweii go today I'm going to be showing you five products that I absolutely would buy again what I'm going to do is show you alternatives as well or cheaper products so that there is something for everyone and if all the five products is only one product that there is no cheap alternative for so that's the one we're going to start with first so the product line would answer you by again although I doesn't see the reason to because it's going to last forever is this product called zip dead double IP and it is a microcurrent device now current device I should say and you put it on and this actually runs off an iPhone app it's already got one program in it but it runs off iPhone app whether it's different programs that acne recalls lifting there's a men's program as well and what we do is apply a conductive gel to your face which is the golden conductive treatment and then you move the device over the face and instantly you can feel this tingling in the skin it's not painful you go all over the eye socket around the eye socket and this is a one product that I use as I spoke about before that actually pull the eyelid back open again so it is an absolutely amazing device it is incredibly expensive which is why they're in alternative or but it's in budget is the one product that will just keep going and worse and you can do it everyday you can use different settings you might have and actually if you've got a spot you can move it over and you can feel this intense tingling on it this spot dries up it's really cool okay so product I would buy again is the TLC and this is like my John elephant in this big guy colic serum which is I believe 10% off hydroxy acid with two percent better hydroxy acid it is so good and in absolutely amazing you get $13 a product for alternative version cheaper version you've got the ordinary lactic acid 10% and then you would need to buy the salicylic acid at 2% you could combine a couple of drops in each is your hand mix them up and then you would get the equivalent so whichever either either it's entirely up to you this product is probably if any of you watched it for a long time you all know that my favorite liquid foundation was Ellis pass that got passed by May 13 Paris and visit their waterproof foundation this is my favorite foundation in liquid format it is so good it really is waterproof it offers a really good medium coverage that you can build up if you need to but I've never needed you but you absolutely could but it's so beautiful you mix it with oil it is the most gorgeous texture that gives you longevity with the shine D Rezac on the alternative product to that would be very very similar would be if it was here will be the Revlon Colorstay foundation they're nearly the same but not quite because they make that anyone has pain has a much less advanced finish to it so you need to bear that in mind if you add oil to rub on Collister you'll get heavenly combination that is absurd beautiful ring on my favorite palette of all time is coco mirage by Tom Ford it is your basic brown eyeshadow palette and it is absolutely gorgeous Charlotte Tilbury also has one this is brand news is the sophistica so they're very very similar but the Tom Ford one doesn't have any gray shadow in it where's the chart everyone does but alternatives for these would be basically any brown eyeshadow from makeup geek because makeup geek do beautiful eyes oh and they are so affordable and they're beautifully pigmented and just all round so good I have every single one of her eye salutes because they are so wonderful but these are just Coco Mirage which is so good no equivalent for this because it's so avoidable is our tomato powder you can literally set your entire face with it and change the color foundation it doesn't leave a huge heavy imprint on your skin but those we who want to know what the difference is between that and Laura Mercier translucent I'll let you know in other videos I've done a comparison so they know and finally this is not the Beauty Blender mini this is from Primark inside I think they're like two pounds for like two or for some international dishes and these are even better than the little baby Jesus because they're slightly firmer but only just and the slightly bigger and they cost and that's why they're so good I prefer these only the mini version mine over the smaller Beauty but it's the bigger beauty blender that really isn't any that do the exact same thing there are some little really really good out there I've reviewed them but none that are identical to Beauty Blender see you said online but the mini one the Billy marvelous now all Billings are in the description bar below so you cannot see some out if you choose to but these are the products that I really really would buying in absolutely so let me know in description bar what are your favorite products but regardless of saving products let's do another random comment in the comment section type of word random and then give me something completely random and buy themselves through you did today last week anything in the world is random just totally unrelated this video because it makes the fun really we can all then this is we chose random thoughts about things and I'll see you all soon July 
here on okay so today I'm going to be going through my morning routine with you in morning ritual and this video is kindly sponsored by aluminate and they are such a lovely company so this is an absolute joy to make now all the information is in the description bar along with 2010 of code which is just wonderful so all of that is right down there now the range the University and the ritual is the luminous veil oh and it is their core range of products that really deliver brightening results to the skin now if the Velo range contains a rare ingredient of super fruit which is an Arctic which is called Arctic cloud very as it contains vitamin A and double the amount of vitamin C two times the amount compared to say oranges what you're getting with this routine is intense hydration and brightening will skin benefits then you will actually see the moment you start to use these products now all these products also contain Arctic spring water which increases the hydration levels of the product it is such a great great range so what I'm going to do is talk you through show you how to use it so let's make a start so the first product that I'm going to use and apply to the safe is the luminous veil over glow boost now this offers intense hydration to the skin and it really will make a massive difference to those of you with dry skins parched skin dehydrated skins that kind of sort of skin texture you'll get the best result you want to apply a couple of drops and I like to just kind of move it around in my hands and then I just apply it to my face and kind of I like to apply a small amount of pressure because I want the product to absorb it and absorb it so quickly there's no greasy residue with this or anything unpleasant which is wonderful and I go all around the outside and in so primitive just to really make sure it's all sunk in and if you can kind of feel my skin now it's gone the product is absorbed immediately and this will get in and brightening results you'll actually see the brightness in your skin which is such a wonderful aspect to this product well I don't have favorites I love this product so step two we're going to be using an eye cream and this is the luminous veil Oh bright eyes now I like to apply to the pumps and apply this with my middle finger all around the outside perimeter underneath the eye and I apply it quite generously because this will depart and help with darkness around the eyes so you're really going all the way around the bone here I'm massaging it in gently D puffing darkness and again we've got the same added benefit with the Arctic cranberry the hydration levels beautiful so just apply it really cunningly around the perimeter of the eye so next I'm going to apply the illuminate Velo glow reveal now this is your moisturizer and this feels incredible when you start to apply this I apply this all over the skin everywhere because again I'm talking about hydration and brightness I want my skin I want people to say wow that's what I want so this is why I apply it and this is why it's the ritual because you're using all these products these four products and they create a synergistic effect on the skin again articling spring water artic library for that brightening effect so I just apply this all over the face and finally to step four this is the illuminate they don't glow refresh now this part you can use before you start your skincare routine after you finish and I'm doing that and through today so I like to keep it a little shape and I like to apply it kind of down the center and then in across and this feels so good on the skin it is so refreshing again you've got all those components that we talked about the Arctic spring water you've got the unco berry everything is in there and it creates a synergistic routine now this is my skincare routine completely done but we're not finished because I'm just going to apply the standard mineral foundation over this because this is the skincare part done so the skin prep is all done but then I just like to buff on a bit of mineral foundation all over the face and that kind of completes the morning ritual again just applying it to face buffing it in you can see is going on beautifully because we really hydrated that skin now throughout the day you can refresh the face as and when you will with the illuminate the glow fresh so again you can use it afterwards to refresh and set the makeup absolutely and it gives that skin that glow and I think this is really what the products are for is to give that writing to give that effect the skin looks incredibly luminous and incredibly healthy and that's why I think it is such a great routine for all skin types but specifically for those of you who are lacking that brightness

heroine okay so today's video is about under-eye bags now I failed a video on my own situation about three years ago or so now and I wanted to kind of update you because I noticed that a lot of comments especially recently for some reason have been about what what if I've been doing to them and am I getting fillers or anything like that for under-eye bags so I thought I would address this issue because it's been a while first of all what I normally film that I'm actually filming with the camera directly on so my seats actually a bit higher normally it's lower and the camera is slightly tilted so I tend to look up slightly at the camera that gives the illusion that the under-eye bag area is smoother than it really is so just to kind of put that out there I haven't actually had any filler audible for eye bags since I posted that video and the reason being is just after I posted that video I lost weight and a byproduct of losing weight meant that the under-eye bag that was really bothering me which was this I mostly was always here and it was really heavy at one point losing weight cause the eye boat to reduce because part of it was a fat pad now it's not completely reduced you can still see them here but they're nowhere near is bad and that was just one way coughs no ultimately it went too far and I lost about four stone your weight in its entirety or about sixty pounds and I never needed to lose that much so I regained just over a stone over the course of about a year because I just looked so you know unwell but that's all I did I just lost weight I didn't get any Botox or fillers or do anything else and I kind of want to make that point under I feel as and do an amazing job giving the illusion of filling out the hollow or the kind of bag area it kind of builds up the rest of the face to meet it so that it looks more smooth but they haven't done any of that generally speaking it just doesn't interested in too much anymore they go a bit older I just become a bit more accepting of the things that are on my face have other concerns that I'm you know there may be going on inside my body more than what's going on the outside but no fillers no Botox nothing else like that whatsoever just lost weight and thankfully a big part of it was a fat bag and that kind of dissipated as I lost weight but they are still here and I do normally film slightly with the cameras lighting down at me slightly up which also gives the illusion that things are a lot smoother is why I'm filming straight on and and also I have very very bright lights here as well from this setup they they go all the way around and they brighten my face so that I look better on here than I actually do in real life so there you go that's really truly wife had done if you are going to go to a doctor with regards to Android fellas make sure it's a good doctor and you have seen the work that they have done and taught them but any problems that may arise I have it done originally didn't look quite right I have the filler then dissipated with an injection and it refilled by another doctor that looked much better but then I got into the process of losing weight for health reasons and you know things looked a bit better thankfully so there you go that's the honest truth thanks so much see you all soon and there is the list of eye creams under there in the description bar as well some that are incredibly good so check those out thanks so much following

everyone okay sir today I'm going to be talking about footed ice now I've done numerous videos on a hooded eyes and I'll leave some links in the description bar below I'm sure I remember but today we're just going to be discussing hooded eyes other problems with them and some of the solutions ironically if it's normally people with very very hooded eyes that will come and say I want this kind of look and it's usually something quite extreme and it's very dramatic and it's also incredibly hard if not sometimes impossible to pull off now there are two types of hooded eye really there is the one you born with and the one that you acquire as you get older and the one you're born with is totally different because the skin can be very very taut so it can almost be like you're just drawing like this when you want to do it it's amazing you can do anything you want because you can put the crease where you want you can put the colors any way you want because the skin is taut with a hooded eye that's acquired through age as we get older this part of the lid and the crease comes down and it can come down completely which means it covers the entirety of your eyelid here or it can come down partially where it covers the most of the outside corner you can do things with hooded eyes you could apply a color over that hooded area and it gives the illusion of it receding away from you but it's very very problematic particularly as you get older because the skin moves a lot and also it can pull the skin you can come down and fold and it can give the illusion of a droopy eye as well they are without a doubt the hardest eyes to deal with when it comes to eye shadow application and the age-old expression you can't make butter with the toothpick comes to mind here if you have very very hooded eyes where the skin is losing is coming down sometimes it's best to just accept that Daddy what you have and to work on finding a solution to give you an amazing I the way that I go about this is I will look at the iron if it's very very hooded and I know that it's going to be incredibly problematic to deal with in terms of the look that perhaps they want they want a very smoky or they want a winged eye which is just incredibly difficult to do because of the skin movement we focus on the eyes the bits that we can create so first of all we can put a highlight absolutely in the brow bone and if you've got beautifully defined brows that is amazing we can also cut the highlight rightly in a corner of the eye because that's always visible so there you've got color the next thing we can do is to put whatever color you would have put on the lid in crease underneath the eye so let's just say it's a brown we can put the color all the way underneath because you're gonna see that completely that's never covered then what we do is we take a push liner brush and we push black eyeshadow deep into the lash bed to create the thickest blackest lash as we can if you have amazing lashes curl them and put mascara in and your eyes are done they are absolutely done if you don't have good lashes you've got two options individuals or false lashes or using mascara fibers both can give you a dramatic length now I've done a video on the scar fibers but I don't post in any particular order so you may or may not have seen that but those are the two options by creating a really black thick full lash you give the appearance that your eyes are the focus even if you've got no eyeshadow really on the lid itself because all you're gonna see is these beautiful founder lashes of the glorious you'll see the color underneath and the tear duct highlight and some of the brow bone now there may not be what something you want to hear but it is the easiest solution when dealing with incredibly hooded eyes because of skin movement when place the brush even my brushes which are incredibly soft on an incredibly hooded eye with skin movement the skin will move and your placement goes all over the place the other way to deal with it is to pick your colors and go for it like there's no tomorrow so you're gonna go out way out than you normally would make sure it's right at the edge here make sure it connects under here then you get the wet wipe technique that I've talked about and you start to clean off to sharpen the edge again you need to be so careful because skin starts to move on this bit so once you're using the wet wipe you don't want to go too high up or pull too hard because then you're pulling the skin and you're creating an off-center or an awkward looking angle but generally speaking people will be very happy with the tear duct brow bone and under eye shadow and also if there is any space here that is visible could I show up a shadow on that as well but work on the lashes thicken them blacken them use false lashes if you need to singles all the fibers fibers are notorious because they fall there is a way of getting around that and I have done a video on it and you can get amazingly thick eyelashes that you won't have any that fall out with that tends to be my preferred method another big fan of putting on false lashes because they just awkward they just awkward but that's my tips on hooded eyes it may not be what you want to hear but it is the best option absolutely with a very very hooded eyes thanks so much for watching yeah thank you bye bye 
everyone arguing today I'm going to be talking to you about skin prepping and how to get the most beautiful smooth texture to your skin before you apply any makeup or whether you just want to go completely bare face but look and feel absolutely amazing prepping the skin and getting it into prime condition before anything is absolute key and I've spoken about these products before but there is now a new product as well which is so good that I kind of wanted to revisit everything and guide you through how my god like creating the perfect base now the first I'm going to be talking about our tight side and tight neck and then new product which is called moisturize now these products work singularly or synergistically in a program so you can just use one or you can use them all together now the thing with these products is and again my love for them is because they work and they give immediate results and they also work over the long haul so the longer than you use approach the more noticeable benefits you continue to get is very humid the benefits keep on coming and it's rare prefer to claim that it can give you a noticeable difference in your skin and it actually work and these products actually work so I'm going to do is explain how and why I use them on myself and on fights because as we as we get older our skin can lose some of this permanent tickly underneath the eyes and then is also an area if our face is completely just heavenly on neck can be an area that giveaway age and these are areas of concern so by applying products that are going to work and give immediate benefits to the face by smoothing out underneath the eyes by tightening the skin by tightening the neck by smoothing the net and then by locking in intense moisture any makeup you apply over that is going to glide on and look seamless so let's make a start so the first product we're going to be using is tie ties now tie ties is a product that reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles it tightens the skin and it's a patented formula so let me show you how to use it you want to apply this underneath the eyes now you want to swipe it don't dab it underneath the eyes now height is heated by your body's natural temperature which triggers the absorption of the key ingredients in this product now at the same time you'll actually feel the Tideway contract on the surface of the skin providing you that immediate timeless now you want to rinse the skin with cool water after the 5 minutes has elapsed now let's move on to the tight neck the same principles apply now let's move on to the time neck same principles applied you're going to apply tightening to the neck area again this wipe don't dad tightening will help to tighten firm and lift the loose skin while improving skin tone now the skin around the eyes is much thinner and delicate whereas the loose skin on the neck is much thicker so while both products utilize the same technology tight neck is time typically for waiting to be three times stronger than tight side so tight neck is not recommended for use on the eye area because of these because of the stronger benefits of it again when the fineness is a last you want to rinse it off with cool water again the benefits are cumulative so the more you use this the better it gets and this is how I press a client skin by using these products under the eyes on the neck to make sure that when the makeup goes on is going on the most beautiful fresh and tight skin okay so let's move on to the brand-new product which is moisture now moisturize is a rich intensive moisturizing serum that conditions the skin is non-greasy and restore skin to its healthy moisturized condition now you want to apply this immediately after you've taken off your type eye serum and your time now you can apply this just to the eye area but it can be also used on other areas of the face you want to take a few pumps and apply this to the under eye area now this is a proprietary medical grade product and it is non tacky it's non sticky and it quickly repels to restore the moisture levels under the eyes and on the areas of the face that you decided to put it basically with these products combined when makeup goes on whether you're using a liquid a cream or a powder it goes on incredibly smoothly because we condition the skin we tighten the skin and then we've moisturized the skin so it is perfect prime condition so that any areas of problems are going to be minimized because of that now again this is a product that I use on myself and I've talked about it before but it's a product that I use on client because I as I mentioned I want to get the most flawless beautiful on skin before I start to apply products so if I know that the under eye area is a concern or Lynette I know I can focus on those areas and then anything I applied over it is going to make a massive difference now all the information to these products is in the description bar which is right down there for the tight Eyez tight neck and then moisturize that all the information is in the description bar below to definitely check them out see what you think because these are products that work for me I have a very very specific makeup kit and very specific products that I use and I always use them because I want to have a pattern I know exactly where I'm going to go in any each step and the fact that I make sure the skin prep is done perfectly before ensure that everything I do afterwards is going to be as beautiful as possible thanks for watching again in information down there and I will see you all soon let me know your thoughts bye bye 
here on OKC today I just want to do a little update about the weight loss because it's been a couple of words been only three years since I started changing my eating habits and I don't want to give you an update on where things are at the moment now when I started changing my diet I did so because I was having stomach problems so there wasn't really thought in my head about losing weight I just want to not have stomach issues and I started in sort of November November three years ago and what happened was I started in that my weight at the time was about 15 stone 9 and over the course of probably four months five months I dropped a total of four stone in weight now at one point my mother looked up to me and said I'm really worried about you your face is very very thin looking and I literally just brush it off as don't talk nonsense because you see yourself every single day so you don't notice things that are happening and then I found the video I'll put the link here about my best friend and I found that and nothing was done several months later about six months later I caught a glimpse of that video and I was absolutely horrified if how lean that my face was it was so lean now at that point I was about 11 stone 7 11 stone 8 meaning I have dropped over 4 stone in weight by that point which 11 stone 8 and 6 foot tall is very lean and I had no idea because I wasn't wearing myself all the time but when I caught a glimpse of myself in that video I was absolutely horrified and I since regained some weight I regained a stone in weight in total so my face looks much healthier now it's a little bit it's still quite lean but it looks healthier the problem that I have is I'm now about 12 stone 8 so I regained a stone the problem I have is is that I don't feel great and it's that it's like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place because when you're lino your body looks better it looks it definitely looks better for me but then your face takes the brunt of that leanness and you start to look unhealthy and unwell now if I was 12 stone at 24 years old my face would look a lot different than it 12 stone does and nearly 40 years old some 39 be 41 middle sort of early next year there's a big difference and I'm now stuck in that place where you know I don't feel comfortable in my body it is slightly heavy weight when I contract my stomach you can see a six-pack but it's very faint now because there's body fat covering it but I'm healthy but at the same time I feel uncomfortable in my own skin but the goodness of my face at a lower body weight looks horrific so this is where I'm at I have no idea how I'm going to what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna do whether I'm just gonna maintain as a band just accept the fact that I need to carry more body fat in order to look healthy or whether to drop slightly more body fat so I feel better but I just look rough let me know if what your thought let me know if you're in a similar situation where you are literally trading off your face for your ass let me know thanks so much and I'll see you soon bye bye

everyone okay to a nice short video today so bronzing and contouring trying to get better results now unless you're doing an absolute lakh proof method of setting your foundation like you can see here with a powder puff and really pressing it into the skin when you apply bronzer what can happen is the distribution of foundation can start to get removed when you're sweeping a brush back and forward across the face this just moves the foundation a much easier way to go about it is to use the press motion I'm going to show you that now this can be used with contouring as well or with bronzer and all you're doing is tapping it on the area's you want the product no more sweeping it across the face unless you've really sealed in the foundation particularly if you are one of those people that find your foundation starts to move this principle can be carried over as well into other areas such as highlighting and applying blusher as well you can tap off any excess you can see it and then rego over those areas to blend it more slightly but this will give you a more precise application of bronzer and contouring and will really give you a much more flawless result because you won't be removing any product there you go that's it how quick was that don't forget to like and comment and share if you would be so kind thanks so much and thank you for your time alright 
Terron IRGC today's video is very different to my normal videos it's not makeup related and it's going to be much longer if you want to watch completely understand the reason I'm making this video and I've never talked about this to anyone else before is that I'm looking for some help or some understanding I'm hoping that there are other people out there who have been through a similar situation who have found help when I was 24 years old which was 15 years ago I started to notice all of a sudden that I was needed to go to the toilet more as in urinating hours it was just becoming more frequent and it was strange because it never experienced that before everything was always fine but a weekend is becoming more and more apparent I was needing to go to the toilet and I was just it was just like I can't explain it you just need to go not urgency like you're going to be as out but just frequently needing to go to the toilet I went to the doctors and they did ep10 spending with negative there was no infections so he said a with an overactive bladder and bearing in mind I was 24 years old and never it was just his sudden on sale there was no gradual progression so I took the tablets for a week and they gave me the most intense lower back pain so kidney thing so we stopped them by that time that other week apart and the symptoms were now becoming very extreme I was going all the time I was now experiencing incredible burning with it so Bank the doctors more you're in touch everything is fine so they try me on more tablets they didn't work either and during this time I was explained to the doctor that they didn't feel like my bladder it felt like the aretha there was something wrong but all the urine tests were coming out negative so there was nothing there so time moves on and during that period the sentence was so painful and so intense that I was getting up eight to ten times at night and it was absolutely horrific the frequency be feeling of needed yearning and the pain associated with it and nothing was being done there was nothing was being found I was all the urine tests were coming back negative this is an overactive bladder and I knew it wasn't so I go to a private urologist to have a consultation he does your intern there- he scanned my bladder it looks fine and then sent for Asus Tosca P which is where they put the camera down the urethra and have a look into the bladder and the ether they were like no it was nothing there from that period onwards you're going too fast all down to about 10 months so from the onset of this up until then which was a full year I was in an absolute misery with this and there was no hope they gave me amitriptyline because that supposed to help in the pain and they kept upping the dose so I was like a zombie but I was still in this pain and I was still going to the toilet I wasn't sleeping because I was getting up so I go back and ask to see another doctor just a random other doctor and thankfully it was a female doctor because they always seemed so much nicer I explained to her almost in terms she did something that my doctors hadn't done or the private doctor she did a swab test that was it she did the swab test and then she comes back and says you have a bacterial infection of the urethra and it was just like for a whole year no one had found this and all it took was a single swab tested they done that in the beginning we may not be a day with this story so they she comes back to you have a bacterial infection of the aretha now Vanessa T I was ruled out immediately because it would have been an absolute miracle to have gone since I had done leaving for a very long time and they wrote that immediately and I knew wasn't that her summation of it was we don't know what caused it but it could have been a sub a body wash she didn't know but we found it and we were going to cure it so she gives me a course of antibiotic these last two weeks on the third day of taking them I spent the entire night I didn't get up once which was just amazing on the fifth day all the symptoms disappeared they were all gone and on the sixth day the symptoms came back but they were different I had the same frequency the same irritating feeling in the ureter the same needed to go to the toilet but at night when I went to sleep I could through the entire night so from my waking hours I was needing to go to the toilet but when I lay down to sleep I just left after the two weeks I went back they did more swab test everything was negative there was nothing left but she explained my symptoms and she put me on another to the course of antibiotics a different one I took those but my symptoms persisted that frequently during the uncomfortable feeling that you need to urinate and it's not like you know even if my bladder is empty the urge to go comes and I can still manage the task water and this is constant so here we are 15 years later during that period I've gone into what I call intermittent remission which means my symptoms suddenly start to dissipate and then they are almost but never quite but they're almost more normal then I'm certainly back to square one again for no apparent reason this is where it gets complicated six years ago I went back to that doctor because she was so nice I explained to her what was happening and at that point it was so bad that I felt like I was just had enough of everything and she did another swab test and she said look everything is coming out negative there's nothing here we don't know what caused it we're sorry but there's nothing here and I got up and left I walked outside and waited for my bus and then the strangest thing happened I didn't need to go to the toilet the feeling that bit with me for all that time because if it flared up you just gone just like that it disappeared the moment she said you're okay it just vanished and at that point that I started thinking maybe there was something going on inside my mind that was triggering these reactions within my body because I've spent a full year with a full-blown infection that no one could find and it was like the trauma of that had left an imprint had left her muscle memory of that condition and something was triggering it now I don't know if this is true but that's how it feels couple of years ago to illustrate that point I had an argument somebody over Christmas I couldn't rectify that situation that day and during that day I could feel this intense pain and needed to go to the toilet and burning and it was for if it was so bad that day the next day I dealt with that argument and I could literally feel my peen go like this it just evaporated and that's why I'm making this video because I honestly don't know anymore what is going on with my body the last month I've had what I call a flare-up and I don't know if it's stress again or what it is because I'm an on stress and it is horrible you are constantly uncomfortable you're constantly needed to go to the toilet and there is no help and I'm smart enough to know that if this is something that's been triggered in my mind in my mind is playing tricks on me or play tricks on my body maybe that is now what it is because there was that infection and now it's gone but if that is what it is I don't know what to do I don't know where to go to help I have companies that say do you want to come to London Joyner go and do this we'd love to meet with you we'd love to talk this over with you or my agents or say we need you to go here here and I always decline I might not want to go because to be in that situation with a group of people and you've got this intense urge is flared up you're like I can't put myself in that situation it's not that I'm going to work myself never urgency is frequency and you're constantly uncomfortable and you're constantly moving because there's this pain so I'm it controls my life and has done on and off for 15 years now because it comes and goes in waves and this one is safe for a month and it's been a real joy and I'm hoping that there's someone out there who has been through a similar situation where there was something and it's gone but it's left something the pain of it is still there I would love for you to speak to me about it because I literally feel in my wit's end this Thursday I'm going to see another new role annoyed neurologist and that will be it I'm done there because I don't know where to go I don't know what to do and I'm constantly uncomfortable and I have had enough of it to be honest with you I'm 39 years old this has been going on since I was 24 and I'm pissed that all that time a whole year not one person listened when I said it doesn't feel like if the bladder my bladder isn't hurting it's not full bladder syndrome there is pain and you're not looking in the right area and it was like none of them gave a and it makes me so angry when I look back at it so anyone has had similar issues as me or knows what might be going on inside me I would love to hear please be nice on the comments please be constructive please because I've been a really really  month and just be nice in the comments please and if any of you can help with what is going on or you've been through a similar experience I would love to hear about it because something is very very wrong and I need to fix it because I had enough thank you and I'm going to go now and do what I do best that's it I'm gonna have a wing because I can do that I can do that really good see you soon bye

heroin okay so today is the favorite foundations of 2017 now happen all here in front of me I've actually been dreading the film in this video don't quite know why but I don't know all the rest were fine so let's make a start this is my favorite foundations so there are a mixed bag if I say I use them that means I use them if I don't mention that that means they're really good foundations that I don't personally use both still really good so the first one now this is the pallet format they come in singles this is kept cream foundation now while they say these are a cream they're really more of a wax and therefore they're compatible thing more like a lipstick but share that they're absolutely beautiful give it true to life coverage they are 4k compatible I talked about these for eight years they're absolutely amazing this is the staple of all staples RCM a cream foundations 50% pigment in here these are amazing they come as singles or in pallets again since I began on YouTube I've been talking about this as I have this which is Mac full coverage foundation again this is more of a wax base than it is a cream ultra full coverage all of these can be shared down with the damp sponge so you don't have to use them to that intensity okay moving on I use this foundation it is maintenance in a waterproof foundation it is still one of my all-time favorite foundations I never use a single foundation I always mix two but that's just my preference this is waterproof it will last it's amazing again talked about a few years ellis fast liquid foundation ultra chewy and beautiful i've been going on about a few years it's lovely this is so good this is the Becca and this is the pack volume banking foundation very very very luminous beautiful coverage on the skin I mix them what I tend to do is use like a fuller coverage foundation and then a luminous one and mix the two together so we've got all of those aren't the way next full coverage with a more normal skin you know not to reflect it is Charlotte Tilbury the magic foundation medium to full coverage and natural finish to the skin it's not luminous or overly matte immaculate by hourglass is absolutely amazing for those of you who want to in cream liquid that goes and turns to a powder finish very good on GOG on that particular if you pair it with the mineral veil primer hourglass again is their stick foundation which is really good it is beautiful and this can be used as foundations or you can dot them as concealers however you want it is an amazing foundation if you're looking for true full coverage Kat Von D lock it this is ultra full coverage again pop of this with a pump of luminous you get the best of both worlds so bear that in mind really full coverage is the dermablend flawless creator this comes in a host of shades dermablend are known for their covering abilities very full coverage be warrant tomforde waterproof foundation and concealer it's expensive I know I use this it is amazing are amazing and this has been around since Tom Ford began which is this stick foundation and it is still absolutely delicious it is amazing wax based foundation now Holy Grail as you all know double-win nude water fresh makeup this is the best foundation in the whole world ever ever but close runner-up is of course the max to do blend water weight foundation basically speaking these two are almost identical a couple of different ingredients but they are almost identical I prefer the estee lauder one but they are near identical this is a foundation that we should never chew never used because it's lemare and it is the soft fluid it's a medium to full coverage it's all good it is luminous and beautiful I mix this with this outrageously good and finally wrong dial and this is the airbrush this is a cream concealer that is the most pigmented foundation it's a cream foundation not a concealer but you can use it as a concealer it is the most pigmented foundation I have ever used out of all of the ones we've just spoken about there's my tattoo it literally just melts and molds away everything it is so full coverage that it is just insane now you need a diamond tiny tiny bit and you put it in your hand and then you mix it with an oil or a moisturizer whatever you see fit but don't use it me because it will look you will not look natural you need to blend that but if you're looking for true full coverage you need the tiniest amount for your face and it is exceptional I've spoken about it before it's amazing and that's my favorite foundations of 2017 what an audio and I'll see you all soon bye bye 
hey everyone okay so this is the kind of video that I wish I had seen years and years ago I was starting out and it's about hooded eyes I'm not talking about hooded eyes on younger skin because regardless of whether you have a crease or not the skin is taut the skin is still quite firm so this video is dedicated to those of you whose skin on the upper lid is firming is coming down and is loose and this is very important because when we're doing eye makeup and it often seems as well women with very hooded eyes often tend to one way the most amount of I shall pick opponents the trickiest eye to work with in my opinion particularly as we get older because the skin is very very loose and it moves around and even with the softest brushes the skin is going to move so I shadow placement becomes very very difficult now there are a couple of things you can do and we'll go on with how I approach them most of the time so the first thing you can do is put a tiny bit of powder on the outside corner of your eye use this as a guideline and this is great but again as you start to move the eyeshadow around with a brush you're actually going to hit that line and it's going to start to move again and the skin is going to move back and forth so that's a problem the other ways you can clean it up which is how I approach makeup which is with a wet white and the tutorial coming on Friday I believe then will show you how to get a really feline eye using this technique but again because the skin over this section here moves as you move a wet wipe up it's not going to get that straight line it's not going to get that lift the same way because the skin is moving so you're going to get patches of shadow now I often think that it's better to approach it if you've got a very very good a diet realistically because you can't make butter with a toothpick and the way I like to approach eyes is a very very standard way doing you so let's go on with that the first thing you're gonna do is line the upper eyelid now bear in mind that lining the upper eyelid is great but only partial part of it is going to be shown so you need to use a waterproof pencil lining up ryder's in total now when you open your eye chances are if you've got a very hooded eye the only portion that's going to be visible is sort of deep in a corner don't worry about that next line underneath the eye and connect the eye up so the line is going all the way around defining the lower lash line on a hooded eye is incredibly important next take a shadow let's just say it's daytime so take a shadow that you want and run it over that Kohl it's going to set it and it's going to give a bit of color and life to the eye if you want to use a shimmer go for it it really doesn't matter so now you've done that all you want to do next is highly in a corner of the eye a little bit so you use a lighter color and if you want to highlight the brow bone use a tiny bit on the very end of the brow then curl your lashes and apply mascara now approaching it this way your eyes open you're going to see the eye shadow because you've got it underneath which is why defining the lower lash line is so important and if you've got really great lashes then great your eyes are actually done it's very very simple or you can put on false lashes or mascara fibers which I tend to prefer cause I think they're really really good now if you're going out if you wanted a little bit more dramatic what you're going to need to do is just go over that exact same shadow but with a deeper color and that's going to transform it into a stronger look also adding a Kohl pencil to the waterline will give it an even stronger yes it can shrink the eye slightly but who cares your eyes are still going to be the focus because of that intense Kohl and it also is worthwhile pointing out that defining the upper lash line particularly in a corner where you can see the eyelid with a black eye shadow right into the lash bag will make all the difference the other thing you can do if you want is you can take a I show that is two shades darker than your skin tone and very lightly very very lightly running into the upper part of the island where the crease should be but the truth be told is I don't tend to do that anymore because just doing this technique it's very simple it's very basic it's called a classic eye because that's how people used to approach a shadow it's very very beautiful and you rarely see it now because everybody's doing crease work and everybody is doing this and I think it looks amazing because your eyes are the focus but you've not overwhelmed anything else you can put coal in to make it a really intense or you can just leave it and look fantastic but this is how I would approach their included eyes particularly on with your eyelids because they are a problem and rather than having to spend 30 minutes on each eye sometimes using something very simple and just accepting okay got hudud eyes they're a bit difficult let's just go with it my eyes can still be the focus with act trying to learn new techniques or techniques they're going to take you a long time in order to get the same result because in the end of the day I chose about making your eyes stand out it doesn't matter whether it's just at the lash line or right the way over the entire socket is there to make your eyes stand out and this does it so there you go don't forget to rate comment and subscribe all that's another one and I'll see you all soon bye bye oh and share it I know you're not coming by

concealer or foundation depending on what you you think will go on incredibly incredibly smoothly it is just heavenly next up we've got the bronzer now the bronzer is beautiful I'm wearing the bronzer got it all around the outside perimeter of my face just to get a bit of glow you can I find it very very sheer Li and I've done or you can probably a bit more intensity to get that real kind of spin on the Sun been for a walk in the Sun effect to the skin this product is so glorious it is the snake booster oil nowadays oil is absolutely beautiful I don't even know how to explain it you have to actually apply to your skin in order to know the benefits and what it's going to do to skin your skin looks amazing what this oil has been applied to the skin it is truly phenomenal but this oils also multitasking what happens is because the foundation which we're going to get onto now is incredibly full coverage you can share that with this oil and create any texture you want any coverage level you need for your face because our faces change around the weeks or a month sometimes we need more coverage sometimes when you glass so is more or less oil to compensate that with the foundation but again this is one of those products that you do need to have on your skin in order this year because the effects are amazing you also get probably one of the most coveted things ever a signed picture of me that's right that's me and last but not least on to the truly hero product or Foundation Board which is the foundation this is the airbrush foundation and this comes in four shades so you can pick your shade however you wish you'll get a shade that you want if you are a winner now I've used shape to all over my face cuz that's the shade that I am and the shade that matches me more closely again this is incredibly full coverage I'm going to show you just a tiny bit I'm going to put this and it literally is a tiny tiny amount and I'm going to put this onto my tattoo to show you so you can see apply meat it can cover a tattoo it is incredibly pigmented I don't know what the pigment level is but it must be absolutely immense in order to do this so let me show you exactly can use it and what results you can get okay so I'm actually going to show you and use the foundation to show you exactly how beautiful it can be so I'm going to use a quick part of the pink diamond instant lifting serum and I'm just going to apply this to my face I'm using this as the prepping step or as a primer because I just want to give my skin a really nice layer and also a little bit of a tightening and lifting step now with the foundation you can absolutely use it neat directly from the jar if you wish to with a damp sponge that way you can share that as much as you want or you can take a little bit in your hand and mix it with oil preferably with think booster oil which is how I'm going to go about it so I'm going to be using shade number two and I'm going to apply a little bit of this you really don't need a lot into the palm of my hand and now I'm just going to apply a couple drops of the oil just because I want to just share this down so that it doesn't go on quite as full coverage and then I'm just going to smooth it into the palm of my hand and this is enough to cover up my entire face so I'm going to start by applying it with a sponge and I'm just going to start in the center of the base and then I'm going to just blend it out and you can see that just with that small tiny amount it is enough to cover the entire area of your face and you can always go back in afterwards to any areas that need a little bit more coverage you can go back in which we might do just underneath the eyes so I'm just going to take a really really small amount and I'm just going to dot this really in the inner corners here and then just on the outside corner because that's where a lot of people get discoloration that it also make the either way being pulled down so I'm just going to apply it with a bit more intensity just around the eye area just to brighten that area so what I'm going to do is add a smattering of powder just in the t-zone section and over my eyelids and then I'm going to move on to the bronzer so I'm going to take my brush and I'm just going to give it lightly into the bronzer just going to knock off the excess what I'm going to do is create more of an all around bronze so I'd like to start more of the hairline and then I'm going to bring it down slightly heavier around the temple area because I want to create a more realistic Bron but I can keep this a portion of a a little bit lighter as most of you know and the same thing I'm not contouring the circular motions I'm bringing it kind of in a number three section by doing it in this number three section you get this really nice kind arc of a lighter color right here by the jawline that looks natural and a little bit across the bridge of the bonus' just to finish this off I'm just going to add a touch of flasher I want to apply blusher quite high up onto the cheekbone area that's it you can see a absolutely flawless and because of the amount of product you're using this is one of the few products that can actually truly claim to be full full coverage because it truly is the most full coverage foundation I had ever used and because you're going to be using such a tiny amount is going to last you whatever also here's another quick quick trick which you can do take one single drop of your oil so the sling booster oil rub it in the palm of your hand so that almost all of the product is directly on the palms and really lightly really lightly press the palms onto your cheek bone area the outer side of the face and what this does is it adds a tiny amount of shine across that outer on area of the face but without adding any channel or highlighter like that so that when you actually move this in has this reflection to it looks incredibly lifelike without any shimmer and there you go again all the information on this competition on this giveaway in the description bar below everything and you get all of this including that person they're absolutely free and you also

everyone okay so this is a nice quick video about the best oils of 2017 now let's just start so the first one I'm going to start with relatively high price one it will go down in your understand as we this happens the first one and this is one I prefer to mix with foundations and all that kind of stuff and it really is unfortunately or fortunately the Visalli rose gold elixir now I know that this has been all over Instagram for a long long time but it really is amazing now all oils will break down foundations shear them out and give you that glow so you don't need to have that one but it is the one that I prefer so that's just the way it is now regardless of whether you want to break down a foundation to create that Sheerness and glow or whether you just want to use them for a treatment at night and they're better at night unless you're really dry drunk elephant virgin marula oil now this is an amazing one I've spoken about it in depth before there's nothing wrong with this it's amazing the only issue comes is when companies like the ordinary come out with a whole host of oils including marula oil but in a fifth of the price so you could pretty much get five times the amount with the ordinary so you need to bear that in mind oh there's so many oils from the ordinary that I've listed them on description bar each of them is great now not one oil will do it all so you can combine oils and because the ordinary are incredibly priced you can definitely pick one or two or three and add them to your evening routine or your foundation so you can absolutely do that I'm also going to include squalene into the mix no squalene really isn't an oil-less such what it is but you know what I mean but it feels amazing on the skin so I want to include that in this mix and finally because there are all listed down there I want to include this one because this is outrageous the expensive and this is me how do you say that vintners daughter I believe now if you've done any reviews on this you'll know people love it it's a second coming of oils now this contains who knows probably 13 maybe 50 mils outrageously expensive beyond expensive and the one thing you need to bear might as well it absolutely has a real strong fragrance to it it doesn't irritate me and give me a headache but I'm very very aware of it the problem with this is that as most people find when they use it you tend not to want to stop because your skin starts to look truly amazing and that's the problem with it it's so expensive that if you it's not a budget just don't even bother trying it because once you start chances are you're gonna really want to go through those are people with sensitive skin rosacea seem to be benefiting the most from it which is so strange since there's lots and lots of essential oils and I've always want about those but I've been wrong about a lot of things and I gave it a go and I'm using it and I will continue to use it at night over the rest of my normal skin care which is really pared down it really is it's an exfoliant a retinoid product and an oil that's about it but there you go that's my favorite world all the information down there and see you all soon bye bye 
here on our cases today I'm going to be showing you kind of highlighting your nose and this is the way that I highlight most people's noses now I know that the trend has been to highlight all the way down the nose and then concentrate on the tip of the nose anything that you highlight on your face anything stands out it comes forward which is the opposite what contouring does contouring makes things receive highlight makes things come out so anything shiny and bright our eyes are drawn to it there are very few nose types where if you want to draw attention to the tip of the nose because by doing them you're drawing attention to an area that most people want to minimize now if that's your preferred preference it's absolutely fine I honestly don't care it's just this is my preferred way of highlighting your nose I was having a conversation with somebody last week and they were like well what's your what's your what's your thing about makeup what is it that you want to empower I just want people to look lovely that's it that's my goal I want you to look your loveliest and that is it so I'm going to show you how to I like nose assuming that you don't want to draw attention so this is my palette that I use this is the blusher and a highlighter palette I'm going to take a shape from here and I think I'm probably gonna take this one and I'm just going to apply some product onto the brush now the way that I do it is that what will happen is the this will only stand out when you tilt your head down so otherwise you're not going to really see this highlight too terribly until you start to move your face and I think that's what's quite beautiful about it so I just want to lower my face slightly and I start quite high up so I started back here and then I bring it down and I stop it just before the middle of the nose so when I turn my head down there it is when I keep it up and face it towards you it's gone and then as I turn my head it starts to reappear again and this way we can go something heavier with it we want or we can share it out it's entirely up to you but it gives the most beautiful appearance when you start to move your face around you get this glimpse you're not suddenly bombarded with intense high light coming from this sort of section of the nose I'm gonna wipe it off but I'll kind of show you what I mean by highlighting here you're just probably is actually but that's what you're doing you're creating a spotlight that's a permanent spotlight on the tip of the nose and it's always there no matter where we do our head it's there so that's why I'm not a fan of applying highlighter Oh me get rid of that we don't want that they would big old shiny red nose that's why I'm not a fan of doing there and for me this is the most beautiful way because we can create intense shine there and yet when you blend it and you're sort of looking straight on it's gone and then it starts to reappear and that to me is one of the beautiful things about makeup is that it's this beautiful lovely illusion that gives you the most beautiful version of yourself but without anybody really knowing what's going on now again this is just my technique you don't have to follow if you like to highlight the tip your nose that's wonderful but this is just my thoughts on it then we know what yours are right down there in the comment section I'll see you soon bye bye 
everyone okay so today is a very simplistic video but also very important one now even though it's incredible common sense try and watch it through to the end so that you can get a gist of what I'm saying rather than turning off the minute you go oh yeah okay before you buy another highlighter just think of this now there's nothing wrong with buying a poetess I love highlighters I buy a lot of them a couple of my favorites are Beca because I really love the back highlighters I also have the loose powders from artist Kuchar they're just lovely but before we buy another highlighter let's have a think if we've already got an absolute bugger load of highlight is available to us already which we do so this is my eyeshadow palette all of these light shades can be used as highlighters on the face but we don't think of it we think oh I buy a new one and we have them available in I shadowed format but what makes them so great to use in this capacity is just think about this this is where your makeup or look exceptionally better than everyone else's say you're gonna pick I don't know that shape there that's a highlight like chain we're going to use this on cheeks and down the bridge of the nose but we can also use this on our eye and by using it on the eyelid and the brow bone and then on the cheekbone and down the nose and maybe above the arch of the brow and bit on the chin whatever we are harmonizing our makeup look we're doing something that most people don't do which is harmonizing the colours on our face and by doing that you bring everything together in the most incredibly beautiful manner and the same thing can go with just your regular highlighter use this but use this on your brow bone and your cheekbone and down the bridge of your nose and on the eyelid and in the inner corner of the eye so that everything has a place and you harmonize your entire face giving it a more beautiful and rounded look so just a recap nothing wrong with buying highlighters it's great but we have so many available to us in a chalet for my can be used on the skin in any way we want and that way we don't have to go out buy more product unless we need it but we've got more choice because most of us have a lot of eyeshadows to pick from case you're wondering I will put links down there to some of my favorite highlighters but if you've got a height and an eyeshadow use it just pop it on your eyes pop it on your cheeks pop it on the Cupid's bow the lip and down your nose and you'll notice that your whole face starts to come together in the most glorious manner humanely possible humanly possible I don't know but that's what I think see you next time bye bye 
here on OKC today's video now it was supposed to be the makeup trends that need to die in 2018 that's coming a week today it's coming Friday I'm so sorry for the delay just been a couple of issues so it's coming you know Inc so today's one is really cool is it there it is now I'd like to say I know why this works but I don't know why it works it just works better for me doing this now you can use a lot of people just use Beauty blenders nothing wrong with that I still like the old fashioned little triangular sponges I've always liked them now I always dampen a sponge because it absorbs this product and allows for a shear application so this is what you're going to do this is what my dirty sponge looks like can you see that the edges have been cut now I don't know why this works but by cutting the two edges you create this little too kind of thinking here and it allows for much more beautiful blending around a little crevices on the face and for some reason it just makes foundation and concealer go up more beautifully so all you're going to do is take a clean sponge you can be done or it can be dry hurry one and you're just gonna snip the two corners off that's all you need to do and again really quickly simple and I don't know why it works but there's something about this that allows you to get so close without bending because when it's in its normal size it can bend quite a lot underneath the eye this doesn't and allows you to get into the nooks and crannies and for some reason when the blending happens it just happens more beautifully and I don't know why look at my dirty sponges it's okay they're coming but that's it that's the tip cut the ends of your sponge don't do this on a beauty but if you have one on work but on your cheapo sponges sniffer to ends off and just see how you go this is pretty bloody amazing if I do say so myself that's it see you well really really fun video coming week and I'll see you soon bye 
so this is 40 heroin okay so different video today it's official I am 40 so today 40 years old it is a very strange feeling I think because you are 34 so long and then you 40 just seems like it's that really big number right and I think I think now 40 looks very different from what it did say thirty years ago four years ago but it's it's a strange number because you are supposed to climb saying you you're a grown up but I don't feel like a grown I have grown up responsibilities but I still don't feel like a grown up I definitely know in there but my body I feel 40 when you're young you get like a scratch and it's gone within like a couple of days now it's like weeks and things like that so that I definitely feel 40 physically definitely but emotionally not really I don't feel that way at all I think that for me personally I thought I would I thought I would have achieved something more and that may sound strange and I don't mean it in a like a materialistic way because that's a truly wonderful thing but like um like emotionally I thought I would achieve something more would have felt different with felt better about myself or about the conditions of my life and maybe I don't know what I'm saying but I expected that I would have reached a understanding and I still haven't I'm still confused about most things I started no idea where I'm really going and I'm still pretty much alone and I think when I look back over my 30s and from a physical point of view I have I probably spent 10 thousand pounds on Botox in my 30s up the way to around about 38 at least 10,000 pounds on Botox in my 30s it was like you you're trying to look as best you can right you're just trying to do everything at least that's how I was feeling but not once all of that money in my forehead not once did it make me look a single day younger than I was what it did and you can see it throughout my videos if you go back years it gave me a really really shiny glass-like forehead but not a day younger ever and I think that's probably what 40 years to me it is an understanding of an understanding that money that Bank Ben should have been going into my bank account into a mortgage into a house into savings was being poured into my face for nothing it made no difference physically it made no difference and ironically since I stopped doing everything I don't do anything anymore nothing I am I've had more compliments on the way of looking my skin and all that that's the irony of it so maybe that's what 40 is an understanding of who you are and that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying to understand who our throughout my 30s particularly from sort of 32 up until now I concentrated so very heavily on work and unfortunately that meant that I didn't do much else and I neglected to make friends and you know it's not like a little poor way but I did a neglected to make friends and I've reached this milestone of an age pretty much on my own and that's quite sad so that's something I really want to rectify and to start working on and if anybody's watching this who knows me they'll know I'm speaking the truth you know I work a lot and I'm pretty much just me just singular always so I'd like to change that going forward I'd like to put some effort in the same way I did with work like to put some effort into trying to try to make a life that's a little bit more fun a little bit more anyway yes this is me I am Wayne and I just turned 40 today thank you for watching and I'll see you soon leave a comments down there what the happy birthday wants oh that's nice but leave your comments in general what you feel how you feel and wave thought you'd be at the age you are now even been there before the thanks so much away 
here one Ikeda today I'm going to be going through the top five beauty makeup mistakes really now remember there's no such thing as a mistake if it works for you if you like it then go for it just because I don't like something doesn't mean that I deserve bad things it's you know we don't like different things but in this video I'm gonna give you five on makeup mistakes and I see most often so let's make a start the first one is eyeshadow that is not based upon your eye shape so if you're watching your tutorial of somebody and you're like I'm going to love it and then you're going to it and it looks nothing like how they did it it may not be your talent level it may be the fact that you've got a different eye shape you might be following Japanese or on an only key tutorial Charlotte Tilbury these eldridge whoever it is they have a row specific eye shape so view so if you're following one of them and say they've got a deep sigh but you're deluded it's going to look totally different so you need to adjust based upon your eye shape so in the description box are all videos linking on how do you find your eye shape or more your eye shape is so if you look at my eyes straight on I've got a standard eye which means it's not too far apart it's not too close together and you can see my pilot when it's open all the way around as I get older it's going to become more fully but at the moment is still a standard eye the other thing is not basing so mistake number two is applying ISO without taking into consideration your face shape and this might sound quite strange but if somebody has a very long face when you're going underneath the eye with eye shadow you can go much much lower down because it shortens the face then on a long face it brings back balance whereas on something with quite small face you wouldn't want to bring that eyes shadow underneath all the way down too much because it's going to show them the face even more so that's a really interesting thing is not understanding your face shape when thinking about eyeshadow work as well of course makeup is just a bit of fun so you can do whatever these are just common mistakes that I see when people are trying to replicate things but they're not taking into consideration their own beauty okay so number three looking at my phones I've written them all down contouring not based upon your face shape so we're watching your video we're going to contour exactly like that and it's going to look totally different because our face is very very different if you have a very lean takes a very angular face you contour that face you're going to make it look more bony and you're going to age that face there are so many things that take into consideration when you're contouring so with a rounder face you're going to want to contour more underneath the jaw line underneath the cheekbones on a very contour based on a very angular face you may not want to contour at all along the jaw line or the cheekbones because you're going to further emphasize hollows that isn't something you may want to do so you need to think when you're contouring exactly what your face shape is again all links are in the description bar which moves us on to contouring your nose to strikes down the nose does not suit or no shapes either the video down there seven different notions on how to correct them when I say correct you know what I mean I'm not trying to be flipping or like your nose is bad seven different no shapes and how to contour those no it's so important because two lines all the way down doesn't really work for me I need to put two here to do and you can miss this bit obvious it doesn't connect I also need to contour here and highlight the nostril because my muscles are quite um narrow their angular and I need to kind of visually bring them out more so there you go and finally not matching your foundation to your body there are lots of different ways to do this but if your body is on show and your face is one color and your body is another it's incredibly it can look quite jarring so let's just say for example that your face is lighter than your chest and you got your chest on show you're going to want to either use a darker foundation or a bronzer around rumors of bringing it down on to the next so that the whole thing blends in seamlessly now you can go either way to see your body fight it in your face you may want to achieve you too darker than visit alignments you may want to bronze up say your chest your collarbones wherever is showing in order to create balance and you want harmony so that generally speaking your forehead your collarbone and your arm should all be technically the same colors to leave you looking unison so there you go that's my five top makeup mistakes that I often see all that people ask me about let me know what makes mistakes kind of perk you or things that you're not you're like oh when you see them let me know in the comment section below and again all video and information is in the description box so check it out don't get to like and all that stuff and I'll see you all soon bye bye

everyone okay so today I'm going to be going through the invisible eyeliner technique and I'm going to film this and upload this in 4k and I'm in a really post my so you can see what I'm doing the way to go about this is that you want to be able to get into the lash line you don't want to go above the lash line any way shape or form because for a lot of people if you do an eyeliner you're going to cover the entire lid and even though we just did a video on hooded eye like that a lot of people want to maintain lid space especially if you notice we light on there otherwise if you do a black line suddenly you've just got black ice so I'm going to go through this technique and it's a double technique for the upper lash line and the inside of the upper lash line and it's very important because a lot of people think that tight lining inside the eye is going on the wet tissue and it's not because it transfers and I've yet to find a product that really doesn't transfer if you know of one let me know because it saves a lot of time so anyway let's get on with the tutorial so what you are going to need is a black eye shadow and this is a good black eye shadow it's an attachment or notice blackest black and I'm going to be using my brush which is the number P brush but it is a tiny minut brush and this will allow us to get into the lash line and create that darkest blackest looking lash which gives the illusion of a thicker lash when you don't really have them I certainly know and it will give the illusion of invisible eyeliner so that's getting close so what we're going to do is take the product and apply it to the brush and we're going to start on the inner corner of the eye because this is just where I prefer to start and you want to wiggle the brush into the lash bed try not to get it onto the wet tissue in the inner corner and you want to work your way all across the upper eyelid you are placing color into the bed of the lash wiggling it and then moving on and the goal here is to make the lashes appear as black as thick and as dark as possible we're all retaining the entire space of the island which is very important force wise hooded eyes really really important so work your way all the way along the upper lash line until you've got those that lash bet is dark as possible the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to kind of lift the eye up and we're going to apply the same black shadow but we're applying this into the root of the lash not the wet waterline we're applying this to the actual lash bed underneath and again it's the same technique but you want to be careful because you want to apply it exactly there if you get it onto the walls lining it's going to transfer otherwise it will be simple just use a pencil but they just transfer and even gel eyeliners can be problematic throughout the day so this is why we're working this into the lashes that this will give the illusion of really thick black lashes so there you go you can see the definition now the blackness of that lash which looks amazing so just to further add more drama I'm just going to curl my lashes and apply a little bit of mascara and now you can see that really really found out effect which just looks each you see how much the I stands out with just that nothing else on the ayatollahs the eye shadow just looks really cool there you go that was it how simple was that but it does produce amazing results and I really hope you liked it don't forget to rate comment and subscribe all that old stuff from old school YouTube I'll see you more so than if you want to share it you can but you're not gonna but I see you seen anyway bye bye

everyone okay so we've got a tutorial today I'm gonna show you how to elongate your eye really pull up make your eyes look wider and also make it look bigger at the same time so I'm going to talk you through this so it's gonna be a longer tutorial so bear that in mind so I'm gonna use my brushes and I'm going to use an eyeshadow palette so the first thing we're going to do is you want to take a nice brush and apply it a nice highlight color so something may be a bit shimmery or you can do Mac whatever you want and I'm just applying this to this inner portion of my eyelid and to the eyebrow arch so just like that so next I'm going to go in with a deeper shadow so I'm gonna take this shade here which is a bit red I've got green eyes so these kind of Rayleigh shades are really good so I'm gonna start in the crease and what you want to do is rather than bring it down too much we want to take it out so go back and forward and then take it out and then really work that inside that outside corner of the eye because this is a very neglected area of the eye it is also an eye that's very oftentimes very discolored so it can make a shadow application look odd so really work the color into the outside corner go back and forward into the crease and drag it out way past the tail of your brow now this is how I do I shadow work on other people so it can seem quite scary when they're a new client which is great just gonna take a blending brush is totally clean and I'm learning this up to the eyebrow but we've still got that highlight shape there it's now just a bit more subtle than it was so I like to do things in threes so I'm going to go back in and repeat and the reason I do this is because then I know that the eye shadow is going to stay on there all day and I didn't prime the eye beforehand but you absolutely can so I know it's a bit mental at the moment but you've gotta have a so the next thing we're going to do is take a smaller brush these are all my brushes link in the description bar I'm going to take a black eye shadow but this is actually a bit of a crappy black so it's almost like a dark grey and I'm going to apply this to the outside corner of the eye but a third of the way really working that outside corner the bit where this discoloration oftentimes certainly on my eye so you're working it right into that area right here don't forget to pull it out at the same time I'm working it on that lid so same thing I'm just going to blend again looking gorgeous waiting I love working like this because it allows me to work allows me to do a few things it allows me to scare the client which I love but it also allows me to be a little bit more messy and know that I can make this look gorgeous at the end so I'm going to take that same dark well that same kind of dark grey and I'm going to line a third of the way and this becomes quite tricky right here this is where we stop so it's really thick on this outside corner and then it stops right here in the middle we will fill it in but not right now and again making sure that outside edge is really really done so now I'm going to knock off everything on the back of my brush but with my hand I'm sorry and I'm just going to give this a little bit of a light blend just to make sure that the colors are transitioning a little bit more we can always add highlight color next you're going to take your baby wipes we're not finished so take a baby wipe and I just like to fold it in half and then again and what we're gonna turn that again and what we're gonna do and then again and what we're gonna do is we're going to take off this side corner so right from underneath here we're just going to start to clean up so this is why I do the ice first as you can imagine so my eyebrow ends right about there and if I extend it we could get a little bit longer so I'm just going to start to work the color up otherwise the eye is going to come too far out and it's going to be too dramatic now remember I purposely gone for colors that are really strong because I want this tutorial to stand out with the camera because of the lights and everything but you could use a really subtle color so I'm just going to kind of take my finger and I'm just going to soften this edge down a bit because I don't want it quite so thick so you can see that the eye is being pulled apart very dramatic very kind of Night Out maybe not popping down to a stir but you get the gist so now we're going to make sure that that same brush is knocked off we're now going to take it in and we're gonna go really finely now much more fine that I just did and go all the way in to the inside corner right the way up here so you want to come all the way in past the tear duct area if you can just a fraction so now you're going to take a Kohl pencil and you're gonna line just this section of the upper waterline and a third of the way in of the lower waterline so right here you might go all the way a third of the way making sure you really connect this corner so can you see that by doing that we've extended the eye we make the eye look longer than it really is now we can go in now with the pencil if you want but if you do decide to because this is going to make you a little bit smaller but we're going for length so you can really go for it with the Kohl pencil otherwise just leave it at that second third now with your black pencil your brush just go really lightly along the top of the lash line so next thing I'm going to do before I do anything else is just clean up a little bit put something on my skin so I can get a better kind of picture okay so now we need to put some mascara so I've actually just zoomed out quickly so you can see it in a zoomed out perspective so you can see that there is this really seductive quality about this kind of look for the eye it's a very very kind of almost when you squint your eyes it gets even better if that makes sense so mascara is on I hope you can see how elongated and pulled up and out the eye so the eyes look very feline they're going down here and up at the outside corner and I've got very small eyes there's not a lot of lid space the crease is closing isn't it is I'm getting older and I know it's really dramatic and that was the point of this so it would stand out because everything gets bleached out here with these lights that and I can't control the color temperature but I really hope that that made sense and you can see that you can make a mess you can do things quite extreme but they don't have to look that way at the end you can clean them up you can edge them off and you can make somebody's eyes regardless of what shape feline by going past the tear duct and pulling up in act and that's the thing to remember here if you pull just out you're gonna elongate the eye long ways we want to create that feline by pulling it in that direction there you go so I hope you found that interesting I love doing eyes this way because I'm not naturally artistic and it took me a very long time to come up with ways that allow me to make a bit of a mess and then start to create the perfection that way because I couldn't we created myself because I'm not very artistic so I had to find other ways in in how to work things with the face and this is what I came up with with the eye so I hope you like it and I see you all soon thank you please thumbs up and all the rest share it be nice and I see you soon bye bye

here am i okay sir today I have partnered up with the lovely keels to talk to you about the powerful strength line reducing concentrate which is 12.5% that M&amp;C plus hyaluronic acid now vitamin C for me was the only skincare product pretty much that I just couldn't use and I've tried pretty much most of them on the market and what would happen is I apply it everything's be dandy and then I would start to experience by kids and this was Universal from product to product it just didn't agree with my skin and I can honestly say this Panama this is the only vitamin C product that has not caused me any issues with my skin no blackheads and no irritation and that is very very important and that's why I'm excited to be talking about this product and the benefits that I've received because I'm about three weeks into using this map so I'm going to talk to you about the benefits and show you my skin up close now it's worth noting that I'm filming this video today in daylight and the lights that I normally use are turned down to their lowest setting so that this is a realistic video also there is absolutely nothing at all on my skin nothing it's just been freshly washed so you're getting a good clearer view of my skin and now I'm going to talk to you about some of the experiences that I've had during the past three weeks okay so the very first thing that I noticed and this is this is important for me right is a brightening of the skin now when you wake up in the morning if you like me you're sort of like when you look in the mirror but my skin looked brighter and this happened almost instantaneously within the first few days my skin look brighter in the morning and that is incredibly important because you know I'm not getting any younger at one brighter looking skin I want nice of he's getting old more youthful looking skin so the fact that I could use this product apply it and know that I'm getting a brightening effect to my skin is you know it's a wonderful thing the second thing that happen obviously I experienced no irritation or blackheads brilliant but I also noticed that pore size looked smaller and that's very important I have open pores around pretty much this section on my face it's not a pretty thing and that's the other thing that I noticed the pores look smaller and Dan is a massive thing because we all know those of us with larger pores they can be problematic to cover oftentimes our skin care products and foundation can sort of go into them and you know not look that pretty so the fact that I've noticed a minimization in paws that's a beautiful thing and thirdly and this is a big one for me because as I mentioned I'm getting older things if you've ever Sol like if you have a blemish on your face when you're quite young they fake quite fast she got a little bit older they take a bit of time to go now this is good because I haven't been noticing especially over the past - really the past two weeks it's been speeding up that if something's on my face I don't really care for maybe it's a spot or I've got pigmentation around my hairline it's fading and this is a this is amazing because I honestly thought that this was just here for good it's fading it's amazing and I'm noticing that spot so I had one just here the other day it is already starting to fade and this is pretty much unheard of for me because it takes a while for my skin to sort of go let's get rid of this now this is helping to speed things up which is brilliant now I think there can be a misconception because often times it if a little bit of something good works then we think that a lot of something will be even better now this contains 12.5% vitamin C plus harder on an acid so you're getting two really powerful practice here but don't be sort of misled into thinking that you higher and higher situations because that absolutely isn't the case this will give you fantastic results it's given me fantastic results but you will get it in a gentle kind manner you don't have to hurt your skin in order to have really beautiful skin and finally as the final kind of part this has been clinically proven to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles and that's that can only be a good thing right it is a good thing it's a good thing in my world so this is my experience and what I'm going to do is zoom in with a camera and I'm filming this other mentioning daylight nothing on and in for K so I'm going to zoom in so you can get a closer look at my skin and he is my forehead as well because I mentioned I get pigmentation right here you know with a bit where the hair should be really thick but it kind of isn't anymore that's where I get the pigmentation and here it's really fading really really quickly that's pretty close no closer okay so this is my skin so this is what it looks like so you can see I've got a slight blemish here but that's already starting to fade Yemi but overall my skin looks pretty bright and pretty good now I'm 39 I'll be 40 very very shortly and I think it all looks pretty good because it just looks more even and brighter and because this is in 4k you're getting a realistic very realistic shot that what my skin truly does look like there you go and this is truly truly my results and my opinion on this product which i think is absolutely splendid again all products ability and you know what this is true because I've spoken about it time and time again I've never been able to use this is the only one and this is a keeper for me and now you use this twice daily I use it in the morning before sunscreen and I use it at night and my skincare routine and it's three weeks and I'm not gonna lie to you I'm looking forward to seeing the next three and then the next three months and the next 12 months to see how this continues to progress and how my skin will get better and better because that is the goal to have beautiful skin to have skin that you don't feel you need to cover as much and that's what my goal is to have the most beautiful skin especially as I get older for it to continue to be healthy and look good so there you go thank you so much for watching thank you kills as well it's been a beautiful beautiful partnership and that is a wonderful thing so thank you for watching now all the information on the product and all the links I don't know in the description bar thanks so much bye-bye 
however one idea to today's video is on how to get baby skin and the chatter will come shortly and it's very very short and sweet because that's thank me baby skin to me is that complexion where the skin just looks incredibly beautiful it isn't about heavy coverage or trying to you know build up thickness on the skin it's about pure skin that looks good so what I do is I combine three or four different products a primer an oil a foundation and a Luminizer and mix them all into the palm of my hand and apply them to the face which you'll see in a second now unfortunately I found this in daylight I actually filmed this about five hours ago and it was really bright so the effect wasn't as a parent on screen as you're gonna see but in real life in situations where there is artificial lighting the skin has this incredible exuberance to it because the oil and the illuminizer are really really apparent on the skin but because we're powdering the teaser you get this incredible glow running outside perimeter of the cheek you don't need to apply any shimmer whatsoever the skin looks baby like it looks flawless and it looks incredibly innocent and that's the way I like to do things so without further ado let's just get on with this video okay so the first thing I'm doing is a point oh and by the way products I use or all information and links are in the description bar below I use the facility and I use the unicorn essences the Primax I just and I love love this primer I use the rose gold elixir for the oil which is again by the surface force alec-fuh sonic force ally for the shimmer you know the Luminizer I use coverfx and they do lots of different shades but I love that one and for foundation I use the dropper from the Mac bottle and I use my Holy Grail Foundation which is the Estee Lauder double water fresh so they go it's common tutorial okay so I'm going to combine first the primer I really added oil I'm gonna add a Luminizer and I'm going to add the foundation then I got mix it up you applying this with a beauty blender and I'm applying all over the skin this isn't about heavy coverage because the oils and aluminized and everything are going to dilute the foundation so you may need to add more I just want the skin to the perfect you I'm going to add a touch of cream blusher because the face can of Garci without some color on it and then I'm going to apero around the t-zone area and what the rest of the face to shine through that's the end of the tutorial see you next time bye-bye 
here well okay as some of you may know the very first high-end thing I ever got was by Bobby Brown it was a couple of bushes and a brush and it was amazing and I got it as a gift I was so grateful then I went out and I bought a book by Trish McEvoy I have another book there was her iconic planner in there and it was literally like everything I ever wanted it will help your brushes or your makeup in these amazing magnetic systems that clipped into this ringbinder palette and it was a dream so let me show you because it is truly phenomenal these come in three sizes there's a small a medium and then there's a large so you can kind of pick and choose now you open up the palette and I'm gonna give you just a kind of sort of let me try and see this a focus so inside here you've got all your you can stick anything you want in there in these zip lepage then you've got this palette the palettes open up let me try and open it for you now this is a prefilled palette but these kind of D clip right so you can fit in here or your eye shows and these blushes your foundation your concealer and you can fit two or three or four of these into here as well and in this section you can put your brushes your lipsticks your mascaras and it all zips up and you can just either have it on your vanity take a small one with you to the gym whatever you want to do in your handbag your purse but I've still got my two original ones and they are turquoise and they are the large ones and they are when I opened it up originally and I filled it there was a page full of eyeshadows and a page full of cheeks and then a page full of face with the concealers and the foundations all in and every bit Trish McEvoy's line is high-end it is incredibly client the quality of it is all amazing and I've already talked about the eye base before by Trish McEvoy it is the one that I use to prime people's eyes because it's colored and it gives you a completely blank canvas another really amazing one is the gel eyeliner you can use this to tight line the upper lash line the curling eyelash curling mascara is beautiful by trish mcevoy as well there is nothing in her line that I dislike and have ever disliked it is so well for tide the fact that you can just stick anything you want in here is brilliant none of what I'm saying in any of these videos for the holidays is sponsored everything is mine there's no money being exchanged it is just I just I love Trish McEvoy never matter I've had the opportunity a couple of times but I've been working sort of never managed to because I can't disappoint other people but I love everything about the planning system I love the old school of it you could still get both the bush go a new book at an old book I recommend the old book because it's phenomenal also what's cool about the new book she's brought back the same models that she had in the original book which is lovely but if you are up for high end and you want something that has everything in it they can just sit on your table and you can be done with it because my goal with all the stuff I've got here which is really minimal is to minimize it down some more because it's not needed when you're only reaching for the same couple of lip colors the same couple of eyeliners you've got 50 of them there's something wrong this kick issue allows you to hold it down it's the bare minimum of what you need and because they're magnetic you can just pop them out so you might want to different lip color you might want different foundation shade because you tan you can just stick back in and be done and it is a glorious thing there you go thanks for watching and I see you all soon 
everyone okay so today's video is on a technique that I mentioned many many many years ago and I'm going to talk you through it today because it can really help to lift as a to get the illusion of a lifted face and more youthful face a more delicious face now this technique can be used on anyone it does really matter the only thing I will say is that if you are very very young it's really not the most appropriate technique because it can age a face or mature a face and that may not be something you know we want to do tickity 16 not a good idea is you don't want to look older trust me you'll get older your wish you look younger so this technique is very very specific to your face shape and your eye shape it will look completely different on you and it does to me so what I'm going to do is mark and I pull you on my face to begin with and show you how it would look and where the placement goes now remember this is just makeup it washes off if this technique doesn't work for you it's no big deal doesn't matter it's just makeup so let's make a start okay so the first thing I've done is drawn the line and this is meant to be a straight line but it's just to give you an illustration it's actually quite difficult to draw a straight line some of these face the line that you're going to be doing and it's you're not going to using pencil I'm just using this as a map what you want to do is take the outside corner of your eye and that is a line you want to put a line or imagine an imaginary line running down from the outside corner of your Eiling whatever that may be because everyone else is different closer eyes it's going to be much more closer in Y to eyes you're going to have lesser space but it doesn't matter so right to the outside corner of your eye now what we want to do with this line this magic line is we want to lift the face so everything that we do with our face highlighter blusher and contour will stay within this line this way it will never come out farther than this line does that make sense so no more apple blusher on the apples of the cheek this line is our guide line and both everything from the outside coin AdWords it will optically let the social so let me show you the placement of where hives would go on my fate as an example so highlighter to me would actually go here which is actually directly level with the eye so you can see that's what I will put halogen now if I look just directly in you can see how it would live this corner now my cheekbone emoji here and you can see other place slightly higher up remember we're trying to pull the face lift the features so this is the area of what I would on my face highlight so using a red pencil this is where I would apply blusher again it's higher on my actual cheekbone now again I'm using stripes as an illustration but these two will be blended into the dis blusher is bleeding in slightly to the target so is this beautiful effect you can see just by looking on that is pulling up we're always pulling up and I finally will do the console and this is where I would place the consort now I don't know if you can see but can you see it started from the top part here of my ear and then goes down because this is where the darkest part of the console would be right here by the hairline by the ear top part here and then travels down just underneath my cheek bone now obviously again no stripes nothing like that these will be blended but think about it in this way you can see what it's doing is pulling the face up and that's what this line does it is different again on every single face shape on your face shapes you will be totally different the placements will be different but the general rule still applies now I actually learned this technique from a really old makeup book by way bandy and that was actually the mix book by the way that can require you to train with which is really cool to use that as reference it is an amazing book Alec print but you can probably get it on Amazon if you really want to regarding the forehead because we're just talking about the line you can shade across here you want to but remember when you're shading with a bronzer on the same side portion you see what I've done it starts off slightly heavier here and then it fades up into nothing so you're going thicker to thinner and again you can see it's pulling back and moving things back there you go I look totally mental but that's okay doing it for you so there you go that is the emerging line technique I hope that that make sense to you and I hope that you can get something from that because it really is a cool technique that can truly live there so particularly when you're sort of 30 40 and above it can make a massive difference to listen pieces of the boat and it's one I use all the time because it's so cool there you go also it's really fun now coming up I'm Russia or halides of triangle this technique right in this base you will realize how far forward we actually come until we're limiting to a certain square circumference here you will notice how much you actually go into the face rather than a so let me know your thoughts up and I'll tell you all to God
