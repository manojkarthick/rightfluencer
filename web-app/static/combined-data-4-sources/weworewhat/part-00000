Hey guys 
I wanted to share something with you  that has brought meaning to my life over the past few months. My life coach Stacy who Ive been seeing for the past year  is constantly helping me to not only better myself but to make sure Im bringing a positive impact to others  and using my influence for the greater good. A few months ago  Stacy introduced me to Maureen. Her son Danny Fitzpatrick took his own life at the tender age of 13  which was a direct result of relentless taunting  bullying  and a school system that failed to protect him and keep him safe. Danny was virtuous  loving  gentle  and embodied all the characteristics we would want in our children some day. After hearing Maureens story and sharing tears together  my heart had no other choice but to get involved and ask all of you to help change and protect all the Dannys out there. You will continue hear more about Dannys story  and how we can all make a difference  because this is just the beginning.

hey guys what's up welcome back to my channel today I'm going to be showing you how I pack the trip that I'm walking for right now is for LA for the weekend I'm going for a bunch of heating's haven√≠t been or two and see my friends so I'm going for three nights and four days and I kind of pre set up everything so that I can show you what my thought process is when I'm packing and sort of how I pick out what I'm going to wear so my favorite Cage Marvel suit is brand new I usually try and do one big suitcase and then maybe like my loose I'm carry-on if I'm bringing my laptop and stuff otherwise I'll just do like a big bag or something the first thing I always start with are my shoes or my shoes this weekend I know this looks like a lot for four days but I need my sneakers for the plane I'll either do my white sneakers or my Gucci loafers I obviously need my work asking her so I'm gonna try and work out everyday my loafers that I have an option of two different loafers to wear and then these booties so when I'm packing I'm always going to stuff the toes and this is a really good tip you just take one roll split it in two and you're going to stuff the toes of all your best shoes I have no corny yelling at me in the background because usually they do this um I actually don't do my own packing I will tell you guys that Moe and QWERTY are the experts behind that but I've taught them my ways I mean this is I was take out what I'm gonna pack obviously but the stuffing of the totes usually doesn't get done by me there's two sides to the suitcase one of them actually zips closed and in the side that zips closed is where I put my shoes my toiletries my blow-dryer and my accessories so I'm going to play then the sides facing each other so that the outside Sun set the other she is dirty and down opposite directions I'll eventually put like my blow-dryer my iron my curling iron and then my accessory is here two products that I have to tell you guys about i'm downing wrinkle sprite is my secret to wrinkle free clothes when you're traveling see a shirt like this if I spray the shirt in like two minutes it's going to be completely wrinkle free my secret weapon so somebody email downy and tell them sponsor we need a good word with music it's our life the other thing I use a static guard spray so anything still being your staticky to spray it on the inside on your legs it actually just smells like  but it doesn't stick like the smell goes away in a second so throw these guys in there and continue on the clothes I usually like to try and set outfits when I'm packing for a trip but that doesn't always work out as we all know so I try and pack my best basics of tops and bottoms up for now LA this time of year could be how could be cold but this weekend actually might be on the cooler side so I'm going to focus more on can outfits for jeans I'm going to bring three pairs I'm going to bring these girlfriend denim jeans which I plan on wearing with one of my oversized rocker T's one pair of skinny jeans these ones are from Topshop they're the Jamie jeans super tight skinny high waisted and they'll go well with any bodysuit and then one pair of kind of loser boyfriend jeans and this pair is new and like any UW new it's really cute and high-waisted kind of loose but flattering as well I'm just going to fold these all in three like this corner on the other side of the suitcase for other pans I want to have a few different options for going out I'm going to bring my ERISA leather leggings which are some of my favorites I'm also going to bring my ERISA a leather pants pair you can put a belt with and they're one of my favorites for going out and they just sew really well was like the black spank and then like a cool statement jacket and I'm also going to bring my vinyl pants which I plan on wearing with sneakers in a more casual way these are my top shop ones these mixture as for tops I always like to pack a bunch of basics so I have two graphic tees one vintage Cubs roses and my Gucci today and then I have a few basic tank top so a brandy melville gray tank top which goes well under anything but also brandy melville t-shirt that's cropped a free people black tank top that will be really going to my other pants are you a my crop tee another basic white tee and then - just like oversized grey white t-shirts especially in a place like LA I don't tend to dress up really too much it's like really casual and it's mostly about just statement jackets and shoes so having a lot of basics just works right and put these all together and sometimes when I'm packing stuff like this I'll roll them up but I think this time around she's gonna work just fine also gonna bring two body suits this fishnet one from Danielle Grigio then this American Apparel one that's just what kind of 90s style straight cut across so doesn't I'm tacking for vacation I like to pack what's up on the hangers it's not the best use of space but if I'm not traveling with someone in like my or Courtney it makes my life a lot easier when I get there so this I'm actually going to add and last to my packing but I want to show you what I chose to bring so I have this misguided oversized huge sweater dress but I plan on wearing with my thigh high boots really casual day outfit for meetings I also have this new reprobation dress which I would dress down with a pair of sneakers probably I have these new pants from Reformation I've had this little slit at the bottom they're high-waisted and I actually plan on wearing these with one of the rocker cheese and I also have these two new pieces / realizations of this star dress and this lips talk which I would probably spare a chance so those I'm going to actually add it last so I'm going to bring these two shorts I want to wring one pair shorts one skirt just so I have options these Coupole other shorts which I think would be really cute I've worn them before with my thigh highs and then just a bodysuit underneath so that would be good going out outfit and just have that on to it jeans are this Zara plaid skirt which I wore with like a big sweater and stockings boots here a few weeks ago and being able wear it which is like a white tee and booties on as four jackets jackets are always the hardest thing with packbow because you need them the most and you want to have options cuz you want to switch it up this time around I'm going to try and just bring five for four nights and three nights actually I don't know fifty cents it doesn't at all actually I usually always overpack but I like some more options sometimes for jackets I will just fold them but since they don't have too much pack I'm going to try and fold them onto each other on the hanger so I can just take them out and I get there one of the works is like the shoes oh my god you're recording this I'm being corrected right now and miserable this is what really happened I was trying to show you guys what I do for myself but this is what actually ended a bit even though we'll come in and just save the guy puts the tops in person jackets just put on top okay hold it in and then you can just kind of go right on top yay okay few more things to show you guys I definitely need belts I'll just roll the belts and put them in this little pocket I also need underwear and bras obviously I also need workout clothes for other accessories I'm going to bring a few pair of sunglasses so that's what I like to change up the most for baths I'm going to bring this black Chanel for going out and then switch off between this and these two bags from Gucci for day bath so that's just on the accessory side of things I'm just going to put them in but usually I stuff one of the bags with like socks or cases from sunglasses and just kind of put them in where they make less sense got to sit on this you 
hey guys welcome back today I'm going to do a style haul for you guys I got a ton of new arrivals in this week so I'm just going to go through and show you my new favorite pieces and how Brenham one of my first pieces I'm going to show you guys are these condo like vinyl pants from Topshop you know I Worth black recently and I love them so much they're actually so much chunkier than they look and I know they're real scary to wear but I'm in Harlem with just an oversized t-shirt maybe a rocker or vintage sheet and oversized sweater something rather this because the pants are kind of tight and really sexy if it was available Topshop and and I would size up enough to the next thing I'm going to show you guys our two pieces I got from ASOS this kind of sheer Swiss dot top with the big sleeves and I would probably wear this under one of my overalls with a brown underneath of course or with high-waisted jeans it's really cute pop and I love how it has the big sleeves I love a good sheer moment I also got these kind of handkerchief like bandana scrunchies like to wear my hair up sometimes and this is a really cute alternative to just like a black ponytail I also got this sort of another like vinyl leather skirt I've been talking about statement skirts a lot and this one from IRA is really cute out there like the cutest new Brazilian brand they have really good pieces definitely suggest checking them out I would probably just wear this with a white t-shirt and then fishnet stockings or just opaque black stockings and civilian to other pieces I got two jackets from store X star X is actually a really affordable sight and I love this jacket and has the faux fur sleeve and it's also vegan leather and its really cute style it's a little bit more props I would throw stuff but I think it's really good statement coat this is off-white color first actually I also got this blue faux fur bomber which and they love the bombers take on it this one's also from stress and it has this detachable faux fur collar on the hood but the whole thing is line another new more high-end piece that I got is this MSG M sequin amazing oversized long-sleeved sweater situation actually lie though it's really comfortable but this is a pricier product I think this was about like 450 or the private dollars but I got this actually to wear during Fashion Week so I'm going to pair with like really simple like blue denim jean so you have like this kind of juxtaposition of the really fancy top with cute jeans this dress I have yet to wear but I'm absolutely obsessed with it it's finders keeper not only is it dusty rose but it's a velvet and it's midi and cute at shorter cuz he's amazing sleeves open back and this mock neck which I'm really excited about I definitely need to find an excuse to wear this and one of my favorite favorite brands started by Alex better a fourth of Labor is realization she just makes the cutest dresses hello hi I'm shooting YouTube yeah I'm doing a style hull what's that Shu students you'll see when you watch a video goodbye anyway so I have these two really cute new friends so this lip top that just ties in the front and this dress and I always wear these like on vacation you're so easy and good for going out and they just fit so well and they're pretty horrible check it out real thin I recently got these two new hoodies please speak themselves this velvet one so cute could be worn as a dress I mean I would wear this dress and then this kind of like lace-up one I also got a few new shoes recently from ASOS randomly actually I got these new adidas sneakers I mean this pair so cute it has this kind of like stock love part that comes up and they're neutral they're like nude and blush pink and zeros at the same time and we're just really cute these are adidas I also got these which I wore a few times already from Zara these are shoes are a knockoff of my silene that i have in white but they're really cheap and they're really cute and they're actually really well made I can't really be mad about it cuz I actually wanted the white ones it's black another dusty rose I don't know if you guys know I'm obsessed dusty rose dusty rose shoes these heeled lace-up booties from Jeffrey Campbell they are so cute so excited to wear that they're a little bit on the taller heel which I'm not used to wearing I'll wear the fashion week and maybe like for a night out of her free photo shoots so in the accessories category two new sunglasses I got in from cheveux and I think these are about like $70 I got this blue pair and it's really vintage looking cool yellow pair I love a good see-through sunny it's like all I wear oh when I was an aspen custom-made these Shambala Sunny's I custom-made him like as an I

blow [Music] 
[Music] hey guys what's up so a bunch of you've been asking me about how to get this slicked back low bun hair that I've been doing only for the past three weeks I actually was rushing to a meeting one day and my hair super greasy and dirty and I was like just flick it back it's gonna be great and I tried it for my first time and ended up loving it and you guys loved it too so I'm going to show you what I've been doing to get this look and a bunch of products that you can use to achieve it here we go so I like to start with my hair somewhat damp I got out of the shower like half hour ago but if you don't have damp hair I would suggest wetting it a little bit so I use the Kerastase reconstructing milk to start I'll just put it like kind of a quarter sized glob in my hand and just sort of rub it through my hair and this is to get it wet but also get it really soft and protected against any heat and products just sort of rub that through and then a little trick that I like to do because my hair is gonna be slicked back and wet look anyway olaplex is so amazing for repairing and kind of giving your hair a really amazing texture so I'll put a little bit in and mix that in as well it's kind of like a overnight hair treatment but I'll sometimes sleep with it in but it also helps to give the wet look and it's just really good for your hair so it's a good time to use it so then we'll just take my wet brush and I'll start patting down everything so it's nice and flat and I want to find my center part and I want to find it perfectly in the middle so I'm going to take the comb I'm going to run it straight back and Carter okay so now I have my somewhat straight center part and I'm going to take the most important thing which is this styling cream this one's from Bumble and Bumble but there's a ton of others that I'll link to below that are really good to know and I'm just going to start running it through tops of my hair and this will make it like a little bit hard but it's actually like a really nice styling cr√©me song run this through especially on the top brush it down start to make sure everything is flat now put a little parts up here you kind of want to come through with the comb really get that nice so once I sort of have the shape I want I'm just going to grab it and put it back into a ponytail [Music] so wrap this around really tight you should give it an extra twist before the third wrap it's super tight and that will create the shape that I want and then if there's any sort of like extra pieces all comes through again with the styling cream I sort of just love them down and we run that through and my trick was getting the bun to be really neat is to twist the ponytail and then start wrapping it and it's okay if it's a little bit messy you don't want this to be perfect okay and then again you'll wrap this ponytail three times around there we go that's the base of it and then I always come through with some hairspray this is from the way it's medium hairspray so it's not super sticky or anything come through and make sure all these little pieces are up oh these are the mistake throughout the guide and then I usually will bobby pin these pieces right here behind my ear and I kind of like the bobby pin showing I think it's like not a bad look I'll come in and buy up there and it actually would be cute to get two of them in a row so is Bobby one there and there you have it that's it 
hey guys what's up welcome back to my channel so here's what went down in the past few days we went to every PR showroom you can imagine here in New York City to get ready for New York Fashion Week I mean getting ready for New York Fashion Week takes a lot of work it's not just the rowing on a cute outfit and walking to the show there's a ton of planning that goes into it and so I really wanted to show you guys the behind the scenes of it all [Music] I do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Music] alright guys I hope you enjoyed this little behind-the-scenes look of what it takes to get ready for New York Fashion Week next you'll get to see actual Fashion Week and all of these looks come to life so I hope you enjoy [Music] 
hi guys it is time for another Q a you guys asked a bunch of questions last week on my Instagram so I'm just going to kind of run through them and answer them as quickly as possible the first question I got asked was what are the best ways to detox your body well at one point this summer I actually I don't really believe in juice cleanses and stuff so I try to detox where for two weeks I took away alcohol completely also dairy sugar and carbs and it completely reset my body it felt so amazing yes it was hard to not drink rose' in the middle of the summer but it was definitely worth it the second question I got was what are your favorite beauty bloggers were people to follow for makeup well my girl Janice justanna who was here the other week she has amazing makeup tips and she does great stuff so I follow her and I also follow how to beauty and she posts a lot of crazy stuff and I find a lot of people follow through her as well what do you look for when hiring interns when hiring interns the most important thing I look for is someone who is proactive so someone who just decides something needs to be done and does it without asking that's one of the most important things and then someone who has good background is organized and disciplined and doesn't want to do what I do so I don't usually like the hire interns who want to be a blogger I just think that's a little weird what is my skincare routine currently I'm using st. Ives apricot scrub and SK 2 um what's the word for toner that um and I actually have a big collaboration coming up with SK 2 so stay tuned they're amazing how did I get started in this business how did I get my foot in the door so a lot of people don't know but we were what actually started as a street style blog I was a street style photographer I just transferred from Wisconsin's fi T and it picked up a camera taught myself how to use it started photographing street style all around New York City about six to eight months and it turned into a personal style blog and a year and a half later I signed with next Model Management talent and it started becoming a real business I think one of the biggest things I owe my success to is being a fearless networker and I always say this when I speak on panels how important networking is so don't be afraid to email ask questions go up to someone cold email people there really is no such thing as a stupid question sometimes we say because also there is but there's really not so don't be afraid to number what is my fitness routine so currently I'm working out with will space who I've been working with forever we do boxing and then weight training I also do cardio on my own as many times a week as I can and I just started with sons of strength this guy Eric Johnson he comes to my gym in my apartment and it's been awesome so I'll do a video hopefully soon showing you guys like what I'm actually doing for my workout we really focus on the lower half my body because that's my problem area and what are your thoughts on brands not paying their interns is it unfair or just part of paying your dues first of all it's illegal to not pay interns if you aren't getting school credit so I do not ever think that that's okay if an intern is getting school credit I definitely always say that you need a stipend at least something I can pay for your food and travel per week so it shouldn't cost anyone money to work for you um but we do pay internships here we were what uh what is the best way to deal with haters I always say that haters mean you're doing something right so I choose to either ignore it I used to cry about it but mostly just ignore it and if it's really vulgar and I know like my mom's gonna see it I'll just block them and delete the comment okay what are your goals for 2017 I mean I just launched two brands so archive shoes and second scan overalls obviously growing those businesses is a huge huge huge priority for me um in 2017 I would like to finish writing a book I've been writing for the past three years I'm going to changed a ton but hopefully that'll be something finish and just expansion it's all about expansion in 2017 and I think there's a lot to come that I wish I could talk about but maybe other platforms wink wink TV you'll say okay how do i edit my Instagram photos there's actually a blog post on just look on my blog in the search bar do how I edit photos I think I've showed how I filter but I use um Snapseed vsco cam and face tuned uh how do you balance your work life and personal life I don't um it's definitely really hard knowing when to turn it off has been really difficult um but I guess trying to not be we were what all the time when I'm out with my friends and family and really just remember who I am as Danielle and Hurley know because they're kind of one in the same my blog really is me and the characters are the same and my personality is the same either way I'm pretty transparent and everything I do so balancing it is whatever the best advice when going to buy clothes I would say what did I say for this is in stable pieces stable pieces for sure um don't do any impulse purchases no impulse purchases if you see something you like and it's on the more expensive side put it on hold go walk around get a coffee get lunch and come back to it why I am +5 most as I am close by a lot but I think that you stops reason I stuff whatever we're not talking about me we're talking about my advice for other people okay you take on five Trent of your take on five trends for fall 16 that everyone should be wearing right now um I think fishnet which is what I'm wearing today I've been obsessed sweatshirt dresses or like long sleeves that are oversized as dresses with thigh highs layering bralette so yesterday I did a post with a turtle not going to brawl that layered with it I just love that look and a t-shirt with the lace bra that as well and velvet everything velvet okay next question if you hadn't gotten into fashion what would you be doing I always wanted to be an event planner actually and work in nightlife somehow so I've definitely dabbled it in over the years but that's probably what I would be doing if I was in fashion what are the best clothes to invest in I think a leather jacket for sure and then shoes and handbags always but otherwise I don't really myself by too much designer clothing because I think that you know the accessories is where you should be spending your money except for my overalls buy my overalls um good luck shameless what are five things you do every morning um coffee lots of it but actually since my stomach thing have to stop drinking as much coffee so I'm trying to you know do less of that um emails we sit here in the morning me Mom Courtney and go through like at least 100 or so emails um stretch we haven't said it recently but we did have like stretch sessions because it's so good - like meditate or stretch or do something in the mornings get your body moving I knew that that's really important blog put up a blog post in the morning and just like in general a lot of planning and organizing schedule stuff yeah how do you build a wardrobe with timeless but also statement pieces um I guess that's kind of a tough one just stay away from patterns and really dramatic shapes that could go out of style I think if you keep it pretty basic like color wise and neutrals and stuff that you'll have statement pieces but they'll be pretty timeless okay the next question is what is the best place to get cheap chokers so Etsy without a doubt is the best um but specifically there is an Etsy shop called Majesty chokers and that's where I get all those like Diamond D ones Fraser sterling also has really cute ones and the I'm label are those custom ones that I get they're actually also pretty affordable so you guys should check it out where can I find cheap accute handbags I would say either ASOS or Zara um pretty much those chuyia lines on the head all right what brand of eyeliner do you use liquid gel or pencil actually have it here because I saw this question I use Stila liquid liner this is the waterproof one that's gold it is unreal I'm addicted to it and I have like 20 of them for when I run out I lose it every day what are your favorite lip shades of the moment okay so this lip look I'm wearing today is a mixture of three different shades I start with this is bite Beauty Coco so it's just like brown color and it's from bite it's called Coco and then I use dose of colors sand on top of it to lighten it up a bit and then on top of all of them I'm either using Mac really me which is a new color or I'm using Maybelline cinnamon they're all amazing and I mix all three of them together which is kind of crazy but does this okay any tips for starting your own business and blogging advice for a beginner I actually did a whole post on this one's on my app so I'll transfer that to my blog since the app is unfortunately closing and I'll post it soon the next question is how did you a girl with no job meet and how would you describe your friendship Claudia is actually you know from the G world and I know her from I know her sister from growing up through a friend of mine and we met a few years ago and we have so much to relate to and she's a most lawyers person ever actually it's not just on Instagram she's so funny in person and yeah we're just really good friends we have a lot in common I really want to do a pastime Q and I with her which we're down for which is to find the time the best quality jeans that you recommend oh this is a good one so for like under $150 jeans Topshop 100% I love their quality and they're affordable so it's great and then for over $150 my favorites would be mother J Brand of humanity they're all amazing in great quality the next question I got is what kind of mascara do you use I mix at the moment I use this L'Oreal primer and then this like super old-school covergirl one just because I love the wand but I'm always down to try new mascaras for those who am using at the moment the next question is how do you keep up with trends I wouldn't say I necessarily focus on keeping up with trends but I definitely am influenced by them I mean I think everyone is but I wouldn't say that I revolve my blog or my life around that at all I kind of just wear what makes me happy the next question is what motivates you in life I think the City New York City in general there's so much hustle here it's insane everybody's moving at all times and doing a million things at once and the Hustle is real so it's really inspiring to be amongst other people that are always doing something bigger and better so it's really motivating the next question is what is the most challenging part of being a blogger I think what we said earlier like learning when to turn it off and how to kind of not feel the pressure that you always have to be on um that's kind of the challenging part and learning when to say no it has been really hard that's just so part of my career when the next question is what's your favorite sex position I know as this question um but if you must know doggystyle sorry mom sorry already um how how do I say organized and it's totally terrific fate um Wow organizes my whole schedule and I'll stay on top of it so most I say organize I'm not really like that organizer person so yeah but what camera do I use I will ask Jeff and let you guys know for the professional photos what we use but otherwise it's just iPhone photos shot by an iPhone is kind of like a thing right now and it works my favorite because time for professional photos all the time um did I go to college and what was my major yes I went to the University of wisconsin-madison and was a retail major I went for a year and then I transferred to FIDM was advertising and marketing communications manager if you had to wear the exact same outfit every day for the rest of your life what would it be overall duh kidding but no not really uh what's your favorite part about MIT I think that if you don't know what you want to do in fashion MIT has so many amazing connections and classes that you can take to figure that out and as far as internships and everything they can totally hook it up and it's a great part of going to school there do I pre plan my outfits for the week or just the night before um if it's for like a major event or Fashion Week I always pre plan and otherwise it's really just what I'm in the mood for that day what is the best way to get fashion internships in New York City if you have little to no connections I think there are so many websites like fashionista and what's the other one the internship website there is like fashion internships something yeah email people on LinkedIn colds email like I said earlier and fashion schools always have great connections to fashion internships so check out fitt bulletin boards and Parsons and all the other ones um how did I become more confident my mom will tell you I've always been pretty confident even when I had glasses and braces I I always thought it was hot so I think that in general becoming more confident is learning to be happy in my own body and cared less about what other people are saying because you can't please everyone and you should only please yourself I always say that the most important relationship is the one with yourself and if you can't be happy with yourself and never be happy with other people or what you're doing so are you doing another fitness collection when will it be available I am actually I'm doing a season two collection with Bandier and Stratus it's so hot and perfect there's like a lace-up legging set and another marble set and it's launching the second week of December so stay tuned for that how did you balance launching two brands in two months um launching second skin overalls was the craziest experience ever I didn't realize how much of an undertaking it would be and it's been so amazing humbling and I'm so proud of how it's turned out and seeing it come to life has been a dream come true honestly and then the archived shoes I had a lot of help with because that was a more of a collaborative effort between Jordan from modern vice and a bunch of other people so I think that balancing it I don't know I just literally have it stopped working I work 24/7 and yeah I just giving them both the love and attention that they need helping promote both of them at the same time if there was something you could tell fifteen-year-old Danielle what would it be this is a great one my one thing I would say to my 15 year old self would be do not ever with your hair do not color your hair you know cut it do not do anything to it um if I could go back to like not go and light too dark and kind of ruining my hair I mean I had like the longest most beautiful like full hair and then I start coloring X I wanted to be fashionable and no color bad for you next question have you ever struggled with depression or anxiety um definitely I think that depression wise I don't think I've been clinically depressed there's definitely been times where I've been really down and I've just said why am I still doing this and I've wanted to quit anxiety all the time I have major anxiety especially before I'm about to speak on a panel or I have a big lunch coming up I think I see somebody um I don't think there's any problem with asking for help I have sort of like this life coach slash therapist that I talked to once a week she's absolutely amazing and she helps me deal with you know a lot of the issues that may come with this industry and I think just like asking for help and being able to like openly talk about these kinds of things have been helpful but you know anxiety and depression I feel like it's something that a lot of people deal with and just like trying to keep calm meditation is something I've tried but I don't have patience for and Jeff how do I avoid comparing myself to other bloggers I mean it's definitely hard if I see another blogger working with a brand and I'll say oh I would have loved that job or like that would have been like such a dream collaboration for me but I think that all I'm friends with a lot of other bloggers and we're all extremely different that's what makes us successful because we all of our individual style so I don't really like to compare myself to other bloggers at all I think that we're all different in our own special way what is my favorite choker that I currently had I think that this new one actually that the M Jewelers just sent me might become my favorite it's really cute um but also just like all those plain like diamond D bands and I guess my I'm label one that says we were what on it it's like a thin one I like that as well how did Erin and I meet and what's my favorite thing to do with him Erin and I met two summers ago on a yacht in Montauk in Hamptons and I was actually being set up with his friend Kyle got on the boat Erin and I were like the joke of the weekend was like oh I rented you know a lot of each other they're best friends but we didn't hook up until like a month later when he came back he was living in Chicago at the time but he's from Michigan and we started seeing each other and then we did the long-distance thing for a few months and then he moved here and then we just moved it together and my favorite thing to do with him would probably be either go out and eat see movie or go shopping cause he actually loved shopping so that's where did I grow up I grew up in Great Neck which is a town on Long Island how do I deal with fake friends I think definitely over the years I realized who my real friends are and who my not real friends are based on just the mere fact of what I do and the kind of connections and things I get to do because of my job um and you realize the people that are actually there for you for other than my we were what perks and I've just kind of weed them out over the years I think that it you don't have time in your life like there's no room for fake friends and people that don't matter so kind of cutting those people out of your life is necessary do I follow a diet or nutrition plan I don't really believe in dieting but I recently also have tried to again cut out dairy and carbs um just like should be pretty easy but actually love cheese so it's hard and I cut out spicy foods recently because I my stomach what is my favorite restaurant in New York City there's so many options but I'll always kind of go back to Bond Street sushi or like Nobu or ally or Montesa I don't even know there's actually so many mamo and Soho I mean Jemma the truffle pizza there there's so many good ones but Bond Street is always like a cool good one um where is my favorite place to travel the trip the place I travel to most that I love is LA I love going to LA I would never want to actually permanently live there but I love going back and forth um but there are so many places I haven't been I want to go the Maldives so badly um a ton of places in Europe that I haven't been and yeah why is mo so testify I don't know how I use doesn't Aaron he's so nice and he gets her sense of humor and what and they get along well can you like him ranek mo always says she's like the third girl Randall Aaron says that she's like the other girlfriends in a relationship um speaking of do you want kids yes I want kids I want to I want a boy and then a girl if I'm lucky but I think first I want another puppy doesn't don't you guys finish you get another puppy like yes yes what is my first-ever designer piece this is a good one I saw this one and they'll never see me wear this because it's so so so old but when I was 13 around my but Mitzvah my dad got me this white Chanel bag look at how old this is this was my first designer thing I've ever owned thank you ruined me from here um what is your favorite TV show I always liked all the Netflix shows are just a new black um shameless new shows I love Westworld on HBO it's so good this is us is amazing family chat any of you see a man that you love the housewives duh all Brava shows um and yes Quantico is really good too on ABC was there a moment in your life when you thought wow I made it I think that hitting 1 million followers was kind of my like the ultimate like I always had when I had a million followers that's going to be like the moment I've been waiting for um my friends actually threw me a surprise party which was awesome and this is great if you could choose any brand to design a collection with who would it be I think my next ideal collaboration would be a lipstick collaboration I would love to create a line with any of the lipstick brands that I love of like taupey brown nude colors dusty rose lip and I would love to do that so maybe lipstick would be next how do you choose candidates to join team we wore what so right now team we were what is intern Courtney and chief brand officer mo love the title judge um and I choose candidates based on vibes first of all I have to enjoy being around you every single day because that's what happens I have to be able to trust you um people have great experience who are smart proactive not shy I need outgoing people what else do we look for guys organized organized for sure yeah I said that for internships just someone with good experience yeah it's not easy I mean we really do work hard and I'm kind of a lot to deal with sometimes so just someone who can handle it okay guys that is it for now I pretty much got through all the questions that you guys ask there were some repeats um I'll do another Q&amp;A in the next few weeks or like a month or so if anyone was wondering these glasses are not prescription I did wear glasses for 12 years so I feel like I can wear these are get away no but I got LASIK surgery and I just ordered used to look smart and cute all right that's it thanks for playing 
hey guys what's up welcome back to my youtube channel today I'm going to be showing you how to get everyday Beach ways this is my morning hair routine as well and everything will be linked below and I'm going to show you guys how to get this look here we go alright guys so I want to show you what I washed my hair with first I used original minerals new conquer blonds collection now these are silver purple shampoos that are absolutely amazing so when your blonde hair gets a little bit brassy this will help get it ashy again and take out a lot of the brassiness so these are my favorite and I use this for shampoo and conditioner every time I wash my hair leave it in for like 3 to 5 minutes also this will definitely help so then when my hair is wet and right now it's damp but it's been about like 15 minutes since I got out of shower I always prep it with Bumble and Bumble hairdresser invisible oil so I'm just going to spray so the whole thing and then I'll brush it through or I'll just kind of work it through with my fingers and then I also use GHD advanced split end therapy and this i'll just put like a dime sized into my hand and just kind of work it through the edge and it's so that when you blow your hair or string or putting hot tools to it it'll keep it intact and you won't have those like little flyaways okay so let's start blowing I usually let my hair air dry for about 15 minutes like I already did so it's not like completely wet right now and I'm going to start with this blow dryer it's also GHD and it's really powerful and there's something original raised in my dog farm set up um so it's loud ok so now that I just kind of air dried with the regular blow dryer I'm going to start splitting it into sections put this up with a clip so I'm just doing half-up half-down so I get different sections and I'm going to use a very old-school product that you guys are probably going to make fun of I am going to use this con airbrush blow dryer I've been using this since I was in Middle School I never learning how to blow my hair properly with this brush and a blow dryer and this kind of just gives you that flat straight look I always want before I put my waves in it so I'm just going to put it in two sections like this and we use this to blow my hair now that I completely dry the bottom half I'm going to go over it with my ght flat iron um this one is ceramic and it's my favourite doesn't damage your hair too much but obviously all he does I'm sure hair and I'm just going to go over slightly so that it kind of flattens out these pieces if I was going to wear my hair straight I would be going over it like ten times but it hasn't been actually wanting to curl it I'm just going to kind of go over it following my brush and just trying to turn it inwards at the bottom so that the pieces all go down and just get it back nice and flat and then I'm just going to do the same thing I'm going to flip my head and use the Conner blow dryer to do the top and I remember that too okay so now that my hair is blown straight I'm going to come in with my t5 style stick because it's called but I'll link to it below anyway and this is a great one to use I've been using it for like the past year and a half I'm going to start with the back piece so I'm going to take my hair split it in two and start with the left side and I'm going to start with about this much hair probably in a little bit less and for the back half of my hair I'm going to do some away from my face and some forward and then when I get to the front I'm going to do everything away from my face so I'll show you what I mean by that I'm going to start with the one and about this close to the top I'm going to wrap it away from my face and I'm going to leave about an inch out at the bottom and just count from six down and let it go and you'll see it just gives this sort of like nice wave that eventually I'll like brush it out so I'm just going to do that going with back and forth all different directions but I'm not going to ever go too high up because I don't like them to start that I'd welcome calls after - but let's do the other side and I'll be right back okay so I am basically done I am just coming in and adding in a few more pieces where we it did it holds up because my hair is always so stubborn but that's essentially how I do my hair every day and to finish it off I'm going to use two different products the first is original minerals frizzy logic and this is just a serum that smells absolutely amazing and you literally need like a penny stock it's like so small and I'm just going to rub it in and it is pretty oily so I'm only going to put it on my ends but this does keep it from not getting too frizzy um and if you have any like random flyaways you can pat it down I'm just kind of work it into your hair but I kind of scrunch it in and then if I want that extra beachy wave love I'm going to take the way waves dry which is one of my favorite chat-up and products shake it up a bit and just kind of spray a few sprays from a bit away and work it in and kind of tease my hair a little and that's it I read your hair alright guys so that's it this is how I get my everyday waves they're not really beach waves they're not super wavy they're just what works for me so all the products will be links below and don't forget to subscribe 
are we calling it a style hall no clothing a new clothing hall hey guys what's up welcome back to my channel today we are doing another clothing haul with all of my new arrivals i curated it a little bit for you guys because some of it you've probably already seen so I'm just going to go through store by store and show you guys that I got let's do it so first I'm going to start with some new pieces I just got from Reformation I got these specifically for a trip I'm going to to the Bahamas next weekend so I wanted some really summery beachy things this is one dress I got it's this white linen really cute dress that ties in the front and this would be perfect with just like a straw fedora and some sandals so you'll see that next week I also got this really cute set I saw it and Radha wear it in the pants version and I thought that this would just be really cute for the beach as well so it's this crop top and these detached but there's came that way and this little button-down plaid skirt so the best part about Reformation is the pieces kind of speak for themselves and they don't have to be paired with anything they're already outfits and there's really easy and here's another linen dress I got and this one has these ties sleeves and this kind of scalloped lace on the bottom and top so you'll see those next week the next thing I got were a few pieces from forever 21 now I've always been a fan of forever 21 I haven't been an actual store in probably over a year but I do love their stuff this is a track suit I got it's velour so really old-school and it came with the matching track jacket this was so cheap I think the jacket was twenty-two and the bottoms were 19 so really cute to get that kind of athleisure wear look that I've been wearing a lot of lately and I would probably pair this with just a white bodysuit the one I was wearing today this white one I have it necessary clothing is awesome and also really cheap and then just white sneakers also from forever 21 I got these striped pants you're cool and rock-and-roll and I would wear them with black booties and just kind of a vintage t-shirt or an oversized sweatshirt and just make them the statement piece of the outfit next up are two really cool swimsuits actually that I got from this Etsy store called naked intersection and they're suede and velvet so they're not like traditional swimwear but how sexy and cool is this this kind of has this like overalls top and they're really high rise and really cute on actually I don't know if I would actually go in the water with them but they're really nice and then this one is velvet and it's a one-piece and it ties in the front here has this sort of suspender strap and is open also high-rise on the sides and I'll probably wear that next week as well next up we have two pieces I got from si se a this top with the pinstripe and the scallop top I would probably wear this with light wash jeans or jean shorts even on vacation but it's just more romantic and a little bit girlier than what I'm used to wearing and then I got another version of it in this linen and pinstripe mix and it has a lace-up top and I would wear this with something high-waisted because it is pretty cropped probably jeans or jean shorts as well okay speaking of necessary clothing they're just so affordable and have so many good basic pieces right now so I got a ton of body suits from there and these are obviously just good to pair with anything they're great layering piece this v-neck body suit that I wore in white today is so good it fits so well it's like the perfect cut and I mean I wore without a bra just because that's what I always do but it's really nicely cut and it will work with anything I also got this fishnet bodysuit which is really good I actually got a medium and think I have to return it for a small cuz it's kind of big but I love the fishnet look layer you guys know that I've been wearing it so much and so that and also I got it in black and these were only I think these were like 16 dollars or something so cheap I also got these sort of more lingerie inspired body suits and I've been wearing lingerie inspired body suits a lot with high waisted pants out on the weekends I think it's just really sexy and it's just more interesting than wearing a plain body suit I've also been wearing it with my sweat pant looks which is obviously very Kim Chi and I got this long-sleeve version as well so I would probably either just wear nipple covers or some sort of solid black bra under this and yeah okay next door let's do a ritzy ax so I went to riskier recently and did this insane like massive shopping spree they're they're so good to me and I got all this new TNA stuff which I posted about a few days ago these sweatpants sets a lot of good athleisure wear but here are some of the pieces I got that are not that are more on night time this ribbed dusty roads off the shoulder top is so cute and really fits so well so I would suggest getting that and then I have these two tops that are more disliked linen cotton mix these blouses and they just have really interesting shapes to them and I love the neutral colors and those are Wilfred which is sold at at SIA next up I will show you some a so stuff you know I'm obsessed with ASOS and ASOS denim is actually one of my new favorites to shop there these flame jeans I mean how cool is that I'm obsessed with these they just came today they're high-waisted and have the flame going all the way down the bottom and I'm definitely wearing these this weekend I also from Rhett SIA I've been from ASOS sorry I've been focusing on getting a lot of Coachella pieces so I found this set it's this silk skirt that comes with this matching top and I think I'm actually going to take it to be altered and make the top into like a little cropped bralette because I want it to be a little bit sexier and because the skirts a maxi skirt so it's this maxi skirt that splits up the front and then this top so we'll see if I can make it work from Zehra I mean I get sufferings our almost every week but just two new standout pieces that I got was this sort of gingham crop top oh no this is Reformation another Reformation piece okay this is from Reformation also I got it to wear with pants I got from Zara to wear like sort of a gingham on gingham look so that'll be really cute and then this jacket is from Zara and it kind of reminded me of that really big shoulder blends yoga jacket but that's Jack it's like three grand or something and this was not so I got this one it has these really cute shoulders and his crops and yeah accessories wise I got a few new things this mini Louie Vuitton backpack I'm so excited about I wanted it forever and I one specifically wanted it for Coachella so got it and I'm going to wear it so excited it doesn't hold much but it will hold the essentials from Daniel Patrick which is this really cool men's store that just started making women's stuff I got a bunch of swept handsets but one of the favorite things that I got were these sneakers they're high-top dusty rose with this kind of gummy bottom they're kind of a little more like ghetto fabulous but they actually match the sweatshirt perfectly I'm definitely gonna wear these down they're cute and then also accessory-wise I got these sunglasses from urban that are so cute I love the tint and then this choker which is sort of this fishnet choker with a chain running through it but would be really cute and then these hoops I'm wearing are actually also from Free People so Free People has a lot of good accessories right now especially belts and yeah that's it for now that was a quick one but I'll definitely update you guys more in the next few weeks

you say hey guys I'm Courtney and you think I'm owed and birthday and routine we were one okay hey guys I'm Courtney and I'm out and we're team you or what yeah yeah good okay guys on Courtney I'm Mel and we're team we wore what you hate it water hey guys hey guys I'm Courtney I'm Moe and we're a team we wore what Wow yes you leave now I was a sophomore at MIT studying fashion business management and I had a few fashion internship my freshman year of college and I just realized how much I hated it and then I came across her Instagram she had 250,000 followers and I was what the hell is this girl doing because I could tell she was making money I just emailed her I go to fashion school I don't know what you're doing but you're making money and I want to learn what's the back end of it is but I didn't want to do what she was doing so she agreed to meet me and I started with her that day at coffee shop that was this August that will be four years ago so my cousin knows Danielle and she told me that Danielle was looking for an intern over the summer so I reached out an email Danielle I was in away on vacation and I was like I can come as soon as possible and she's like can you come tomorrow and I was like I was like sure so we were flying back day anyway so I came into her apartment the next day as the intern and I'm still known as I see I'll always be MC with those pieces Anton corny brother I would say one of the best things about working with Danielle is the traveling that we do I've been all over the world like London la Miami Texas British Virgin Islands Cabo Paris next week the best part personally is like being able to go to all these school meetings because any other first job I think I would have in fashion I wouldn't be able to meet awesome people that I'm like iced med and also just so much responsibility especially with the overalls literally starting a brand and growing it is so cool biggest fuck-up is I would say forgetting to pack her jewelry and then she texted me and was like where's all my jewelry and I was like so I'm sitting on your counter I'm sorry I probably I think my biggest fuck-up would be I gave someone her blog password once and you just like edit something for a page post and I was like oh they offered to just do it themselves nowzick okay so I gave them her login and then I got this call I was like sitting on a spin bike about to take a spin class and she says three me I mean I could balling and I ran the spin class I would like to try got it ah what about me you guys laughs but you don't know oh you got what I want [Music] my favorite designer is Sandra same with me but I would say from Fashion Week I also love Sally deploying my spirit animal is a dog forever yours is a oh I love wait I don't have a spirit animal like I don't think I'm an animal but if I was an animal I would want to be a peacock I want to be a golden doodle exactly everybody's like under lion I'm a dog like no I am a peacock [Music] Danielle we burn vision I don't have an idol can I skip this one shoot okay but that's my one pot my PLT pleasure that's right franchises for sure my guilty pleasure is Kristy Emma [Music] my crush I'm going to go with a girl Bella Hadid and I can tell you Mo's my celebrity crush is Travis it's been a long day without you my friend and I'll tell you all about it when you do damn it Charlie if you're watching Mao is single and once you hit me I'm pretty why in most a ball ha ha ha she's too good for all the guys that she hangs out with and Mo is very picky the quote I live is Yolo oh my god whatever Danielle says does and I don't know by my luck we stay but I honestly and I have it tattooed on me I don't bite fate which just like everything happens for a reason cliche but I really believe it my favorite Instagram account to follow is either humans of New York or honestly girls no joke my favorite Instagram account to follow is the dogged [Music] oh this the most annoying thing about Danielle is how messy she is she leaves her clothes literally everywhere including her jewelry underwear workout clothes shoes everything everywhere I think the most annoying thing about Danielle is waking up one morning it's not as easy as it could be takes like 30 minutes ago my favorite thing about Courtney is how similar we are it just makes coming to work so much easier we just get each other we can hate on Danielle this is the reason we feel each other's pain just makes things so much easier my favorite thing about Mel is how on top of her game she is from the day I met her she's just like on top of it and has taught me so much if I wasn't working for Danielle I would probably be working at an ad agency I would probably be a buyer somewhere or in sales for a company just normal after f IG job I'd probably be miserable

of a miniskirt and then it oversized sweatshirt so we'll see I'll probably where that stands my Boothbay Sammy Mero just gave me this body suit that I absolutely love if the sheer black long sleeves I see it with the denim patch running through the center and I would wear this the way I wear anybody's doing it just with some high-waisted jeans or my leather pants and then layer it it would be cool

have in Paris or something here and spring but it's really cute and off the shoulder it's like frilly and girly and then this romper as well with the ruffle sleeve over the place and actually really sure it looks up the rubber part but I would even wear our like black tights maybe over the entirety you look like this Loran here something very Parisian so Caroline Constance is one of my favorites

hey guys what's up welcome to another clothing haul I have so many new arrivals so much to show you guys so I'm just gonna get started and hold up and explain where things are from why I bought them or why they were given to me and we'll just go from there so let's get started I have a bunch of new arrivals from one of my favorite brands for love and lemons I'll just show you a few pieces so it's this top that ties in the middle paired with this matching skirt so cute I can't wait to wear this I'm like literally unable patient or if I have to wait to summer I will and then it also comes in blue so I would actually mix and match the two colors I think that this would be really cute together also from for love and lemons since they just literally make the cutest dresses ever we are all tangled here okay also from 4:11 lemons I got this really cute polka dot red polka dot dress I'm so into polka dots this season I wore a ton on my recent trip to Carta hennya I've been obsessing with polka dots and wearing them all over the place and so I can't wait to wear this guy and then there's this pop off the shoulder actually I think this one's on the shoulder with a little lace up kind of like that peasantry look I also got this off the shoulder tap which is a little more structured it's in a white denim I think this is really cute they just always send me the best stuff and then I also have this really cute bra top that recently came I don't know if you guys can see it has this like eyelet sort of detail to it really cute buckle for all of this okay other new recent purchases are from mango I got this really cute oversized sweatshirt that has a sort of bandana and fringe appeal to it definitely just wear this with some blue jeans keep it casual Brooklyn so there's a lot of really good pants at mango right now and I love to get pants especially right before Fashion Week I buy a lot of pants because when I go to pull for Fashion Week I don't always fit into the sample sizes the tops I'm good with but pants know so I just like to buy a ton of pants so I got these red ones from mango they're just like loose and silky and then these I thought were really cool these black pants they kind of have this like white stitching going through them and then this would buckle right here to close them other new arrivals of the pants I wore from Marisa web this is the matching top to it it almost looks like a trench coat made into this really cute off the shoulder top and I love what they do their style is so good and their pieces are always really cute this is another off the shoulder top and a plaid and they actually showed the khaki pants paired with this top and I think that that's a really cute VEX something else new that I got were these jeans from the brand is so hard to pronounce Ksenia she made her and I probably pronounced it wrong but they're these jeans that look like they're almost too jeans and one they have this like opening here but they connect and so it looks like you're wearing a really loose Jean and then it gets straight like at the end I saw them on a few celebrities actually wore them recently but I've seen them in some Street style photos from Europe and I'm really excited to wear them I'm going to save them for Fashion Week now for Reformation you guys know and love I got this really cute leopard set these pants are high waisted and amazing and I think that they also come in plaid so definitely get them I love how high-waisted they are it's really hard to find like legitimate high waisted pants they might say high-rise the high-rise and high waisted I think are just absolutely different and then that came with a matching top I would wear the matching set together but I would probably wear like a white t-shirt under it or something I also got this top which is a little bit sexier from Reformation it has these like baby baby shoulder pads in it so it's laced with baby shoulder pads low neck really sexy I would just wear this with high-waisted jeans out at night whatever and then this really like sweet sort of floral II it's a little bit see-through top and this I would just wear with like jean shorts or something casual also one more thing I got from them is this dress I mean Reformation makes the best dresses and just super simple and easy no-brainer for vacation moving on show some accessories these two bags are my absolute favorite from staad she's a relatively new designer you might have seen me wear this one Encarta hennya recently this is another one it's like kind of lucite and has this built-in pouch that you can put in so you can wear it with or without this part but I think it looks really cute cuz it matches the handle so I like how ended up wearing it together she just makes the best option makes clothing too and it's just really cute on trend other accessories we can talk about some shoes Manolo did this collaboration with Castagna I think I'm pronouncing it right I have never worn s4 jewels before I've never been a fan of espadrilles but these are pointy toe espadrilles and it's a carburetor in the middle I mean look how cute these are and I've tried these on they're really flattering on your feet and I just love the lace up detail of them the color is amazing and so my first or gels back to clothing I got two new designer t-shirts I know that seems ridiculous ever since the Gucci tee I was kind of like I'll never spend money on a designer t-shirt again but when Valencia and Sandler I make designer t-shirts you can't really say no so I got this blunt iago on it's just I would like to wear t-shirts a lot and be casual and so if I want to wear one let's say to Fashion Week it might as well be a designer and I had a discount code when I order them so they weren't that expensive I just have to say that and then this saintly Rahman and obsessed the color it's like this acid wash gray and it has just a baby baby logo my boyfriend tells me I'm a label whore but like whatever dude I work in fashion and also from st. Laurent is this new belt that I got because I'm kind of over wearing my Gucci belt so I wanted another black and gold belt and this one has just like a really a small little logo and it's just simple suede easy little beef right it's like small so it'll just be for my high-waisted pants I really like this one back to non designer things a label we all know and love as of like this year I am gia the label they are just so cool I mean they keep coming out with these pants in more colors and more styles these are the I forget what they're called but you know I have them in black I have them in khaki I have them in white and now I have them in black leather they're not obviously real leather and they're pretty shiny so they're awesome and they have the chain and I wear a small and medium in these pants I think that sometimes I like them to be even looser than they come and then also from IMG oh the label this little red off the shoulder top it's super stretchy so it looks really comfortable and actually think they're probably cute pair together I love red and black what do I have am i right so recently stone-cold Fox sent me a package they did a collaboration with always judging my friend Courtney and this is a really cute crop houndstooth blazer it's kind of vintage inspired looking but it's cropped so that's obviously cute and these pants came also in the package which are just some high-waisted silk floral pants and I think that these two pieces actually look really cute paired together okay these pants crazy story I mean look at them these are brand called and I'm gonna they're called it says material but like it's not spelled materials the normal way I'll link to it below anyway but I saw these pants on my friend Dana Hourani she's a blogger from Dubai she's like one of the coolest people I follow I'll link to her Instagram too because I want you guys to follow her I saw her wearing these with a white button-down and I was just like holy should I need that look for New York Fashion Week so I asked the brand if they would send them to me and they did and so I can't wait to wear these people definitely see these on me during Fashion Week kiss my kini okay my friend Jordan is amazing bathing suit designer she just came out with this new kiss my kini bathing suit the bottoms have this gold chain they're super high rise and then the top is a bando with a gold chain down the middle the chain pieces that she does is a collaboration between chose by a thread and kiss my kini so I think chokes by a thread provides all like the jewelry stuff and that she makes the bathing suits and you've seen me wear her stuff before okay ooh are you a my obviously a favorite for basics roomie has made such amazing basics over the years and she just came out with one of our my favorite tops of hers which is this like off the shoulder crop top in a bodysuit so I have that this black off the shoulder it's the softest material ever if you've never felt any of her pieces just get a t-shirt because I swear they're the best and it's the best material I wear them non-stop and then this health gold button is this white turtleneck and you can like unsnap it snap it it's really cute also from Rumi I got this off the shoulder white top it's actually like a really sturdy nice material super cropped everything she does that's cropped was like really crop so if you have boobs this may not be the brand for you because my boobs even fall out of some of it okay a frm is a really cool brand they just started last year you guys have definitely seen me wear a bunch of their stuff over the year they used to be called a ride clothing change the name to frm they just sent me this denim blazer that has studing that goes with these denim pants I love a good matching set I can't wait to wear this it has a super 70s vibe to it but I think it's really cute see okay when I was in Australia I went to this store I forget the name but this designer store that my friend Sasha took me to and this vet mantra I borrowed from my friend Sophie when we were in Paris and I loved it so much and I was like searching the web for it could never find it and I finally found it in the store in Australia and it was on sale sorry so I found it on sale it's really hard to tell what it looks like because you kind of have to like wrap it around ten times but I'm gonna wear this soon also and it's just this floral vet mont dress in colombia recently I went to this store Johanna Ortiz as a designer she's calling me in her stuff's really expensive but I was like if I'm in Colombia I want to own my first piece from her and I want to own a piece that I get in Colombia because she's a Colombian designer so this off-the-shoulder sweater it has this ruffle and then this huge sleeve one-shoulder so cute Oh same time as the store I got it from and this is Johanna Ortiz and I'm obsessed with it and I can't wait to wear it and then to other random pieces I got I

top I got it's from Peterson but I got it from but it's Peterson that's the brand they sell it on shop up it's really cute it has his palm print and I'll wear that on vacation probably with high waisted pants or jean shorts and then I just have a few more shoes to show you guys designer ones I just shot these Bolin Tiago kidding heeled pumps they're really really good in healed and short which I love and they're white and I've obsessed with them I also got common project sneakers I have never owned a common project sneakers I was wearing my Stantler Outlands for a really long time I think a good white sneaker is an investment piece and I think that common projects are actually better than the Saint Laurent ones they are way more comfortable they're like slim and chic and is really stark white and I love them so much I think everyone should invest in a good pair of white sneakers but if you can't you know I love my kids and those are like 40 bucks and then these boots I love combat boots I have my Louboutin ones that I wear all the time but these are Alexa Chung new line and these come in a bunch of different colors actually but I love the white pair and I'm really excited to wear these these just came in I'm actually gonna switch out the laces for a stark white pair because this is like kind of like a dirty beige looking but they're really cute and chunky and I love them and then I have two new pairs of sunglasses Adam Selman endless specs have the best collaboration ever and I always wanted these so I got these Sony's and I think they're really cute and fun and good for like a specific outfit and then I also got this clear pair that's really funky that I'm not even sure how I'm gonna wear them but I just had to have him I thought they were so cool

[Music] there's one question I get asked the most it's along the lines of how do I become successful in the fashion history how do I start a blog and how do I build a career in this industry I'm sorry to say that there is not one right answer there is not one secret sauce to doing this but I do have some tools that I can give you to get to where you are base following are the best tips and business advice that I can give you guys many of which were bestowed upon me by people I look up to and many of which I've learned while finding a career in such an undefined industry the first tip I have for you guys is to be a fearless networker this is going to be so far in life I've never been afraid to go up to someone important shake their hand say hi introduce myself tell them Who I am ask for their email as some questions connected them via business cards there really is no wrong way to do this speaking of a handshake shakes firmly I judge almost anyone I meet off their handshake we can't shake from a man tells me he doesn't think other people or is it a good business man a firm handshake from a woman it tells me that she's confident and probably pretty  awesome an extra trick when I meet someone I always repeat their name back to myself like hi I'm Danielle nice to meet you oh hi Danielle I'm whatever if you repeat their name it always helps me remember it's just a little extra tip for you guys take rip trial and error is basically what I've built my career on you never know if something's going to work if you don't try not learn from your mistakes but don't harp on them personal example for this is not reading the fine prints and contracts before I sign with my modeling agency and something I had the don't be something for everyone be everything for someone by this I mean find your niche niche is such a cliche word but is extremely important tip if you're just starting a blog try to fill up space in the industry that just doesn't exist oversaturated industry is difficult to stand out so it's really important to try something different quality over quantity this is not only content advice but life advice channel so it's the brand's you promote or events you attend align yourself with what speaks to your settings of us great example of this would be Fashion Week at first I attended every single show I was invited to but I soon realized only supporting the brand's I'd loved and had personal relationships with was even better create a demand for your business surround yourself with support and a great support system a great support system is the key to many people's success don't think you can do it all on your own and asking for help doesn't make you look weak either try not to look at your peers as competition rather a group of people with the same questions or problems that you have now I won't lie to you everyone feels this way now it's just being a good judge of character turn it off I can't even tell you how important this is Vince because as a blogger my job is 24/7 and it can be exhausting so learning when to turn it off taking time for your friends and family not seeing me or what is so important and will help you stay sane work hard play harder it has been one of my life motto because hey I can give you some of my best networking at night and you never know who you're going to meet by socializing not everyone will agree with this but I'd argue that some of my best deals have been closed after a few drinks the networking relationships you build out and I allow for a personal connection to be built it's also a great way to reward yourself for hard States for hard day's work today organized now I'm not alone in this because I moment Courtney who are managing my schedule and with me on a day to day basis but before they were in the texture creating a Content calendar for myself as a structured schedule is extremely important this isn't a nine-to-five career but can be as close to it as you make it even working from home I get dressed and ready as if I was going to be almost a morning and find that that helps me to stay motivated number 10 is maybe the most important piece of advice that I can give you guys and that is to stay authentic authenticity and staying true to my brand has been one of if not the most important keys to success this goes hand-in-hand with learning when to say no even if the money is there if the brand doesn't align with yours say no it's not only builds trust in your followers but shows others that you are not willing to promote something that you don't truly believe it I've always told myself true to this standard to it for my business advice for now we can get more specifics and I can show you things like habit my photos and how I started my blog like literally from the back end of it comment below with what you want to see I hope you enjoyed that don't forget to give that firm handshake and subscribe love
