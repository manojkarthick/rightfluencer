hey everyone today I'm going to be showing you how to curl your hair with a clipless curling iron I usually use a curling iron with a clip which means it has the little thing attached to it that you open up when you curl your hair but recently I've been using this Jose Eber ever I'm not quite sure how to pronounce it clipless curling iron and I love the beachy waves that it gives my hair on the last post where my hair was curled I used this and I've been using it ever since so I wanted to show you guys how simple and easy it is it's actually quite faster than curling your hair with a curling iron that has a clip so to start off break your hair into two sections I have really thick hair so this always makes it easier for me so I'm just going to tie it up into a sloppy bun on the top just so I have the section below to work on and it also came with a glove to wear so you don't burn your hand when you're holding the hair when you wrap around it but I've gotten used to it so I'm not going to use the glove today but for those of you that are first starting out it's probably good to use it so one of the tricks of using the curling iron is to figure out the ways to wrap it around and there are a variety of different curls you can create depending on how you wrap it around the curling iron so for example if you make if you wrap it around more spaced out you'll have looser waves but if you wrap it around really tight you'll have tighter curls okay so now we have the curling iron it's getting hot so I'm going to take a small portion of my hair in the front and you're going to take the curling iron and you're going to hold it like so and you're going to wrap the hair around it and you're going to hold the ends like this and wait until you can can touch the hair and see when it is feeling hot and then you take it off and see this really pretty loose curl that I have and so I'm going to do that again my hair is since it's dark it's a little bit harder to see but and the reason why I'm holding it upside down is to make the curls go this way instead of this way as if I were to do it this way the curls would be facing my face instead of facing out and that's the way I like to curl my hair but depending on how you like it you can do it either way so I'm going to do the same thing wrap it around and hold it and you can kind of touch the hair and you can feel when it's getting hot and see how the curl is spaced so if you could do it really tight like this and that will give you the tighter curls or you can spread it out and that will give you the looser curls so this is a kind of in-between and I like to brush it out so it doesn't get too into one big curl and I'm going to take going to take the next piece and do the same thing the trick is just to be careful when you're wrapping it around so you don't burn yourself but you'll get the hang of it after a few tries and just feel the hair and another loose curl all right so now I've curled the bottom section of my hair and I have these loose waves that I'm just going to brush out and kind of tousle so they don't get too curly just kind of pull it and I'm going to take down the second section and pull all the hair on to two sides and I'm going to start with this first front piece of hair I'm going to do the same thing that I did with the bottom section and I'm going to hold it up hold the curling iron at the base of my hair and wrap it around like this all right so here is the final result of curling my hair with the clipless curling iron it creates these loose beachy waves that I like to brush out and they actually last for a really long time so if you have not already I completely recommend the clipless curling iron I was using the giraffe Clippers curling iron by Jose Eber so I hope you enjoyed my tutorial I'll see you guys soon bye 
welcome to Iceland we did so you come Haley really nice there's actually waves breaking off hey we just got back with our blue lagoon experience and now our Icelandic adventures vegan what kind of weather have we seen in just a few hours we've been here we've seen ice cold wind chills we've seen hail we've seen rain and we've seen snow so I don't know how much how sweet we are in search of lunch right now you just got to Reykjavik right give it yeah one of those one of those roses Danny is raising cool it's really cool not cold enough to snow it should see [Music] we don't know if we're supposed to be driving on this road route said it was closed but this is the only way - better towel there's another card track on there hopefully it's not another tourist like us that's someone who actually doesn't our car is a big 4x4 which is luck [Music] [Applause] [Music] say we are going this no more snow mobiling snowmobiling snow mobiling that's such a hard word to say say it really fast snowmobiling snowmobiling snow mobiling but vilely appealing anyways so we are meeting them at noon it's currently ten twenty three so huh okay just kidding 12:30 so you have two hours to get there it takes about an hour so we're just going to see what we find along the way this is what we're so this is usually how we find our locations to shoot we're driving we see something amazing we pull over and we hike cool [Music] she's already up there you can't wake up here just just you wait sorry for my heavy breathing I haven't worked out and about home loss treatments so not in the best of shape but look at this look at that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] great giant suits [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it is so windy and so icy out we actually just ice caves across the parking lot luckily I caught a car so John [Music] [Music] go straight on tight fell straight onto my hip oh right when I turn off the filming of the video no saying oh you did a great job ice tree is no joke we had a competition going who was gonna fall first and I said Thomas I didn't even see that I was going to fall what did I even fall I mean obviously [Music] right [Music] [Music] what to do when you type a phrase the way you ask person shape and you take whatever they give you especially when the next store is 87th Belongers away basically saran wrap [Music] it [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] at 7:45 this yesterday morning we left our last hotel in the south of Iceland and today at 3:20 a.m. we just got into our room in the north of Iceland so we actually drove half a circle around Iceland and by we I mean I did it the entire time just stay awake some of the time wasn't our original plan we need we're going to stay about halfway on the route but we thought we would power through there was snow wind blizzard brain road closures some which we were forced to follow one of which we ignored we went over a mountain pass that said it was impassable but we did it we did it barely um and now it's time for bed [Music] we are on day five of our road trip through Iceland and we are heading to deflower farms which is north so last night we drove about the hours well totally assuming ten folders yesterday we drove about 10 or 12 hours or super north now probably the north is part of Iceland just about and it is beautiful and super snowy and dirt red I'll show you [Music] [Music] [Music] we are heading to the hot tub now and not wearing the robes red do it for some warm while you watch the snow fall outside we are getting ready to go out sledding it's snowing yeah just keeps going it is so beautiful tomorrow we are going dog sledding today we're going humans letting like I wanna slide on you yeah had a right look at this coat we could probably go yeah this code would be slick enough you just like write down or you can just die down [Music] let's do this so as easy as a work time [Music] this slides finally came so we don't have to keep writing the shovel it is so fun you just do this for hours and it's actually an uphill so you can't go build on it the elves would get a variable but we can slippers like that invisible people but you can set all right about to go where only a few men have is before if I want to go first look at that hill I can't hold a we're ready ready I'm gonna go a little for home ago first three you go on four three two oh my god I think I broke it yeah that was a terrible idea clean it off so we finally have real sleds Julie's about to do epic slide [Music] [Music] just a the most fun thing you've done this entire trip so fine wonderful you just spend the whole day out yeah thank God you got everyone that shovel is not cutting it good morning today is our good morning at 2 o'clock okay good afternoon it is our last full day in Iceland and we are heading out dog sledding so really excited should be fun um today's a beautiful day we have some sunshine so some blue skies a little bit this is our guide right up there just like the sweetest guy ever very much everybody's been really nice [Music] No Oh [Music] we are getting ready to take off the dogs are locked and loaded [Music] you good you're really good last night we're staying at Hotel 101 Hotel 101 we're heading out for dinner right now we are heading to a place called the laundromat cafe couple people recommended it on and we checked it out money looks pretty good apparently it was it is I'm not sure if it still is but it started because it was a laundromat and they want to lose yeah they wanted to create a place where people could do their laundry and have some good food so comments you should have brought you dirty of the work I'm wearing it the end of the trip do I bring enough he doesn't I just bought that inside out oftentimes I'll find his on door is hey hanging up this ice Tina my boy hanging was in the bathroom of our hotel room because he'll have washed beverage the sink there was one hotel that we stayed at that was super fancy in Italy know those friends know know where they we came back to the room and there was something on the bed it was like a package it looks like a present with something wrapped and tissue paper with a little sticker that was like ooh they left me a present and I opened it up and it was it was once his underwear then that they had washed they they took his dirty clothes from the bathroom floor and washed them and then wrapped them up in tissue paper and left it on the bed but it's how they washed it because it smelled amazing so yeah that was probably the fanciest moment we've had traveling [Music] we are actually if the driver taking us out to try and find the Northern Lights tonight it's a clear night so they're supposed to come out fingers crossed so you have to get far further away from yet we have to get further away from the city we don't have our rental car anymore on so fingers crossed because last night here so we have one shot and it's the first clear night we've had so
