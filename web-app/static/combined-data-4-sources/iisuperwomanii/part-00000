@ all your heartbroken friends!. Yesterday  I marched with thousands of people for equality. AND I AM PROUD AND HONOURED! #WomensMarchLA. No matter what you’ve previously read  or what incorrect information you’ve heard  the fact is that if you believe in EQUALITY then you are a FEMINIST. And “FEMINIST” isn’t a bad word. Feminism does NOT equal anti-man or encourage man-hating. Feminism is the fight for political  economical and social equality of the sexes. So if you believe that all women should be in control of their bodies the way men are  women should be paid for the same work as men and have equal rights and opportunities as men  you’re a feminist. And you should be proud of that. I was definitely proud marching alongside my brothers and sisters at #WomensMarch today. And thank you @emmawatson for one of my favourites quotes. ❤️💪🏽 #WomensMarchLA #GirlLove. Something must have been in the water in The Lilly Pad because the whole team acting RATCHET AF out here 😂. ‪Every. Single. Day. 😂😂😂 When you gotta hit a yoga pose with your charger for it to work.

Check out my parents reacting to #MotorSport by Migos  Cardi B and Nicki Minaj!

Also  note to self: buy more Advil. 😂. I REFUSE TO LET GO OF CHRISTMAS! FA LA LA LA LA!. I live a privileged life and I know that even my worst problems are ones other people pray for. I have access to healthcare  food  clean water and education. This isn’t the case for millions of people around the world. Malala Yousafzai is a 20 year old activist who uses her voice to advocate for women’s education. In addition to her voice  she literally almost gave her life for the cause. At the age of 15 she was targeted by the Taliban and shot on a school bus while amongst her friends. I can’t even imagine a scenario like that. I think about how I would react  how I would feel and how terrified I would be of life afterwards. But Malala recovered and continued to be even more vocal about women’s rights around the world. She is truly a force. Fear  a bullet and a group of people who feel threatened by educated women could not stop Malala. She went on to win a Noble Peace Prize  start her own organization called the @malalafund and publish a book. Knowing that women like Malala exist in the world is both reassuring and humbling. I always remind myself that true advocacy lies in the inconveniences  fears and discomforts. It’s about standing up for what you believe in  regardless of what you’re up against. Thank you for your bravery Malala. You are magical. For these and many more reasons  you are my #WCW. I am honoured to walk the planet with you. #GirlLove @spreadgirllove.

- Hey Lilly can I bug you? - Just give me a sec. - What are you doing? - There's a hole in my
shirt so I'm just fixing it. There, problem solved. - Yeah... Um, can I borrow you outside real quick? - Is it urgent? I was just in the middle
of stalking my ex. - Not urgent but there's
a sale at Target-- - Huh, I'll drive. - [Friend] That's what I thought. - Sale! Remind me not to buy those
small bottles of lotion because I still have so many
left over from that time we stayed at the Sheraton. What's this? - Lilly, have a seat. - Okay. What's going on guys? I thought we were going to Target. - We're having an intervention. - I drank that hand sanitizer by accident. - What, no. - And also I was googling
prom pics but I made a type. So that's why when you walked
in there was porn pics. - Lilly we're having this
intervention because you're cheap. - What? I'm not cheap. - As your teammates and your
friends we feel differently. Derek, would you like to start? (clears throat) - Um, this year you had
my name for Secret Santa and all I wanted was a new phone case. - Yeah, and I got you one. - You got me this. - Okay, that is a zip and
lock freezer bag, by the way, so if anything I splurged. - The other day it took me an
hour to make you a milkshake. (quirky music) - I have to eat my cereal
two cheerios at a time. I mean, a regular size milk
carton is all we're asking for. - Really? What's next huh? We're gonna start buying
bottles of ketchup even though we have the packets from Mcdonalds? - Okay, the other day Lilly
took me to Costco for lunch. - Wait, what's wrong with
buying lunch at Costco? I actually like their food. - She didn't buy it. - Mm, yup, which one was that again? - For the third time, sweet chili. - Sweet chili, we'll try one of those. Grab one, grab one, come on, don't be shy. - [Both] Mm. - Oh yeah. - Let's get going. - What about that one? - They're all sweet chili. - They're all sweet chili. Are you sure because I feel
like they're different. - [Both] Mm, mm hmm. - Now I see, all sweet chili. - Are you guys gonna
buy something or what? - I haven't decided if I like it yet. Maybe one more. Here you go.
- Okay. - Just to make sure.
- We're really doing this. - Why not? - Why are you carrying that? - It's free food. I'm not trying to be wasteful. - Last week I had a cold and
the Starbucks napkins were really rough on my nose. Can't we just get regular tissues? - I'm sorry your nose is a Kardashian. Gosh, this guy. - Last year when I was
booking your world tour, do you remember what you
said about your flights? - Yeah, I said we should book
one flight from LA to India with a whole bunch of stopovers in different countries but that's smart. - One time you tried to bargain with a vending machine at the mall. - How do you know if you don't try Paul? - What about that time we went clubbing? And you made us all go so early. - But it was ladies free before 11:00. - Yeah, but you made us go with you. (club music) (giggles) - But did you pay? - Guys were hitting on me. - Why didn't you just take the wig off? You first interviewed me
you asked me if I wanted a sparkling or still water, remember that? - Yeah I do. Exactly, it's like a fancy
restaurant in here, options. - Right, I said I wanted
sparkling and you gave me tap water with glitter in it. - But did it sparkle? - My poo looked like a
Christmas ornament for weeks. - That sounds fantastic, you're welcome. - Listen Lilly, all we're
saying is that maybe if you weren't so economically cautious, things would change. Like maybe you wouldn't be single. - Excuse me? Okay, I treated my ex
like a king, by the way. Do you know how many times
I made him classy dinners? (quirky music) Happy anniversary babe. Oh, my mistake. There. Listen guys, I appreciate
the concern but I'm fine. Trust me, so can we please
just get back to work? - Fine.
- Sure. - Thank you. - The Wi-Fi isn't working. - Can you call the neighbors please? - Yeah, to ask them if theirs is working? - No, ask them for the
new password, obviously. Oh so you pay for Wi-Fi now? Me cheap are you kidding me? Make sure you click my ads,
I want that money though. Just in case. Make sure you subscribe
because I make videos every Monday and Thursday. In fact, here's a sneak
peak of my next one. How to fix any bad day ever. One love super woman
that is a rap and zoop. What the eff? 
- Ladies, I'm about to
spill all of our tea. What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. And this is why I'm
gonna be single forever. Listen, I'm not one of
those delusional people that's all like, oh I'm single
because the world is unfair and guys are jerks, what no, no. Okay, I am single because
I'm a hot effing mess, and I expect people to read my mind. For example, I know what
I want in a relationship. But then sometimes I also randomly want the opposite of that,
do you know what I mean, and I just need someone to
figure out the algorithm. For example, if I'm venting,
I know what I need in return. Jessica is so annoying. And she thinks that I'm stubborn, me. That's insane, she's an insane person, I'm the most like unstubborn person ever. - Unstubborn? I think you mean not
stubborn or something, I dunno, it just doesn't sound right. - No, unstubborn. It's a word, I just used it in a sentence. - I don't think that makes it a real word. - Oh my God, unstubborn,
it's a word, it is. - Look, maybe Jessica has a point, though. - You are literally never on my side, I can never rely on you, argh! - Oh my God. - But then, this is also me. Jessica is insane. I agree, she's completely wrong, and she's acting like an idiot. - Okay well she's not an idiot. - Yeah but she's wrong. I'm on your side. - Okay you're not just
supposed to agree with me. You're supposed to show me
a different point of view so I can grow as a person. Ugh, whatever. All I'm asking is for you to agree with me and challenge me at the same time. Is that so much to ask? Here's another example, right,
when I'm in the mood, tss. This is all I want. Okay honestly why can't you
ever just make the first move. - What? - Yeah, I'm sitting here,
I'm clearly in the mood, like, pull my hair or something. - You want my first move
to be pulling your hair? - Okay, not like ripping it out, don't turn me into Mr Clean,
but give it a tug or something. - Okay. - Never mind. But then on a different
day, this is also me. (jazzy music) - Hey. You look so sexy right now. - Really? Because I'm clearly
watching a movie right now, and now I just missed what that guy said and we have to rewind it. C'mon. - Yeah, I'm sorry, sorry. - Is sex all you think about? It's also really important
to me to date someone who's confident enough to be himself, and make his own decisions. I don't want to feel like a babysitter. - How do I look? I want your parents to
be impressed, you know? And what should we talk about? - Babe, just be yourself, okay, I need you to be confident. Like I'm not your mother,
I cannot hold your hand and walk you through everything, you need to do this on your own. - Okay. - But then, this is also me. - Alright, ready to go. - Wait, are you really
gonna wear that shirt? - Yeah, what's wrong with it? - I feel like it just
screams, I don't care. - I do care, and I'll prove it
with insightful conversation. - Okay on that note, we need
to go over some talking points. Okay, number one, don't tell
any jokes, you're not funny. - Okay. - And when it comes to commitment, I obviously want someone who's serious and not gonna eff around. Question. Where do you see this relationship going? - Oh, we've only been dating each other for like, what, two months? We're still getting to
know each other, right? - Wow. Okay. - I mean- - Okay. But then like a random
Tuesday after half a cosmo, this is also me. - Hey, so, we've been
dating for two years now. I was thinking maybe we could talk about what our future looks like together. - Woah, future? Woah, that's moving a
little too fast for me. - Okay, um. - Could you pass me some water? - Um, yeah, sure. - Thank you so much. Actually could you leave? - Just. - Yeah, could you just leave? I'm super stressed right
now, you, really stressed, thank you so much, thanks. Can you lock the door? And literally the worst thing in the world is when a guy gets jealous, mm-mm, that ish is so unattractive. - Hey, uh, did you
comment on Joey's picture and call him sexy? - Yeah. Oh it was such a good picture. - See you can't comment things like that on other guys' photos when
you're together with me. Plus, I'm way sexier, right? - What, now I can't talk to other guys? Let me live, Anthony, I'm suffocating. But then, when I'm feeling petty as eff, this is also me. I had such a good time at that party. Joey is great, we had such a
long conversation together. - He's such a great a great guy, I agree. - Really nice. - I know. - Would it kill you to
care so much about me where you would get jealous sometimes? Just sometimes. - You want me to get jealous? - Yeah, sometimes it's nice. Nick Jonas gets jealous
and he's a superstar, so I really don't think you're above it. - Okay but I don't feel threatened, so. - Are you saying I'm not desirable? - What are you, what are you doing in there? - So yeah, I'm totally
aware of the contradictions I expect in a relationship. But, when it comes to you, I know exactly what I want
from our relationship, and that is if you liked this video or any of my other videos, subscribe. Because that ish matters, so
go ahead and click that button. And, don't forget to hit the bell so you can be notified every
time I upload a new video. Let me know when you're done. - I did it babe! I clicked the bell. - Okay, why do you always
have to rub it in my face when you do things like you
want some sort of credit? Why can't you just silently support me? - You know what, you're crazy. - Do not talk to me like that,
that is very unattractive. - You're a lunatic. I'm done. - I am so turned on right now. Yo, did you like that video? Ladies, if you can relate, give this video a thumbs up though so I know I'm not alone. Last video over there, bloopers
for this video over there, show Anthony's channel some love, the link is in the description, and make sure you subscribe to me. Because I make new videos

(unicorn gallops and neighs) (logo whooshes) (upbeat piano tune) - My client, Kristen Brown
would like to formally request the termination of this best friendship. - As does mine. Let's negotiate the terms. (clearing throat) - My client requests that
if either party should need a phone conversation,
she must first text the other party to see
if it's a good time. No more randomly calling
to see "what's up?". - Who calls people anymore? - What are the terms for
"needing" a phone conversation? - Death in the family,
death in Game of Thrones. - Actually, I think that's more of a text message condolence. - Okay, Striking Game of Thrones. - No, death in the family. I mean, what are you supposed to even say? But, if Jon Snow dies I
will be Face Timing you. write that down. - Jon Snow dies, she will be Face Timing. (hits table twice) - What about birthdays?
How will those be handled? - Both parties must still wish each other an annual happy birthday. Via text. (whispering) - Let's keep it brief, three sentences max and one of those needs to be super cliche. Something like, "Hope
you have a good one." Or "Wishing you many more." - Three emojis. No less, no more. - Let's be clear, the upside-down
smiley is not a positive emoji. My client will not have any of that passive-aggressiveness. - Agreed. (sighs) - Ah, my clients mom is no longer going to assume your clients
attendance for family dinners. - What? No. But, Auntie makes the best barbecue chicken and
Kristen's a vegetarian. She can't even appreciate it. - Aw, so sad, best barbecue chicken. Which brings me to item number 12. Per this agreement,
each client relinquishes the right to call the other
clients mom, "Auntie". (clears throat) (sips on water loudly) - My client will remain close friends with Ted, Kev and Kim, while
your client will have friendship custody over
Brian, Tina and Joseph. - Sorry, that's not going to work. I've been dating Kevin for 2 years. You can't have Kev! - Tina has a pool. - Alright, whatever. It
wasn't gonna work out anyway. - Let's discuss public
interactions, shall we? My client would like to
maintain a hug, upon greeting. As to not make third-parties
in the room feel awkward. I'm sure you understand. - Define Hug. - One arm. Minimal eye contact. - And no more jokingly
grabbing each others butts. - Wait, no. she does squats, it's so firm. - you can't be friends with benefits, you can just let that one go. - Alright, what about sub-tweets and Instagram's directed at me? - You do not have to answer that. - We need assurance that
your client will not slander the name and likeness
of my innocent client. - There is no proof that my client has committed any such act. - "Best friends has 11 letters", "so does backstabber". - That could be anyone. - And she tagged me. - Fine! One sub-tweet per week, for the first three weeks. - What? No! - She has 40 followers. Pick your battles. - Do we have an agreement? - We do. Now to make it official we'll exit. While listening to the Friends theme song. In reverse. ("I'll Be There For You" plays in reverse) - So I'll see you at class tomorrow? - Yep. (shimmer sound) - Yo! Did you like that
video? How relatable, hashtag relatable. Give it
a thumbs up if you liked it. My last video is right over there. Second vlog channel right over there. New merch lillysingh.com get it done. And make sure you subscribe because I make new videos every
Monday and Thursday. One love Superwoman. That is a wrap. And zoop! (slurps water noisily)

it's winter anniversary didn't know that yesterday all right before we start this livestream I asked both them to answer some questions and I'm gonna ask first to you Lauren okay so these are questions Alex and okay so here's the thing with Alexander's questionnaire what's the dumbest answer down it's not actually the real answer so you should be able to for how you that determine it yeah cause you're gonna determine if alex is right about himself yeah this is how relationships work okay no it's the future boyfriend of mine take notes okay so I asked Alex what is your favorite video that Lauren has made what do you think Alex's favorite videos of yours of mine we calm down just one bite there's a play okay snap question okay according to Alex what is his favorite cereal do another one this where you don't put something stupid down that's two materials okay I'm gonna say either Cinnamon Toast Crunch that was almost it keeps my house almost there's a really good cinnamon toast crunch aunty crunch possibly no cocoa pebbles okay if alex is it a bad mood what's one thing that'll cheer him up fart that's true although that's plausible that's incorrect that's a good answer to explain before why would a fart because you've got the humor a four-year-old and last I'll give you five he farted both anyone far she's important she doesn't she just litters yes okay yeah it's basketball oh yeah I guess yeah yeah okay athlete prophet what is his favorite kid this is why you never say this is a stupid so what is your favorite Oh getting tempted you're so so honest what is your favorite junk oh they get this one okay no I'm gonna I'm gonna give you a whole array okay so he likes the the chewy Jolly Ranchers so this is why I said your abs are stupid this is chewy John you interprets the green and red ones that we always get or those stupid Sunkist fruit slices that no one like well this is all correct [Music] [Laughter] going to Alex how many X's has he had before he knows Alex ahead you put like all of them down or like only girlfriends girls and boy cousins you talk about girls okay so actual real yeah yeah like I love the sensation of one okay once it lasted probably at least like six months okay so before you have any exes if you're from our generation I feel like you definitely did okay I'm between two numbers I think it's for its for news by the way can we get it zoom in on these nails real quickly and now my nails and this is why nothing on them no this is why Laurens a better human than I am these are like you I actually really want them we'll talk about this later okay what okay according to Alex what annoys him the most about you probably how like how scheduled I am that's not Merritt mm-hmm how anxious I am this is this is a very specific how anxious I am no no I'll give you one more animal nope Oh Malan though yeah she makes high-pitched stress noises oh my god like yesterday can you give us an example yeah it's not even something it's just like she forgot to tweet something or something small and she I can vouch this once I thought Lauren get stressed out because I quote on her Instagram no two pictures that were not even next to each other they were just touching on the grid so like from last week and today the corners of them each had blue yeah so the Blues were touching okay we got two more what do you okay so according to Alex what do you two argue about the most how much he sleeps what about I think overall forever is hilarious Oh cities stuffed animals what the f can you explain why they tell you ru is always so your biggest thing you argue buzz you want him to love your stuff animals aren't that hard yeah they're really maybe they're not that's the biggest problem you'll know yeah all right that's our biggest problem last one okay what's the biggest injury alex has ever had oh that is correct Thank You each other high-fives that's pretty good that's pretty good good oh yeah Alex Missy hello you know Lauren won't give you about the flop that acting was so good Rose like you got one two three four five five right by eight Oh what that's a lot are you sure family are you dumb taking my word no you got my side yeah got candy got four X's you got stuffed animals okay okay I know we're good okay now here we go robo versal can we get a close-up of this look right here with these bomb and ashes that are accentuating the look she's giving [Music] pre-emptive I'm sorry I gotta say I definitely feel like the third wheel okay anyone else that was like a preventative measure ready oh great strategy that's a great note yeah so it's mad kiss from yeah yeah stop so it's so cute when you're done anything solve problems it's adorable okay here we go according to according to Lauren Alex what is Lauren's biggest fear worms I'm sorry if you don't know you're on a carbs diet or something just get it on and never get it okay that was good that's correct I'm gonna give you a check right okay according to Lawrence what is her favorite thing about you my big heart your big do whatever you can say whatever you want if it's disgusting and nasty oh it's your humor and that's bonus points because humorous about the Canadian way okay next according to Lord what is her least favorite thing about you I think even I know what that is correct according to Lauren alex farts like an abnormal amount of time oh there sure like almost everyone in this room can vouch for this how about that Alex parts in a day oh all the way here you thank you for today probably like 15 to 20 ok seconds walking down the hall where are the days like you just so mature moving on voice is correct according to Lauren you piece-of-trash this answer is so trashed what is the last thing you argued about I want to see what you say matches this and we haven't organized in a while I don't know this is why we get Horry missing I don't remember what we worried about in that happens again if I think it's fine it says honestly can't remember oh good what kind of trash I just want to say that this is nothing like the relationships I grew up with in my home unrealistic situate kids don't go home and think this is how mommy and daddy are supposed to be these are supposed to be broken on the floor how it's supposed to be okay next question what's the one thing Lauren wishes you can change about herself which is you can change about yourself yeah this physically it just that's the question but whichever route you want to take it yeah I'm so stressed you like your big ears oh I'm sorry there's a stress for it's a stress for [Music] Lauren which is you could change by herself you should tweet be like what ten minutes in one of our five four three two we're all going but since we started dating she has already gotten more outgoing more outgoing is not correct it is her anxieties laughing okay [Laughter] question if Lord were stranded on an island what are three things she would want with her stuff tease her so you were one of the things she would bring moose and this is the last what are you ready memory foam memory foam bed okay right now if you get the next two right you'll be tied but if you get one more wrong okay next question I feel like this is easy according to Laura what does the app she uses the most on her phone that's correct oh yes last questions hopeful with that was another hint did you tell the answer hum oh there's plenty of the donuts I don't know that okay good the same fourth wheel is third-wheeling okay last question I was referring to the the rape of donuts Instagram just please excuse that humble enters the frame to take a doughnut everybody okay last question you need to get this right oh you need to get this right or Lauren beats you okay no pressure everyone pull your noise do we go to sudden death plug your nose just in case okay last question according to Lauren what was her first youtube video 3 2 1 it is no heat girls and Lauren who officially won you know and he knows you go ahead and take a bite of your daughter but that's okay because you guys are both pretty well yeah that's pretty impressive I'm pretty good speaking of

mostly my folks but that goes to you again lord I have discovered that I had no friends and I need to be here more and spend more time with my friends we're gonna take some questions with the audience because they have some questions for you obviously you guys asked questions do I continue to ask questions Lily live is where you can go to do that and then to move because the questions Claudia asks

I'm sure every so funny everyone knows your birthday anyways moving on we got questions from the audience I know everyone wants to know this answer okay it's very annoying for me let's imagine all men on this planet are dead except for three Claudia wants to know who would you prefer as a boyfriend for Lily oh great question okay Yussef Susie or Dietrich Thanks wow that was a unanimous d-trix explain why they wanted him Susie is a player doesn't mean to go blaze need your badge ladies Susie I guess I just think that you guys are just too fools mm-hmm butting heads to be credit you some and I are great friends but yes we just never work and why dumb because so what you're trying to say is I need a boyfriend s compatible with everybody so which I think I talked about he's a good listener that no boys have so it's like it's like he rises up three things on your bucket list to do with each other that Germany had done Oh [Music] it sounds of interest because we've done everything okay what have you done that was the cool world okay so no like just going to the mall or Bora Bora mm ye visited Paris for her birthday so don't let this be an example that YouTube like taking on that Adsense time and I get hella brand news and that's what this is don't let this be okay normal people go to the mall go to movies use coupon you were in the movies together okay Sami asks how would you convince them this is another question that I got are annoys me Sami asks how would you if you all had 20 seconds right not to convince me to be in a relationship how would you convince me to be in a relationship right now right now yeah I like life is happy ready to share with someone who is also positive okay I like the last part what were you I would just squish our faces together like video and then happy in that one to be like this so many of your oils are just going into each other's pores right that's it all right I'm not convinced the oil dialer yep so any pimples that which is really negatively affected we have a barrier we have a barrier of makeup you got foundation on today I do but that okay okay my face it's absorbs it so how would I cubes orbit you have great skin though actually both have great Stacey so mad he's never bought he's laughing to watch his face was like mixed 13 boys don't watch their faces I feel he's so mad that's with a face watch except for Kyle the natural defense if I wash my face and take that off and then I get the breakout don't watch my fur it makes no sense yeah next question somebody asks have you ever seen a Bollywood movie the

put your trust in them to bring you the right straw and they dough so I am is on my own boats dross I have my house for when that happens happens you'd be surprised Alex another Asian I know and discount broken up ready categories cute girl that's not Lauren three two one all the right things to me right now all right you guys got two and a half points okay we started off strong two and a half points what kind of the right now ten twelve minutes left okay so I'm gonna ask y'all some we go you can't let go if you would like to let go you can let go can you let go Oh fantastic if we have any more questions in the audience Kyle let us know I have one more thing I want to do for you but I wasn't waiting for the last couple minutes because it's really exciting for me personally okay um what else the questions gonna ask you okay I know I know I don't know half because it's a question that I got on Twitter I don't know a so but how do you guys decide because your relationship is public how you decide what to make public and what not to a public Oh guys having a rule or do you guys have a fight about this or with tennis because it's been a learning curve I feel like I really beginning we had to like like literally be like yes this no this yes this no this and now it just kind of comes more naturally I feel yeah at first I was logging before we start dating so I was like I put everything everything goes he would just start vlogging we started dating yeah but I put everything in it like every time I walk everything goes in no matter what and then she would tell me I couldn't put stuff in and then I but then eventually I learned and understood but it was just like you kill me when people tell me I can't vlog on like that even when I like go to like somewhere there's no live I know it's just me I can't blow you don't even know you don't even know okay yeah yeah you have to understand the concept of like having things that are private and through yourselves and stuff that's not shared because I mean like realistically your relationship gets cut down to like what ten minutes of a blog okay so it's like why I put all the most intimate moments into those 10 minutes that's actually something I mean we're talking was before and I was bringing up but something we're talking with you sister but I was tell you I've had some Possible's an audience for an entire relationship read the context yeah when they see this much of it and when you give someone this much of something they'll just judge based on those yeah I would not assume they know everything because of that yes yeah all right next question what's the best gift Lord has ever gotten you and I would ask him the same question as well oh man I know what the best thing she's ever gotten you is according to me but my answer will be separated happiness a little bit absolute trash no no what's a good gift he can't even I can't remember hold on let me list them off for you yes please my basketball drinks that have wasabi on the back oh yeah yeah that was good oh you mean a lot I got you my birthday yeah I remember anything flooring got to you first last year burns birthday for his choices birthday I got him 27 presents now I get it we're talking that your audience doesn't skip their ads and they get that you too but no it won't be an example we have nobody thinks it was like polka but pokeball bath bombs oh yeah she's gonna be getting involved actual Dragon Balls you can make wishes on them you probably don't understand what I'm talking about they understand they got me face just an absolute lack of fool she's thinking [Laughter] [Applause] okay what's you think would be my favorite I think it favorite would be the drink balls eyeballs daven worked yet but I got my favorite gift that Lord is ever gone you was when you were away she completely redecorated your oh yeah Alex why don't we Lauren literally because Alex's room was like absolute trash and so Lauren and

(horse neighing and galloping) Today's fitting was so great. Yeah. Also, I can't wait
to take my Spanx off. Before I change could
you take a picture of me? What should I be doing? Can I get you a Starbucks cup? Nah, that's too orchestrated. Planning to read a book? I don't feel like I'd be reading
in this outfit, you know. What if, like, I'm just
stepping out of my car? Yeah, but we'd have to
move it into the sun. (light, playful music) The sun is this way, so
I would park that way. That good? A little more. Good? A little more. Good? A little more. Too much! Stop! Someone go move those garbage cans! Is this good? Take a few, okay? (sighs) (picture snaps) Tell me when to switch, okay? Hold on. (picture snap) I didn't say switch! I know, but I was posing
for a really long time. I felt awkward. Stop moving! (picture snap) ... takes forever to focus Wait, bend that right
leg. It looks kinda weird. (light, playful music) It's not focusing! Touch my face. You're supposed to touch her face. Yeah, I know how a phone
works, and it's not working right now, hold on. Why are you so close? Back up. Are you telling me to move closer? Back off. I feel like her face needs more light. Now, well, it's either she's
well lit or the background's well lit. I can't do both. Down. Down. A little more. A little less. Stop there. (picture snap) You look too much like you're posing. Should I look away? Look more natural, but
keep your back straight. Yeah, like, don't
slouch, but look relaxed. How's this? You're a little shiny. Oh my god, thank you so much. I love you. - [Makeup Artist] This is
important and you're doing great. How's my hair? Stop moving and talking! Hold on. Make sure you get full
body and close-up, okay? You can crop it. It's not the same. I feel like you should show
a little more cleavage. Really? Is that okay? (picture snap) A little too much, might get flagged. How about now? (picture snap) Yeah, that's good. You should take some
with your glasses off. (fast-paced music) (picture snap) No, but now I can see
myself in the reflection. Okay we can Photoshop it. You can tag me. Okay, I think we have a lot of options. Lemme see. That one's nice. Oh, that one's really good, right? Did we get it? One more. (picture snaps) (bassy music) You know, this first one's
pretty decent, actually. Wait. No, wait. Yeah, okay, let me just
balance the colors. Smooth my skin. Okay. Posted. (light, upbeat music) She's so effortless. Yo, yo, wait, before you go
anywhere, make sure to give this video a big thumbs up. Check out my last video over there. It's about when people
have a crush on you. My second vlog channel's right there. Make sure you comment
below right now because super-sixty is starting,
which means I'm responding. And subscribe because I
bring you videos every Monday and Thursday. One love Superwoman. That is a wrap, and ZOOP! 
- Stop, wait, no, it's not an old video, it's a new video, I'm just in my old room. (sparkling) What up everyone, it's
your girl Super Woman. And right off the bat, you
might as well just send this video to all your
girlfriends 'cause I'm about to tell you your life story. Today, I'm taking you to
an alternate dimension. A woman's public washroom. More specifically, a woman's
public washroom in a club, featuring drunk girls, cue intro. (pop music) (retching) Pervert. Now boys, you might be
sitting there wondering what the eff could
possibly happen differently in a woman's public
washroom and the answer is everything. Social protocol is different, communication is different. Science is different,
the way we compare our penises is different. Wait what? My bad. Science is the same. (maniac laughter) All of the following things happen in a woman's public washroom
every single time 100% getting deep. First of all, you know
when first day of school you're like, too shy to go up to anyone and say hi and like,
make new friends, yeah. The woman's public washroom is like the exact opposite of that. 90% of communication that
happens is compliments to complete strangers. - God, those shoes, look gorgeous. - Your hair is so amazing. - Can I just say, you're so beautiful? Isn't she so pretty? - Your body is bangin'. - Oh my god. - You're so pretty. - And nothing is off limits when it comes to the washroom. So count on girls to get super specific and personal. Straight up based on a true story. Girls just come, let's just be real. Drunk girls, they all lesbians. Don't, it's true. - Oh my god, your boobs. Your boobs. Look at her boobs. - Oh my god. Can I touch them? - Yes. - Please. Wow. - Oh my god. Your butt is such a good butt. - My god, I'm so jealous. Wait, the shape of your
face is like, perfect. - Guys, I have a Spongebob face. - [Everyone] No! - Do not sit here and tell me that you and your drunk girlfriends have not touched each other's boobs. You lyin'! The nicest thing a
drunk girl has ever said to me in a washroom, and I quote, Oh my god, oh my god Lily, your eyelids are the perfect size. And you know what? She was right, that's right, subscribe for these eyelids. (maniac laughter) The world would be a
significantly better place if everyone treated each
other like drunk girls treat each other in a women's washroom. Because this is where
true friendship lives. - I'm so lucky to have you in my life. - You're gonna make me cry. - No, no. Shh. I love you. - I love you. - You're like my best friend. - I'm always gonna be here for you. (sobs) - [Woman] Yo, we gotta go. (sniffles) - Listen, it was so nice meeting you. - Same. You know what, I'll see you soon, man. Okay?
- Okay. - I'll see you again. Come back soon. I'll be here. - Shout out to all the
best friends I've made in washrooms over the years. I may not have known your name, okay, but you're my sister. You know, when it comes to the washroom there are no social boundaries, okay? Everyone in the washroom
could participate. And the capacity of a
woman's washroom, infinite. You could fit 100 drunk girls
into anything, straight up. So everything that goes
down is a group activity. - Hurry up, I love this song. - Hey. You look alive. (screaming) - Hey, the moon walk. Get there. (cheering) - That's cute, you thought the party was outside the washroom? Nah, the party is inside
the women's washroom. 'Cause this shit just lit there. Yo, except for that one girl, alright. That one girl, that's
always crying on the floor. Straight up, I don't
know how she gets there, but without fail, she's always there. I feel that she just came with the club. (maniac laughter) Here's the thing, all the other girls in the washroom, they don't
really know exactly why this girl is crying, but that's not gonna
stop them from assuming and giving her all the advice. (crying) - Hey, excuse me. (crying) Don't you dare cry for a man, you hear me? - Who's the jerk? Is he outside? Let's go talk to him. He's making this girl cry, my sister. What was your name? - Lily. - Making Lily cry. - She just said Larry, your name's Lily. Okay, look, you're beautiful. He's not worth it,
whoever this guy is not. (wails) - What if her boyfriend's
some hunk, or something? - You're right, he could
totally be worth it. - Cry it out, let it out. - In the napkin. - Oh my god, is Jason Dean here? Oh. Hi. - This is Lily. Lily. - Because that's what
sisterhood is about, okay? It's about being there
for the girl you just met through thick and thin. (crying) Every public washroom
has at least one girl who has stopped babysitting
her drunk friend who has somehow turned into a toddler. And everyone that walks
in knows to pay respects to the babysitter. - Hey, are you okay? I'm right outside the
door, I'm right here. (gags) - I'm okay, don't be mad. - Do you want me to come in? - No, I'm fine. (gags) It's coming out. Don't be mad. - Okay, good girl, let it all out, baby. Yeah, she's fine. Thank you. You good? (crying) - Excuse me, is your friend okay? - She's fine. Thank you, yeah. Hurry up. Do you need help with your zipper? - No. I broke it. - You're wearing my dress. - Does anyone know I'm sick? - No you're good, no one's
in here, you're fine. She's good. - Are you mad at me? - I'm not mad at you. - Honestly, don't you
love when that happens? It's my favorite thing. So funny, when you're standing there like the babysitter, and your
best friend is drunk, and all these other girls walk up to you also drunk, sweet, but drunk. And they're just, okay, what. Let me know if your friend
needs anything, okay? And I'm just like, oh what you gonna do? You can't even stand, okay? You're wearing your phone case as a shoe right now, get it together. Okay, but let me know if
your friend needs any help. Oh, are there boogies in my nose? Nope! Subscribe. Yeah, the women's washroom is such a beautiful and scary place. Scary because of all those
selfies we take while drunk, even though we think we look really hot. - Sexy. Kissy. Hold your hair. Silly. Yeah! Hug! Wait, wait. We look so hot. - Send me that. (screams) - And then you wake up
the next morning like, oh my god! All the ogres. (electro music) What do we do to convince
ourselves in those moments that with our sweaty
hair and smudged makeup we look good. Like I'm just looking at this picture, like girl, there is
Sephora all over your face. Not just like, all of Sephora. Like Sephora here, Sephora,
just Sephora everywhere. And yo, you know what else? You know what I did? I had to record this video twice 'cause the first time was out of focus. so I'm just gonna be petty and desperate and thirsty and say, give it a thumbs up. Okay, great, look at just cool rafeeki. So beautiful, and it helps
send girls to school. GirlLove.com is where you can get one. More information in the description. Do the end card, go. (maniac laugh) (crying) (laughter) (gagging) - I have a Spongebob face. - [Everyone] No! - Maybe you do.

- If your friend sent you this video to watch, there's a reason. (hoofbeats) (whoosh) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman, and since the beginning of
time y'all have been asking me to do the video "Types Of
Guys In Relationships". And every single time, I've ignored you. Why? Because I can't write about
things I don't know about, okay. It's been since forever
since I dated someone. Like honestly, my most recent boyfriend? He bought me an iPod
Shuffle for my birthday. But my friends date people, thus, Types Of Guys Your BFF Dates. So grab your BFF, grab some popcorn, grab a booty 'cause it feels
noice, and get ready to relate. Number one, the Flaming Hot Cheeto. Now this is the guy your BFF dates that is hot as hell, okay. I'm talking mus-cles,
chiseled jaw, boy band charm, but has the IQ of a Cheeto. Beyond good looks, there's
just nothing there. So, Alex, what do you do? - I chill. Do my thing. - Do your thing. And, and what is your thing? - Pfffft. Spend time with Lauren. - (sighs) Does that pay well? - Hmm? - It, it was a joke. - Who's there? No wait, you say knock knock. - You get me water? And here's the most shocking part, right. Usually when you ask this dumb person, "Like yo, what do you do for a living?" You cannot even fathom their response, you're just like hoe, how? I mean your job. Like, what is your job? - Oh, I'm a financial planner. - I'm sorry, what? - Pfffft. Financial means money. I help people decide what
to do with their money. Excuse me, I can't decide what to get, 'cause there's no pictures in this menu. You know what? I'll just have the chicken par mesian. - Parmesan. - Bless you. - Then when you talk
to your girl, just like "Yo girl, what, honestly what
the eff is happening here?" She's gonna respond with some trash like-- - I just love his personality. - "I just love his personality!" Gah, you love his personality when he ain't wearin' a shirt, get real. But you know, I can't even
hate it, I'm just jealous. Girl, live your life. Number two, the potential queen. So you're meeting your best friend's boyfriend for the first time, and something just seems a likkle bit off. So you go through the
following thought process. It's so nice to finally meet you. - Same. Uh, by the way, your hair looks great. - Thank you! Ah, a man who appreciates
the little details. - Hi there, could I get um, a Cosmo? - Same. - See, that's nice. I love when a dude is secure
enough to order a girly drink. So, Alex, what kind of music are you into? - A little bit of everything,
but loving Fifth Harmony. - Oh. That's really openminded. But also what? - And also, Alex loves football. He's obsessed. - Oh, okay. There we go, that's like a
stereotypical dude thing. - Seahawks? Yasss. - Wait... was that yes, or yas? - Yas. - Spell it. - Y... (suspenseful music) A, S. Yas.
- Yas. - Girl, he gay. My friend's just like,
"He's not gay, okay, "he's just sweet and
understanding and sensitive and... "holy crap, he's gay." - Number three, the waste man. Now this is the dude your
best friend dates, that you've probably already heard about
through the grapevine, okay. Or you probably even met him before when he was dating one
of your other friends, or he's even accidentally
hit on you once before. Or he just has that goddamn smile where you wanna knock his teeth out because he's definitely a player. So, how long have you two been dating? - One month, ah, three months.
- Three months. - Mm-hmm. And where did you meet? - My ex's birthday party. Yeah.
- They were having problems. - She had trust issues. - Right. (soft digital clicking sounds) - [Waitstaff] You guys ready to order? - Well hello, Jennifer. What a unique name, is that Irish? - Jennifer is a unique name, really? - Oh, and that smile, wow. - Jennifer Lawrence. Hudson. Aniston. - You have Insta? - Lopez, Jennifer Lopez. No? No? Here's the thing about the player, right, he's also somehow a
hypnotist, because your girl is just blind to everything
that's happening. Like homegirl stared at the eclipse without those special
glasses, now you need to like, spell it out for her in braille. She'll say things like "He's just being social and polite, okay?" Yeah, yeah he's being
polite with his penis, girl. Wake up. Number four, the catch. All the annoying guys your
best friend could date, this one is quite possibly
the most annoying. Why? Because he's wonderful. - And for our anniversary, he planned a surprise trip to Hawaii. It was so romantic. - Hawaii? - (sighs) She's too kind. And enough about us. Tell us about you, Lilly? - I've never been to Hawaii. (phone ringtone) Oh, aw, I'm so sorry, this is so rude. It's Kevin.
- Oh, okay, yeah. - Um, I have to take
this, but I'll be back. Excuse me, excuse me, hey buddy! - Kevin is the child that Alex sponsors. - What?!
- Yeah, he saved his life. - Really?!
- And he just adopted a dog for him! - Heh. - The dog only has three legs,
but Alex believes in him. - Hmm. - He's also really good in bed. - What?! - I said this bread,
it's really good bread. (sighs) He's also really good in bed. - Dammit! Like where did you find this perfect man, and how can I obtain one? No straight up, because, you
know, just those rare moments where you're just like "This guy "is too good for my trash friend", okay. I know that sounds
mean, but let's be real. Some of your friends are trash. I knew this one girl, she was a jerk. She was such a jerk! She used to drive past the speaker and the first window at
a drive through, okay. And then just take whatever
paid for meal was provided. Just like "Oh, thank
you, this is my order." Hoe, that's not your order. And I'm just like, how girls like that get sweet guys like this? You know, hold up, just sec. Hello, Karma? Yeah, where you at? You want me to drop a pin? Number five, the quirk! So this dude seems pretty normal and nice, and you're like "Holy hell, did my girl actually find a decent
human being, like congrats!" But then. So then I said, "It
takes one to know one." (loud, grating laugh) - You, you take one, and
if you don't take it, you don't know it!
(wheezing and cackling) Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, alright. (sighs) Can we have the check? - They have some effin'
weird tendency or quirk that your friend can't see
but is driving you insane. - This was so much fun, we
should definitely do it again. - Mm-hmm! - Yeah, for sure, let
us know your se-zual. - My what? - Your se-zual.
- Your se-sual. - Oh, my schedule. - Yeah, that's what I said, se-zual. - No, that's what I said. - But me too. - You guys are saying the same thing. - How are we saying the same thing? - Sezual. - It's sk-edge-ual - Sezual.
- Skedgeual. - Sezual. Schedule. - That's what I said. - Anyways, you know what
the best kind of guy your friend can date is? The one that has a single hot brother who has low self esteem,
that I can come scoop up. Sign me up, hoe. Speaking of sign up, don't go anywhere! Yo, if you like this video, subscribe! Look, I even gave you a
visual diagram and this bell, that you can hit the bell
(dings) and it'll notify you
when I upload a video, which is twice a week, so that's not that many bells in your life. That's less than school, when you were, that's less bells than school, hey do it. You should do, you should
do it, also hold on. Waitwaitwaitwaitwaitwaitwaitwaitwaitwait! Super Sixties gonna start right now, which means that for

that is a wrap and zoop! 
(neighing) - What up, everyone? It's your girl Superwoman,
and it's story time with Lily! I thought I would tell
you my childhood stories through acting them out. Wait, you know what? This video's pretty long. To be continued, boom! One of the reasons I'm so big on feminism and empowering women,
especially young girls, is because growing up, I had
to hear things like this. - Girls shouldn't whistle. Girls shouldn't dance at weddings. Girls shouldn't talk too much. - So now, I've made it a point
to do all of those things. Why? Because when something is unjust, you don't just repeat the cycle of wrong. No, you make it right. So, ahem. (whistling) I've had a lot of really
good days in my life. You know, meeting The
Rock, meeting Selena Gomez, traveling to some dope countries. But still, one of the best
days of my life remains. You got me an N64? (screaming) (burping) N64 is the best system of all time, closely followed by Super Nintendo. Do not at me on this, do
not debate me on this. I will 007, Mario Party,
Banjo Kazooie your blood clot! On that note, a lot of times, when people hear the way I talk or see the way I dress, they assume I'm trying to
act like somebody else, and that couldn't be more wrong. When I talk the way I talk and dress the way I dress, I am being completely myself, and that is because I was born and raised in a place called Scarborough. My school was filled with black people and South Asian people, which means that everyone knew how to speak Tamil, everyone knew how to
speak Jamaican Patois. It was expected of everyone,
and that's what we knew. Our school dances only played reggae, dance hall, soka, rap, and hip hop. So if I didn't act the way I act and talk the way I talk, then I'd be acting like someone else. Ya dig? You don' know my youth. Snitches get stitches, ya hear me now? Speaking of stitches, I've had a few. In fact, once my head
cracked open on my birthday. It's my birthday, and I
get some birthday cake! (screaming) ♫ Happy birthday to Lily ♫ Happy birthday to you! True story, I was running
up the stairs on my birthday and I think I got distracted
by cake or something and I fell and cracked my head open. My mom fainted in the hospital because they were stitching up my eyelid. You see that, you see that right there? That's why my eyebrows
can never be on fleek. That, and because I never get them done. I've also gotten stitches on my hand. Basically, there was this computer game named Jill of the Jungle, where this girl, she would swing on vines in the jungle. So during recess one day, I was like, yo, we're playing hide and seek, I'm gonna hide in this washroom stall, but I don't want them to see my feet, so I'm gonna swing on the coat hook, just like Jill of the Jungle. Yay! It went through my hand. Ow, help me! Mrs. Parks! (screaming) Yeah, I was just hanging there with my hand through the coat hook. Boom, the receipts! Yeah, I got injured a lot as a kid, but one of the most memorable times was when I got a new bike, and I wouldn't admit that
it was too big for me. So I was riding the bike and I fell into the bar crotch first, and I was like, mm, that really hurt. So I went into the washroom, and: Mom! Now, I know what you're thinking, and no, it wasn't my period, but there
was still blood everywhere. And at that age, I didn't get why my mom was so concerned, and she was outside the
washroom door just like, "Please, God, make sure she
didn't bruck up her uterus. "You know I only had kids
so I could have grandkids." It turned out I just
got a cut in the area. That's right, you see, normally girls only have to experience that
pulling down the underwear and seeing blood once in their life. But me, nope, twice. I had a pet cat named Oreo, and he was my best friend! And then he ran away. Your my bestest friend in
the whole, entire world. No, no! (crying) I was so devastated about it, but his favorite food was Lucky Charms, so obviously, I knew what to do. Now we wait. Spoiler alert, I never found him. It was fine though. It was actually extremely painful and traumatizing, to be honest. In school, I was an overachiever, and to be honest, the teacher's pet. I was even valedictorian in grade eight, and also very naive. And I just know we'll be friends forever, because that's how real life works. (applause) A moment of silence for all the friends we thought we'd have forever. In grade 11, my family
moved from Scarborough and to another town, but I still kept going
to the same high school, but had nowhere to go after school, because I couldn't go home. So, I used to go to my
best friends' house, and they were two Tamil twins. So, basically, I was part
raised by a Tamil family, which is why I'm so
proficient in the language, and I can pelvic thrust
like my life depends on it. (Tamil music) - [Woman] Oi, Lily, come down and eat! - Mummy! (speaking in Tamil) Being an overachiever
wasn't just in school. No, in life in general, it
used to really bother me, and continues to really bother me if I don't do a really
good job at something. Back to that obsessive behavior. So, even my first job at Harvey's, which is a fast food restaurant, even though it was a
crappy job, I was like, no, I will be the best employee ever. (heavy electronic music) Your burger and fries, ma'am. - [Customer] Took you long enough, loser. - Have a great day! As I grew up, I had a bunch of jobs, and they were all kind of crappy. The worst, though, was when I
worked at a collection agency. Lord help me! Hello, I'm calling about
your outstanding payment. - [Man] Shut the (censored) up! You (censored) suck my
(censored), you (censored). - Okay. Hi, hi, yes, I'm following up on that outstanding hydro bill, remember me? - [Man On Phone] I'm a
little busy right now. - Oh, oh my, did you
want me to call you back? I could call you back in like two minute? Or, like, five? I don't mean to be offensive. How long do you think you need? I don't wanna assume. Not to mention the boss
was 100% verbally abusive. - Hey, what the hell are you doing? Are you stupid, are you crazy? You're wasting my money. Are you mental? - Aka, the type of boss that
I will never be in my life. Yo, shut up, I'm trying to
make a video, you stupid! I'm just kidding, there's no one here. I'm all alone! (laughing) And that's my childhood in a nutshell. Of course, except for all
the other dramatic and really heartbreaking stuff that happened. But this is a comedy channel. I'll save that for my
episode with Dr. Phil. Hey, hey, now that you know me, the ins and outs of Lily Singh, the person behind Superwoman, go ahead and click subscribe, because, yo, I'm clearly a well-developed,

card, get out of here! Yo, sorry to cut this video in two, but I did it, and it was

- Yeah, okay. How's this?
- No, it's too dark. I don't want to fall asleep. Okay now there's a glare on the TV. Perfect, let's do this. - That's better. Yes, alright. Okay, let's do it. - I'm ready. So, should we make popcorn? - Oh my God, yes. Yes, I'm so hungry. I can't concentrate
unless I'm eating popcorn. Like, I can't follow the plot. There you go. - Thank you.
- Let's do this. - You know by the way, I

(chimes twinkling) (whooshing) (grunts) - Happy Monday, everyone. - 'Sup. - Happy Monday. - Yeah, you know, thanks. I'm thinking about having
a really relaxing day. You know, super calm. Not thinking too much about anything. - We think you should write your will. - What? My will? Why, why, why? - What if you die? - Why am I suddenly dying? Oh my god, Mom, did you look under my bed and see what's in that shoebox? Because I swear to god it's not mine. Even though it's engraved. You know, I thought it
was a cucumber plush toy. (panting) Yo, is my mom gonna kill me? - Engraved? Really, Lil? No, we were all just talking
about what would happen, you know, if you died. - You know what, you seem
like the brain tumor type. - No. I think car accident. You know, this one time Lilly
tried parallel parking almost cause forest fire. (giggles) - You're a virgin that can't drive. I'm sorry, I'd been waiting
like years to drop that joke but we always Uber it. - Oy, everybody shut up, okay? This is not appropriate conversation. - Thank you. - Lilly definitely going to die
because of loneliness, okay? No husband, no kid, I
give it three years max. - Heart attack. Definitely heart attack. - What? - You eat garbage all day long. - Okay, what is that supposed to mean? - Lilly, do you want
all of your assets to go to the government? - I'm Canadian. I don't mind. I love Justin Trudeau. - Your accounts are American. - Alright everyone. I've created a will. Humble. You get my YouTube channel. But you have to post a video
from one of my fans every Monday and Thursday. But only the innocent ones, okay? Not the ones that send
penis pictures to my friends on Snapchat. - Got it. - Mom. You can have my closet. - Lilly, I don't like
this conversation, okay? You are not bloody dying. (sniffling) I'm sorry. I'll be right back. - Dad, you can have my... (phone chimes) - Oops. Sorry. - Dad, you can have my car. - Yes! Take that other loved ones! I mean, Lilly, Lilly. Don't talk like that, okay? (amusing music) - Sorry, I had to quickly check something. - Ay, yo, hold up, hold up. Who gets the hot tub? (amusing music) - You can all be guardians
of the hot tub, okay? But don't ever let someone
in who spelled my name wrong. Ever. Trust me, I'll know. And I will haunt the eff out of you. - Yeah, yeah. - This is all really sad. Who's gonna get your Skittles? - I'd like to be buried with my Skittles. - You going to be cremated, okay? Not buried. Don't shame our family when you die. - Mm, that's right. You already did enough of
that when you were alive. - Fine. I'll be cremated with my Skittles then. - That will be very nice rainbow. (amusing music) (phone chimes) - Sorry. It's my Snapchat. (gasps) God dammit, Unicorn 1411,
that is so inappropriate. - Jessica. I told you to stop opening those snaps. - It was a mistake! And sometimes I'm curious. - Ay, yo, let's cut to the chase, okay? Who gets your money? - I'll be donating my money
to three separate charities. - Charity? - Charity starts at home. - That's right, okay, you
should donate to my foundation. Poor Mothers With Stupid Daughters. - You know, I always click on
your bloody YouTube ad, okay? You owe me money. That's right, let me calculate. What would be this one. (screams) What the bloody hell this? Okay, that's definitely Photoshop, okay? - Oy, oy, let me see! I mean, no, no. I don't want to see dirty thing. Let me see. - Okay listen, everyone stop. Okay, a portion of my money
is going towards Girl Love to help issues surrounding gender inequality. - My brother gets paid more than me. You should donate to me. - Okay, you're a cashier. He's an engineer. My second charity is cancer research. - Yo, that's perfect! I'm a Cancer. Yo, give me 50% of your money I'll participate. - Dammit, I am Sagittarius. - And my last charity is up
and coming YouTube creators. - What? Okay, look at the comments below, okay. Ain't nobody an up and
coming YouTube creator. - Yeah. Like literally none of the
comments are about that. - And if I die before the age
of 30 any outstanding invoices people owe me, y'all can
divide amongst yourselves. (doorbell rings) I'll get it. - So, yo. Who's gonna kill Lilly? (laughs) Just kidding. (laughs) - I'll cut her brakes, huh? Just kidding! (laughs) - He gone cut her brakes! (laughs) - I'll put a pillow over her face. Just kidding! (laughs) - A pillow! She gone suffocate her, you crazy! She crazy! (laughs) - I'll slip something into her dinner. (clears throat) I'm going to go take shower now. (slams) (twinkling)
(pops) - Hello! Now that we're done talking
about my death, if you like this video give it a big thumbs up. If you want me to be alive and stuff. Yo, I'm going on tour across
the world, if you want tickets LillySinghBook.com/tour
is where you can get 'em. My last video. The bloopers. And yo, make sure you subscribe
'cause I make new videos every Monday and Thursday. One love, Superwoman,
that is a wrap and zoop! 
- Pause, you might as well just go grab your parents right now, so you can watch the video with them, so they can proceed to deny
every single thing I say. Whaddup everyone; it's
your girl, Superwoman. And let me just preference
this entire video by saying, based on a true story. And let's be real clear
right off the bat here, okay? Kids are hella annoying. Like me, for example. So annoying. The most annoying. But here's the thing, right? This is my channel. I can talk about whatever
the eff I want, so yo, here's five annoying things
your parents definitely do. Number one, unnecessary comments. Oooh, can you feel your
blood boiling already? It doesn't matter where
your parents are from, okay. Where they were born,
where they were raised, because all parents speak
one universal language, and that is the language of guilt trips. No matter what I do,
what we're talking about, or how good of a child I've been, my mom simply cannot end a sentence without an unnecessary comment. An unnecessary comment. What? Hey mom, I'll be home late tonight. It's Kevin's memorial. - Hon, that's okay. I know your friend's
more important than me. - Oh. (thumps up steps) I am so tired. I had the longest day ever at work. I'm going straight to bed. - Okay, I know this just
hotel for you anyways. - Okay Dad, my friends are coming over. Please do not get drunk and talk about politics with them, okay? - Fine. (doorbell rings) - Hey, how's it going? - Hello, sorry, Lilly say I'm
not allowed to talk to you. - Why? What's wrong with you? Which petty Olympics are you competing in? - (laughs) You make such funny joke. That's okay. I'm going to die soon, anyways. - Number two, airport life. I think I speak on
behalf of all of humanity when I say if I travel
anywhere with my parents, I am for sure going to reach the airport way too many hours early for my flight. - Oh Lilly, what time
we leaving for airport? - Oh, it's a domestic flight, so an hour and a half should be fine. - Hon, they saying on news, make sure you go three hour early. - Really? Did they say that? On the news? It's fine, Mom; an hour
and a half is fine, 7:00. - Google's saying make
sure you get there early. - Mom, we're not flying to India. Okay, 7:00 p.m. will be fine, trust me. - Okay, we leave 6:30 just in
case we get a red light, okay? - Sure. - Wife, what time we leaving for airport? - Lilly said 4:00. - Not to mention, if my mom tells me we're
leaving the house at 4:00 p.m., at 3:30 p.m., she gonna
slap me for being late. You telling bloody lies. You know evolution, right? Like, how we started as
these little monkey things and we evolved into, like,
I don't know, whatever, like vloggers or whatever the eff, yeah. This is like right here,
this prehistoric animal; this is live footage of how
early I got to the airport with my parents. (laughs) Oh god, it's funny, it's funny. Click subscribe, shut up. Not to mention, this
happens every single time. - Oh Lilly, make sure
you bring ticket, okay? - No Mom, you don't need
to print the tickets. It's on my phone. - What if something happened, huh? - What, what could possibly happen? - You get some sort of virus. - Mom, I haven't printed
a plane ticket since 2010. Okay, we're fine. - Okay. - Here's the thing, though. When your mom says okay, you
have to listen to the tone, because there's okay
and then there's okay. When she says okay, you
think she's just fine and accepting you ain't
gonna print that ticket? Not, that cues the petty Olympics. Because now every single
thing that happens from this point on will
be used against you to prove her point, even if
it's completely irrelevant. - Can I have your passport, please? - You see. This is why we should have print ticket. - Sorry, we don't have
any more aisle seats. - You see. This is what happen when
you don't print ticket. - And it'll be $50 for the bag. - You see. Now we pay $50 penalty for no ticket. - Speaking of which, zoop, number three. Refusing technology. Did I press record? Oh! (gasps) Here's the thing, right? My Dad had to grow up
doing everything himself in what were apparently the
worst possible conditions. I had to walk 80 kilometers
in the snow, okay. No shoe, no road, so very hard, okay. There was no school, even. (laughs) So it makes sense that
he's a little bit stubborn when it comes to receiving help, especially help from machines. A.K.A., my dad refuses to
accept the capabilities of technology. - Okay, I tell you how to get there. - Oh, that's okay, Dad, I can just GPS it. - Why you going to waste the GPS? I tell you. - Waste? Okay Dad, the GPS isn't some
sort of limited resource. - GPS doesn't know, okay? - This piece of Google
software doesn't know how to get to the closest mall, really? I'm pretty sure it does. - No.
- That wasn't a question. - No.
- Dad. - No.
- Stop. - No. - Dad. - No. - [GPS] Navigating to the mall. - It's going to send you wrong way. - But Dad, can you please
just let me do this one thing? - Look, look, it going
to take you wrong way. It's going to take bloody hour now. - Okay, it literally says six minutes. - Oh my god, one hour. - [GPS] Turn left. - Turn left here. - I know. - [GPS] Turn right. - Right here. - [GPS] Turn left. - Left. Oh Lilly, pay attention,
I'm telling you direction. - Every brown father ever
is just like, Google a map? Oh no, okay, 'cause we goin'
turn right at that rock. I know, trust me, that tree
over there, we turn left. We make a U-turn where
that car always parked. (laughs) Number four, cooking obsession. This one might be particular
to brown kids, to be honest, because I don't know what
you white kids stay eating, and I feel like you all just went to town with some Hamburger
Helper, but brown kids, it was a little different, because from childhood to literally now, full-grown adulthood, my mom is just absolutely obsessed with cooking me food. She has an obsession to
insure that I've eaten, and I know what you're thinking. Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, don't complain about that. And I agree, it's sweet, but too much of anything is not good. She will harass me to cook for me. She will uproot my life
to serve me a meal, to the point where it's an inconvenience. I think that's a great idea. Should we go over next steps? Sorry, excuse me one second. - Oh Lilly, what you want to eat? - Mom, I'm on a call right now. Don't worry about it. So sorry, yes, you were saying? (phone buzzes) Oh sorry, one more second. Hello? - [Mom] Hi Lilly, what you
want me to make you for lunch? - Mom, I said I'm doing something. I'll figure it out; don't worry. You don't need to make me anything. I'm so sorry. (laptop beeps) You were saying something
about mission statements? Yeah, I see the email. (phone jangles) So sorry, that all sounds great. I'll make sure I get
those things over to you. Okay, speak soon, cool beans, bye-bye. - So, do you want cool bean with rice? - Oh my god, yes, yes Mom, I'm hungry. Could you please make me a grilled cheese? - Hmmm, okay. I know I'm just slave. - Because in my mom's brain,
there's only two scenarios when it comes to me eating. First, when she cooks for me. I am so happy. And second, when she doesn't. Help. Number five, FaceTime. So, even though my parents
struggle with technology a bit, they've actually improved a lot. They officially know how to FaceTime. Like, we do it all the time. They know how to call;
they know how to hang up. They understand FaceTime is
not a service to book a facial. Having said that, there's still one thing
they struggle with. Hey Dad, how's it going? - Hello Lilly? - Dad, turn your screen. - Huh? Okay. Now do backwards. - I know; turn your screen. - All right, I dumb. - No, you just have to turn your phone. - Now do bloody sideways. - Dad, you must have
locked the screen somehow. - Lock my screen. My parakeet, you have key for screen lock? - It's okay, I will turn
my screen; don't worry. - Okay, me too. - No, you stay. - I stay? - Dad, stop turning the screen. - Hello? - I'm up in here getting motion sickness from FaceTiming my parents. Okay, FaceTiming my
parents is a goddamn raid. Okay, the whole experience is
just one giant fidget spinner. But yo, I wouldn't trade
my parents for the world. Parents are awesome, 'cause you know what? No matter how annoying they are, trust me, you 10 times more annoying. Also, do you like the pin? We're so close to hitting our goal of 16,000 Rafikis and pins. Girllove.com is where you can go. October 11th is the campaign end. Send girls to school in Kenya. Information is in the description. Okay, do the end card. (laughs) Hey you all, stop. Don't go anywhere. Don't you dare go anywhere. First you gotta give us a thumbs up. Do it; do it for a sister. You want to see some

- I hope you're having a great day! (neighing) What up, everyone? It's your girl Superwoman. And before I became a
professional YouTube engineer, I had a lot of retail jobs. One of them was a sales associate at an electronics store, and I worked in the camera department, which is why I know so much about cameras. Wait, am I out of focus? Let me just adjust the
mitochondria here, this dial. There. Having said that, I
know what it feels like to be the customer and
the sales associate, especially in moments like this. - [Customer's Thoughts]
Okay, just give me the camera and don't try to sell me anything else. [Associate's Thoughts] Oh
baby, you know it's coming. - [Customer's Thoughts] Don't
do it, don't you dare do it! - So, for products like these, I really recommend getting
the extended warranty. - [Customer's Thoughts] Honestly, f you! - Mm, when they hit you with
that extended warranty line. (groans) And kind I just say, as someone
who's worked as a retailer, I need to let everybody know
that these sales associates, they don't give an f about
you or your camera, okay? They need to sell this warranty, one, for commission, two, to hit a quota. Because I remember if I
didn't sell a warranty I would literally have to
explain to my boss why. I also learned a few tricks, y'know, put them right up my sleeve. Their sales associates will
always use the following tactics when trying to sell extended warranty. - No, I'm fine, thank you. - You know I just had a
customer walk in crying full of regret. His wife left him because
he had to buy a new camera. They didn't get the warranty. I don't want that to happen to you. - No, that's okay. - You know a thing about
these itty bitty cameras is they got such small pieces. This one's got a lens in it called the endoplasmicreticulum. Yeah, it malfunctions all the time. Warranty covers that. - No, really, I think
it's fine, but thank you. - Wow. Okay, I mean hey, me, I
personally would never buy this camera without a warranty, but hey, I mean, it's your money! It's a shame. - Uh, no, I think it's fine. - Alright, well, in case
you change your mind, you got 30 days. - Ho, I haven't though about
anything for 30 days, okay. Let it go. Has anyone ever though
about it and been like "Oh, sorry, I just wanted to come back "and that warranty you
were trying to upsell me, "yeah I'm gonna purchase this. "29 days, I'm gonna purchase that. "Take my money." Are you done? Are you done? Are you done? Here's the thing, right. It's so hot! Also I just wanna show
off my cute tank top. Okay, I just poked myself in the eye. Here's the thing that makes no sense: Even though I've been a
sales associate in the past, even today as a customer,
when I know someone's about to drop the extended warranty line on me, I get irrationally stressed. I don't know what it is! It's like a fear that doesn't make sense. I'm just like no no no,
don't ask about the warranty. Please don't ask for the warranty. Like my butt starts clenching,
my fists are like this, I can't even make eye contact. I'm like no, make it stop, make it stop. So I pretty much never
get the extended warranty, but I always do this. Why isn't it working? Stupid thing. (sighs) - [Phone Operator] Thank you
for calling warranties.com. Please listen carefully, as our menu options have recently changed. If you're calling about
our new membership program, please press one. If you're calling about
your recent bill payment, please press two. If you're calling because
you're in a public area and want to avoid real human interaction, please press three. If you're calling about
warranty and repairs, please press four. (phone beeps) We're expecting longer
than usual wait times and appreciate your patience. - I swear to god, you
want to call any company that has an automated telephone service, you better block your whole goddamned day. But once I'm on the line with
someone, here come the lies. What do you mean I
don't have the warranty? I fully got the warranty. - [Phone Operator] It
doesn't show in our records. - The guy told me four years warranty is included in the product. Included! That's what he said to me. - [Phone Operator] That's incorrect. - Okay, well, you know what? This is really disappointing
customer service, so... - [Phone Operator] My apologies ma'am. Has the camera had water damage? - Ooh, my favorite place. I love it! No! - [Phone Operator] And
what about dust or sand? - I don't know if this is in focus because there's sand all over my camera-- No. - [Phone Operator] Did you get
the camera dirty in any way? (festive music) - It's your new camera, bro! - This okay? No. - [Phone Operator] Okay,
bring it into the store and we'll see what we can do. - Aight. What? What? Okay, don't judge me with your judgemental rod and cone cells! Let's be real, no one needs a warranty
for unexplainable issues. No, people need warranties
because they drop crap. Give me a warranty that
says if you drop your phone while trying to be basic as f while taking selfies in
a pool, we'll replace it? Sign me up! I need a warranty that says try your best to take a selfie on that rollercoaster, but if you fail, we got you. I swear to god, it's just not right. You know why I'm so salty? Because this one time
I did buy the warranty and my camera did stop working and I realized it doesn't
matter, it's completely useless! Why, you ask? (speaking in foreign language) Observe skit. - Hello dear sir, I have camera. Broken, but I have warranty. Can you please replace. - Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Let's take a look. - Thank you. - Looks like you do have a warranty, sir. That'll just be $200! - Huh? What? - Ooh, it looks like the warranty doesn't actually cover
the lens of the camera. - How can a warranty not
cover lens of camera, huh? - Yeah, it just covers the body. - I'll cover your bloody body. Okay, where is manager? I want to speak. - Hello sir. The best we can do is a
replacement in four to six weeks at a discounted rate of $1.99. - Can you give me replacement in meantime? - No. - Can you do fast delivery? - No sir. - Can you give me discount on new model? - No, I cannot. - Okay, but you can take
my bloody money, right? Well that's okay. That's okay, take everything that I need. Take my phone. You want my phone? Take it, I don't need phone. Wallet? Take my wallet. Huh? Bloody crook. That's okay. You want my car? Take my car. Take everything, I need nothing, okay? You snatch my bloody weave, okay? Done. Actually, I need this things. Sorry. My wallet. I told everyone to cut camera,
but they're still rolling, so I take the camera, thank you. You're still a bloody crook, okay? So yeah, I have a love hate
relationship with warranties, but my way of making
the world a better place is to tell all of you that the next time you're
buying an electronic and the sales associate is like, "So, the extended warranty..." Give them a chance. Listen to them. Don't be mean to them because
they literally have to do it. It's their job, so give them a break. Oh my god, am I out of focus again? Goddamn cerebral cortex on this camera. No, wait, don't go, don't go! Before you go, I wanted to let you know you may've noticed that I've
started to post bloopers on this main channel. About 10 minutes after
my main channel videos, I also release the bloopers
to that video on this channel. Link is in the description. I'll also put the end card.

that is a wrap and zoom. 
- Rent, who is she? (bells ringing) (popping) (twinkling) What up, everyone, it's
your girl, Superwoman. And the other day I was
watching TV with my friends, you know, while I was
waiting for bae to come home. - Your line into my world? Angels guard the sun. - Yeah. - Aw, he's so cute. - Damn, he could get it. - How is Jane still a
virgin with him around? I would bend bend in
every direction for him. - Daddy, dad-dy. - I would do everything to him. - Take your shirt off, boo, come on. - His great thing with
Petra are you and me. - [Jane] Are you kidding me? - Absolutely, I called you. Wow, hey. - Hey.
- Hi, sweetheart. So, you guys enjoying the season so far? - Mm, it's decent. - Hmm. (crunching) Wait, are there carbs in that? - The struggles of dating someone too hot. Oh, wait, you hear that? It's all the people
saying they can't relate. Real talk, though, we all know the struggles of dating someone whack, or being single as hell. But, yo, think about it it's also probably really tough to date someone that's a little too hot. I know what you're thinking,
shut up, hear me out. First of all, when you're
in a relationship, right, people usually respect it enough to not just straight up hit on your boo but as your boo gets hotter, it becomes more and more okay for people to say sexual
things about them. A.K.A
- Damn, he could get it. - Are you telling me Gigi Hadid's friends aren't like to her, "girl, Zayn be looking
like a gourmet snack." Are you dumb, of course they are. Like hoe, if you dating
this fine man, okay, as your friend, I get to objectify him. These are the rules. If you dating Billy Bob Joe, have him. Okay, but if you dating
six foot tall sex bomb men, we gon' share, okay, because this Monopoly and those pecs are a community chest. Second of all, dating someone hot probably gives you mad trust issues. I mean, your boo could
be completely faithful, okay, but that's irrelevant because you don't trust other people. Why? Because you remember
the thirsty hoe you were the first time you met his fine self. You tripping because you know people like you exist out
there (chuckles) in the world. I cannot with these boys. - Amen. - There are certain things that are just deal breakers, you know? - Yeah, like if his wife's crazy. - You mean if you have a wife? - Yeah, that's what I said. - I just don't wanna date
anyone from the industry. I don't wanna a movie star or an actor. I don't want no one's baby
daddy, the end, no exceptions. - Preach, girl.
- Straight up. - Excuse me, ladies,
I'm sorry to interrupt. Do you know where the restroom is? (sexy music) (twinkles) - Uh, no, but I have a
restroom at my house. - I just came from set I
just want to freshen up. - Oh my God, I was just talking about how much I respect
the film industry. No, thank you for your service. - Aw, and it was my turn to
pick up my daughter at school. - Shut up, I love kids,
show me pictures right now. - Of course. - That is so hilarious (giggles). (drum beating) (drum beating) (chuckles) Hoe, pass me some super glue for these deal breakers right now. Just the biggest leech ever (chuffing). I smell fresh, sexy blood (chhuffing). Some people are too hot for
your irrelevant requirements. With a face like that
put a stroller in my hand and call me step-mom, boy, giddy up. And because I was such a leech, now I naturally think
everyone is also a leech. His assistant. - Oh, good morning, sir (chuffing). - [Lilly] The delivery girl. - Delivery for you, sir. (chuffing) - [Lilly] His best friend. - Hey, bro, you been working out? (chuffing) - The girl that wrote
this script (chuffing). So, now I stay tripping, okay, and I question him all the time, even if he does nothing wrong. (playful music)
(loud footsteps) - Hey, babe. - Where you been? - Work, obviously, where else would I be? - Interesting, because
I called your office and they said that you weren't there. - When? - Six minutes ago. - Because I was on my way home? - Mmm, okay, well how come you didn't share your
Uber status with me then? - Because I drive myself. Everyday now for two years. - Hmm, convenient. Whose hair's on your shirt? (clears throat) So, definitely not mine. But straight up, that's
as far as that goes because when you're dating
someone a little too hot, it's impossible to argue with them. Like, you can pretend to be mad but you know that if y'all get in a fight and he sleeps on the sofa,
really, it's your loss. So, you try your best but your hormones simply
will not allow it. - [Hot Bae] Getting tired
of you not trusting me. - And I'm getting tired of your lies. - [Hot Bae] Oh my God, listen to yourself. You're being ridiculous. - Okay, do not speak to me like that, I swear to God I will-- (sexy music) I will walk over there and I
will effin' grope your bicep because you're pissing me off. - What? - Yeah, that's right,
don't make me over there and shove my tongue down
your throat because I will. - I'm confused, are we fighting? - Yeah, we're fighting, okay. You're so dumb you and your stupid toned perfect abs, yeah, I will totally come over
there and lick them. - Lilly, you are really
upsetting me right now. - Oh, yeah, you're so
mad, take your shirt off. I bet you can't take your shirt off. (chuffing) ♪ But my brain keeps telling me no ♪ ♪ But my vajayjay's telling me yes ♪ Is that a song? Did I just make that-- ♪ But my brain keeps telling me no ♪ ♪ My vajajay's saying yeah ♪ Am I John Legend? What up, previous collab reference? Here's the thing, right, when you're dating someone really hot, you probably subconsciously defend them even when they do act whack. You just like that velvet
rope in a museum, just like, "do not come for the art" (chuckles). I think Justin forgot our anniversary. - Rude, you need to dump him. - Okay, calm down, he's such a great guy. - How long have you been
waiting for that text back? - Four hours. But give him a break he's going
through a really tough time. - Why? - Okay, well first of all,
he ordered a pizza yesterday and they accidentally put pineapple on it. That's a lot. - Are you serious? - Yeah, and he's just had
a really rough childhood. When he was growing up, his
aunt had a gluten allergy and it was really tough on
him, so, back off, okay? Like, girl, what you out here
trying to suggest right now? Don't be out here trying to take away the one good thing I have with your uncalled for common sense. You best be a good friend

- I have a tail. (horse hooves clopping) (chimes jingle) What up everyone, it's
your girl, Superwoman, and let me just preface
this video by saying I love my body, I'm proud of my body, I love every curve and
flat place and pimple and stretch mark and bruise on my body, but sometimes my body is effed. (laughs)
Let's talk about it. Number one, my hips do lie, specifically when I'm shopping for jeans, because here's the thing
about my lower body, right? My hips are wide, and my thighs are thick, but my waist is not as wide, and my calves aren't that thick, so I basically need like one pair of jeans and another pair of jeans cut in half and then sewn together. I need to look like, basically have a scarecrow's
outfit full of patches, because no pair of jeans fits me. I swear to God, everything below my waist is a struggle, okay? Because, in my life, I'm
constantly, constantly, thinking of three things. I'm thinking, okay, number
one, is my phone in my pocket? Number two, is there a
mother-effing spider near me? And number three, do I have
a jean penis right now? Why? Because 100% of the time I sit down, I have an artificial jean penis. It's literally the fastest
and cheapest sex change. Justin, Jessica, Justin, Jessica. Here's the thing about
my body in jeans, okay? My gut doesn't fit into my tight jeans, so it's hanging over the
edge and that button, and God bless that button
and God knows it's trying. You know, big ups to that button
because it has a rough job. I don't know how it holds
all of that ish inside here. That button is a real
one, I'm just saying. That button is probably
up in therapy just like, I don't, she just keeps
eating like a little, this is me being the button. She just keeps eating like a little hoe. I just feel like I have the weight of the entire world on my shoulders. What? Okay, it's not my fault. Okay, I'm just forever hungry. What up, t-shirt reference. Ah! Also, I don't know what the eff that button was talking about. And if I buy bigger jeans it just looks like I crapped my pants because now the butt area is too big because there's too much space in there. Why? Because my butt
can't fit all that space. I don't do squats, okay? I have my average butt cheeks. There ain't not much junk in my trunk. So, really the struggle is that I got to fit all
of this into my jeans. My liver, my uterus, my
intestines are just cramming in these jeans just like this in my jeans being tortured. I can't even fart when
I'm wearing tight jeans because there's no where
for that air to go. It's just like this is
my butt cheeks, then stop, do not pass go. Do not collect 200 dollars,
just stay in the booty hole. Just, I can't. It's a struggle. So, all that to say whenever
my hips are in jeans I can't even pay attention
to anything else. I am consumed by making
sure my jeans look proper, so I'm not even listening
to what you're saying. - [Male] I don't think
this is working out. I just, don't have feelings for you and I feel like you never listen to me. - [Lily Voiceover] I hope
you can't tell my gut is hanging over my jeans.
- [Male] Actually, you never listen to me. - [Lily Voiceover]
Wait, is my zipper down? - [Male] We've been in a
relationship for a long time, but- - [Lily Voiceover] I
better cover my jean penis with my shirt. - [Male] Every time I try
to talk to you about it it's just a, are you listening? - Sorry, what? Oh, I love you, too. Number two, eyebrows. So, every morning when I'm doing my makeup I shape my eyebrows with my
little brush and I fill them in. And approximately 20
minutes later and beyond, my eyebrows will proceed to
do whatever the eff they want. I could imagine it's like being a parent and you put all this
time and energy and money into making sure your
child gets raised right and becomes a beautiful human being and then they end up being a mother-effing serial killer, anyways. That's my eyebrows. Just like oh, I got the
right color filling for you. I even got some eyebrow gel. I have this special
little brush to comb you and you still going to
betray me like that? So, come lunch time I look in the mirror and straight up my
eyebrows are just drooping. They look discouraged. I don't even get how it happened. Like how are you defying
gravity and going downward? Is this "Wicked," the play? Is this the cue in which
Colleen changes into Miranda? Like defying gravity? And it's a problem. You know why? Because I
could be confident as hell, but my eyebrows straight
up look like victims. My eyebrows are that girl in the club crying inside the washroom
where you just need to like, girl, listen to me, okay. You need to get it together. It don't got to be like this. Pick up your heels, get up off the floor, take that stupid top knot out your hair, and get back out there. That is me to my eyebrows. My eyebrows always look
like they just found out Trump is president. Just like, what do you, what do you mean? And because they look so sad, I notice that when I brush them
and fix them 100 times a day I literally give them a pep talk. Y'all out here acting like
you're depressed widows, okay? Looking like we just watched
"The Fault In Our Stars." It's not that serious. We're not sad. We're at a birthday party, okay? Get it together, you're better than this. Number three, ashy elbows. Doom, doom, doom. My elbows look like someone
just made s'mores on them. Like two mini campfires
took place on my body. No matter how much
moisturizer I put on my elbows they look ashy, dark, and dry. No matter what. Yeah, sorry to interrupt the
Simpsons are on the phone. They want to know if your right elbow could fill in for Krusty
the Clown this Tuesday? Shut up, zoomed in Lily! No, but straight up, if I elbowed you in the face, you wouldn't just have a bruise, okay? You would be exfoliated. Which is why I started to
use these home remedies. Girls, I know you can relate. You go online, you read some magazine, and they have all these home remedies with random ingredients. If you are sitting there
and you are telling me that you have not once tried a home remedy to improve some part of your body, you lying! The ingredients are so
random, but here's the thing, I trust them blindly. I'm like oh, these random household items that contain lots of chemicals? Sounds great. So, I'm just sitting in my kitchen like, a little bit of honey, dash of pineapple, just a little bit of toothpaste. Like how do these
ingredients make any sense? They don't. I remember one time it
was like baking soda and I'm like how could
baking soda improve this? - [Male] Actually, baking
soda reduces dark circles. - Word? Just a splash of baking soda. (cackles) Baking soda, I got baking soda. I remember one time this
home remedy was like, ooh, you want to reduce dark circles? Cut a potato in half and
rub it against the area. So, I'm just like ch, ch, ch. I didn't see any results, but yo, I had a lot of hash browns. Number four, baby hairs. AKA, the bane of my existence. These little fetus hairs on
my head that want to grow in the exact opposite
direction of everything else. They're just like oh, the rest
of your hair is doing this? Let me just do this. And let me just go every way and just make sure Lily
doesn't get a boyfriend. Let me just make sure she has no friends, she never takes a nice picture. I'm just going to have you
walk around looking like Satan. Hi, thank you so much
for taking this meeting. - The power of Christ compels you. - I always have baby hairs
on either side of my head. All the time. My back up occupation is
that God damn rodeo bull. You know the one that you put a quarter in and you have to ride? That's my back up plan. Mm, yeah, then you'll
start getting some action. I'm going to action your bloody face. And then on my forehead
don't even get me started. I put my hair in a ponytail and my baby hairs here will just be like. Like a peacock. Like that dinosaur from
Jurassic Park that's like. That is my baby hair in the wind. And I know what people who don't have baby hair are going to say. They're going to be like uh,
why don't you just gel it or use hair spray? No, gelling baby hair makes
the situation so much worse. Because then you're just going
to be walking around like a mother-effing hazard because your hair is just going to be taking people's eye out. The hell was that?
(laughs) No, but I swear to God, this should be an inspirational quote. Like be a resilient as your
mother-effing baby hairs. That is the quote. Because I could literally
take wooden planks and nail them to my head and still my baby hair would be like, hey. Then, what do you do, what do you do? Obviously, you do stupid
things like me and you cut it, thus fueling the downward spiral. Number five, leg hair. Here's the thing about shaving. I'm not good at it. Like I don't have patience
for that nonsense, so very often I'll shave my
legs and then I'll wear shorts and I'll realize that I actually missed an entire section of my leg. Like a legit patch or better yet like a strip
down my leg that is hairy as if my leg was the
set of a movie premiere and they just rolled out
the carpet, down my leg. Here's the thing though, I always feel like I notice, but I don't think anyone else notices. Yeah, no, no, we all notice. We call you leg mohawk. And one time I got caught in this scenario with a patch of leg hair
and I had to play it off. Mm, babe, I missed you so much. I'm so happy to see you. - Oh. - Oh. Oh, no. I just wanted to give you options. You know in case you were into that. Because I know you like puppies, right? Just like little fur, right? Just like nah, no, I'm not bad at shaving. No, you see, I was just
trying to be considerate in case you had some like
weird kinky thing going on. The body struggles are real and we all have them, so honestly, who cares? You're beautiful, love yourself. Live your life, boo. Wait, before we go to the
end card I want to tell you did you know I post the
bloopers from my videos on this main channel, now? So, ten minutes after this video comes out there will be bloopers in the description and at the end card. Check them out because
they usually hilarious. All 100% of the time. They're usually absolutely
crucial for your happiness and, let's do the end card thing now. Hey. (chimes jingle) Yo, did you like that video? Well then, why don't you watch

- Okay, just turn off
your brain and relax. Just like that. (Lilly sighs) (Lilly hums dramatic music) Turn off your brain now. And now. God, I have so much work to do. I wonder how much time is left. Probably like 20 minutes. I don't mean to be that person but I feel like he just not
budgeting his time correctly. You know, because he hasn't
even reached by feet yet and there's probably,
what, like 12 minutes? Should I say something? Can you just relax, you freak? What if he's taking a picture of me? Oh my God, my legs are so prickly. I'm so embarrassed. Whatever, whatever, he probably deals with
this stuff all the time. Right? Right? Go damn it, Lilly, reassure me. Right, Chewbacca, right. Honestly, F you. Oh my God, come through. Yes, come through. Right there, yes, yes, yes. Be my boyfriend. Wait, wait, ow, ow, ow, okay, F me. That hurts. Just say it hurts. Shut up, that's rude. God, ow, it hurts so good. No, not the elbow, not, oh, what the elbow, why? - [Masseur] Is the pressure okay? - Oh, yep, it's fine. You deserve pain. Wait, wait, are you
moving towards my butt? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Awkward, awkward don't do it, don't do it. Oh God, no. Actually I like it. This is nice. Now I'm finally relaxing. And I will always love you. And I'm drooling. Is it weird that I left my underwear on? I mean, everyone does that, right? Oh no, is that a fart I feel coming? Hold it in. Okay, it passed. Wait, I hope it didn't go
to my brain or something. - [Masseur] Okay, take
your time getting up. - Okay, thank you. Does that mean I can stay
in here for an hour and nap? (banging) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. I hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, give it a big thumbs up because my forehead is literally broken. You can check out my last

(jingle bells and galloping) (ding) - (sigh) Why, why, why
did I agree to this? - Because you and Ryan
promised to stay friends. - Okay, isn't that just
something people say when they break up to
sound mature and hard. Okay, no one actually means it. - You are mature and hard. - (scoff) That's what she said. Also, okay, yes, I want
to be friends with him but I'll be super annoyed
if he's like, really happy, you know, or if he gets rich or if he starts going to the gym. - Okay, you could totally
go to the gym too. - Don't be insane, okay? I just want him to suck a little bit. Also, that's what she said. No, for real, who wants their ex to meet their new girlfriend? Are you dumb? - He wants to be friends,
that's the whole point. - Anyway, why are you stressing? Literally who could
possible be better than you? - You know you're right, you're right. I don't even go to the
gym and I'm this fit. It's just my lifestyle,
I have a good lifestyle. - That's right. - That's why F the stairs,
let's take the elevator. - You're smart, you're
funny, and you're confident. - Yeah. You didn't really say

that is a wrap and zoom! 
- Damn. Two branded videos in a row. Girl, get it. (neighing) What up everyone? It's ya girl, Superwoman. Aight, so you feel bad because you keep slacking and making the same mistake. Listen I've been feeling really guilty. And I just want to start
by saying I'm sorry and I know you've heard
this before but I am. - Um. - I've been neglecting
you and I don't want to. - Okay. - And I keep saying I want to make time for you but then I don't. - Lilly, I don't feel any. - I just, I come home
from work and I'm tired. You know, I'm tired. - I really. - From now on, okay, when I come home, I'm gonna hold you with my hands. I'm gonna wrap my hands around
you and I'm gonna lift you. - Oh. I didn't realize you, I
just thought we were friends. - Move. What's happening to you? I'm sorry. It is a scientific fact that working out is practically impossible. Earlier this month I heard
my Spanx crying in the middle of the night and I felt bad
enough to finally work out. It took me about a week to prep for it. - Uh, what are you doing? - Buying underwear to work out in. - Online? - Yeah. I'm too lazy to go in person so I figured like
amazon.com/mycalvins son. - Wait, hold on. Why do you need Calvin Klein
underwear to work out in? - Hello. Because I'm gonna
be a fit person soon, okay? And fit people always take pictures with their Calvin Klein
underwear band showing. Don't you stalk sexy people on Instagram? - Wait. Hold on. One second. Just because you're trying to work out that doesn't mean you're gonna become some kind of Instagram model or something. - You know what? I'm sick of you never
believing in me, okay? - You know what? Whatever. I can't. - I have bad friends in my Calvins. Once I finally bought all
the clothes and equipment I needed and figured out
like a cute hairstyle and made all these workout charts, ooh got one of those
like fancy water bottles, it was time to go beast mode. (upbeat music) Are you kidding me? It's too easy. Okay. I could do like 100 of these. All day. I'm tired. I'm bored. (upbeat music) Day one. Easy. (upbeat music) - What are you doing? - Um, hello, pushups you noob. - You're doing them wrong. You're supposed to do them
on the ground not the wall. - Oh my god, how embarrassing. There. 55. 56. (upbeat music) Yeah. Should be losing
weight any minute now. Yo, for real though, those 14
minutes changed my life okay? I was a whole new person. (camera noise) Hashtag gym life. Yo. Get in here quick. Yo. Ask me which way the beach is girl. - I have a GPS. - Nah, you just jealous of my gains. - You worked out once. It doesn't happen that fast. - You know why you call these guns? These right here? Cause these are fire arms. - You literally look exactly the same. - Yo. New year, new me. - It's November. - I'm Blogilates. You know and it's like working out once really changed the way I made choices and allowed me to judge
other people for theirs. Uh, I can't believe you put
that filth into your body. - Um, you eat donuts like every day. - Okay, that was before
I started working out. Hello? Yeah, your body's a temple. Just saying. Yo it even changed the way I talk. Yo do you even lift bro? - Um, Lyft for Lilly. - Yeah, that's me. Yo. Can we go to In-N-Out still? And it turns out that working out once does in fact completely validate you. Yo. You follow my fitness blog yet? - Your what? - My fitness blog. My last post was about skipping leg day. - You only worked out one day. - Yeah. And it was leg day. - Okay. You know what? Lilly look, just because
you started working out once doesn't make you some Instagram
model or a fitness guru. You know what? I can't even stand people like you, people who think they can

- I'd like to thank God for Spanx, screen protectors, and Selena Gomez. (horse hooves clopping) (horse neighs) What up, everyone? It's your girl, Superwoman, and never before have my
parents reacted to Selena Gomez. Why? Because I adore her and
if my parents say anything to make fun of her, I will die. Sometimes I wish I could just
like, control what they say. But because Selena's
new music is so iconic, I've decided to change my mind. So please enjoy my parents reacting to Fetish by Selena Gomez. Wuddup, t-shirt reference? Wuddup, t-shirt reference? It's like, Inception 2
is just writing itself. Okay, go ahead, go watch the, whoosh! - Hello! - Hello. Munjit Singh, coolest guy on Instant-gram. - Today we're reacting Selena Gomez, never before react because Lilly say if we say anything bad about her, she going to run away from home. - You know, I don't really
know Selena Gomez music because I am man, so. ♫ Keep my hands to myself ♫ I mean I could but why would I want to - You know, wizard girl that
do the magic ding-a-ding? - Uh, Hermione, from Harry Potter. - Song name Fe-tash. - Featuring Gucky Mah, Munny, ba da, Gucky Munny! - Mmm, nice flower, I
want like that in garden. - Very nice, beautiful, yeah. Maybe Fetash some nice place in Greece. We should go vacation. - I like this dress, you see? No legs showing, very good. - You see car on fire there, Lilly probably driving this one. You know one time she
tried to parallel park, they had to close the street. - You see, you see? Good girls go grocery shopping. I'm talking to you, okay,
naked girls on Instant-gram. - Oh, I love hand puppet! I love, oh, make a doggy! Make dog, meow meow! Meow meow meow! - This like a silent film. Very pretty girl, you see? I wish I had daughter like this, you know? That look like a girl. Look, such a nice table. She probably making dinner for in-laws. ♫ If I were you I'd ♫ Love - Oh, oh, okay, that escalate quickly! - Oh, oh, okay, maybe this a
new way to defrost a chicken. - This is not how you take off a stocking! I mean, not that I wear, I don't know, but I'm guessing, you know. (clears throat) she cutting her tongue with a wrench. - Oy, that a eyelash curler, dumbhead. - Okay, okay. She cutting her tongue
with a eyelash curler! - What the bloody hell
this is, her fashion? ♫ Under and twisted up like origami - Okay, how the bloody
hell it raining inside and what kind of magic candle this is, not being effected? Bloody wizard. - This a music video or new
season of American Horror Story? ♫ Surprised, I sympathize - Apparently crazy is the new black. - Okay, you need a plumber! - Why the bloody hell
she playing Twister, huh? There not even colorful mat on floor. - Oh, all the eggs broken, oh my God. How you going to make omelet? - I don't like this dress anymore. - I think she really like this counter. - This not how you serve dessert, okay? Or is it? ♫ I push you out and you come right back ♫ Don't see a point in - Maybe she take Advil PM during the day and now she crazy. - Where this water coming from, huh? Your dinner table in SeaWorld? - She remind me of this emoji. - This counter getting
more action than Lilly. - Oy, oy, oy oy, where your hand going? (stammers) I mean, I'm not looking, I'm just, I just, I'm just, I'm, okay. - I like when her hair comb, you know? She look less crazy. - Oh, yes, Drake is here. - Oy, this is not Drake! This Weeknd. - Huh? Weekend? Today Monday. - He speaking English? Sing Star Boy! - Okay, I understand, she in grocery store where maybe Elsa do shopping. You know, grocery store
inside a snow globe. - Why you always on floor, huh? Somebody buy her bed! ♫ Why buy a mattress anywhere else, ding ♫ Out and you come right back - Making a snow angel
in freezer, very good. - But she's so pretty, right? Oh. Then she eating lipstick. - This is not how you do lipstick, okay? I mean, not that, not that I know, I'm just, uh, I'm just guessing. ♫ If I were you I'd do me - Okay, thank God, do dishes, ah? What the bloody hell? - Oh, this is not food group, okay? Vegetable, roti, bread. These food groups! - No, that's good, no, no! Let me throw bloody food on ground and then let me eat soap, huh? Very good, good. No, no, no, please, please! Good, very good. Good, good. Dumbhead. I could say I understand,
but I would be bad liar. - Maybe someone know the
meaning of this, but, ♫ It ain't me ♫ Dun-de-dun-dun de-dun-dun-dun. - [Man] Hey, um, Lilly? - Huh? - [Man] We're back. - Uh, no, oh, I was just, I was just flo, flossing. (stammers) Hygiene, my teeth, my hygiene, the mint. But there you have it, I personally love Selena's new music. I think it is different,
I think it's artistic, and it is definitely full of moans that I try to imitate all day long. ♫ And oh, baby My ear just popped.

like every instrument. - Oh that means he's
good with his hands too. - Oh, that's him over there. With the amazing hair. - Holy crap, you weren't kidding. How did you two meet again? - At a Britney Spears' concert. Yeah, and he was such a gentleman. He kept complimenting my outfit. And then you know me, I got drunk, and I was like, "I have the
best creme brulee recipe." and then he's like no, he did. So we exchanged emails
and did a recipe swap. (mumbles) - Oh, you guys hooked up? - No. We had a bake off. Okay, but you know. We've been hanging out
every day since then. - Have you kissed at all yet? - No. Oh, but we cuddle all the time. Honestly, I just think he's nervous. You know what he said to me yesterday? That he's never felt so
close to a girl before. It's really cute. - Wow, that is really sweet. His friend's pretty banging too. - Girl, I got you. That's why you're here. Giddy up, let's go. Hi, bae. - This is Andy. - Andy, it is so nice to finally meet you. You know Rudy can't
stop talking about you. - Guilty, guilty, guilty. - This is my very beautiful
girl friend, Eliana. - Nice to meet you guys. - So nice to meet you. We actually went ahead
and got you two cosmos. - Oh, so sweet. - And got some for
ourselves as well actually. - Oh. - Why not? Join the party, right? (chuckles) Cheers, guys. Here's to new friends and a
fabulous future together, huh? Extra. Why not. - So Rudy, you and Lilly have
been pretty inseparable, huh? - I mean, she's great. We have so much in common. - Last night we binge
watched Cupcake Wars. - Don't do it Lilly. - Remember that one episode? No. - Don't do it. She just wanted to win for
her dog that passed away. - We stayed up crying all night. - Hello. Save some for the rest of us. - I mean find me someone else who knows all the Lady Gaga lyrics, only eats the crust off pizza. C'mon. ♪ I'm on the edge of glory ♪ ♪ And I'm hanging on a moment with you ♪ - It's perfect though because before Rudy I only used to order the breadsticks, but now we can split a pizza perfectly. I get to eat just the tops. - And Rudy's always been a bottom guy. (laughs) Excuse me. - So bad. (laughs) - They do the pizza thing too. Andy is so handsome. - Tell me about it. - It's like hot people
travel together or something. How do you know each other any way? - Online. We met online. - Oh my God. Was it one of those
fantasy football things? I heard those get super intense. - Um, it was location-based actually. - Yeah because I'm trying to set up Eliana with someone more her level as well. - Well online dating's
perfect for that, right? - Yeah, well I'm looking more

Can you help me go to the washroom? Okay? - They're nice. - What are you doing? Do not say the D word. - What? - Dating. You're gonna freak him out. We're taking it slow. - That is not what is gonna freak him out. Rudy is gay. - What? No he is not. We have had a sleepover
like every night this week. We're in the same bed. - How many pillow fights? - Four. - Literally, I think you are
reading this relationship wrong. - No. No I'm not. You're wrong. I am so right about this. You don't understand because
he's just a sweet guy. Yeah, maybe you're not used to sweet guys. Okay, he pays attention. Yeah, he compliments what I wear. He texts back right away. He's always telling me
how much he respects me. Oh my God, he's gay. I'd like to propose another toast. Okay, here's to hoping
all of us individually, separately, all go home

- Hey, guys. Did you notice the new grocery store that opened down the block? - You mean, like, outside? - Yes. It's expensive, but it's
supposed to be healthy. Their tagline is: You are what you eat. And apparently it's supposed to be bomb. (thud) (hissing) Oh, our Coke exploded. - Alright, what'd you get? - I got cheese, chicken
for the carnivores, wine, All Dressed chips for me, cereal, - This look like a normal
cheese from any store. - Huh, what's so different
about this wrap, huh? (crinkling) (wine pouring) - It's normal. But something wrong with my eyes. I can't take them off you. (cymbals) - Uh, that was super cheesy and gross. - I'll never find a man that treats me like that and it's not fair! - This wrap is all dough,
but it still is not so bad. Your life is Where's Waldo,
you can't find a man, uh. - What the hell was that? - Dude, shh. Don't yell at your mom, man, I don't want her to kick us out. - Since when are you such a chicken? - If you were a vegetable,
you would be a cute-cumber. (cymbals) - These dudes want to be
the Ross to my Rachel. He say he want to watch
Netflix and cut cable. You won't wife me, I don't like labels, Only here for the weekend, call me Abel. - Mmmmm, Selena Gomez and
the Weekend are so cute. Oh my God, my phone's on 1%. I just chipped a nail. My head hurts. - Oh my God, a nail? I don't want that to
happen to me, I'm scared. I really want to try some beef too, but I don't want to get E coli. - Dude, chill out. (intense music) - You don't have to make a phone call, eh? Don't tell me what to do, son. - I lost my phone number. Can I have yours? (cymbals) - Lilly, let me try some corn. - Hmm, you want one or two? - All I need is one corn, one beat, one stage, one auntie front,
my face on the front page. - So, one corn? (crinkling) - Mmm, every time I eat corn,
I can see it in my poop. It's so gross. I hate corn. I hate vegetables. My life is so hard. - Mom, what the hell is on your head? - What? - Hold up, kay? Everybody needs to stop
disrespecting me, okay? I can literally sense the disrespect. Kay, if it's a chit chat thing you better act nice, eh? - Oi, calm down okay? Have some cereal. (ripping) (romantic music) I'm up on that to get lucky, bae. - Where did that girl even come from? It's a closed set. - Wow, that girl that went in
there seems really flexible. What's all this? - What, what, huh, what, what, what? Just cause we're all here, what, now your questioning us? It's a free country, okay? Okay? Shh. I told you not to talk to me in public. - Achoo! New grocery store opened down the street. - Oh, yeah, right, I ate there yesterday. Had a foot long wiener. It was great. (crunch) Mmm, this salsa's great. - Okay, I'm here. What are you're other two wishes, huh? (cymbals) - Damn, this salsa's (salsa music) really, really good. - Good, good, huh, good, just so good. That means we can be bad. Shh, act normal, they're on to us. (laughs) - Yeah, I really don't get what the big deal about this food is. (salsa music) - Same. I'm going to go spend some time on Tinder. - Ooh, did you want the
catfish, in case you get hungry? - Sure. (salsa music) - Lick me, - [Man] Lick me? - Let lick me. - [Man] Oh yeah. (laughs) Sorry. (mimicking Man) Oh, yeah, I ate there yesterday. - Say the line! Speak English! English! You are a steaming, hot pile of trash outside on a sunny day. It's a heat wave, there's food left over. You are that trash. That's the trash you are. Straight Up. (crinkling) - Mother f-er. You only had one shot and one opportunity to cease everything you ever wanted. - I'm so full. - I'm so full, I don't
want to eat anything else. (coughing) - You like this view? (vomiting noise) (laughing) Oh, hey there. You like this video? Let me know by giving me a big thumbs up.

(magical unicorn hooves clomp) - Hello and welcome back
to my YouTube channel. Wait, why are there no Christmas
lights in the background? Hello! I'm making a lifestyle video, what kind of trash lifestyle
do I have without lights? And it's August, which means
back to school videos, yay! And I know there is a huge lack of these on YouTube right now, so
I decided to help you out with some super cute, super fun, super adjective adjective DIYs. But before we get into
it, please enjoy this super saturated montage of me
smiling with school supplies. ♫ Forget about the rules and whether Pause, more saturation! ♫ Thing that matters ♫ When it's time to move out ♫ Feel the rain in every battle Before I tell you anything of value, please make sure you
subscribe to my channel, comment below, and give
this video a big thumbs up without even watching it. I'm also probably doing a giveaway and my links are down
below for my Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest,
Snapchat, Facebook, Vine, MySpace, so make sure you follow me! Now let's get into the
video by queuing to another super cute montage where I
somehow use copyright music. (upbeat music) ♫ We're stronger together
than we ever could be apart (upbeat music) Normal highlighters are so boring. They're literally just
neon, bright and colorful. So, here's a fun DIY that you can do instead of paying attention in class. Bleed ink from one highlighter
into another highlighter and then get a multicolored highlighter that will last literally for nine seconds. It doesn't really matter
what you're highlighting, as long as it looks cute. To make your new
highlighters even prettier, place them on a desk next
to a bunch of other random school supplies, like a roll of tape, single hole punch and stapler, all the things you use every
time you're in English class. I definitely use my single hole punch every time I need to
hole punch a Post-It note because it's useless for a
normal size piece of paper. Another fun DIY is Post-It note earrings. You can even write your
to do list on them. It's super cute. (upbeat music) Normal notebooks are so boring and plain, and cute ones are so expensive, like this glitter one is $19.99. But don't worry, you can DIY it. I bought this glue gun,
notebook, and glitter off Amazon for only $30. So go ahead and make a cute
design with the glue gun on your notebook and then
sprinkle glitter on top as you make a huge mess. Three hours later you'll
have this super cute glitter notebook that will
100% ruin everything else in your backpack. (tearing noises) Now if you don't have a
credit card to order things off Amazon because you're too young, chances are your parents won't
let you use theirs either because they're scared of the internet. So just go ahead and
steal their credit card to make a purchase, it's super cute. If that doesn't work, don't worry, an easy life hack is to
just check your priorities, because this doesn't matter at all. (upbeat music) Agendas can be really overwhelming with all the numbers and
dates and similar squares. Oh, so make your agenda
more fun by cutting squares of decorative paper and pasting
them in every other square. Then use colorful gel
pens that will instantly smudge to write in it. All your friends will
think it's really cute. - Your agenda makes me feel really happy, like a cake baked of rainbows. - She doesn't even go here. - Wait, do you even go to this school? - No, but I just have a lot of feelings. - Okay, go home. (upbeat music) - You don't wanna be the
only person in your school with a lame backpack,
so get super creative and put a whole bunch of pins on it. This lets people know
that you have an important point of view. To make your backpack even cuter, candidly laugh and smile at no one. People will definitely notice. (laughs) - The new girl is so weird. (laughs) (upbeat music) - Normally pens are really basic and all they do is write,
but if you want your pens to be super adorable, shoot
them on a really expensive lens like I'm doing right now. I mean, afterall, we want
everyone to swipe right for your pens on Tinder. It's also important to
have a full face of makeup and wear a super extra outfit
when holding your pens. I mean, you wanna bring out
the best in your stationery. (upbeat music) Locker organization is something that is just as important to
me on the first day of school as it is on the last. So here's a fun DIY locker to do list. Buy a piece of decorative paper and place Post-It notes on it. Make sure you write to do at
the top to avoid confusion and don't worry about
running about of Post-its, because you'll only use
this about two times. That's because your to
do list will never be where you need it,
it'll be in your locker, looking super cute. (upbeat music) Wait, what was the assignment? (upbeat music) My last DIY is Washi Tape,
and you can literally just put it on everything. I mean, you can make a DIY watch, DIY eraser, and even a DIY PopSocket. It's super cheap and super cute, and everyone will love it. I mean, that's literally
how the real world works. What is the Capital of Canada? The capital of Canada is the letter C. Well I mean she did cover
this with Washi Tape, so... Alright, that's all I
have for you guys today, thank you so much for watching this video I shot in front of a
really intense ring light. Please give it a big thumbs up because my retinas are literally fried, and don't forget to subscribe down below in case you forgot all of the other times that I told you. You can also follow me here, okay, bye. Okay fine, one more montage. ♫ You and me (upbeat music) (magical sounds) Just kidding, this is horrible, and a shout out to all the DIYers who I'm actually friends with. No shade, I think you're
so creative and innovative and I'm just jealous. If you wanna watch videos

- Wow, you probably had
sex when you were like 13. While watching Pokemon. (laughing) (upbeat hip-hip music) - And I ate Tandoori Chicken. - It's not called Tan-dur-ee is it? - Yes it is. - I thought it was Tan-dor-ee. (laughing) - Isn't it Tan-dory? It's Tan-doo-ree, but you
white people say Tan-dor-ee. (laughing) - It's so terrible. (both laughing) - Can you say that word for me? - Like white person or really. - Say it how you would say it. - De-lee, De-lee.
- Great. - De-lee.
- Just like that. - I went to little idiot. (laughing) Idiot? - When your real racism comes out. "I went to little idiots one time. "They had the little
dots on their forehead, "and they were like,
ding-a-ding-ding-a-ding." - I really don't, okay, okay. - Are you chewing nachos right now? (laughing) You cow. Tyler is behind the camera doing, (mouth chomping) Listen Shamu, goes into a 7/11
and can't control himself. (whale singing) - He said his life was exactly the same. (laughing) Killing it. Come give me kissies. (kissey noises) Mwha-mwha-mwha-mwha. - Who's a good racist? You a good racist. - Who's a good white boy? Come give me Eskimo kisses. - Do you speak fluent American at home or, or British? (laughing) - I'm sorry. - Is your occupation
the #0000 in Photoshop? - Uh, I, oh white, white. I gotcha. - Wait, are you white? I love Taylor Swift. (laughs) - Love Taylor Swift. (laughing) - You probably tell your mom, I can see your jaw
clenching and it's so funny. (laughing) It's like. (laughs) - I watched a documentary
about your people called "Super Size Me". (laughing) (electronic music) 
- Mad fetus vibes. (laughs) (unicorn hoof beats) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. And growing up there was
one thing that happened every single month that was
the biggest stress ever. The arrival of my phone bill. Hashtag first world problems. When I was younger I
used to be so terrified of the arrival of my phone
bill that I would straight up turn religious. That ever happen to you? When you were a kid and you
knew you was about to get whupped so hard so you're like okay, let me try this God thing out real quick, just praying like Lord Jesus Christ please
save me in this time of need. I'm out here making saviors
up just like Bob, Jacob, George, Ashley, if you up
there please stop by my manger. - You're not Christian. - I know but this is the only
religion that seems to work in horror movies. - Because those people are Christian. - Okay well I never seen
Krishna, I know exorcism, okay maybe Hollywood
should be more diverse. That's because brown people
don't get possessed, okay. We're not scared of the devil,
we're scared of our parents, which is why I was scared of my phone bill because it was paid for by said parents. And I'm not just talking any phone bill. No, no, no. I'm talking that detailed bill that took an entire forest to print. (paper slamming) Make our planet great again. Here's the thing, right,
when I'm in a restaurant my parents can't even read the menu because their eyesight is so bad. (upbeat background music) - One second. Lilly hold for me. (chair scraping) Farther. (chair slamming) Okay, okay I take water no ice. - But when that detailed bill arrived? - Who 736-276-9127 huh? - Which area code this is? - Why you awake at 10 p.m.? - Who you calling in Miami, Florida? - Uh I got hurt. I thought I was calling 911. - Number for 911 is 911. - I got confused. In my defense, in the history
of the entire universe, no child who has been
asked whose phone number is on their detailed bill has told the truth. It's just never happened. Here's the thing about
phone companies, right, they make these commercials
that are all like-- - Now introducing our newest plan. Unlimited talk and text
for only $45 a month. Wow! Reliable! Unlimited. Affordable. Unlimited. Fast. Unlimited. Call your boo. Text your boo. Sext your boo. Without any limits. (microphone thudding) - And then you open your
$45 a month phone bill. (whistling) Mother fu-- Because straight up the hardest thing you will ever learn in
life is that unlimited is never really unlimited. What they really mean is
unlimited up to 100 megabytes. Like, ho, that sounds like a limit. Unlimited after 5 p.m. Unlimited but within two
kilometers of your house. Straight up I had a plan
like that when I was younger when calls were free within
a certain radius of my house. Yeah I was making calls just like, yo so how's the weather in Miami. Really? Yo I gotta call you back. (tape measure clicking) And with every expensive phone bill I got, my dad pulled this 100% of the time. - Uh hello, yes, I'd like to
cancel my phone plan please. Yes cancel. No that's okay you cancel. It's too expensive, I can't afford. You know, too many extra charges. - And this process included
some key sentences. - Mm, yeah you know people at Bell they giving me better deal. (ding) I've been loyal customer 15 year okay? (ding) You know I talk to somebody
last time from your company and they telling me next bill free. Check my file, check my file. (ding) - My Dad ain't canceling nothing. Okay this is the monthly
bluff that goes down. My Dad's on the phone sitting there like Joanne the god damn Scammer. - Uh hello TELUS, it's over. It's canceled. Honestly, no truly. Unless you can give me some
sort of discount on my bill. (upbeat music) Iconic. - And I'm sure some white dude in Ohio is just sitting on the other line like-- - Lord Krishna, please help
me deal with this customer, and make them fall in a ditch. - But you're not Hindu. - Yeah well Jesus is
always busy with exorcisms and I think this is the only
religion that karma works in. (laughing) - Yo if you like that video
actually click the thumbs up and let me know. That's how I know to make
more videos like this. You want to check out my last video, it is my Dad rapping all around the world. Bloopers for this video right over there. Click subscribe because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday. One love Superwoman,
that is a wrap and zoop. 
- If everybody else in
the room just exchanged eye contact, this video is about you sis. (neigh) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman and we all have that one girlfriend who is obsessed with her boyfriend. Or girlfriend. I mean hey,
it's 2017, okay. Love wins. Although to be honest,
the year shouldn't really validate that point because
love should have always won. Just saying. And hold up,
hold up, I get it, okay. Love, feelings, romance, all those things. You live your life, I ain't mad. But I feel like I speak on
behalf of humanity when I say that it is annoying as
hell when everyone else feels like they are also
dating your boyfriend. Straight up some people
these days are so obsessed with their significant
others and I'm just like yo, the rest of us people, we the people, we did not sign up for this trash. We the people, we need you
to be a couple that consists of two, or three, depends
how freaky you want to get. Two or three people over there, okay? Don't always be so over here in my face, on my bloody lap, in my timeline. Okay, you know your girl is trippin' when she starts doing
any of the following. Number one. And make sure you Uber it, cause we're gonna get stupid drunk. - I'm so excited. Can I bring Tyler? - Tyler, like your boyfriend Tyler? - Yeah. - To my bachelorette party. - Mm hm. - To my all girls Taylor Swift
Bad Blood bachelorette party. - Yeah. - Don't make me. She asks
to bring him everywhere, even though it's clearly
not appropriate. Duh. Like is common sense not common? The invite will say bring a plus one if you can bring your boyfriend. If it doesn't say bring
a plus one, don't ask. This ain't some sort of math equation where you can just carry a one, hoe. Okay, no. There are social rules. You know, I would have
loved that. Oh, but shoot. I don't have enough uh,
seats in my house, so. - It's okay. I can just sit on his lap. I do that all the time anyways. - Oh, shoot. But you know what it is? Oh remember the thing. I
didn't order enough food, so for that many people,
so no he can't come. - No worries. We can grab food on the way. - You know actually what it is is that it's my mother F-ing bachelorette party. So you can't bring your
boyfriend. Are you dumb? Are you dumb? Are you dumb?
Like honestly, catch a hint. Okay, honestly who's in charge of props? Was it you? Was it you? You had one job. So hey, get the F out of here. The point is no, you can't
bring your stupid boyfriend. - You're right. I'm sorry. I won't. - Thank you. But it's
gonna be fun. (glass clink) - Happy bachelorette. - Girl, straight up if
you bring your boyfriend to my bachelorette party, he
best be the stripper I hired. Number two. She tells him everything. Now I get it, okay. When
you're in a relationship you want to share things
with you significant other, you know all the things
that affect you two like how was your day, what did you eat, did you find whole corn
in your boob again. All the crap other
people don't care about. Knock yourself out. But
I am not down with you being my friend and then
sharing information about me with your boyfriend that
doesn't even affect him. Like when the hell did this
turn into a group thread? So, do you want to get out of
here or what are you thinking? - Hey, sorry. Sorry to interrupt. Rachel was telling me about your situation and this will help. Hang in there. - What? Who was that crazy guy and what was he talking about, right? - Talking about the
UTI. That wasn't clear. - Got it. - Rachel, she was telling me and so I- - Yes. So are you still down? Girl, don't you dare. Okay, you
know exactly how this works. This works one way. You tell me everything about your boyfriend,
but not vice versa, okay? He doesn't need to know nothing about me, this ain't no democracy. Yeah, that's right. You
listening to me boys? Boy watching right now, you
girlfriend if she's friends with me, I know everything
about you. Everything. I could draw a picture of
your penis right now, okay. To scale, just saying. (laughter) I'm kidding. Mom, if you're
watching this I'm kidding. It wouldn't be to scale,
all girls lie. Duh. Number three. Face all the time. You know, I don't know who's more lame, the girl who's always
FaceTimeing her boyfriend even though she's around other people, or her boyfriend who
thinks it's okay to be FaceTimeing her even though
she's around other people. Both of y'all need to be
seasoned, packaged up, and just labeled as whack
sauce, just like 15 cents. Here you go. You bloody
perfect for each other. - My god. I'm so scared babe. Hold me. No. No, don't do it.
Don't go into the room. Babe, you would never go into
the room without me right? You would always make
sure the room with me? Oh my god, I can't
believe he's gonna do it. I'd be so sad if you died like the guy in the movie that's about to happen. (cups rattling) Aw, babe. I miss you so
much. No, I'm not busy. What do you think I should order, babe? - Okay, honestly Rachel. Can you just put your phone away for one night? - Sorry, you're right. Bye, babe. - Bye. I had so much fun
FaceTimeing you just then. - Can I get just like a jug of vodka? A whole jug. No, but real talk. How many of you have
been at a party and seen a girl in the corner
FaceTimeing her boyfriend? Just like there are real
people around you right now, and to be honest you're being
rude. You're being antisocial. Not to mention you're killing
everyone's vibe, okay? So just hurry up, get drunk, and lose your phone like a normal person. Number four. The redirect. You know a girl's obsessed
with her boyfriend when she somehow redirects every conversation to be about her boyfriend. Like legitimately it's a talent. I'm shook, I'm stunned
at her ability to do so. She should be on reality shows. Just like okay, sweetie. So
what's your talent today? Oh my god, that's so weird. My boyfriend also calls me sweetie. Every judge right off
the bat bah, bah, bah. Three X's. Oh my god, that's so weird. You know who's not an
ex? My current boyfriend. Yeah, just give it time. You clingy as F. And then I just met all these
wonderful girls in India and they have such
heavy stories, you know. - Wow, yeah. I know. I totally get it. Tyler's never been to India
before, so I can relate. - I'll take a Coke Zero. - Aw, Tyler. - I'm sorry, what? - Oh, Tyler's 20. - Okay. - So, Coke Zero. - I don't get it. - 20. Two, zero. - Okay? - Tyler. - Okay? - My boyfriend. - What? - Seriously, Lilly? - I'm sorry. My uncle just died, so. - Oh my god, I'm so sorry. You know who else just died? - Who? - Not Tyler. Isn't that great? - (whining) Okay, let
me get this straight. Okay, you want to interrupt
my story to tell me your boyfriend has not been to India as if that's some sort of shocking point. You know, yeah, majority of the American population has probably not been to India. I could go to L.A. outside
right now in L.A. and ask ten people have you been to India, okay? Five of them are gonna be like
oh I've never been to India, but I do love the Cleveland Indians, okay. Three of them are gonna
be like which tribe? And two of them are gonna be like oh my god, I love Slumdog Millionaire. Your boyfriend is not unique. Duh. Number five. Cosplay. Possibly one of the most annoying things someone can do is pretend to like all of the things their significant other likes. One time I had a friend, I swear to god, she tried to convince me that she suddenly likes rock music and I'm just like girl, one time we played Guitar
Hero and you sharted. Okay, get the F out of here. (mumbling) Walk away. I think my eyelash just
like stabbed me somehow. That's because they're fake. (laughter) Yeah, I'm just gonna fake talk to you for a second cause Rachel's being- - Sup, playa? - Hey, what's this? - What do you mean? It's my Raptors jersey that I always wear. - Okay, you left the tag
on. Also, since when? - It's the playoffs tournament. - Okay, so who's your favorite player? - The quarterback. - And what's his name? - Ronaldo, duh. - And what's his number? - Oh, don't be silly. We don't text. - Oh, right. This had nothing to do with the fact that Tyler
likes basketball, right? - Ew, no. What, no. I am so not that girl. - Skittles are amazing. - What? It was like this when I got here. - Just be yourself. Unless you're on the first, second, or third date. Let's be real. All girls are
not jealous, low maintenance, and kind on the first, second, third date. But after that, be yourself. To the end. Hey, thank you so much for watching this video with

- That awkward moment when
I'm making a video about you. (galloping)
(chimes twinkling) (whooshing) What up everyone it's
your girl Superwoman. And disclaimer, disclaimer! This video may or may not
be me making fun of you, and me, in fact everyone
who watches YouTube videos. Maybe you're one of these types of people. Maybe you're not. Maybe you are but you're in denial. Either way the important
thing to remember is don't unsubscribe. (heavenly music) Let's get straight to it. Number one. The Stans. Now for those of you who may
not be familiar with internet language, a stan is basically
a synonym for a very passionate intense fan. Like a windmill. Now these are the types of
people that don't just watch YouTube, no, no, they
live and breathe YouTube. And they don't just like creators, no. They want to be physically
abused by creators for a reason I simply cannot comprehend. (whooshing) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. - Cut me with that jawline and
strangle me with that hair. - Pre-order my book at LillySinghBook.com. - Take my money and
slap me with your book. Give me paper cuts with those pages. Break that book spine over my skull. - I'm going on tour. - Hit me with that airplane. Shove that turbulence down my throat. Suffocate me with your boarding pass. Cut my legs off on that stage! - Yeah, apparently it's like
a huge compliment to want someone to rip your guts out. Yo, Freddy Krueger is on the
next season of The Bachelor. Welcome to 2017. Also, I'd just like to say
that these are my fans and my fans speak like this and I
don't care if they sound crazy, I love them. I love Team Super so much. In fact, you know what? Team Super, slap me
with your tweets, okay? And shove your memes down my esophagus. Number two. Internet Warriors. Now these are the people that
have one sole purpose in life. And that is to disrupt everything. They don't go to YouTube
for the videos, no, no, no. They go to YouTube for the
comment section, okay, because they turn that ish into a war zone. Just straight up cussin'
off people for no reason. You see, other people go to
therapy for their self esteem issues but not the internet warrior, no. They go under my videos
and they're like, "Okay so "everything about my life sucks. "I know, I'll make myself
feel better by typing the word "slut a lot." And you can spot this person
from a mile away because they don't know how to spell
and they don't know how to use grammar. I mean that sounds a lot like me. Okay, there's two kinds of people. Either they're the
internet warrior or it's me leaving a comment. Whatever, yo. Go to the skit. What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. - Hm. (sniffs) Go back to your country you Paki. And eff everyone who watches
her videos you dumb idiot! What's this? "Why do you watch her videos?" Don't tell me what to do you hoe! Okay, I effed your mom last night. "Just leave." Just die because you're ugly
and I effed your sister you piece of diarrhea!
(keys tapping) This is Sparta! (rock music) Yes, yes. Give me more attention! Hey, where you going? Pay attention to me. Pay attention to me, stupid! You idiot! Hoe! Don't forget to click my
ads internet warriors. Thanks for giving me a view. You know, I bought this house with your help. (laughs) Number three. Dinosaurs. (roars) Now these are my favorite types
of viewers because they come from a period of time with such innocence. You know, before people
were smashed and passed. These are the parents and
grandparents that are just now discovering the internet and YouTube. They're scared. Confused. And 100% don't think I have a job. (innocent music) - Now where do I put the cassette tape? Hey, sugar pie, they're makin'
videos on the computer now. - What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. - Is this The Price Is Right? Bob Barker's got some long hair now. Aw, would you look at that,
they're letting colored people make movies now. That's good. You know, I saw on Facebook
the other day, people are also starting to post
photographs on the internet. What a time to be alive. When I was younger we had
this thing called Blockbuster. I used to get them late
fees but never pay them. I was a rebel. When are they gonna play Plinko? - Number four. Playlist pervs. Now these are the people that
convert everything I say into something that makes them
feel sexy and turned on. I could literally be wearing a
turtleneck and snow pants and this playlist perv is gonna
be watching me rubbing his nipples pretending I'm Elsa. Just like, let it go. Let it go. For them YouTube is just
free porn with a lot of personality and none of the viruses. What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. - Hey. It's your girl Superwoman in my bed. ♫ So what up t-shirt reference T-shirt reference on your boobies. Yeah I'd like to see you
with only that snapback on. - Lilly, I don't like
this conversation, okay? - Let me feed your mom my chicken curry. - Oops. - Yeah, take that blonde
wig and just (sniffs) sniff it with my huge nose. Oh, yeah. - Yes! Take that other loved ones! - Yeah. You wear that beard just for me. I mean I like boobs. Yeah. - And welcome to the Girl Love series. - You empower girls while I empower this... - Number five. The Butt Hurt. Ow. Now these are the types of
people that go to YouTube videos and just seek out ways to get offended. Like some effed up
version of Blue's Clues. Just like. (cheerful music) Hey, kids. Do you see a way we could get offended? You do? Where? (gasps) Look at the wall. It doesn't have every color,
therefore I must be racist. It's like they willingly watch
content and then go out of their way to express their disapproval. Like, why you here, are you lost? How do you spot this person? Easy. They'll be down below in
the comments super butt hurt because I called them butt hurt. What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. - Wow. Everyone? Okay, what if I don't wanna
be defined as a someone? What if I wanna be neutral? - Get ready to relate to
Types of Teachers at School. - Not everyone can afford
education, okay, this is so non-inclusive. Did she just say don't have a cow? That's animal cruelty. (gags) I'm gonna be sick. I know this is comedy
but I'm offended by all of these jokes. What a waste of food! Saying eff is still swearing
and I am so offended. She didn't even talk
about what's happening in my specific community. She only talked about mental
health, empowering girls, and encouraging me to love myself. She's such a selfish sellout. I feel personally attacked by this sketch about complete strangers. - I mean of course there's
also a gang of funny, smart, supportive, intelligent people
who watch YouTube but none of that would've been funny
so let's just ignore that. But yo, hold on I have to tell
you something so important. It's crucial. Especially you playlist
pervs, you're gonna wanna listen to this. In just four days, one, two,
three, four, I am starting my worldwide tour across the
planet for How to Be a Bawse. Tickets are on sale right
now, LillySinghBook.com/tour. If you live in North America
or the UK your ticket includes a book and a meet and greet. If you're in a more
international territory go to the website, find out the details
'cause there's VIP meet and greet tickets and all that jazz. The venues are much
smaller than my last tour. There's less tickets in general. LillySinghBook.com/tour is
where you can go because I am leaving for tour. I'm literally going almost everywhere. Most place, not everywhere,
most places, whatever. Don't be offended. (slams) (chimes twinkling)
(pops) Hey I hope you liked that video. If you did, yo, for real
give it a thumbs up. For real because I have to
wear this stupid god damn mic to get the sound right. Hopefully, I don't
know, could be effed up. If you liked it give it a thumbs up. Comment below, check

(shimmering sound and horse whinnying) - Okay mom, I'll see you next week. - Oi, Lily. What happened to your neck, huh? (ominous music) - [Lilly Voiceover] Uh, say you fell. No, wait, but then she'll say- - How'd you fall on your neck? - [Lilly Voiceover] Exactly, you moron. Say it's a rash. Actually, no, wait. 'Cause then she'll say. - Hmm, okay. Let's go to doctor. - [Lilly Voiceover] And
you won't be able to lie to the doctor. He went to school and stuff. - Hello, Lilly. I said what happened to your neck, huh? - [Lilly Voiceover] Quick,
hurry, think of something. Okay, uh, you got shot. Uh, it's a new tattoo. You're an aspiring dalmatian. - Uh, I burnt myself with the curler. - Okay. Be careful next time. - Okay. Uh, I want, like, four bowls of edamame. I'm so hungry. - Is that a hickey? - Did you hook up with Bryan again? - No, I, uh, I burnt
myself with the curler. - Oh, that's the worst. - Yeah, hate when that happens. (cell phone ringing) - [Lilly] Right? So painful, the worst. Okay, before you ask, I burnt
myself with a curler, okay? - [Friend] What happened to your chest? - Oh, I dropped the curler and I burnt myself. On my boobs. - [Friend] Ouch. (phones ringing and office chatter) - Is that lingerie in your bag? - Oh, no. You know what happened? I, um, burnt myself with a curler and then I used lace to wrap my hand. - Ugh, that's so annoying. - Oh, it's terrible. (slurping) (sighing) I keep waking up sick every
morning and throwing up. I have no idea why. I mean, three weeks ago, I did burn myself with a curler, but... Hello? Hi, yeah, I'm not gonna be able
to make it into work today. Yeah, I burnt myself with a curler. It's been really painful ever since. (sizzling) Mother Fu- (booming bass) (playful music) - Is that a hickey? - Did you (beep) Bryan again? (laughing) - This is 14, take- This is Scene 4, Take 1. - You're drunk, go home. Mother Fucker! - End, take 1. (snap) (beep) - You thought for a
second you hit me, right? (laughing) Taylor's heart was like I'm an actor. An actor. I'm sorry this videos so short. You know what had happened
was, I had burnt myself with a curler. (laughing) If you liked this video,
if you can relate to it, give it a big thumbs up. Check out my last video right over there. Second vlog channel right over there. Make sure you check that out. Make sure you subscribe, yo, 'cause I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday. One love Superwoman. That is a wrap. And zoop. Straight up, for everything, "burnt myself with a curler." 
♫ Where in the world is Superwoman today Malaysia, and I actually just
landed after an 11 hour flight so bear with your girl. (unicorn hoof beats) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman, and I've been on a lot
of flights during my tour which means I've watched a lot
of movies on these flights, especially romantic comedies. Why? Because I love to rub
salt in my single wounds. Well, whatever salt is leftover
after my tequila shots. (sighs) And every time I watch romantic comedies, I find myself asking
the exact same question every single time. And that is, where do these
people exist in real life? These movies set unrealistic expectations and to be honest, it's f-ing me right up in the following ways. Number one, apologies. So I was watching a movie
the other day and this dude says something so whack to his wife, but she doesn't vocalize that she's upset. You know what I mean? Like she doesn't let him know, one of those like if you don't know I'm not going to tell you type situations. But as an audience member
you know she's pissed. So she comes home from work
later on and I'm just like yes, damn Gina, this about to be lit. You'se about to get whupped. I'm there waiting for the
drams and then all of a sudden he's like, gives her a
hug and kiss and is like babe I'm so sorry about
the comment I made earlier, and nails exactly why she's upset. And I'm sitting there like... Is this a movie or a spiritual awakening? No is this a sermon from church like is someone about to walk
for the first god damn time? What is this miracle upon us? Furthermore how did you
get him that whipped? Dare I say what is this miracle whip? Like yo you sure your
boyfriend ain't Miss Cleo. Like was your first date
a free tarot reading? Like girl what is going on, because I cannot think of even one time in the history of my life, where a boy apologized to me for something without me telling him
exactly why I'm upset. Because that's not possible,
okay, these types of humans do not exist unless you
want me to go speed dating at f-ing Hogwarts, that's not an option. If I ever had a guy
apologize to me so accurately without me telling him
through a game of mother f-ing Pictionary exactly what was
wrong, I would just be like, take me. (laughing) Not to mention the ease of
the apology in these movies, just like, I'm sorry. Oh babe that's okay. I love you. I love you too. Boom sex scene. In my life thus far it's gone like this. Okay fine I'm sorry. No F you I'm still mad. I said I was sorry. Sorry is just a word. You on a 90 day probation. And you're out here showing
me effective communication and high functioning adults
like that ish is attainable? Stop selling me lies, okay. Ain't nobody parents got along that good when they were growing up
to have that type of example and do that. Telling me all types of trash. Hi yeah, is my therapist free at two? Number two, grand gestures. In romantic comedies,
people, especially guys, are willing to do these
grand life changing gestures for the sake of their relationship, like I'ma quit my job for you. Move across the world for
you in a heartbeat, right? Give up something really important to me. And this happens 45
minutes into the movie, so once again I must ask, how? I once had a boyfriend for two years okay, and this mother f-er
would not even share his two can dine for 9.99
McDonald's coupon with me and that ish is for two people. He just walk into the place like, "Uh yeah I'm going to
take two Big Mac combos, "and then whatever she wants. "What's that? "Yes we're paying separately." (laughing) The speed of commitment in these movies. I get you're trying to tell a
story in a condensed format, but y'all are moving in after two weeks. Two weeks! Okay it took me 10 months
to give my boyfriend my Netflix password. Just like, hmm, I don't know
if this is worth my 14.99 subscription yet. I just don't want to rush into things. No, no like I love you. I love you. I just, I'm really particular about the continue watching section. I don't know if I'm willing
to sacrifice that yet, so. (laughs) The mother f-ing accuracy though. Number three, family first impressions. In romantic comedies, your
partner confidently shows up the first time they got
to meet your parents just looking on point. They brought a gift. They're responding so boldly. They are the bomb dot com. In real life, though,
when people meet parents for the first time, okay,
they're sweating buckets and saying all the wrong things. I once introduced my
boyfriend to my parents who I obviously lied about
and said he was just a friend and you know what he said to them? He said, "Oh yes, I drink occasionally." Occasionally? We were 15 years old. What the F you mean
you drink occasionally. When you're 15 and you're
meeting my parents you say yo I drink apple juice from a juice box while freaking catching
Pokemon in Pokemon Snap with my velcro shoes that light up. Are you dumb? Are you dumb? Are you dumb? Are you dumb? Are you dumb? And I've had other boyfriends
that are so nervous when they meet my parents that they don't even say a thing. They're completely silent, and I'm just like surprise Mom and Dad. He's actually a god damn mime. Yeah we communicate in sign language. It's real special. We actually met in the club. I thought he was just
whipping and nae nae-ing but apparently he was asking me out. And I think God every day
that I understood his whip. You could even say it was a... Number four, adulting. Have you ever noticed in romantic comedies that people are super independent at the tender age of like 24. You see 23 and 24 year olds
looking like grown adults, okay just wearing fitted
suits with their life together in CEO type positions. And you see these people and you're like, am I doing life wrong? Because in real life 24 year olds don't know what the F they're doing. Okay, 24 year olds are still
puking after a night out because they haven't figured
out their tolerance yet. 24 year olds are still like,
yo what am I supposed to do with this degree? In real life 24 year olds
are still saying things like, when I grow up I want to be. and then I watch these movies and these people got
their lives all sorted out in just a mere 90 minutes and I'm like, girl I'm
28 and I'm still like when the hell am I getting my period? I'm out here writing Instagram
captions asking my friend how to spell the word schedule still. I'm out here sitting on
the floor next to an outlet because my phone is dead, okay. My life is in shambles. I'm clueless. I have not a single clue. I'm standing here like
okay yeah I think the maid murdered her in the living
room with the wrench. And everyone else is like,
uh we're playing Monopoly. Number five, the sexual intercourse. In romantic comedies
everyone is so confident when it comes to sexual intercourse. I get it you're hot actors. You have the benefit of
like angles and lighting and post production, but even still, y'all are always ready. No prep needed. Like you're telling me, character
A, that you just had this random hookup with a guy and your bra and panties are matching and all your ish is smooth and exfoliated? Girl if I had a date on Tuesday, my calendar would be blocked
from Friday to Monday in preparation. I'm out here on the weekend
Googling body scrubs, filling my bathtub with
honey and grapefruit. And then there's you in this movie. Just finished a long day at
work, probably worked overtime. Bumped into someone, decided
to get jiggy with it. DIdn't even feel the
need to use a wet wipe and you look like that naked? Spare my self-esteem,
please, Mila Kunis okay? Because I'm the type of
homey that's gonna shave and lotion half of her legs
if she's wearing capris. Why? Because I'm out here trying to survive. (laughs) JK, I ain't surviving. I'm out here conquering like a Bawse. This seems like a good segue. That's right I have two more stops left on my Bawse book tour here
in Malaysia on the 23rd is one of them. You can still get tickets
at lillysinghbook.com/tour. My last stop on the 24th is in Singapore and you can get tickets at the same place. Last two stops. Thank you so much for
the support thus far. I just burped, tried to cover it up. But yo come to my tour if
you want to come to my tour. That's all I gotta say. Let's go to the end card. I just shot this video
after 11 hours on a flight. I hope it made you laugh. If it did please give me a thumbs up because that would just make my day. You can check out my
last video over there. Vlogs from on tour are right over there. Make sure you subscribe
because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday
from somewhere in the world. One love Superwoman. That is a wrap and zoop! 
- Your horoscope for the next few minutes, "You will laugh tremendously, "and then click Subscribe." (unicorn neighing) What up, everyone, it's
your girl, Superwoman, and the other day, I was
having a conversation with my friend and they
hit me with the question. - I don't know, anyways, it
threw me off a little bit, but I try not to take it personally. You know, life goes on. - Wait, what's your zodiac sign? - (groans) Rolling my eyes so hard. All my eyes are rolling, my username is no longer IISuperwomanII, okay, it's !!Superwoman!!, why? Whenever I hear this question, I already know how the rest
of the convo's gonna go because it never just
stops at one question. (clears throat) I'm a Libra. - Makes sense. What time were you born? - I'm not really sure. - Like, was it morning or night? - I don't know, night, I think. - Totally, I see that. What's your moon sign? - My what? Am I the crazy person? Like, do normal people
know their moon sign, they just know it, like, should I be embarrassed
because, straight up, I don't know nothing, okay, I'm the type of person that's filling out an application form and I
still gotta call my mom, like, "Yo mom, do I have a
social security number? "And if so, what is it?" And you expect me to know my moon sign? Like, what are you expecting me to say? - Your moon sign? - Oh, my moon sign? (laughs) ♪ Sailor Venus ♪ ♪ Sailor Mercury ♪ ♪ Sailor Mars ♪ ♪ Sailor Jupiter ♪ ♪ With secret powers, all so new to her ♪ ♪ She is the one named Sailor Moon ♪ Here's the thing though, right, I'm not trying to hate
on people's beliefs, like, I believe that Oompa
Loompas actually exist, I ain't judging, but I
just think it's important to recognize that
horoscopes are very vague and it's easy to just apply them to whatever is happening in your life. Dude, you don't actually
believe in horoscopes, do you? Like, you know they're
just placebo, right? - It's not, trust me. Look, watch, read me my horoscope. I'm a Cancer. - Okay. (clears throat) Okay, Cancer. "Older relatives have some romantic advice "over the weekend", okay,
"so do them the courtesy "of listening to their stories." Sounds like every weekend
with an Indian family. - Oh my God, no, that totally happened to me this weekend, with my grandma. - You can't give 50% in a relationship. - What, you can't? Dammit. Also, wait. Oh my God, that was actually the horoscope for Leo, not Cancer. - Oh, yeah, no, that makes sense. I just remembered that wasn't my grandma and it wasn't about relationships. - I can give you 50% because it's damaged. - To be fair, that's what I
said in my last relationship. Not to mention that some
horoscopes aren't even predictions, or, like, things to pay attention to. They're just sentences, they're just like, "Oh, Sagittarius, things may
be larger than they seem." Like, oh my God, really,
larger than they-- My side mirror of my car
figured that out years ago. Or, your horoscope just
predicts super common things that happen every single day. Okay, Cancer. "You're in a hurry to take things "to the next level when you meet someone "you really like over the weekend." - (gasps) Oh my God, pizza guy. - What guy?
- I met a guy that works at this delivery
place over the weekend. - Like, you mean in a bar? - No, at my house. Like, he delivered my pizza, but there was something special there. Wait, read yours. - Okay, I don't know if I can compete with the romance of the pizza
guy, but... (clears throat) Okay, Libra. "Today, you will go beyond limits." Wow, deep. Yeah, apparently my zodiac sign is Tumblr. And, yo, straight up, I'm pretty good at being open-minded. I feel like you can believe in whatever you wanna believe in, as long as it doesn't personally affect me or the well-being of other people. Here's the thing, though, okay, people who believe in horoscopes, they start saying things like this. - Sorry, I'm kinda
feeling under the weather. Mercury's in retrograde, you know? I'll be right back. - Wait, what about Gatorade? Oh, okay, so Mercury
is a valid excuse now, right, for why you're not, oh, it's not the 10 shots I saw you take at the bar last night. Yeah, it's Mercury. Like, can you imagine being able to use the solar system as a valid excuse? (police siren blares) I'm so sorry, officer, I didn't realize how fast I was going because one of Saturn's rings is tilted. Babe, babe, listen to me, I only cheated on you
because Pluto got kicked out. Okay, well I didn't refill
the milk because I was lazy. Wait, what's the joke again? And whenever you talk to people
that believe in horoscopes, they believe, they truly believe they know exactly how you are and why, based on where the planets
were when you were born. And they say things like, "Oh my God, "you're such a Scorpio," and I'm like, "No, I'm just bold and
have a lot of opinions." "Yeah, because you're a Scorpio." "Uh, no, not because I'm a Scorpio, "because F the patriarchy." They also have all these ideas about who's gonna get along with who. - All of my friends are Virgos and Libras, so we're gonna get along great. - Yay me. - And all of my exes are Scorpios. - Oh, really? All of my exes are snakes. - That's not a zodiac sign. - I know. - Lilly, this stuff is real. Look, when you were born, the-- - [Man] Kelly, is that you? - Oh my God, hi Zack. - Hi, Zack. Who's Zack?
- It's the delivery guy. - Extra large cheese pizza with mushrooms and garlic dipping sauce. - You are kidding me. - I know this is moving a little fast, but do you wanna hang out later? - Yeah, I'd love that. - You know how to reach me. - Yeah, Postmates. Okay, see you later. See? Horoscopes are totally real. - Okay, you cannot be serious, that was just some freak, weird coincidence--
(cell phone dings) One second. So, how do I figure out my moon sign? What, okay listen, I just
like to know all the facts before I make a decision
to believe something, okay? I'm such a Libra. So, how do I figure out my moon sign? - [Kelly] I am so glad you asked. Okay, first you align your chakras 'cause you just wanna be in,
like, a good place, you know? - Oh my God, so first, you sacrifice a goat. - Right, yeah.
- Okay. - [Kelly] And then, you tie
it up, and then untie it. - I think the key is you have
to have a lot of crystals. - [Kelly] Yeah, you just
surround yourself with crystals, and then you just feel
the answer, you know? (laughing) Read me my horoscope. I'm a Cancer. - Well, my mom is FaceTiming
right now, so I can't. Hi mom, we're shooting a video. Now you're in it, say hi. - [Mom] You're always busy. - I know, I know, you should be so proud. Babe, I only cheated on you
because Pluto got kicked out, and also, if you just bought me more merch from LillySingh.com, we
wouldn't be having this fight. (laughing) I'm so sorry, officer, can you let me off with a warning? - [Officer] Yes. - Don't come for me if
you believe in zodi, don't voodoo me, okay? If you believe in zodiac signs, comment below, letting me
know if you do or don't, and what your sign is. You can check out my last
video right over there, the second vlog channel's right there, and make sure you subscribe because I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday. One love, Superwoman,
that is a wrap, and zoop. 
- You know, when something
horrible happens in the world, you'll see the rise of
two types of people. Number one, people who
don't let fear divide them and instead choose to come together. And number two, racist
idiots who don't deserve an internet connection. Here's the thing, right, I just don't like when people are bad at things. If you're gonna be racist,
at least do it right. Now look at this comment
on my YouTube video. Go back to your country,
you terrorist Paki, Afghan, Indian, Muslim slut. Hashtag Make Americ Great Again. Now I don't mean to discourage Merrick. He seems like a great guy. But your stupidity bothers me. First and foremost, let's
make education great again. In fact. (upbeat piano music) Hello, and welcome. We'll begin by taking attendance. Are you here? Of course you are. YouTube comments are
how you feel validated. Today, we're going to be
taking a trip around the world, so you'll need to pack. It's probably been years
since you've had the chance to use your passport,
just like your penis. But don't worry, this time, you'll actually take off. To go back to my foreign
country, we'll need to fly a long 45 minutes all
the way back to Canada. But I'm assuming you thought
my country was somewhere else, so let's fly across the
world to the country of Paki Afghan India. India is all the way over
here, across the ocean, so unfortunately, you won't be able to drive your trailer there. Oh covfefe. Once you board your flight, settle in, it's going to be a long journey. But that's okay, you can take a good rest. It must be so exhausting to walk right through airport security. The aircraft you're flying will
probably be a double decker, which means it'll have about
300 to 400 people onboard, which is approximately
the same amount of people at Trump's inauguration. JK, that's an alternative fact, but you're probably used to those from watching so much Fox News. Please note that we're not gonna fly through the Bermuda
Triangle, because things mysteriously disappear there. In fact, that's probably
where your education went. We're going to fly across
the Atlantic Ocean, around Africa and through this passageway that's very narrow, just like your mind. You may recognize some of these countries we're flying over as
places immigrants come from to steal your jobs. Or just the same countries
you steal oil from. Once we reach our destination,
you'll notice that India, Pakistan and Afghanistan are actually three separate countries, you silly American Aussie Brit. When you land and are
going through customs and they ask for your occupation, make sure you say
trashcan, and when they ask your date of birth, be
sure to say 3000 BC. You effin caveman. You'll notice right away
that India is full of beautiful sites and
culture, and I know what you're thinking, it
probably smells like curry. And you know what, you're right. And it's delicious. And although there are
approximately 175 million Muslims in India, there are
approximately two billion in the whole world, which
means if every Muslim was a terrorist, you wouldn't
stand a goddam chance. Good thing they're not. Now that we're here, the good news is your wife can save all that money she spends at tanning salons trying to look closer to my complexion. Quick travel tip, if
you're going to India, they don't kill cows
there, so there's no beef. But don't worry, because
if you kill anything, it'll be considered mental illness. So you're good. I hope you've enjoyed this trip to where you think I'm from. And I promise, if I ever meet a genie, all three of my wishes will
be for you to get an atlas. To be honest, whether I
went back to my country of Pakistan, India or even Canada, I don't see how that would benefit you since my tax bracket helps
pay for your kid's education. You're welcome, Timothy. Hello, I hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, give it a big thumb's up. If you believe that we
should come together in times of need and
not let fear divide us, give it a big thumb's up. My last video's over there. My second blog channel's right over there, and make sure you subscribe. Because I make videos

- Sports. (high-pitched chiming)
(rhythmic clopping) (rapid swooshing) What up, everyone? It's your girl, Superwoman. And I'm by no means a sports expert, but I do know that the NBA
play-ons are happening right now. Raptors for life. Also, just kidding, they're not in finals. But that's okay, because you know why? Shut up. 'Kay, hold up though. Real talk, when watching sports I can't be the only one that notices how dumb sports interviews are. It's halftime, tensions are high. Everyone is sitting on
the edge of their seat, and they do that thing where they start interviewing the players. So you're like okay, let me
hang onto your every word. Please drop some wisdom. And then, every player literally
turns into Captain Obvious and says nothing of value. So what are your thoughts during halftime? Well, you know, we got halfway more to go, we got 50% more, and we gon'
finish off the second half. You know, there's two more quarters, and we gon' get it done. Fractions. Uh huh, uh huh. Oh damn, yo, he right, he right. You know, that's mad deep. Okay, literally he's just saying words. Also, what do you think
your team needs to focus on in the second half? Oh, you know, I think as
long as we get the ball, and, you know, we put
the ball in the basket, we're good, you know. Okay, and what's your strategy for the second half of this game? Well, you know, I think as long as we don't let the other team get more points than
us, then we'll be good. You know, so I think it's
about defense and offense, and basketball. Bars! Yo, play that back. (speech played backwards) Defense and offense, and basketball. Damn. Yo, that's why he's the best, man. He knows the game, eh? He literally said nothing. And it's not just basketball. It's almost every sport. If you actually pay attention
and listen to the interviews, they're hilarious and meaningless. So, what are your thoughts
going into this game, you know? You know, ball. Take the ball and kick it inside the net. You got to play, play hard. And, ball. Ball. So why do you think you won this game? Well, you know, we hit the ball, and made the runs, got the points, and at the end of the day
we just got more points than our opponent, so we won the game. Just like that. Yo, hold on, hold on, pause it, pause it. I wanna take notes. Fire. And then that got me thinking, what if people in every
occupation communicated like this? AKA, communicated nothing useful. Listen, I think you'll feel a lot better if you just stopped being sick. Uh, huh. Yeah, you should see a
doctor, get some medicine, and then just be healthy, you know? Take of yourself. Okay, got it, thank you so much. Alright, yeah, you can
pay at the front, thanks. Okay, thank you. Hi, yeah, sorry, excuse me. My roof has a hole in
it because of the rain. How can I fix it? I think as long as you fix the roof the rain won't get in, you know? Okay. The most important thing
is to fix the hole, and have a strong roof. Oh, okay, understood. That would be the first step. Awesome, thank you so
much, really, so helpful. Hey, if they ask who help you
tell them Julio from flooring. Of course, definitely. I get commission. (singing "Despacito" by Justin Bieber) Ugh, I can't get these
lyrics, can you help me? Yeah, for sure. (singing) Despacito, blah
blah blah blah blah blah. (singing) blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah. (singing) blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah (claps) blah blah blah. Like, it makes no sense. But that's okay, because
you know the athletes have other amazing abilities, you know. I get it, not everyone
can be a great speaker, and take great shots like me. (snorts) I wasn't talking 'bout that. I was talking 'bout this. What? Don't judge me, it's Saturday. - [Male Voice] It's Monday. - What? (boom)

Already giving you reasons to hit that thumbs up though! What up, everyone, it's your girl Superwoman, and being a YouTuber is hard, here's why:Number One- video ideas Do you know how hard it is to think of so many video ideas so consistently? Especially when you have over a thousand videos and you overthink everything today's video idea Today's vid idea vid video Film today's today's fil- film project Is about Is in regards to - vid? Video-vid? vid...   Video -vid. (snaps fingers) Mm. Movie ( hardcore music plays as Lily types and suffers) WHY Let's do.. types of people in the shower.  ( Lily looks at person with with a look of great  disgust and "Are you okay? mixed in) (Rhythmic eye-twitching) Why don't you do types of people grocery shopping? ( How stupid is this person?) Lily suffers. She suffers!   And honestly even if I try to follow trends to get views like a smart person, I just can't get myself to do it. Hey you this is their diss track, and I am so relevant- nope. Hey today, we're gonna make a galaxy fidget spinner-slime at - nope   Shirt damn it. Okay tomorrow my boyfriend is gonna pick out a new outfit for me- no Number Two- Algorithms number two algorithms dear YouTube you change of mind Like a girl Changes clothes. And when I say girl, I mean other girls. Not me. I thought girls would actually change their clothes regularly. I'm a bad example same bra every day for life. No for real though I'm not gonna have a good job. Where the rules of who sees your videos AKA. How you get views okay? How you get paid change all the time ?And here's the kicker. It's all one big secret! No one tells us, so we don't know. We're just making crap up. This is live footage of every single youtuber at least once a year.   So team, my views have been pretty inconsistent recently. Any ideas? Oh, the YouTube algorithm changed. Blonde Haired Teammate: Yeah, videos nine minutes or longer are more favorable now. Okay, so make my videos longer. Mustached Fellow: Oh wait. No, never mind. Just changed to 14 minutes. Oh wait, wait. It says the algorithm changed Mustached Fellow: Oh wait. No, never mind. Just changed to 14 minutes. Blond Haired Teammate:  Oh wait, wait. It  says the algorithm changed. Okay Blonde Haired Teammate: It only favours new creators now. Mustached Fellow: And essentially the best practice is enticing titles in all capitals. Mhm ,mhm. Oh,never mind. It says they just did a survey, audiences now want a thing: take titles and thumbnails and tell people to hit the bell ! Why?  Blond Haired Teammate: They get notified. no they don't mmm Here's the latest update viewers might get notified if they hit the bell and Venus and Saturn are aligned also Let's talk about titles because the algorithm just changed and a lot of words are banned Well my next videos types of diets, so that's fine. Hey, you know. I'm not sure about the word diet What's wrong with the diet diet? die T die It's basically death it's murder. Are you serious right now? Okay? What about? What types of food consumption? Hmm, I don't like the qanun consumption. You know it's just not a pro. It is super negative. Yeah, also the algorithm Just changed and now we need to start pushing Playlists in to videos. Yeah, it says here that for every playlist clicked on the playlist committee gives you bonus algorithm points Okay, what about video tags? Can we improve those? No those don't matter. Oh never mind They just changed the algorithm now. Tags are the only way people see your videos Yes, but only in the first 24 hours and only the first 10 tags also the algorithm Just changed now for minute videos are the best let's just trial and error all the ways we might be able to eat dinner today job security number 3 FTC aka what the eff I know FTC ok trade what is it? No that doesn't the federal? Trade committee ello Federal Trade Commission, that's how acronyms work with me ok something You might not even know exists But basically anytime a youtuber or actually anyone is a brand deal online you might notice that they usually say hashtag AB Yeah That's not because they want to is because they legally have to what do you mean all those people aren't genuinely that? Passionate about those Nature Valley granola bars. Yeah, and let me just preface this which I completely Understand I think is very important for people to disclose when they're getting paid to advertise something consumers should be Protected I get it but when your creative person FTC regulations straight-up murder your Vision you could have a super adult video concept and be like yeah sure I will say this is an ad is that enough new Name new new new new new you'll need to put legal language in the first 10 seconds of the video verbally and in text an X amount of times every X amount of minutes whatever when it's a girl Advertisement, this is an ad hash tag of this company is my partner. This is a sponsored video spawn Hash tags bond hash tag partner. Hash tag partnership tag relationship. Hash like tinder to be clear I had received a large sum of money to communicate these specific talking points, which I will say very authentically hash tag Experiments, here's why I'm complaining ok because I think it's a little unfair to be honest. There's many other traditional Celebrities that endorse things in different ways and they don't have to disclose it as much for example. What's that song call again? Oh yes Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman these boys up to something or was it jump, man Hash tag egg jump man hashtag spawn jump man this a branded song Cayden number for adsense waves normal people season summer winter spring fall Youtuber seasons summer break Christmas holidays back-to-school youtubers get paid to ads and ad agencies spend different amounts of money throughout the year That in combination with if my audiences in school or not it came they got free time to watch my ducky self or they don't Really impacts how much I mimic and typically there's two types of waves number one December To January her team wasn't up this month. There's only two meals a day okay lunch and water break We least turn on the heat the heat What do you think this is back-to-school season it's January no Everybody knows in December Christmas shopping season ad senses popping and everybody knows in January when everyone's like I can't spend no more money on nothing ad agencies are like And I only go to meetings so I can get a free lunch I am oh What's that you thought that your favorite youtubers did so many videos during December because they just weren't again the Christmas spirit Ha I'm even Christian Get ready for 12 collabs Number 5 comments now that we all know the internet is full of racist sexist um bag that say mean things This is not new information I think what a lot of people don't think about it that Creators put a lot of time and energy into these videos I mean some of them most of them a percentage do and sometimes when I'm really proud of a video I made. I want to share some really insightful feedback I Am so happy with our last video. Honestly. I think it's creative. It's timely. It's well executed. What are the comments it? Notification Squad, okay scroll down do they mention anything about the dark color palette or anything like that, huh? Please react to BTS anyone from the BTS army here. Don't read my user name. Don't look at my profile picture Don't you hate when people beg for likes like if you agree here before a million views today is my birthday? Early squad twelve likes and two thousand views YouTube is broken you copied Shane Dawson stop trying to be jenna Marbles nice Pimple she's hot why does she talk like that I bang her please check out my channel I post comedy videos. She has nice boobs even though I appreciate that you think my boobs are nice sometimes I want to hear about my actual art first You know but don't get a twisted the second thing you come and should definitely be about my boobs It makes me feel great right. They are pretty awesome mary-kate and Ashley so full They didn't even need to be in the reboot fuller house. Hey What's this viewable oh right sorry? I hope you enjoyed my parents reacting to BTS Real Talk though yes, I mentioned some struggles of being a creator, but I gotta say that there's so many more positives I love love love my job And I just want to take a moment to say the best one my job is you I'm in this little speech I'm not even tell you to subscribe and I can tell you thumbs up There's no call to action in this segment genuinely me just saying you take time out of your day to come to my channel to watch my videos to interact leave comments if You do and I really really appreciate that because I know there's so many other things you can watch online There's so many other videos and the fact that you give me some time in your day really really does mean a lot and it Does give me this wonderful job? so thank you so much for watching my videos and now you can go to the end card in which I go promote things but I did right now, but now I will Like this video if you did you have to let me know by clicking the thumbs up It's free, and if you don't do it I'm I supposed to know I need validation, but watch my last video does a collab with RCL Beauty It's right over there my second daily vlog channel is right over there So check that out and make sure you subscribe because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday I want you to be here; sending you lots of hugs and kisses. One Love Superwoman, that is a wrap and zoop! 
- You can help change the world
just by watching this video. This is not clickbait, it is a fact. (galloping) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. And in case you don't know,
my real name is Lilly Singh, and today is my birthday. Thank you so much for all this wishes. I really, really appreciate it. But this video is not about me. 365 days ago, I did a campaign
selling rafiki bracelets. Don't know what I'm talking about? Don't stress, I got you. This is what we accomplished together. (singing in foreign language) - I am Superwoman. (singing in foreign language) - I am Superwoman. (singing in foreign language) - Lilly, we miss you so much. - And we wanted to say thank you. (singing in foreign language) - Thank you for helping
me get an education. - Thank you for believing in my dreams. (singing in foreign language) - Thanks to you, I can become a doctor. - An engineer. - A neurosurgeon. (singing in foreign language) - [All] I am Superwoman. (singing in foreign language) This year, for my birthday, I so excited to announce
GirlLove rafikis v2.0 in partnership with WE Charity. Now hold on, hold on,
hold on, don't click away, I know what you're thinking. You've probably heard stuff
like this so many times. And I could make a really long video telling you a million reasons why I'm doing this campaign again. And I could give you
a million more reasons why you should support it, but I'm not gonna to do that. I'm gonna make this short,
simple, and to the point. These are straight facts. Each one of these rafikis is
hand-made by a mother in Kenya. I have met these mothers and
made these rafikis with them. Number two. The sale of each rafiki helps
girls in Kenya go to school. It goes towards school supplies,
uniforms, and school fees. I've met these girls, and
I've been to their school. Number three. I just came back from
Kenya a few weeks ago, and I designed this new rafiki myself. I picked the color, which is gold, these cute little square beads, it still has a GirlLove pendant on it. It's slightly longer than
last year's rafiki, why? Because I wanna make sure our
brothers can also sport it and spread some GirlLove. Number four. This year, in addition to the rafiki, there's also a combo you can buy with a really cute GirlLove pin, because you know I love a cute pin. Number five. Last year we shipped to just 43 countries. This year, we are
shipping to 223 countries across the world. And, shipping prices have
been reduced from 25-75% because I know all you
international homies wanna support your girl. And not just your girl, but all the girls. Life hack. You and your friends can buy
in bulk and pay shipment once, if you live in the same place. Number six. The more educated girls
are around the world, the better the world becomes. And I need to emphasize, this is not some fairy
tale or my biased opinion, this is a fact. Higher education for girls
means less teen pregnancies, and less child marriages. Not to mention that educated women are less likely to get
diseases like HIV and AIDS. And the list goes on and on and on and on, but at a very basic
level I guess you could just frame it as hey, doesn't every girl deserve the opportunity to be the best version of herself? Number seven. You can wear the rafiki like a bracelet, like a necklace, like an anklet, or like this cool thing. I just did it right here. (chuckles) You can get this new rafiki
right now at girllove.com, and this specific campaign
starts now, today, and goes until October 11th,
which is Day of the Girl. My goal is to send even more
girls to school than last year, sell even more rafikis, and
impact even more stories. That's literally all I
want for my birthday. Like, we are so privileged. I don't need anything else besides knowing we, together, did something to give a girl the chance to go to school. What better thing could
I possibly ask for? If you were gonna do
anything for my birthday, or forget my birthday,
just because we should. If you personally can't
afford a rafiki, I get it. But you know what you could do? Share this video, spread this message, because maybe someone on
your timeline or on your feed will watch it and maybe
they can buy a rafiki. So please, please spread the message. Let people know about the rafiki. I've been there, I've
seen with my own eyes and it does make a difference. And by saying humanity is the
most important team we're on and we're in this together. So please, support my new GirlLove rafiki, and help me spread some GirlLove. 'Til next time, one love Superwoman. That is a wrap, and zoop. (upbeat music) 
- There's a unicorn on my pocket. What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. The other day I was talking
to my friend about dating, and she's all like, "My
parents love my boyfriend. Did your parents ever get really close to any of your boyfriends?" And I'm just like, "Hoe, you crazy?" And then I had to explain to her that my Indian parents simply do not understand the concept of dating. This is a real thing, I
am not making this up. My parents had an arranged marriage, which means that they never dated. So in their eyes, the process of dating is absolutely unnecessary. Even though they don't expect me to get an arranged marriage,
they still don't understand the necessity of getting to know someone. AKA, all Indian kids know
that you can never, ever introduce your parents
to someone you're dating, unless you trying to marry that person. Ain't no room for error up in here, it's a calculated measurement. But yo, this one time, my mom got bright, and she asked me about a boy. (seatbelt clicks) - So I have feeling something going on between you and that boy. - My mom is smart eh,
like "Yo let me get Lilly in the car where she can't escape and then bust out these accusations." When parents really wanna whoop you, they'll bring up stuff in the car. Heaven forbid my parents
ever get a self-driving car. They could beat me with both hands and still get us home
safe enough to ground me. But yo I still had options. - [Lilly Voiceover] Okay,
just tell the truth. Actually no, are you dumb? Lie about it! Or, or, could pretend
to have a heart attack. That could work. No stop, you're not a kid anymore. Handle it like an adult. (ding) - Well actually (groans) I mean (groans) I think I'm having a heart attack, mom! (screams in pain) (heart monitor beeping) (sighs) Am I dead? - Depends. Are you dating that boy? (heart monitor beeps faster) So I had no choice, I had
to tell her the truth, like "Yes mom, I'm in my mid-twenties and I'm dating someone, sue me," and literally her next sentence was - So d'you talk about marriage, huh? When we meeting parents? - Mom, it's been two months even I haven't met his parents. - Huh? In two months I meet your daddy, get married and get pregnant
with your sister, okay? - Yeah well, I'm still
getting to know him. - What you mean, getting to know him? What did you have to know, huh? Do you like him or do you not like him? - I'm still figuring it out. - See, that's your bloody problem, okay? Too much bloody freedom. - The only compatibility
test my parents ever had was, This is girl, this is boy, parents agree, okay done! So me trying to explain that
I need to get to know a boy and see if he's
good-hearted and respectful and makes me laugh and
brings out the best in me is absolute and utter trash to my parents. Not to mention that dating someone without the promise of marriage brings shame to your entire
family, duh are you dumb? By who, you ask? Uh, every person that doesn't matter. The neighbors okay, my sixth cousin, the family dentist, because apparently, everyone's got a chart at
home where they monitor peoples' behavior and they're like, Oh, dating without being
engaged, that's right, wore a mini skirt out past 11 pm, oh. - If you not going to get engaged, what people are going to say, huh? - That I'm a smart, independent woman who makes logical choices? - Don't be dumb, okay? I don't want you running
around with every boy. - One, literally one boy. - Every boy you running with, okay? You bloody Usain Bolt. - And once my parents found
out I had a boyfriend, they hopped, skipped and
jumped ahead of themselves. Yeah I'm on my third
date with my boyfriend and they're at the astrologer's just like - So she is a Libra and he is Gemini. Can you tell me most
auspicious date for marriage? - September third. - And this went on for a
while, until we broke up. Which, by the way, that's another thing Indian parents do not understand. - Let me get this straight. First you date him and then you break up? What bloody sense this make, huh? - If you going to break up with him, why'd you bloody date him, huh? - Okay obviously we
didn't plan to break up. We just both agreed we're not compatible. - Compatible? This is your bloody daughter, okay? This is what happen when kids have Google and internet, they running wild! - Nobody's perfect, okay? If you going to break up with everybody - One person. - Then you never going to get married! - You know, kids these days
they want a Disney movie, okay, a knight in shining armor. That's not going to happen,
you going to get a Bobby in a Selleck shirt and dress
up pant doing peoples' taxes. This is real life. - I always laugh when I see
that inspirational quote that's like, Reach for the stars! Because I know an Indian
parent never wrote that and if they did, it
would be something like, It's okay to settle. The worst part about
my parents finding out about my ex-boyfriend was
that any future boyfriend I have will never be taken seriously. So there's a boy. - Again? - A different boy. - How different, huh? You still getting to know him? - Well actually, we're
getting pretty serious. - You say that last
time, then you break up. - Okay well this is different! - I think you like playing
games with my heart. - Mom this is not about you. - Oi, marriage between two families, okay, not just husband and wife. - We're not getting married! - Anyways, what was
this video called again? Why do kids lie, no? Oh, my bad, what? Just kidding, I'm just saying though. If you weren't the crazy, maybe your kids wouldn't do the lying. - Oh, Lilly telling kids to lie. (pen clicks) Oi, call the dentist! Tell him what we find out. - Yo, can you relate to this video? Comment below and let me know, how do your parents react
when you're dating someone? You can check my last
video right over there, make sure you subscribe
because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday and I truly care if you're here or not, so be here. One love, Superwoman. That is a wrap and zoop! 
- Really there are only two types of people in the shower, all right? Those who pee and those who lie about it. (horse whinnies)
(magical twinkling) What up everyone? It's your girl, Superwoman, and I am literally obsessed
with taking showers. Yeah, I take one like, every week. And I've discovered that showers are a really interesting place, you know. Why? M-C-A. Because showers can reveal a lot about a person's personality. Here's the breakdown. Number one, the showstopper. Now obviously some people
sing in the shower, that's not new information. ♫ And I will always love you But you see me, see I don't
just sing in the shower, okay? I turn into a full-fledged performer and I'm not just talking singing. No, I've done all types
of entertainment, okay? I'm in the shower reenacting
my favorite movie clips. (dramatic music) This is Sparta! Imitating my favorite music videos. ♫ One, two, three, one, two, three And most importantly,
pretending the wall is my lover and staring deeply into
it's eyes as I sing to it. Real talk, I actually do that. Is that gross, is that weird? It's clean, right? Right, right? You see, because outside the shower I may be a talent-less psychology graduate that wears only high waisted
jeans and granny panties but inside the shower, oo, I'm like Beyonce and Leonardo
DiCaprio's love child. Oh I am a performer. No, I swear to God. If casting directors took showers with me, I would get all the roles because they would see how good I am. Oh, okay, I guess that could go both ways but okay if it was sexual, obviously I wouldn't get the
role because these rolls. In conclusion, I'm way more
talented in the shower. (sobbing quietly) (groans) Leave me alone! And scene. Number two, the mental breakdowners. Does this look familiar? No, honestly, girl, I'm
in a really good place. Yeah, I love my life. My day was great, I had
an awesome day at work, everything's phenomenal but
I'm gonna take a shower. I'll call you back, okay? I love you, bye! (wailing) Yeah, raise your hand if
you've ever done that. (bell dinging) Now these are the people who take showers to escape reality, okay? Escape their crappy days. They're just standing in the shower, numb, letting the water hit their face and they usually think things like this. I think my life sucks. I hate my job. This day is trash. I'm pretty sure all of
my friends are stupid. This rash is getting worse. Straight up, I've cried in the shower. Why? M-C-A. Obviously because people
in the movies do it and therefore I can see how dramatic and emotional it looks, okay? If I'mma cry, I'mma
Oscar worthy cry, okay? I ain't about no sub-par crying. I have standards, I'm not an animal or, is that a peanut? Number three, the ocean killers. Let's be real, everyone
messes around in the shower but some people take it next level and they're in there for like two hours. Have you ever experienced
someone who takes so long in the shower that
there's that slight moment where you think there's a
chance they might have died. (laughs) You know what I'm, let's be honest, you know those people
when they take so long and you're just like, okay
they're probably fine but still, that image flashes in
your mind at least once where you're like, oh okay,
they're probably dead. They're probably lying
there like a raisin, you know, that scene from the Psycho and I can see their dead body. (stuttering) Am I deranged? Because what the F other
logical explanation is there for taking two
hours in the shower? Not to mention you're wasting water, okay? The ocean is dying, the environment is out
here struggling, fam. You're using so much water, The Little Mermaid's out
here with dry lips, okay? Just like (wheezing) ♫ Under the sea, under the sea Hurry the F up, okay? Before I flush the toilet three times and turn you into the star
of the next Frozen movie. Number four, the wet wasteman. Now it takes a special type
of person to take a place that's designated for cleanliness, that literally has hygienic products in it and turn it into a disgusting mess. Like literally, the shower
is a place with soap and shampoo and clean water, but you somehow turn it into a dumpster. Shampoo bottles knocked
over everywhere, left open. Somehow the soap bar's in
two pieces and on the floor waiting for me to slip and die on it. (loud clunk) And not only is this mess
reserved for inside the shower, no no, it gets much worse as
you exit the shower, okay? You know why? Because towels are optional. Yeah, why use a towel when
you can just dry yourself while doing the effin' Harlem Shake. Like, what's going on? You ever enter the washroom after someone's done taking a shower and you step on the mat
and water just oozes out and you're like, how did this even happen? How did this much water exit the shower? Are your butt cheeks made with sponges? Now washroom floor is a sea. Now if I gotta take a
dump, I gotta call up Moses so he can make a path for
me to get to the toilet. And quite possibly the
most annoying thing about this person is, okay, you
know that little button you've gotta hit so that
the water stops coming from the shower head and instead
comes from the faucet? They don't give a F about that button. That button's never been touched before. So then I enter the shower,
and this little faucet, (imitates spraying water) and water comes blasting on my head. You are a menace to society. You see this hair? That little bit of sprinkle, you know that's gonna take
10 days to dry, God dammit. Number five, the shedder. Shed, shedder, shedder, is
that a real word, shedder? Shed? And this type of person is so annoying, I had to give them their own category and I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking, you're thinking, how can you get annoyed of people who leave hair in the shower when you look like effin'
Samara from The Ring? Well the thing is, if my
hair sheds in the shower, I rinse that ish and
put it down the drain, I don't leave it there for display. I can't even explain to you how gross I feel when I see wet hair in the shower just left there and here's the thing, most people, they don't get it, they're like, what's the problem? If the shower looks like a
chia pet, there's a problem. If I step into the shower
and I get carpet burn, okay there's a problem. If my shower is dirty and I need to call a hairstylist to clean it,
okay there's a problem. If my shower could be considered for the role of Chewbacca,
okay there's a problem. If my shower has a bushier
beard than Humble The Poet, there's a problem. If the shower can donate more hair to charity than I can, there's a problem. And hear me when I say that
if I pick up a bar of soap, and there is a pube attached to it, there's a problem and no, no don't say that thing
where you're like no, it's just a short hair
from my head, I swear. No, no one uses soap on their head, okay? It's a pube and Houston,
we have a problem. Not to mention that hairs
that are stuck to the wall of the shower, you know what
I'm talking about, they're wet, so they're like all
there and they're in this weird design where they're just like, (laughs) this is me imitating
the hair on the shower wall. Like, I hate it all, contain that ish! In conclusion, subscribe. Hi! If you liked that video, there's

(chimes ring)
(unicorn gallops) - Welcome to therapy, Lilly. Tell me, what's on your mind? - Okay. I just feel like sometimes the world is against me, you know? - Why do you say that? - I mean for starters, me and my friends never see eye to eye. I guess, there's a lot of tension there. - What do you disagree on? - Everything. Just the other day, my
friend got mad at me, because I wanted to stay home and watch Black Mirror, instead of going out. Like, I get it's your birthday,
but there's new episodes. - I see. - Yeah, and then, she started to go on this whole rant about every
single thing she's ever done for me, and I personally
think that's petty. Yeah, I don't do that, 'kay? Like, how many times am I gonna have to hear the story about how
she donated me a kidney? I get it. Yeah, I know. What about last week, when her car broke down on the highway? Who did she call? So, who's really the bad friend? - Was she at least grateful
when you went to pick her up? - What? Oh, no. No, no, no, I called
her an Uber from my bed. There's new episodes of Black Mirror. Aren't you writing this down? - Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna show you a series of images. - Porn? - And I want you to tell me what you see. (whimsical orchestral music) - A terrible piece of art by a terrible painter who will likely never make it. It's pretty bad. Kinda looks like my sister, when she got dumped. Huh, that's funny. Wait a minute. That's a picture of me. Yeah, no. No, the legs are a dead giveaway. That, that's me, is that me? - Interesting. - What do you think is wrong with me? Do I have anxiety from
being right all the time? Or maybe I'm depressed because of other people's bad choices. Like, wearing Crocs. A lot of people do that. - No, I think, in my professional opinion, the issue is that you're a bad person. - Hmm? - You're a mean, selfish, arrogant, self-centered person, who needs to work on not being such a terrible human. - Mm-hmm. So, is there like a pill for that, or? (boom) That awkward moment when
you think something's wrong with you, but
really, you're just a jerk. If you like this video,

that is a wrap, and zoop! - Methinks I stole her watch? - Wait, what? - Okay, I don't think, I know.

want to break it down Jesse excuse me friends basically and then they had a little bump in the road and using one - Jesse's house and they basically made a video talking about all the reasons their friendship kind of went through this real fast right and I'm super honest or so the audience things it was super I was okay dope dope dope so I'm nauseous and I was like I would love to have a conversation like this with Yousef because I'm gonna be honest I've known Yusef for how long um first time we met was Santa Monica yes when we did that prank called uh are you shaking the energy G oh yeah I forgot I forgot what it was called whoever pretended to break up yeah broken up in public yeah yeah right and I I have known you for so long and I feel like you've gone through lots of phases in life all the to know all the time and so I feel like I've known use of a uses be used to see and I'm here my goal is to learn the real user who Youssef is I'm not trying to make you uncomfortable I'm not trying to disrespect you I want to know what your growth with a really honestly I love that yeah I really do another here I love it there's no judges I just want to poke holes in your doing no you for you why because I guys down or you don't yeah when you when we were texting about my journey before you asked me to do this and I had said like I wanna you know come over and spend the night here you had said that wasn't the first time I got that text also even before the journey started I you see a text like that oh this is my only chance I have a reason for you to say he started the journey to semtex invade but we had discussed how we want to have an honest heart to heart off the camera so if we're having it here let's do I don't probably have another one off camera as well when I spend the night alright so first question yes for you can you just for people that might not know we're going right right we're gonna get right into it okay I'm out here I might even cancel the rest of my day okay that's how much this means a lot of girls have done that for me before so I'm gonna want to leave the SAS for later on I'm going to live yeah I'm being honest I feel whatever I don't know that's a I'm sure you're around lots of people who validate you very coolly so don't worry okay I'm not one of those people so what's gonna happen I want you to tell me about your journey feel that don't know o Guardians watching you're on this very special dream can you give us a brief kind of summary of what okay um I've lived in LA since 2013 and through my la journey I've had a lot of ups I've had a lot of downs okay I lived a vicious cycle of doing really well and then doing really bad and really well and really bad and the more apartments I moved to the more stuff I add it to my collection of things I was hoarding in my blithe to fill the holes that I was having the more I realized the vicious cycle was an ending and I was supposed to move into a house with Alex and Aaron the house fell through and then I had a decision right then and there do I stay in LA and continue this endless cycle that I know is not going to change I know I'd be 31 years old in a couple of years and I'd still be going through the same sit down with my depression my bipolar I wasn't gonna get better so I was like you know what I can sit here on my couch and cry about it like I have been and relapse so many times again or I can leave my apartment I can have no place to stay I can have nothing but a back patch there's nothing holding me down and I can be free to the world and what it has to offer so in the simplest terms that's what it is so if I'm correct so what it is is that you have only a backpack yes you where do you sleep at night um we've slept at three oh I have a team now okay who's your team me Daniela and Kimo okay it was me and Danielle at first but after we went to the Middle East we picked up chemo okay and I was traveling with us and like our last home that we slept that was Roman at without okay um so you're on a consistent home no stay a different place the role was supposed to be every night has to be a new place okay every night okay but it's been changed and you frozen all your assets all your money I do have I do have access to a card okay and the reason for what what kind of card we talked about what kind of card oh no just like it's a black platinum card no no no the reason being the reason being like right now my dog dollar who's not here with us is in the hospital and I had to pay $2,500 yesterday to take him into the emergency I needed to do that okay also another reason um every year during Ramadan my mom donates to charity and she just put a huge charge towards charity in the Middle East off my car so you're set assets aren't frozen you have a card yes okay you have a card otherwise how are you making money how am I making way because you've frozen all the Adsense income right no nothing guy so are you making money somehow through the journey because in your first video you're like I'm gonna see if people will like pay me to do things or hell yeah yeah and so first things that the first thing that I did was a hundred thousand dollars going to a charity okay now we think cuz we just started the charity called Project butterfly it's literally foundation being built right now in London we think that that's where the hundred thousand dollars should go okay so we're holding that for that um now as far as the money that's coming into the fouseytube channel yes money's still being made but I discussed this in interview that I'm going to be posting tomorrow the whole ad pocalypse I got hit like 90% on my fouseytube channel okay and I talked about this tomorrow and this is totally outside the point but I'm dishonest with it I asked a friend of mine 1 million views in 24 hours how much is that making you yeah he showed me his adsense and can I be honest or does it be honest he said don't say the name no of course not and I saw each million views in 24 hours was 8,000 to 12,000 dollars now how much is the fouseytube channel making per million views in 24 hours four hundred and fifty seven dollars and that's a lot of money don't get me wrong it's a blessing but I know that there's a human alike with ads right now there's a huge shut off a huge shut off so my motivation through this my you know what's keeping me going and everything the last thing it has to do with the money but as I'm doing this journey I'm not gonna shut off the money that's coming into the channel wherever that may be used for okay well we're not gonna dive into your analytics page yet I'll maybe do that when the cameras are off and to see if this is actually exact or not I'll let you guys know but since your money and your Adsense is struggling and you are struggling fam I have some money right alright and so I'm gonna ask you some honest question okay and we're gonna do is we have a Yousef piggy bank right here right and every question you answer honest then we give you $10 good okay that was a good like me being honest right there right I was I can't judge if you're being honest or not Oh we'll get to that right you might be being honest you might not be being honest we'll see I'm not gonna help you don't look at them um okay but no I'm gonna ask the questions good okay don't get nervous okay you're fine you're good stop trembling okay question umber one if you haven't seen useless episodes they're dope I haven't seen all them I won't lie I've only seen a few of them they're like 20 months on yeah right I can't do that so I really like the way that either they're very cinematic they're very cool thank you and you edit them so long story short you edit them let me get this yeah long long story short yeah when we first started we outsource somebody who's editing it for free every night we would I would have the whole vision of my head and as a director I would tell him exactly how I wanted the flow now this was very hard because the time difference is did the person was in the Middle East and by the time I got the story back if it didn't look how I wanted it to look and it didn't tell my story there was nothing I can do about it the video was live okay so at this point in time now and it's been like this for a couple of episodes we are 100% editing it I sit down first I do the whole rough cut I take out what I want I tell the story then I sit with Daniela again we pull all nighter and then she does like the effects and stuff like the GFX I'm not great at that we are editing the videos 100% cool so you are all blaming that someone helps you add and help someone else to shoot yeah yeah daniel is coming on the long journey to record that's openly acknowledged yeah that's $10 Hey all right you're use that divided me to folio all right so let's that that was it just a late question good night okay okay okay that was Matt we're gonna get deep now okay so you recently tweeted something I like to reshoot I always get in trouble on Twitter yeah you deleted all your tweets oh it's hard to talk you we'll get to that in a second so you tweeted something yeah you know if you don't know Youssef has gone off YouTube on YouTube off YouTube on YouTube right I've been there for a lot of conversations with him when he wasn't on YouTube as to why he quit what he was into but we'll get to that what I want to talk about is you tweeted something saying this was a note to myself on my phone when I decided to come back on YouTube okay and it said I'm gonna read it it said you got it and this is a note from Yusef to himself yep you got to win their hearts back you got a slow build take care of those who are there only accept love only except happiness breathe relax do not fear do not panic do not let go everything is okay smile correct mmm okay great so it sounds like your journey is about you right like when you said you're the project issue like I had so many superficial things I dated girls for the wrong reason I had a car at a motorcycle all these things it was about your journey of happiness right I want to ask you about the first part which is you got to win their hearts back why is it important to first of all who's they who's there and why is it important to win people's hearts back if the journey is about you so there is okay they say yours yes I put this over here okay there is a group of people I don't know how large they are there's a group of people who have been by my side through every single phase and you can imagine me and its fans okay you can imagine how much of a whiplash that maybe they've been there when I've started mornings with fousey and quit it gaming with fousey and quitting YouTube break one YouTube break to YouTube break three fousey build channel pride land music video streaming wins they've been with me through it all yeah I promised them that I'm going to chase my dream and never give up so when I quit this last time and I had again 100% in my mind thought I quit yeah I felt like I let so many of them down okay so when I came back I wanted to remind myself and I the one line that I said there's take care of be appreciative of who was there yeah because take care look vlog wouldn't have hit a million views in 24 hours my ego would have been upset by it Dan people don't care about you something's happening but this time when my channel level data at three hundred thousand four hundred thousand for a second I had to remind myself that's a blessing so instead of being mad at that and looking why am i don't have a million let me appreciate every single one of these three hundred four hundred thousand because that's what I didn't do last time and I have a gratitude for what I had so I just wanted to nurture what I had and win their hearts back and show them that I'm trying to fight and I'm trying to continue the fight to remind them not to give up on their own battles that stuff so with this project right I I think you're growing a lot as a person huh you do have obviously to help you sorry I didn't know sorry is it gone yeah okay great I'm capable okay okay so on this journey hmm what let me ask you a question what about what will validate you what makes you feel validated what validates me yeah well just in order to what validates you know am I giving you the cliche answer whether I want the honest answer I don't the cliche if it sounds cliche and it's honest I'm guys well honest if you say it's not views he's saying it's not the money what validates you on this current journey right so what used to validate me was numbers yeah tweets yeah like when I tweeted when I got a lot of interaction that Phil the boy to mean I've been doing that for years so a lot of Ben traction just as people you know fall into the mess of social media Instagram likes views support and positive feedback okay when I got positive feedback I felt good I did something I won their approval and I was happy well now well that is you know not what validates me now what I'm trying to work towards validating me is none of that but what I feel in myself each and every day regardless of my approval rating what people think about me my views how much money I'm making or how hot I am in the YouTube community right now so even if you don't quote win their hearts back you will still feel validated that's what I'm working towards yes that's what I'm working towards and I tell my like team every day we have hard tomorrow that's why I'm working towards so is your goal you mentioned all your goal is to appreciate those three thousand four thousand hundred people that are there right so how do you know when you've accomplished that goal this is the thing I always ask people right I always ask people what's your goal and a lot of times creators I would be really gone creators give these really cliche answers right I've been guilty of doing this in past as well my goal is to make people happy I just want to impact you of course you want to do that but that's not a goal because how do you know you've accomplished that goal how many people is enough happy people how many people is enough impacted people of course we always have goals every measurable so when will you feel like oh I have accomplished what I want to accomplish well I feel with this project I already have you feel you've already accomplished yeah every day because we just did a meet-and-greet in Ohio right tweeted out a random location the police shut it down and the people who saw my tweet got to move to a new location now when I went there with the team it wasn't the play and my intention wasn't let me show everybody how hot I am and how wanted I am let me cause a ruckus in the city and hit see that happen all the time it's not what I was doing I got to the meet and greet they started going crazy I said stop I said I do not want to take a picture I not cuz what I wanna do spend time with you guys like let's just sit down and chill so you feel like you've accomplished what you want because when people were coming up the people who talked to me that people have pot project butterfly and butterfly like games and support I feel like they're there and that's what matters okay but what if they all go with uh it would be hard it would be very hard but I promise myself talk to us in their meeting I'm not quitting I'm not okay so this is this is okay this is the breakdown of Yousefi knives relationship right I have heard Youssef quit YouTube one two maybe three times right yeah maybe maybe more okay and the last time you quit YouTube I went over to Alex's house and I said copy nothing was worth day mm-hmm and I was like dude what the f are you doing you keep quitting YouTube and you said to me and I quote huh I finally discovered YouTube's not for me I'm not gonna go back to you too because doesn't make me happy I want to try different things that maybe want to try being like a fitness person maybe I want to try travelling stuff I just am NOT going back to YouTube and you said something that really impressed me which was I keep telling myself as because of hate comments because the content were making that's why I keep going back and be unhappy but it's not I just don't enjoy YouTube and I was like damn Youssef is honest with himself he knows the stuff and then lo behold one and a half weeks later I saw a YouTube video it wasn't just a YouTube video it was called dear YouTube you need to see this and I literally wanted to jump out my goddamn window because I was so annoyed at you because you're never consistent what you say yeah so you're saying with this project yeah even if no one supports your project even if you get very little views no matter what happens you are not gonna leave YouTube again I'm not saying I'm not gonna leave YouTube again okay because I can't even predict that for so but what a minute again ago you said you're not gonna quit so I'm not gonna quit on this journey quit and you two were different yeah cuz III wouldn't you find what not the final criticism well let me let me backtrack a second shit and that turn all right you're good your dad time you saw me on my birthday yeah I do want to mention uh-huh I didn't see you ever again after that we saw me my show yeah yeah which was recent ya know and I texted you this and this me and Myra got every little thing through texting yeah where she asked me that she was like yo where are your intentions here in this and what I respectfully told her was I respect where you're coming from from what you saw as an outsider yeah last time I saw you hey Lilly I'm done I need to find my happiness next thing you know I'm back on YouTube but somebody who was there and I told you this who spent every day with me was humble a poet now he nursed me every day we talked on the phone for hours he hung out with me he talked me about life I was wondering he was annoyed every single day and he really helped me reach a new place right and he always let me know if you need to come back to YouTube do it for yourself so if you watch those vlogs that are posted on Joseph you see what I said in those vlogs was me coming back this time is not for you I pointed to the audience that it's not for you I said it's for me I said for years I've had an outlet to voice my opinions my frustrations and deal with my depression I need that back okay so whether you're here to ride with me or not that's what I'm doing so I started that on those sofas and then unexpectedly this journey came about and I came back to fousey so I just want you we're gonna wrap up this segment right here I'm just gonna leave you with a final thought which is the contradiction of I need to win their hearts back and this is not for you it's for me because those are two opposite sentences no because like I am really connected to the people who are there for this right and although why I'm creating is for me I still know who's a part of it because they're a part of it more than even I am they're invested in me they're invested in the journey they're not in part of it more than you are you're part of it more than they are true okay but cut the beard no I care for them a lot and I will not just be asking any other thing which I believe you all call other creators out on this I felt like I've always if there's anybody invested in his audience it's me 100 percent so whether they're what like outside of me creating for myself whether they're haters well name another person in your life you're invested in that's not a fan wouldn't mean invest any other person that you're emotionally invested in emotionally like the way you're invested in your fans you care about them name someone who's not a fan that you're invested in family member trend doesn't matter anyone my dog's okay someone that stalks your mom mmm really close with your mom you know we talk every day so your invest in your mommy yeah what what characterises investment you're honest with people that's will be one thing right that's the people you're honest with that you care about them right uh-huh great that's a perfect segue to clickbait which is the most dishonest thing a creator can do that's what time we'll talk about put a pin in that okay not a second because we're gonna take a break from the key twice our task as we're going oh okay I'm gonna give you $5.00 for that because there was a contradiction in your answer which is I want to in their hearts back if you like for a car make sure you're going to find a contradiction for a contradiction I'm simply looking at the facts laid out in front of while you're looking for the fault and my stars um well you have to have stars for me to have fine folds first okay calm down okay so two questions from the audience the only reason staffing is because you're trying to get flirtatious with people no saga you are and you and you by me uh-huh you showed up you drink of my drinks right now I would be trying to play footsie if I was trying to flirt I'm not your knees can't even reach another table legs might not anyways okay two questions from Twitter and so my audience they're they're hella are they watching right now are they like they're I think they're watching they're watching I think I'm liking it so we have two questions from Twitter are you ready yes you can be on the lighter note right nothing here's on the night team super Mumbai Suri my boy well of course is gonna ask the most inappropriate question question number one I think it's for both of us actually okay okay but you're gonna have to answer first okay it's gonna be can you let us know if y'all fell for each other at some point you first me first okay there's my live streaming you really want me to answer that right now in front of everybody who's in Israel and them right now yeah alright there was a time to get that lip quiver can we zoom in on that lip quiver there was a time yes where when the whole yulie was happening and everything happened that's always happening yeah I did to myself envisioned what it would be like to be in a relationship in here and you know so many people kept saying you guys are such a good match it isn't this and I know we're different but I in my head tried to envision if I let you into my world that I let girls into there's a whole nother side that's outed world no no it's very limited when I let a girl in I let her in yeah now you saw this side to me but we've never connected on a spiritual level I feel we matter how good our friendship God and I asked myself if I did let her into that world and had like intimate nights straight up would she feel something for me and I had those thoughts so that's his honest as it could get right there so as much as you might think like how much it was playing now I was like there were times where I really like I thought about it I've even talked to friends about it now you're taught which friend mutual friend yeah now don't act now did I ever think that you would be interested or anything I mean no and that's why it's it was never it was just one of those things you know interesting yeah and so there you have it most of the fanfic on the internet yusuf wrote about us there you have it um if Alice answers question you know I'll be honest I agree I always thought like you know Youssef is I like how he's ambitious those times when you were like I've got three channels I'm ambitious I have these goals I was really like I'm attracted to this hustle in you but that was never consistent and that was such a big problem not even romantic I'm he's a friend I like to be around if I'm really honest I like to be around people who have a certain energy I always felt like your energy was never consistent in that regard it was always like okay use of a change again okay you for someone else now and I just for my own mental sanity need to be around people that consistently have a positive energy right there was times of course when we were shooting videos this mother ever would write scripts words that okay so that we won't be in bed we go get married what I was like up against this chest in these abs or I was like yo yo maybe maybe you somethin I sure like really - yes of our own but but again spiritually I was like nah I would kill this mother effort come on I got you and that's why I never I respected whenever I felt like I know you you the kind of person you are and you need that kind of energy and that's what I'm on the path to do right now so for me 225 days right now on this journey 26 today my Energy's been great my drive has been great my hunger has been back so I found my purpose I'm proud of myself maybe 365 days from now when you've been like this for a year we can shoot a video you can write something where we're in bed together and I don't know maybe it was all about you know piss me off about that okay sorry if we're going long no it's okay there was one time where I had a video plan with me and you were gonna kiss and then we are gonna shatter my life is so hard please listen to this we were gonna shatter everything and I was so excited but if I were many people's hearts back it was way before that but if I remember correctly that was right when right when I was going to do it you and Suzy did it and I said they're like wow really cuz everybody knows you when Suzy is not real but me and you there was a chance let me get all this money out his door right now let me just take all of these I'm going to take this drink back right oh no don't take my love for your abs is there with a chain I know he got out right now listen one of the stories in the same week Suzy and use of both on the same day we're like I want a video where I kiss you and Suzy just messaged me first okay and I was like I'm not gonna do that with both of you guys in the same week that helped no and then dong you ended up kissing does so mad but well we'll talk I'm actually gonna put a note on my paper about this you can't look at what it is that we're doing in the history of our friendship I think your answer is a little bit soft than what the truth is because true or false just all I want is a true or also I want no explanation around came here the multiple choking so you have multiple times gotten upset if another guy has taught to me true okay multiple times true great moving on second question all right ahem um by the way I'm so sorry that question was some team super og okay um it wasn't a three stories questions now teams were Mumbai this is good right and we're not gonna name any names okay okay that's my one rule okay another I wouldn't mind date you because if we break up I know you gonna be stop tweeting about me and I'm gonna bump them on the effing leg okay work on that okay this is the question yeah all right did and don't mention names okay let people soon did lily and your ex have some type of tension I'll answer after you answer I really don't want to talk about her right okay what do you have okay the answer is absolutely not any time you dated anyone I have I actually really believe in girl love so I don't know if your climb really nice to everyone you dated that I know of or anyone that anyone's dated even though online he would try to pick oh but no you supposed to be for Lindy yeah dia I've never had problems with it no I know you haven't but other people have with me there have been times I've had to explain to took girls like they asked like like even one girl I talked to years ago and we recently started talking and she was like yo but you and Lily yeah and I would have but you know why that is right yeah what because of what we showed or what I showed correct yeah we you all right there was an instant uh-huh where you were with your girlfriend and I was in the room and I was questioning this so hard I was like why is he doing this but I didn't him you right where your girlfriend came up to me and you started vlogging with me like yo she still makes me nervous you know and I was like why are you doing this in front of your girlfriend when she's obviously gonna feel jealous that I that might have been okay we all make that was a mistake not pointing things yeah how was understand what I'm saying if your girlfriend ever did so just they're probably justified yeah yeah that was a mistake and I my heart goes out to her all the people that have you said blocked a car to go up to you this last room is dedicated to you maybe this jar will also go to you for that honesty I will give you five more dollars okay we're gonna back it those are the light questions okay I start this death there okay we're gonna go into more questions just yesterday I read on my cheeks right now no you look at that Kyle when he's almost up okay how long's white person sunburn right now okay yes or no okay have no I don't want any stress no I'm liking it where I smile it's like it's like a it's like a detox I more than anything which you should be gathering is that I've done my research yeah I love it I love it I love it yes or no question no explanation don't you know have you changed since the first time I met you oh yeah train everyday okay great perfect because you also tweeted saying that you don't change people's perception of you changes no see see see there's so many there's so many things here like fine lines between we change everybody changes all the but what I say about change whenever people I'm people always view me as an old user than a new user that's just suddenly people say to creatives just dumb I got tired of that because I was like no stop there is no old use if there is no new use it because this we've created me being in charge of it with my audience and the reason they're like happy with this oh yeah we like use of again is because I've villainized myself from the past and made myself my past version myself be a most horrible person when I think about the past version of myself like the one who had just met you the one who was overweight and everything I always had the same good intentions I always had a pure heart a kind heart now people might not have seen that in me based on how they perceived me so now I'm also based on how you acted but I know myself even through those times okay behind the persona of who I was for the internet who Youssef was not fousey not the villain right great so I also get think everyone changes I hate when people come and say you all the lead really old uses because everyone changing the person that writes that comment also changes you have a change that's how you grow uh-huh change and both inevitable necessary right there's a few things that I feel like you've said contradictory things to me okay and I'd like to ask you about the first time I came to your apartment yes when we lived right beside each other and never saw each other yeah was you were getting your tattoo removed yeah oh great I like this yeah you were getting a tattoo removal like dude why are you going through so many of these operation things at your tattoo removed yeah and you said to me and I hope you don't mind me repeating this you said to me saying it's not my choice I don't even care that I have a tattoo I don't mind the tattoo I just happy to move because it's not my choice but then I went home and saw a post I was like I regret getting the tattoo it's not who I am and was just so contradictory to what you said to me in person and now can I just see your arms yeah now you've got a pity attached as a rule but you've got all of these tattoos yeah I don't think that is our big deal at all but you for some reason your brain convinced yourself that you need to be one way even though you don't actually believe in that way hundred percent why so when I started Yousef I was like I created Muslim content like content that represented Islam and I represented content middle Easterns now I just up as my mom dad did the whole thing think they got Facebook now because of this that audience saw me a certain way and I had a standard to live up to okay so I lived up your brain yeah and for me feeling like I was doing the right thing okay because there was a time where I finally started like getting my viral hit doing middle-eastern stuff where I was like dang there's people back home watching me I need to represent so now as I'm and yo double life on YouTube don't get me started yet don't get me started with how many youtubers are one way for the camera one way for another so me doing that it was out of a good intention because I was representing a religion and a culture so as I was doing that I was also growing as a person so when I got my tattoo when I moved to LA I wasn't ready for that in my life at that time I was still scared of judgement judgement of my audience judgment of my mother had a severe panic attack when I got the tattoo scrubbed it off for hours in the shower cried every night went to therapy gained 49 pounds was depressed because I thought my life was over because in my head whenever somebody saw that they're no longer going to see you sit that they supported they're going to think I got lost in the sauce started getting my tattoo removed through therapy and through my removal process I grew up and I learned that no youssef if you want to do something you're going to do it for you regardless of what other may see so here's what happened in my youtube career as I started being more me because I'm not gonna lie while I was making those videos representing a slam and doing the Middle Eastern stuff I was doing stuff behind the scenes all the time I never said I was actually segue into my second I was still I was still living a double life I was still going out and partying I was still drinking I was still doing stuff with girls I was gonna show them that yeah so what that's where we used to take pictures we had two orchestras specifically remember at a house party me and you would hold on to you to be the new made us move all the alcohol from behind the fig yeah and I was like you said what are you doing done and so so what it what actually ended up happening was people thought I changed what all I really started doing was being more true to myself as I started being more true to myself people thought I got lost so they're they can't they're like dang la changed him Fame change and money changed him but I was just becoming more me so when I got this tattoo now it was me as an adult ready to make my own to make my own fault and to say this is what I believe in I respect your beliefs this is me and I got to through that talk to my mom about it and then my mom like who I thought would disown me it's my biggest supporter and she trusts me because she knows this does not define the love or who her child is so this is just me being ready to accept my own decisions give you ten dollars for that answer big off yourself ten dollars this all is all going to go towards taking me on this okay what question gets me a kids none of them anyways moving on so here's the thing I feel and this is where I might get a little heated because this is where I am very passionate about the Sun okay I'm gonna read you three tweets from you yeah okay delete my Twitter No you've already done that many times you're not gonna do it this time because I have the receipts right okay write three tweets from you yeah alright and they go in order okay so the first one I'm gonna read is from back in the day okay okay number one I'm changing the way I you two no longer am I making content reviews no more need for quick satisfaction from numbers the next week was I used to get a million views from crap content with click baited title and thumbnails it's time to change all that and begin filmmaking about two three weeks later our titles and thumbnails do not represent how powerful content is it's simply us having to play the game to change the game so essentially from I'm just going to call it how I see it okay and you can correct me if I'm wrong you were making content with honest titles and saying I'm a filmmaker not doing the click make crap anymore I'm above that my content speaks for itself maybe you weren't getting as many views as you mentioned your views weren't I think I can see the receipts online no yeah the receipts are when we started the journey and then you're like yo actually clickbait thumbnails and titles are just me playing the game to change the game and so I need to do that for people to now see this awesome stuff I'm making through filmmaking and so now yeah I am gonna click make why the contradiction why the change okay why before were you okay not quick dating and wife okay just start first of all yeah and this is two friends I'm not a child no I know this is a chance from your justice is this a big topic for me too so first of all YouTube right now in this day and age depending on your audience is built on clickbait now why do I say that four years that I've done this I posted videos that weren't clickbait and I posted videos that are quickly I know what the audience clicks on and I feel like the people who complain about clickbait the viewers are the people who only click on clickbait what I found now I have a predominantly male audience I do have a female support group but a predominantly male audience their clicks and they're like reception towards videos are different so it's tailored to a different way now when I started the journey and I said like I'm being you know the filmmaker for the first 15 days me not capitalizing my titles no exclamation points no nothing a million views each day and for six days and wrote two million views not clickbait just the content now you have times where let's say I post whatever people think a clickbait title is on this journey right here's what I feel I feel like now that I support my content and I know it's quality so I know if I do get them to click it ain't a waste of their time this is quality content that you need to see now how am I going to target young Jake Paul fans like I met Jake Paul fans in Ohio hey are you guys watching the journey now we're not but it's everyday bro how am I gonna get them to elevate if I have to play the game and maneuver and I'm bringing them in to get them to watch the video I'm going to do that because at the end of the day this is the business and I have to play that and I feel like my content deserves to be seen but when I used to stuff in the past clickbait on like dose of pussy but I know all I did like a lot of youtubers to stay at home and create a vlog all day why what am i doing to that kid why am I wasting 13 minutes of their day to come watch my video wasn't worth it that's clickbait quick bait to me is not only the town thumbnail it's the content you're uploading in there is my question to you would be if you're saying for Joseph you see when I said you know trash content I used to I don't want to waste 30 minutes someone not all trash oh yeah sample was trash saying I don't want to waste your time watching this content why do you think that a Jake Paul fan gives an F about your journey and needs to see your content by no means do I feel like they need to yeah but I feel like me believing in the content on producing now I want them to care because if I have a chance to get little children but if you want them to care doesn't that contradict your journey of it being for you no no no because through this journey I started project butterfly and I have a charity I now have there are operations that we're going to run where I do feel like we're gonna make positive influence and positive change now I'm building a team around that I'm circulating team around that I'm creating a charity this is all stuff that's happening through like throughout what we're doing so why do I feel like that kid needs that kid doesn't by any means he can live his own life but if I have the power to get a kid like that to join the journey and team butterfly and believe in positivity and love and the change we're gonna do for the world by all means and any means necessary now I also feel like clickbait if you want to be um it's not even it's not even clear but first of all I I'm sick of quit because I feel like look on YouTube everything is clickbait not everything not everything but like for example your vlogs right how many of you is your a blog is gonna day not a lot not a lot and do you ever clickbait not really you don't right now if you wanted to be a part of that group that gets a million views a day as sad as it sounds you have to you have to click bait now if your quality is worth bringing them in then bring them in do I want my content to be seen right now yes because I believe in the message I know I'm not wasting their time I know I'm not spending half my vlog selling merch I'm not trying to get them to buy a song but don't you don't but here's the thing right I just really would as your friend would want you to think that if your journey is all about I'm doing this for me and I want to put out a good message why that f do you care if that is a hundred thousand people or a million people and why use a clickbait to get into that group of a movie because when I put all vlogs right I literally could be in my house all day working and I'll put that vlog I don't click bait and I'm off thing I'm writing around we're just different and that's fine but here's the thing with clickbait right is as someone like me and maybe I'm maybe the flaws with me I don't know but I'm just telling you how I feel is that you click mating actually makes my job harder because I go into meetings trying to make something of YouTube and all they can think I was like also like you vlog right so like you guys eat stuff online you you guys do pranks and you do stupid crap with your friends and that's what people think YouTube is right and so now creators like the Ryan's and the d-trix doesn't like I don't want to mention my name because I think they're better than me they are now lost in a sea of I did this stupid crap or I broke this part of me or like I just this person and so actually for creators like us you in a way what you care not is I guess your choice you actually make our jobs higher where we feel like no we all have to be part of this little crew then to also clip it so if you're so obsessed with like I have the power to make someone watch my vlog and change the way they think is impossible I have the power to change the game and not clickbait and actually make my content speak yourself first off in any industry like let's say Kendrick Lamar conscious rapper he can't be mad that waka flocka ding dong comes out with a song like boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo and goes platinum it's part of the game yeah he can't sit there and be like y'all are ruining the game for me I can't open these kids mind he understands this is a game it's a dog-eat-dog world and people are willing to do whatever it is they're willing to steal content they're willing to click bait they're willing to be unoriginal whatever it may be that happens in any industry BuzzFeed was created on clickbait you know how many times I got created by a BuzzFeed article CNN click baits night and day why are these news channels trying to click bait for our attention there was recently a muslim girl who was killed that they clicked baited the hell out of me to click that title it's everywhere it's in our media it's everything and it comes down to a point like yeah I know no no we would because I'm not like right now I stand by my content is what some of the best content on YouTube right now and I will stand by that and if my clickbait I would love for you to show me an example you're like this is unacceptable to get your viewers to watch because like I just titled the video I stole Roman out which card stores car yeah I will agree there's some instance of clickbait words people just like saying this is super quick if the thing actually happens am I using women am I using breasts am i pretending that a ghost molest me at night like 90% of youtubers right now to get views no I'm creating here doing other things know what what am i doing you need to watch this video I'm gonna have to delete this video dear YouTube you need to see this if it journeys for you yo why does YouTube need to see it because I believe in the content I want it to be seen so then my what I would tell you is frankly disagree which means that you got to say the journeys about me but it's about you seeing my journey as well what else you wouldn't be saying you need to play the game to change the game you wouldn't be saying it's a business with you glad I acknowledge this is a thing like I feel youtubers feel pressured to say cliche things right they feel pressured like of course the journeys about me know it's a business you said yeah but it's what intention do you have going into that business I know a lot of people who their business right now the reason they want to get views is cuz they know a lot of you means more Adsense that's not my intention me playing the business right now is knowing the more people I get is the more people I can get to be a part of my charity and the more change we're gonna do so I'm playing that I'm playing that in a huge way but ah where was I I had something I'm sure you did um call this vlog the time I got amnesia ah damn it dang you there was something I say in regards to that but um listen I understand as a creator there's people that's gonna use click like I'm not like sitting here being salty about it I can't control that and you're right it's dumb for me to be like I'm mad as a courier I'm not getting views cuz this person they're not I'm not about to do that but all I'm saying that if you are so adamant that your journey is about you and you're not doing it for other people then there should not be a need for clickbait that is the deepest level of yourself to understand or if it is about getting as you say yes the journeys about me but it is important to me that people see the strange so for sometimes I have an amazing amazing amazing video and I know it's amazing but I know if I title it what it is then it's not gonna like I said be seen and I feel like it's important enough to be seen I know that sounds holier-than-thou but I truly do and I feel like the more eyes the more change now had I put a regular title like I did I put giving back helps me through my depression and I gave back to workers in Qatar who are fast and low views right and that's fine but if I had if I felt like it was worthy to be seen and I titled it dear YouTube you need to see this and there were more eyes on it by all means it was still the best video I producing great content the Kia's and this is how it wrap us up I think the keys not to be validated but who how many people watching it if you believe in it so much it does not matter if one person sees it 10 people see it yeah it doesn't but it's also like this is the industry like you can look at how the rock promotes his movie you can't compare how he promotes his movie towards how Leonardo DiCaprio promotes his movie they're going to promote their movies in different ways now Leonardo DiCaprio might be like man look at this guy posting these Instagram videos and making fun with Kevin Hart and doing these tours while leo is like I'm an actor I believe in my art I don't have to do this it's they're selling themselves promoting yourself it's different than saying you need to see this video YouTube cuz this is gonna get doing what I feel like what I feel like to you is nothing your Baywatch is gonna self-destruct in one day if you don't watch it in the finebros have done that all the time the fine roles aren't here I know the finebros i drop that name and i apologize that's okay they're not here right now you're okay but here's what I want to say to you here's what I'm gonna say to you here's what on this video calling out your BS and here's what itis they do journeys for you if it's actually also Vulcan but here's what I'll say to you and this goes to anything that you do and I've learned this when I was like young on YouTube don't get mad at somebody for doing something that works just cuz you're not willing to do it and I'm not mad oh you know what I mean I am I'm being a friend that's being like yo you're contradicting yourself normally oh yeah no no and that's what was the man I could put up a vlogger right now it's like they yeah you put that's what I'm saying that but that's an issue I'm completely fine getting two hundred thousand views on my blogs I'm content I have a party my vlog gets to in a thousand like yo damn straight and then I walk when I ordered Capote Lee today cuz I'm mother from Bali that's awesome but what I'm saying for you if your journey is about soul being authentic then have the guts to say it's also about you watching my journey it's not just about me pretty much I don't say that in the episodes I tell them that they're the wings that make it fly and I understand why they're supposed to make it fly is a very tumblr effin way of saying it's also a business and I need you know I don't need values cuz I'm not doing it because my channel is shot down an Adsense right now anyway and me promoting it doesn't have to deal wouldn't clickbait not true okay so you have or the next week I dare dare you nuts clickbait titles that's the call every YouTube right now in times every youtuber you know but if you have that issue call them until you do the same I care about you as my friend and I know that loopholes like this in your journey is what I know I'm doing what I know I'm doing we're gonna in two seconds but I know what I'm doing I shouldn't face no we're not I know I know I'm not like I know I'm not putting your boobs and my thumbnails to get used I know I'm not um I know I'm not disrespecting my family my sisters or girl I'm not doing anything that's you're not disrespecting girl like I'm this journey give me your title I'm thrown a girl under the bus perhaps you've thrown X's under the button other things to throw people under the bus not to throw under the bus no we're gonna agree to disagree we're gonna move on for a second because we're getting heated um we're gonna do something real funny are people watching are people watching okay people are watching maybe they're just like we're an old couple bickering I don't know well just leave it up for a second we're still friends he's sweating a lot but it's fun we're gonna do something which is really funny so Yusef actually was popular way before I was right I was starting off on YouTube and Yousef was like the mother effing man I lived in Toronto and I still the man

don't care that use of prank like I'm not upset that used to prank me you said that's what he does you prank people before that was your thing okay I personally got a fan of friends I think they make people feel uncomfortable I think it's not fair to them they didn't sign up for that it's just cringe I don't like seeing people in that circumstance when Youssef said he's gonna invite me over for a lap dance everyone and their mothers are like he's gonna prank you and I was like dude he's not because Youssef respects me he knows he knows I don't want that to happen because I've made it very clear many times to all my friends that prank me I don't enjoy being pranked I just don't like it so I go to this guy's house like we're gonna do this lap dance video I'm up gets over this booty on this right here this booty be working on you looking right at my give a little squeeze right I get to his house and not only were you in on it but some mutual friends we had at the time we're also in on it which made me annoyed as well but I get them the first thing I say off camera to use those like Yousef this is not a prank right and Ofcom you're like it's not and I said to you I'm telling you right now if you prank me it is going to affect our Fred shit I'm telling you I'll be upset I said it straight up like dude it's not you then proceeded to prank me and I was so allied and show it in the video maybe watch the prank really shot I was so damn annoying because I thought this guy does actually not care about her friendship he just wants the video wants the views and would do anything to get a good print video I was so annoyed by that and so for me that was when our friendship I was like you I don't want to be around this guy because he does not care about her friendship as a friend and I'm not even no excuses no justification I sincerely apologize for that and that's something I never forgot about and that's like you know whenever I think pranks again it's like it's one of those things that like I'm like not because I remember how I made you feel I've had plenty of people in the past tell me like yo don't like pranks Loretta and I've still done it and it's always just been a laugh but with you I didn't take it into consideration and that was my fault my original intention this is not to excuse it I told you this was to get the rock I thought you were to love that didn't work in fact you thought that was doable they didn't work so I thought how can I do this and not piss her off I was like oh she loves girl love I'm P good girl okay train of thought you sound like my ex how could I do this and not piss her off let me just break her because that would piss her off so instead of a rock let me get the next best thing and prank her instead of just giving her a goddamn black I'm sorry still haven't gotten no you did in one of the vlogs I gave you and I always see this clip posted on Twitter again it's like though I don't even know how my hips moved like that you know what's cool I'm talking I was at Alex's House everyone was there I grind it hard okay we have different definitions of hard um anyways okay we're gonna move on okay I have two more things actually this one might be a little bit sensitive Oh feel free to not answer you don't want to I think religion of the Internet is a lose-lose situation personally I feel like when you're religious online the comments section becomes about religion it becomes religious warfare no one wanted to stuff the content you use just like you said you'd deliver this content and then you're like no I'm just this for the for this facade I'm not like this but you recently tweeted saying got to break my fast and pray on top on the highest towers and Qatar today so now you've again incorporated religion into your well that was my first tweet on religion in a long time years yes so it's to honestly ask you what is your religious stance what would you say I'm not going to answer not gonna answer alright I'm gonna give you five for admitting that you're not gonna answer because that's respectable and I probably would not answer actually no I would answer I answer everything what that's okay we're different people it's fun um but I will pay for my friend uses I do feel for sometimes I will say you're sweating like like wow I know damn so I get this guy what club you dying up in here jeez um I will say please religion is actually and despite being one popular opinion I'm okay with that I'm okay with standing for something that's an unpopular opinion no matter what any religious text says no matter what you think is right or wrong religion is going to be subjective you cannot have right and wrong when you're referencing texts or books or ideas that are thousands of years old and I will say for my friend use of one of the things I do feel for a lot is that you get a lot of heat about a lot of things and I never thought that was justified I don't think that's okay and so I will encourage all of you to not judge people based on what you think is right or wrong according to your religious beliefs that's a battle State for you um and hopefully one day you don't get a lot of heating you can talk about well what I do say like I said this in a recent episode was Glide I mentioned that I was like hey guys this was the first time I showed you guys any part of religion and I explained how any country that I go to I'm going to take that opportunity to learn about their religion and also pay respects to their religion but at the end of the day if I'm gonna be honest with how I feel about a religion and this is how I feel in general about it I don't care about what religion anybody is what they believe in where their values are whatever like I respect any and every belief like right now in this room I don't need to know what religion they aren't I don't care what religion they're I respect them as people and that's how I view so religion to me like I respect people who have faith I respect people who don't have faith I respect you know whatever they want to do at the end of the day are they good people to me are they cool like you like I don't I don't care I mean I don't bother with it I'm an amazing friends yeah so I don't I don't mind great I have one more thing and then waiting to something really fun and spicy mm-hmm um so she went I want I want to know I'm about going right now I want to have a one more thing forget it really honest okay we can discuss any of the stuff off cameras well I don't want you think I orchestrate his whole thing to put you on the spot okay I only kind of did that um there's one more thing that I never told you about that to me annoyed the crap out of me ah why have why don't you tell me these things when they happen why don't they come about why don't we discuss like you know why that's it that's what you know why didn't say these things yeah because I was like yo am I gonna answer and his actions I'm not going to consistent next time okay fana I've always felt like the consistency was never there so I never took the effort to tell you things okay so now this me doing this is me once again believing in you okay as I always will and I'll get more to why nothing but I feel like in our friendship yeah I have oh I don't know why I've always had a soft spot for you when you go through issues I know if you remember when we lived beside you I used to come over and be like yo I'm struggling with this everyone does not always tried my best whether you agree or not I don't know to be like this is the advice I can give you about business about team or YouTube about anything not that I'm an expert but this is what I can tell you right you also when you said I'm not going to tanks anymore only biscuits there's one person's already not done that was me and you said I want to ask it what starting skits or did that skit with you about dating a youtuber what I would do really well you can't you said you're never doing pranks again that was before 20 pranks so markers I've always tried to be there for you every time you want to a video boys try to be there for you you have done the same for me for the most part okay but the last annoyance I had was well I did this Halloween shoot we're not gonna say it was for because it never got released this big Halloween video I did and it fell through but I remember I had so many my friends I had an Alex that Lauren had did you guys so many people there and I don't know if you realize this but you came and you put zero effort into this project I was working on and you were like lying there and you wouldn't get up and you wouldn't put your analogous like this mother effer can see that I'm busting myself trying to get this done but no effort and that's why I felt like deal maybe he doesn't actually care about me you know how there's two sides to every story they tell what we never discuss tell me my biggest insecurity and something like I would love to learn on the journey is dancing okay and that was straight dancing so when the director was saying like you said come on more I'm like Oh demotion okay you gonna weigh in my head I'm like yo I think I'm dancing like MJ right now I thought I was doing my best so me sitting down not being enthusiastic to get up and dance cuz each time I got up that was hard for me and the whole time I was like damn and I knew it on my head I'm messing up this project I don't know how to dance and it required me to dance Alex he bust them Lawrence you can bust a move everybody who's there they can bust a move then there comes Yusef and you don't want me to do little things but like I don't even know how to do the second project is a second project where you've danced for something and the first time you did it for me you had no problems you were like yeah I'm gonna do this I might be a little awkward I'm still doing when was that that was for that Bollywood yeah I did like the ass and I did that but it wasn't anything too crazy alright I'm glad I heard your sides no I I wish maybe we connected on meds I'm I believe in being like yo he literally put an old effort no no no I I did and I even whispered to them like I knew like I was not like I thought I was gonna what the video came out I even whispered to them like imagine what I'm gonna look like dream is that was hard like they were like we have different definitions of hard well I don't know how to dance those moves it was like oh my gosh like that was scary alright alright we're need a break from this right now okay I'll give you ten dollars for that we're take a break from this okay we're gonna do something that everyone over there in this internet world has hi guys Ezra Chris I hope you're enjoying this everyone has requested so when I said I was induce livestream all my fans like oh you're just gonna pick the crappy questions like what's your favorite color idea I was like all my fans like to get bright you know they like to get bright and sassy yeah wonders all to do this so what I have here is that I don't know if you know this the Internet is a filthy mother effin place and all our fans all these teeny bopper fans and teens even older people they actually get off on writing six things about us on the Internet okay that's what they do I have some fanfiction here about you and I again really I do and we're gonna read it okay we're gonna read some fanfiction um I have to how bad is it do they like go in like they did things went in father really um but I have to from your point of view and one from my point okay so first I'm gonna get you to do this one okay I'm never side note I've never read a fanfic side note I didn't know what fanfiction was yeah also never read a fanfiction back today when I was looking at them I was like gifted down with this like I don't just look for something ever read fanfiction really fanfiction you have to understand from our point of view like oh we're friends never even when I'm drunk or anything is anything happened between us yeah true the closest thing that happened was maybe Yousef was drunken sent some flirtatious crap to me a creator segment that is the worst set of ever happened don't worry we'll put a pin in that okay um so nothing has ever happened to so I'm reading this it's like what the f is wrong with you guys but we're gonna be I remember sleepy a creator something okay where am I reading just the highlights oh she gives me a slight smirk as she crawled and plopped herself onto my lap her lips instantly went for my neck I was hoping to feel some type of sensation when she did that some type of spark some type of electricity but nothing all I felt were wet lips against my lower neck I glanced at her broodingly an ounce of her wet fighting its way into my thoughts but instead of letting myself feel guilty I crashed my lips into her and just like that I was numb I have two questions number one whoever wrote this you're delusional if you think that he is gonna be like but nothing what kind of trap for putting the fiction in fan fiction for sure because that is ended up I crash to my lips and who was someone crashing into my nice mug like are you the Titanic wat wat anyways that was sickening to me um I'm going to read one from my point of view okay can't even take this seriously right now mine's much longer by the way and also I'd like to know there's way more offense which is from my point of view for music and there was so this is your cue just write some more from his point of view because let's be really real life guys if you haven't noticed if you haven't noticed I learned this at a young age she does a lot to prove to everyone that there's nothing there that's actually not true I just said that when I test your abs and chest I was like yes comfortable oh yeah but now like just let it be cool like let it it's fine you don't have to poop to then like you know me I'm not proving I just knew coughing you're like you know trust me yeah I've never asked that I've never tried cuz if I tried I wouldn't be like that that's what I said there's a different side to me oh you can tell you out game a men's game that's very honest and true and aside you have another beer someone's use it was drunk he said these words to me he said I was leaving with you oh I'm gonna leave now and he was like if you're gonna leave why the hell did I stay here if I'm not gonna like essentially what you're saying was if I'm not gonna get some why the hell did I come here I didn't say dad essentially what you said in different words anyways let's go to the san fiction right now my mic fell because even it is like yo this is trash okay okay let's hear it yeah let me hear it I'm getting bad I'm gonna imagine it yeah oh I'm there I'm there just as I was about to pay attention to the movie I felt the use of swarm giant hands slide under my right hand which is resting on his ads you say that but I like he caressed the back of my hand his thumb don't care about that I didn't bother to take my hand away I couldn't help myself from slowly lifting my head up to look at Yusuf's chocolatey eyes that's when I realized my eyes had been on his lips for a while now his eyes travelled down my lips that also made me realize that I had the side of my bottom with in between my teeth slightly biting it he probably he pressed his tongue to the theme of my lips I slightly parted my lips to give him the access apparently I'm a parking garage we didn't care of our surroundings as our tongues danced and purl together we're both on cloud mother-effing 9 it says mother effin yep my best one feeling this warm breath on my neck I couldn't help but let out a slight I like this I like this yeah our tongues danced and twirl together basically our tongues are in the sequel of lala land is what I'm Catherine from this I like that one alright ok I'm sure you do breathe oh okay there's the highlights give it to me boo I had my arms around her waist as our hips moved in unison are we dancing her back was leaning against my chest as we both got lost to the beat of the music dancing some Beyonce song followed the previous song and Lily instantly started grinding carelessly to the cadence of the music my lust for her became stronger as I tried to keep my composure it's been like two minutes and she already has me turned on just by her stance and the way she was dancing against my crotch I knew she was finally letting go and finally letting herself enjoy a little and I was so thing happy about it so in this step if you're dancing just fine no that's our Liao's well I dunno how to just like stand on a wall let somebody grind on me that's the only kind of dancing alright I was concerned so if you want to like I can stand there okay I have one more from you point of view all right I took my hair no we should have done you somebody should have read it and we should have really enacted it like like you know like acting acting practice acting I'm gonna ignore you and read now okay I took my hair out of the towel and began to untangle it while Yusef washed me hey you missed one right there he said as he put his hands through my hair then put his hand on my neck while his thumb was resting on my cheek they like thumbs that is a run-on sentence also they like that his hands eventually made their way to my waist as my hands wrapped around his neck as our kiss was getting deeper and deeper we made our way to bed we'll come through he gently pushed me onto the bed okay know how it would go the other way around and began to suck on my neck as I began to breathe heavier and then let up sophomore why didn't ever want me to moan I feel like you wouldn't know they just they believe in the power of usage and I would I would I would let out noises I do all right we're gonna conclude that segment with the honest our right that's great that's fantastic I'm gonna conclude this by saying and because you were you were really honest about that maybe ten more dollars nice um I'm gonna conclude this because I think you've been done great so if I've been very honest I've grilled you a lot you've been a great sport this is your chance to ask me anything what are our friends about whatever view you don't have to any questions for me you can turn the tables and um anything I don't have any questions for you but you know how you said that you had stuff that bothered you I've had stuff that bother me yes now I've heard you wanted if I forgotten and you actually did then my deepest apologies but my recollection it didn't so I'm gonna ask you my first movie Tyler Perry's Wilma D Halloween after the release and ever being in the red carpet I don't think I ever got a text from you yeah and I've never got a congratulations I never got a like anything and what I've always made sure to do as bad of a friend that I may have been in the thing when you have something I congratulate you whether it used to be through Twitter or recently your movie like I was stoked and I texted you right away to let you know and I don't feel like I got a congratulations for the right you probably guys congratulations you did get a text with a picture of the movie promo in the group squad group being like yo use if I see your movie poster so that's dope oh but that's still not the same congratulations I apologize for that I think this was after the pranking situation right maybe and I think I was just so like no this guy does not yes I think I was so and then I think it happened again with the second movie I don't think I got anything there either oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and that like to me and I remember I talked to somebody about it at the time I was like you I'm hurt because no um I think was a girl a song at the time I was like you alma hurt because again I got something from everybody and stuff but I felt like I was always there to congratulate you and be like your biggest fan but I felt like when it was my time you know to like apologize that's how you felt I've never once you feel that way it might have just been me being like yo I'm so salty about this prank and I'm solving it this is another thing to make up for that or acknowledge that and so I'm not gonna I think I did pull away like I said I need to be around and selfishly so I need to be around a certain energy and when I'm not I do pull away because I'm like not my mental health I'm not down with that that's probably following I apologize and I'm very proud of you and you're wonderful you did great you could just stop click baiting now okay anything else um alright so you've made it known you're not into me and all this stuff um I want to know right now with your busy career and your busy schedule and all that you got going on do you have love in your life right now are you trying to find love is it a is it something you want but it's not there because you're just so invested in career right now where are you in that if it comes your way are you going to accept it so possibly the latter this is my thing I'm not I'm not one of those people that's like oh I'm really lonely and so I really would like to be a relationship truthfully my so busy that time to feel lonely I have so many things going on I'm so career driven and the honest truth is if I was in a relationship I would be a really bad girlfriend you know previously during super when I was in a relationship and I was a bad girlfriend I don't like being bad at things I don't want to be a bad daughter I don't wanna be a bad friend I don't be a bad girlfriend and my life does not allow me to be a good girlfriend right now having said that if I met someone was like oh like you are really bringing out a part of me that is a part I love and you're really helping me be ambitious and you're motivating me and I gain a lot from us being together I would consider yes I'm against the idea but I'm not seeking any seeking make sense um so you obviously care about not just wanting to know I'm sure they wanted to know as well so um not not uh I know you care about your brand and you care about your business and you care about how it's perceived I mean there's a lot of celebrities who work with you so what you pull on average your views you can use to your advantage when your team is working towards business deals and stuff like that let's say there was a glitch on YouTube and your views that you're known to get weren't coming and there was something wrong with your channel and your adsense there was something hugely wrong so now when you're uploading video that you work hard on you're getting 300,000 views on your main channel and your adsense is like shut off and you know other people's are working just fine your videos get when you post go on restricted mode even though you're there you know they're not meant to be restrictive and you know there's something wrong because you're not being in people's recommended they would you not would that not be a concern for you and something where you'd stop and be live hold up something's wrong let me call somebody up on YouTube yo YouTube because you know Lilly superman' has the power to contact YouTube like that like you matter to YouTube and I will go as far as to say you matter to YouTube on a higher precedence than a lot of other creators do you're one of their top priorities so if that happened would you now as a content creator not be like at this I need this fix I'm you know you guys have to do something and not be concerned to you yeah that's a bigger question I went that whole YouTube restricted mode thing happened I'll openly said that my ad as far as I know was not reacted I make super PG friendly content so I do have a direct link with YouTube I did experience a downfall in views because of whatever algorithm changed because however my videos were being recommended and so what I did was I didn't change what I was doing on YouTube I did contact my YouTube partner manager like yo what's going on let me learn about this let me try to promote the new algorithm is let me do something to remedy this instead of just complaining about it right and this is something I've always had an issue with with creators is when something goes wrong on YouTube there is a sense of entitlement that's like oh well my money is not the same so f YouTube well why do you feel like you have the right to make money off your videos to begin with that is a first-world belief you can have the right to make money because you're the right to fuck videos up online but now you want to complain that you're not gonna make money off those videos because they don't satisfy where they're ad people want obviously that's how YouTube works they work off ads so if you want to sit there and complain saying but I want to do inappropriate things in my videos and get paid for them guess what you're entitled and that's inaccurate but it's my Adsense sub did go down I'm confident to say that I have my business in such a place where if my Adsense was at zero I have enough other revenue streams in my business to not make that destroy me I'm grateful to say that but it's not only luck it's also me proactively doing that which is why in the past I've told you and you can you can honestly tell them I've always liked Youssef you need to reach out to youtube mean to have a good relationship with these MCS you have a good relationship with YouTube because and I'm not being BS cut the BS when you say you too cares about you in your priority one of the main reasons as to why that is is because I am easy to work with I don't get as many views as a lot of other people there's people have way more views than me and so from a business standpoint they should be the priority maybe why I get things resolved on YouTube and they care about me because I'm easy to work with I'm not jumping on Twitter hating on YouTube when something goes wrong I'm not cutting them out rogering any of that stuff if I have to address something I do it in a professional manner so my channel fouseytube like it's mess right now it's not reaching the amount of reaching and the monetization as I said literally $400 in comparison to 8,000 and 12,000 I was on the phone with YouTube and I told them I said exactly what you just said I was like look I is a creator I'm not entitled to get squat if this is how much I should be getting then god bless that is a blessing from above I'm happy with it but if there's something wrong and it shouldn't be like this I deserve for that to be fixed because this is a business and I'm taking care of a couple of people and all I've been getting I've been working quietly behind the scenes for months hey YouTube something's wrong something's wrong because what happened on those two fousey when I came back two weeks in a row every video had a million views there was a bug in the system dropped to 300,000 flatlined Adsense got masta came to fouseytube started this journey with day 1 to 15 every video was getting a million views by 8 p.m. I missed an upload schedule by 5 hours algorithm got messed up everything got my stuff but the Adsense has always been messed up and I have been trying and trying and trying and my youtube person what they did they passed me on to somebody else and they said an email hey sorry we can't help you with this here's this person but can we be real honest in the past your relationship with YouTube you have not always been the easiest to work with is that true or false with YouTube no with companies other companies at YouTube not I've never had a problem with YouTube I haven't had a problem with YouTube and I haven't even had a direct thing because I used to have a manager I used to have an agent all that so is that I you've told me in the past that there's some times when you wouldn't respond to them or you dropped out of things and things of that but we just has conversation upstairs so all I'm saying is that correct or something's wrong with your channel yes it fix it yes so there is right now expect to be like y'all I've been difficult to work with and now something's wrong so fix it right away it's not fixed right away it's been months it's been a month like it's been months for my channel but I've heard stories I've heard stories of other creators having their issues fixed and other people being prioritizing getting it fixed but come to mind and this is me a chance right now because I'm sure somebody at YouTube is watching this saying yo there are creators who wanna mend a relationship because I said that in all my emails I kiss their butts and I said I want a healthy relationship with you guys and I'm working towards that I'm contacting you now with no manager no agent and everything now help me work there now I'm waiting to get that back warranted because of everything that's happened in the past oh because there's uncle that's when I agreed to no because look then that's saying like I'm the pussy tubes the hardest person to work with in the in the system no there are so many more people who are like that but not everybody is getting the precedence to be taken care of on YouTube at this time we can talk about some more off-camera cuz I think we went overtime but the last thing I want to say is that I think a common thread here is that start caring what other Creators you know in this conversation at least 10 times you've mentioned other careers and what other peers are doing this that and I'm only talking about you and I and I understand but what I'm saying here is if we all work in the same business which we do we all fall under Google and they're the ones giving us our money if my boss if I know that I'm taking this for a second for an example if I know that I put in my work and I did my thing and I have my quality but my boss comes to me and goes oh there's something wrong here's this but then they go to somebody else and they go here's this it's like all up in my drink it's like why why am I get it where where's the issue here why am i why is every video that I post even when I'm praying on the top of the thing going on restricted mode why is um why am I not in the algorithm algorithm anymore what is going on here help me fix that helped me understand but my response hey we understand your frustration and we do value as a creator but unfortunately at this time we do not have a remedy to fix your issue although we do agree that there is an issue well the thing is you're not the only person going through that it's also good news also been other people in things I'm not to the extent of not and I beg to differ because you don't know that you don't know I've taught but the sources that I've talked to 9 out of 10 are not even close to the 90 percent percentile drop that has happened on my okay so I'll tell you what after this last room is done we're gonna go into our analytics uh-huh I won't have a conversation about that's fine I'm gonna look at your analytics that's fine I'll show you and you're gonna cuz I've showed other people and they were like why that's crazy like literally when I asked certain creators how much are you getting per this and they told me and then I told them mine you should see cuz I always knew when I used to create YouTube back in the day and I did I I do have a vendetta a lot of times against other creators I always said these youtubers saying I my audience I do this with my audience shout off their adsense and watch what happens when this ad pocalypse happened people were shitting bricks every conversation I was having behind the scenes is oh my god what is gonna happen I'm not getting $50,000 a month any more my life is over I need to get another job where I'm saying they're like damn what happened to the love but their issues are fixed and resolved so they're chillin now and now they're just happy that it's not happening to them so me somebody like look if the money and I that I don't have other revenue streams I don't have merch I don't I'm not doing other stuff and I do have merch but it's not something I do like I just wanted to do much for this project and the money is going to be for the charity I'm just saying I feel like as a creator men my frustrations and all that stuff either tell me there's nothing we can do about it and this is as it's going to be or let help me talk to fix this because like you said they gave you like suggestions I've done those suggestions as well but still I haven't had anything but I've seen other creators get theirs issues fixed great well we're gonna go through that others we're gonna figure it out I'm not YouTube I can answer questions I'm just a crater that makes content I want to end this line first of all say thank you to all of you for watching is very intense and what honest and wonderful I'm gonna actually say you were way more honest than I thought you were going to be I'm going to give you the rest of these $5 bills um you can give them let me get one thing yes your one kiss on the cheek just like as a friend cuz arrow what when Arabs say yeah say hi to each other they kiss each other on the cheek but yeah right yeah it was like girlfriend so now that that's out of the way um we will I just don't I just don't know what that has to be the the aim of this lunch there's nothing a name once you got here you like you may give them agility I'll give a kiss on cheek when I feel like giving you a kiss on me do you girl all right all right boom so thank you for joining on the path you know I want end this on a positive note by saying I know I gave you a really hard time you're a really really good sport and the actual point I want to get across I know I grilled you want to click made and I'm not agreeing on certain things the IATA here's the thing about you slip right is you do a lot of things to annoy me and I probably got a lot of things to annoy you - we both annoy chat but there's always gonna be a part of me that feels for you because we're friends and I care about you and so the real the point of this honestly is like even though I agree just disagree even sometimes on your you might be like your BS and you're so full of crap like that sometimes it doesn't mean I'm not going to support your journey it doesn't matter if I agree with their journey is the point of this it doesn't actually matter people agree with your journey or not doesn't matter if I agree that's not why you're doing it and for that reason I was still supported and if it's what you need to do I will support it I will give you money you can stay here for me to stay here as long as I get my work done on my F I will do whatever I can to support you and that's what I wanted to say and without leave you kiss on cheek because you're good sport and your good friend know thank you to all of you for watching let me know what you thought and let me know come below know who else should be a guest on ask Superman for super super honest cut the BS survive and I don't think any creators gonna have that intense of an

Zoop I will see you next month on a date I will let you know about me [Music] 
- I ain't got none of my lights with me, so there's mad shadows on my face. Oh gee! (neighing, hooves clopping,
and chiming sounds) What up, everyone! It's
your girl, Superwoman, and it's story time with Lilly! Today, I decided to do
something a little different. Instead of doing a Q&amp;A or drawing my life, I thought I would tell
you my childhood stories through acting them out. I am an actor. Now, these are real stories, so sit back, relax, and enjoy getting to know the hot mess that is Lilly Singh. Lilly song. I was born on September 26th,
1988 in Scarborough, Ontario, which means what up, Canada! (slurping sounds) To start off, as a kid,
I was super stubborn. Which makes a lot of
sense, because as an adult I'm also very stubborn. Just kidding! I'm not stubborn, I swear. I'm not stubborn, and nothing
you say can change my mind, so shut up. Shut up! No, but for real. I was a handful, and my parents will even
not be hesitant for a minute to tell everyone what
a annoying brat I was. I remember one time, I got in
trouble for this one thing, but to be honest, it wasn't even my fault. (ball thudding on wall) - [Lilly As Her Mother]
Oi! Stop throwing the ball! You're going to break something. - Oh my god. No I'm not, mom! Trust me, I'm really good at this. - [Lilly As Her Mother]
Lilly, I said stop. - Mom! I said I know
what I'm doing. Trust me! (ball thuds and clock crashes) (table shatters) (screams) I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - But I vividly remember this day because that was the day
I learned how to run. That's right. I was Usain Bolt before Usain Bolt was Usain Bolt. I was throwing this ball,
and I hit this damn clock which, by the way, was like a
circle with spikes around it. Child safety, okay. What the eff was this, Game of thrones? Why the hell was that clock in my house? And this goddamn hoe clock fell through a glass table and broke, and I remember just running. Running down the hall, out my front door, into the street. I was just like, yo, I am safer in oncoming traffic than I am with my mom right now. You see, because back in those days, kids, things like "child services" and "parenting techniques"
didn't really exist, okay? Like today, you get in trouble like you might get your
phone taken away. Maybe. Back in the day, you got
your limb taken away. Just kidding! I'm not, I'm kidding. That's, that... (laughs nervously) What? Do you hear that? Do you hear that? It's all the kids with immigrant parents that
are just like "preach!" Here's the thing though, right? Not only was I stubborn when it came to my parents telling me to do and not do certain things, but I also always had a point to prove. This one time, I was mad at my parents, and I decided as a goddamn 10-year-old that I no longer needed them. So this is what I did. - I'm gonna run away!
And live in the washroom! I'm in the washroom! And I'm living here. - [Lilly As Her Mother] Okay. - I swear, I'm so mad in here right now! - [Lilly As Her Mother] Have fun. - Yo, young hoe Lilly, who do you think is gonna
be negatively impacted by you living in the
washroom? You're so dumb! This is why you should've
watched less Power Rangers and read more books, ya moron! Now aside from being a stubborn brat, I was also very passionate
about things as a kid. 'Cause I wouldn't just like things, no, I'd become obsessed with things. And one of those things was Bollywood. (Bollywood music plays on TV) Once I fell in love with Bollywood, it's not like I just watched Bollywood. No, don't be ridiculous. I was Bollywood. I was
a Bollywood actress. I'd dance like them, I'd talk
like them, I'd sing like them. Obviously, I was up in my bedroom performing bomb effin' concerts like them. (Bollywood music) ("Dharma Mix" by Udit Narayan) Real life picture of me as
a kid with Madhuri Dixit, who was my favorite
Bollywood actress growing up. Thank you, universe, for
validating my obsession. Now, another one of my obsessions should come as no surprise to you. And that was WWF, which
is now known as WWE. What up, my OGs. Back in the day, Monday Night Raw used to play at nine p.m. on Mondays, but here's the thing. Every once in a while,
they would cancel it for curling. I know what you're thinking. "What the eff is curling?" Curling is this damn sport
where they throw this boulder thing on the
ice, and they take this giant toothbrush and they
(imitated curling sound). It's ultra Canadian. (slurping sounds) And when that would happen,
they would cancel wrestling, but they would air it at two a.m. So what did I do? I set my VCR. Kids, VCR is like
iCloud, but with a cassette. And I would record it overnight and then wake up at six a.m.
to watch it before school. And that, my friends, is how this tomboy got all the boys to come to her desk to know what's happening. I was like a dealer, a negotiator. Like yo, you wanna know what happened? Last night's fight, yeah? Bring me your best Sailor Moon cards. Right here. Let's make a deal. Specifically, I was
obsessed with The Rock. Is this, I feel like this might be the first time you're hearing this, but I really, I was a fan. A very large fan of The Rock. And it might have showed, like, a little. - Hi, what's your name? - Hey, my name is Lilly. What's your name? - Jessica. - It doesn't matter what your name is! (Jessica cries) - Picture me posing with a
cardboard cutter of The Rock while I was obsessed as a kid. And boom! Real life picture
of me with The Rock. Thank you, Jeebus. Strangely enough, I wasn't
just obsessed with The Rock, but I was also obsessed
with collecting rocks and making little stories out of them. - What do we have here? Oh! There's diamonds in this rock. But don't tell anybody, or
they'll try to steal it from us. (sinister laughter) - Growing up, I had
the hairiest arms ever. And I know off me saying that, you have a visual in your mind of what you think it was like. I need you to multiply that by four. It's four times worse than
whatever you're envisioning. No exaggeration. It wasn't even hair. I
basically had feathers. I basically had wings. Like, I don't understand
how during gym class, when I did jumping jacks,
I didn't just take flight. I swear. You think Red
Bull gives you wings? Nah. Okay, Being a brown
girl gives you wings. And for a long time growing up, I was super embarrassed of my hairy arms. So I would always cover them. - Aren't you hot in that sweater? - No. - Now, eventually I stopped giving an eff, because also eventually
my mom let me wax my arms. That's how I made Manjeet's wig. At a really young age,
I developed a fear of spiders and clowns. And that is because my
cousins forced me to watch the movie "It." ("It" plays on TV) - I'm not even scared. (ominous music) - You know what's stronger than fear? Your stupid effin' pride!
I was like seven years old fronting like "no, I'm not scared." Shut the eff up! You were scared, Lilly, of the goddamn witch in Snow White. The Disney witch! Who you playin'? And now this year, they're remaking "It" to eff up even more kids. And I am here for it, to be honest. Also, wait, you know what? This video's pretty long. To be continued! (makes explosion noise) No, but for real. Wait for part two. It's gonna be my very next upload. Learn more about me and my childhood. I promise there's twists
and turns and stuff. I tell you about my tail that I have. There's, I don't know, Is
this how you do clickbait? Is this? Teach me how to clickbait! ♫ Won't you teach me how to clickbait? ♫ Won't you teach me how to clickbait? Go to the end card! Yo! Did you like that video? You can let me know by

(unicorn gallops and neighs) (logo whooshes) - You'd think someone would have said something about the sweater. - It's such a big company. Not one person was smart enough -- - Good morning, Lilly.
- Morning. (sighing) - Well, how are you
doing this fine morning? (coffee splashing into mug)
- Fine. - Just fine? (laughing) Why so glum, chum? - Listen, dude, I'm not in the mood. - Wow, someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. (laughing) - No. No, no one woke up on the wrong side of the bed, you know why? 'Cause that doesn't make sense. It's a bed, not a road. (light jazz music) (whistling) - Hey, your recent video about goldfish just got de-monetized. (phone ringing)
(clearing throat) - What the F? How, there's only two ways
and neither of them work. I'll take a small ginger tea. - So, one tall ginger tea. - Why did you just do that? - Do what?
- Correct me? Look, you know what I
meant by small, right? - It's called tall, though. - No, actually, everywhere else on the planet calls it small. - Okay. - Yeah, you can't just
change the name of a size. That's not how language works. - So, it's gonna be $2.99. - Yeah, you know what,
I'll pay by fiddledoodle. - What?
- Oh, fiddledoodle? Oh, you don't know what that is? Yeah, it's the name of my card in my secret language I just invented, and now I'm judging
you for not knowing it. - Here you go. - Hey, your recent video about rainbows just got de-monetized. (sighing)
(cup slams onto desk) (phone charger chimes) (phone charger chimes) (phone charger chimes) (phone charger chimes) (phone charger chimes) (phone charger chimes) - I will kill you. (phone charger chimes continuously) - Hey, your new video
about being a good person just got de-monetized. And age restricted. (papers thudding) - (laughing) Wait, wait,
did you see that photo of the sexy kangaroo? - Are you kidding me, it's my lock screen. (both laughing) (door slams)
(sighing) - Worst day ever. (phone thudding) (screaming) (horn beeps three times) God damned! What the eff? Where the hell did you, (sighing with exasperation) the eff did you, come on, where the, Jesus Christ! What, what is this, a black hole? There's one place, one
place this coulda gone. What in the eff? (both laughing quietly) (door slamming)
Jesus Christ. (exhaling heavily) (panting) (screaming in frustration) - (laughing) You doin' all right, pal? - Someone woke up on the
wrong side of the bed. - No, no, shut up, okay? Shut up, okay? I am having a horrible day,
and none of your little cheery little attitude
little pats on the back, your Polly Pocket effin'
movements are gonna help, okay? Nothing is gonna make this day better! (phone chiming) (laughing) Hey, look at this picture
my friend just sent me. It's a cat stuck in plastic. It's a cat meme. - Huh. (laughing) What a guy, a cat stuck in! (laughing) (door slamming) Oh there's a cat! (laughing) (playful music) (car horn beeping) (Lilly screaming) (Lilly screaming) (car horn beeping) (screaming) What, what? - Go. - [Lilly] Remember when you broke my lip? - Yeah, uh-huh. (crew laughing and clapping)
(slapping counter) (door slams) - Yo, if you wanna make
one of your friends happy, send them a meme, send
me memes, I love memes. If you liked this video

♫ Go, go Power Rangers - Hi, I'm RJ. I've been a Power Ranger for two years and been dating Lilly for nine months. - Yeah, we first started dating when he caught my eye and I asked my friend
Becky to introduce us. Okay girl, serious question. Is Ivan Ooze actually dead? Because I'm just saying,
he probably is still alive and kicking it with Tupac. - I told you, I know
absolutely nothing about this entire spandex era, I'm 20. - Ooh, ooh, excuse me, hi, can
you help me open this please? - That's simple. - Ooh girl, who's that? - It's a, RJ. He's the blue Power Ranger. - Blue? - Who's the black ranger then? - Ludi Lin? - Lin? Who's the yellow ranger then? - Me. - What? 2017, okay. 2017, okay. Cool, introduce me. - I can do that, I could hook it up. - Yeah, yeah, okay, I'll
see you for lunch later? - I've got the whole saving
the world thing to do. - Blah, what about dinner, Chipotle? - Be there. - Okay, truka, oh some RJ. I love dating someone who's so
passionate about their work. Like he loves being a Power Ranger, but sometimes, he can't turn it off and it turns me off. - So, you ready for morphine time? - Sure. - Imma go so megazorb. - Okay. - To be honest, I hope you
ready for this triceratops. - Babe, can we maybe try like not talking? Maybe, you know? - Okay. Yeah.
- Okay. I'm down.
- Okay, okay cool, cool. - Blue Ranger! - Oh my god, babe! - Okay, I'm sorry. I take it, I take it, I'm sorry. (sings Power Ranger theme) It's cute, you like it. You don't like it. You don't, okay. I pushed it with the second half, huh? Lilly's very supportive, okay? But sometimes I do get the feeling that she doesn't respect or know the importance of our job. - You're telling you
just went from the green to the white ranger, just like
no one asked any questions? White isn't even a color. - It's alright. - It doesn't make any sense, RJ. - Give me time, give me time baby. Hello? Zordon, what's up? - [Zordon] RJ, there's no time. The fate of the universe is in your hands. I need you--
- Oh my god, Zordon, can you let us live for one night? What the F? - [Zordon] You don't understand. - Listen, we're on a date. Okay, maybe you should do the same. Can't you holler at Siri or something? - [Zordon] Lilly, you
know I have an android. - You do know that though. - You know but really, from
green to white with the flu? That isn't even look he's playing the flu. It's questionable. Some of my friends think it's weird that I'm dating a Power Ranger but it doesn't even bother me. Oh my god, so yesterday, I accidentally used Alpha 5 as my vacuum. (laughs) In my defense, he looks
exactly like my Dyson. Hey, sorry.
- Hey, babe. I'm late, I came straight from work. What's up? 'Sup? What's up, man? Rough day. - Let's go dance. - Well yeah, the
relationship is definitely had some obstacles, you know. How could you do that? - It was a mistake, babe. - You made out with another dude. - Okay, it was a costume party
and he was dressed up as you. Becky, help me out. - Becky, you better not say nothing. - Dude was in a wheelchair. He was clearly not RJ. But I mean, he was kinda cute so, I get it. - The whole thing is
definitely confusing at times. It's like a whole new world. - Yo, we gotta go.
- What? - Rita is up to no good. - Get up, move. I gotta get ready. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. How did you get in here? And who's Rita? - She's pure evil, okay? - Pics or it didn't happen. - Seriously. I'll go to her Instagram. - Isn't that whatsherface
from the Capital? Can't Katniss handle her? - Zordon's say we have to go. Sorry. - We gon' talk about
that when we get back. - And there was definitely moments where he's delusional. - You know, Transformers
is so unrealistic, like really big robots fighting. Who would believe that? (Lilly sips loudly) - But we have a lot of fun together. - Yeah, yeah, definitely. (lively dance music) - Yup, we're Lilly and Billy for life. I love you babe. - I love you too. - You're so cute. - That spot, as you can
see, it's morphine time. - Stop. - What? - What up everyone? It's your girl Superwoman, that video's perfect. You know you like that video, give it a big thumbs up. Check out the trailer in the description and make sure you watch
the movie in theaters soon. You watch my last video right over there, bloopers of this video right over there. And you make sure you subscribe because I make new videos

(sleigh bells ring) (bell rings) - All right class, welcome. Why don't we go around the room and talk a little bit
about why we're all here. (light upbeat music) Not everybody all at once. - Hello, my name is Paulo and I am here so that I can understand my son. - Welcome. - Hey, my name is Stanley. I'd like to figure out what
my girlfriend sub-Tweets me. - Hi, I'm Will. I'm a Libra. West Philadelphia born and raised. And I'm here to learn how to promote my new movie, Bright, on the internet. - I'm Gabby and I'm here for the bingo. - Okay, all right, listen. The internet can be a scary place if you don't know the language, okay? Make one bad move and that's it. Hashtag your name is over
party trending on Twitter. Yeah, I've seen it happen before. So let's start with the basics, okay? Compliments. Will, let's say your daughter
has a new hairstyle, okay? How do you tell her you like it? - Something like, "Hey baby girl, "love the do, you look pretty." - "You look pretty," that's cute. And then she runs away from home because your words mean nothing. Okay, wrong, compliments on the internet need to be aggressive. - Like the insurance company. - Okay, no, that's Progressive. Aggressive, like, you know, "Girl, wrap "those braids around my neck and whip "'em back and forth until I turn "blue enough to be called Papa Smurf." - I'm sorry, so you mean to tell me, so people wouldn't be offended by that. - Lesson two, no on is
offended on the internet. Everyone is offendedt. - Tuh, tuh. - Tuh. - Tuh, tuh. - Tuh. - So everybody spells it wrong. - They don't spell it wrong,
they spell it with passion. Adding t to the end of
any word makes it better. Attacked-t, snatched-t. - Internet-t. - internet already ends
with a t, so you see that? You can't have the two
t's it doesn't work. - Oh, I'll have a t. - My girlfriend is always
tweeting about spilling the t. How can I help her be less clumsy? - Clumsy-t. - Let's get back on track, I think we're off the rails a little bit. Let's just, eyes up here, eyes up here. Because there is one major thing that is offensive on the internet. A big N-O. Never, ever, insult the K-pop group, BTS. Or the fandom will drag you. - Fandom, that's cute. So what is that, like a couple of people who are part of the same
chat or group or something? - Let's just say, you'd be
safer in I am Legend sis. - I'm a man, don't you mean bro? - Sis is gender neutral on the internet. Everyone's a sis, you're a sis. You're a sis, you're a
sis, everyone's a sis. - All right. - Unless you're hella fine,
in which case you're daddy. - That's me. - Also known as zaddy. - Maybe that's me. You saw me in Men in Black right? - Unless you're someones idol
because then you're their mom. - So if I'm a zaddy mom, then
my fandom is full of my sons? - Full of your stans. A fan is called a stan. - Present. - No, no Stanley, we're not
taking attendance right now. I'm just letting you all
know that a fan is a stan. - Cat in the Hat. - No, Paulo we're not
rhyming right now sis. You get that we're not rhyming, right? Just a fan is a stan. - Not rhyming, I am sorry. - You don't need to be sorry,
I'm just letting you know. - Not sorry? - That's okay. - No, I am sorry. - I get it, but you
don't need to be sorry. - So, no sorry. - Do you do private classes? - I no sorry. - I heard some kids the other day talking about sliding into the PM's. So that means like,
coming home late, right? Something like that? - PM's? - Well yeah, it's like,
"Yo, I gotta go home. "It's getting late,
sliding into those PM's." - Well, PM's also spells PMS. So we don't wanna slide into that. (he murmurs) Sliding into those DM's though, you know. That means direct messaging, someone trying to get jiggy with it. ♪ Na, na, na, na, na, na, na ♪ - Oh, okay, trying to
get textually active. (she snaps) - Bingo! - Gosh darn it. - Any questions? - Yeah, why is there a person
holding a camera on my face? - Oh, just ignore that. Just shooting a little behind
the scenes for my channel. He's my BTS guy. - BTS videos are lame. (room shakes and rumbles) - What have you done? - [Group] Ahhhhhhh! - Drag him. - He's canceled. - [Group] World star,
world star, world star! - World star! - Hashtag Stanley is over
party trending on Twitter. That was quick. - Should we help him? - Nah, he'll be fine. The internet has an
hour of like, 96 hours. Remember coney? - What? - Exactly, one more thing. If you look good, you're a snack. If you're like a couple, you ship them and they're your OTP. If you're sassy, you're a sav-id. That usually leaves people a little shook. Especially if you serve
that t in small dose, you know what I mean? Sprinkle it just a little,
like salt bae, like? - Okay, a little salt bae. How can I promote my movie? - Well, what does the word Bright mean? - Not dark. - I guess you could say, it's lit. - Ahhhhh! (upbeat music) - Lit-t, with a t at the end. - Because it has two t's. - He don't get it. - It doesn't work, it's already a t. - Not paying attention. - Snap, crackle, pop! Look who I shot a video with! - Will Smith. - God damn, check out his new
movie, Bright, on Netflix. Right now, information in the description as well as his new YouTube channel. So check that out. Last collab over there,
second blog channel. Make sure you subscribe because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday. One love, zoop! That is a wrap and zoop! You the man though. - Hmmmmm. - Okay.

Comment below, let us know what you thought, check out my last collaboration right over there, my second vlog channel and watch Jumanji coming out December 20th Links in the description make sure you subscribe because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday One love superwoman; that is a wrap and...zoop! You smell great. Don't leave. 
(unicorn hoof beats clattering) (mellow music) - Hi, welcome to Sefora, with
an F because of copyright. (ding) - Yeah I'm looking for some new lipstick. - Great, what did you have in mind? - I don't know. I mean my personality kind of sucks so I'm looking for something to fix that. - I have the perfect thing. Try our new Talk Filter line. - What the hell is a talk filter? - Try one. - Sexy Rouge. Hm, sounds like a porno crayon. - Girl French makes
everything sound like porn. - Touche. I don't see what the big
deal about this lipstick is. Like, it just makes me want
to climb on this table, wrap my legs around you
and bite your lower lip until it hurts. What the hell? - Sorry sister, you're
barking up the wrong tree. - I know, oh my god I'm so sorry. I just, I just feel like a coach you know, and you're a gymnast. I just want to come over there
and try to make you flip. - Doubt it. - Maybe you've just never experienced a woman who's done it right. - That's because I am the
woman who does it right, sis. Makeup wipe? - Yeah. (laughs) I am so sorry. I am usually not that forward. - That makes one of us. (laughs) - What is this one? Nerdy Nights, ooh. I really don't get how
this lipstick works. It's almost like the
pigment from the lipstick is affecting my Broca's area, which is formed by the pars triangular and pars opercularis of the interferior frontal gyrus therefore affecting my
production of speech. (gasps) - I didn't know Sheldon
Cooper was a cute brown girl with cute little boobs. - Aw, these old mammary glands. - Here try this one. - You know darling, I've
been here for what seems like an eternity and someone
has yet to offer me an iced latte, or at the
very least a moist towelette or a hydrating face mist. - From ladies free before
10 club, to country club, like that.
(snaps) Bougie Pink - Be a love and show me some products from the Michael Kors line. - Michael Kors doesn't have a beauty line. - Well I'll tell you this. My life is becoming more and
more difficult by the moment. - Do tell. - First my barbaric driver bumps the curb and nearly breaks my pearls. I've been here for a lifetime
without an iced latte and it's been 20 minutes since I've sniffed
anything lavender scented. - Girl I'm going to need one of those. - Isn't it sad that I feel
the need to wear makeup or society won't accept me? (melancholy music) - Buzzkill Gray. - I'm a slave to the social constructs that have been embedded into my psyche and now I feel like if I
don't have a strong highlight on my cheek I am unworthy. - Well, it's not completely wrong. - Ooh, Liar Liar. Sounds fun. Where is this one? - Sorry, we're all sold out. We just sent a huge
shipment to the White House. But try this one. It's Nicki Minaj's new nude shade. - This lipstick be so poppin', feel like Barbie when I'm talkin'. Boys want cookies and cream. I'm like this ain't Baskin Robbins. Ain't no floppin' when I'm droppin'. Ain't no croppin' when I'm flauntin'. The whole pic is so lit,
ain't no face to fix in it. Put moscato in my glass and
there ain't no mixing it. Yeah my money is my crew. Yeah my money is my fetus,
all the rest are my sons and you ain't gone beat us. - Girl, my wig just flew all
the way off to South Korea. - That was exhausting. I need something more simple. Like this. I don't like to complicate things, you know like makeup and relationships. Honestly, sometimes I feel like I should just date my brother. - What? - Yeah I mean that way
I wouldn't even have to change my last name. - Forbidden Romance. Take that off. Incest is nasty. Unless you're Jon Snow and Daenerys, and in that case yas. - Wait what's this one? Old Taylor Swift. Okay I have to try this. - Sorry girl, she's discontinued. Yeah like her way. - What happens if you mix the lipsticks. - Let's take this one
and let's take this one. - I just want your phalanges
all over my epidermis. I want to increase your
production of oxytocin. - Let's try these two. - This one is for the gentleman with the rather booming
system, top lowered, air conditioning with the cooling system. When I arrive at the
venue he is blazing up. Got investments on
deck, must be saving up. - This is so fun. One second. (laughing) You gonna buy something or not? (booming) - [Lilly] What the hell is top filter? - What do I say? (laughing)
(beep) - Do it one more time
where you're almost like, Michael Kors doesn't have one. - Perfect, more (bleep). - Yeah exactly.
(laughing) It's like the pigment is
affecting my Broca's area which is formed of the pars
triangular pars operculis? (beep) Which is formed of the pars
triangular and pars opercularis interfer--- Pars opercularis... - [Kyle] Of the interfer-- - Of the interferior frontal... - [Kyle] Gyrus. - Which is formed by the pars triangular and the pars opercularis
of the interior designing. (beep)
It's almost as if the pigment from the lipstick is affecting my Broca's
area which is formed by the pars triangular and pars opercularis-- (screaming)
(beep) Formed by the pars triangular
and pars opercularis of the interferior gyrus
frontal lobe of my production. (laughing) Frig! Is formed by the pars
triangular and pars opercularis of the interferior frontal
gyrus therefore production my-- Oh I was so close. Frig, F me, F me. (laughing) (boom) Hey thank you so much for

(neighing) - I will kill you. - I told you I didn't do it. - But you're lying. You were the only one
that was alone that night. - When? - When you went to the washroom. - You think I faked needing to go pee so I could steal your watch? - I don't know. I'm just saying when you
came back downstairs, your bladder didn't look any different. - What does that even mean? - Yeah. And I know you need the extra
cash for Kevin's birthday. Oh my god, you know what? You probably sold it on Craigslist. - I'm an engineer, okay? I don't need extra cash. Kevin and I broke up. - Okay, so then you
just want to meet Craig. Makes sense. - Hi, Kardashians. I'm looking for my sane friends. What the hell is going on? - Lilly's acting crazy and
thinks I stole her watch. - Wait what? - Okay I don't think, I know. - Lilly?
- No yeah. Erica's my best friend. She knows me. I have expert intuition and
I am 2,000% sure about this. Erica, tell him. - You stole my best friend's
watch you piece of trash. - Tell him. - Oh my god. - How did it feel? Did it feel good wrapped
around your evil wrist? - Oh my god. Oh my god, do you know what? I actually even remember you
wearing it the other day. - I've never even seen your watch, okay? That's insane. - I remember it, too. I remember thinking oh,
Rosco's wearing a watch. Cool. - Who even wears watches, okay? I have a cell phone. - So do I, but I like
the way it makes me feel. - She likes the way it makes her feel. - Yeah, sure I couldn't
always tell the time on it because it didn't have numbers, it had those fancy little markings. But still, it made me feel like a lawyer. - Yeah. We feel the defendant guilty as charged. How dare you disrespect my best friend? Come on, Lilly. Let's get out of here. - Mouth breather. - Dude, you're completely wrong. You let me borrow your watch last week. - Damn it. - It's okay. - Are you having a good day? I hope you're having a good day. You know how you can
help me have a good day? Hit that thumbs up if you like this video. You can check out my last
comedy video right over there. It's about honest therapy. My second vlog channel right over there. And yo make sure you subscribe. I make new videos every
Monday and Thursday. One love Superwoman. That is a wrap. And zoop. Yo, give me my watch son. Back off. 
(neighing) - What up, everyone? It's your girl Superwoman,
and it's story time with Lily! I thought I would tell
you my childhood stories through acting them out. Wait, you know what? This video's pretty long. To be continued, boom! One of the reasons I'm so big on feminism and empowering women,
especially young girls, is because growing up, I had
to hear things like this. - Girls shouldn't whistle. Girls shouldn't dance at weddings. Girls shouldn't talk too much. - So now, I've made it a point
to do all of those things. Why? Because when something is unjust, you don't just repeat the cycle of wrong. No, you make it right. So, ahem. (whistling) I've had a lot of really
good days in my life. You know, meeting The
Rock, meeting Selena Gomez, traveling to some dope countries. But still, one of the best
days of my life remains. You got me an N64? (screaming) (burping) N64 is the best system of all time, closely followed by Super Nintendo. Do not at me on this, do
not debate me on this. I will 007, Mario Party,
Banjo Kazooie your blood clot! On that note, a lot of times, when people hear the way I talk or see the way I dress, they assume I'm trying to
act like somebody else, and that couldn't be more wrong. When I talk the way I talk and dress the way I dress, I am being completely myself, and that is because I was born and raised in a place called Scarborough. My school was filled with black people and South Asian people, which means that everyone knew how to speak Tamil, everyone knew how to
speak Jamaican Patois. It was expected of everyone,
and that's what we knew. Our school dances only played reggae, dance hall, soka, rap, and hip hop. So if I didn't act the way I act and talk the way I talk, then I'd be acting like someone else. Ya dig? You don' know my youth. Snitches get stitches, ya hear me now? Speaking of stitches, I've had a few. In fact, once my head
cracked open on my birthday. It's my birthday, and I
get some birthday cake! (screaming) ♫ Happy birthday to Lily ♫ Happy birthday to you! True story, I was running
up the stairs on my birthday and I think I got distracted
by cake or something and I fell and cracked my head open. My mom fainted in the hospital because they were stitching up my eyelid. You see that, you see that right there? That's why my eyebrows
can never be on fleek. That, and because I never get them done. I've also gotten stitches on my hand. Basically, there was this computer game named Jill of the Jungle, where this girl, she would swing on vines in the jungle. So during recess one day, I was like, yo, we're playing hide and seek, I'm gonna hide in this washroom stall, but I don't want them to see my feet, so I'm gonna swing on the coat hook, just like Jill of the Jungle. Yay! It went through my hand. Ow, help me! Mrs. Parks! (screaming) Yeah, I was just hanging there with my hand through the coat hook. Boom, the receipts! Yeah, I got injured a lot as a kid, but one of the most memorable times was when I got a new bike, and I wouldn't admit that
it was too big for me. So I was riding the bike and I fell into the bar crotch first, and I was like, mm, that really hurt. So I went into the washroom, and: Mom! Now, I know what you're thinking, and no, it wasn't my period, but there
was still blood everywhere. And at that age, I didn't get why my mom was so concerned, and she was outside the
washroom door just like, "Please, God, make sure she
didn't bruck up her uterus. "You know I only had kids
so I could have grandkids." It turned out I just
got a cut in the area. That's right, you see, normally girls only have to experience that
pulling down the underwear and seeing blood once in their life. But me, nope, twice. I had a pet cat named Oreo, and he was my best friend! And then he ran away. Your my bestest friend in
the whole, entire world. No, no! (crying) I was so devastated about it, but his favorite food was Lucky Charms, so obviously, I knew what to do. Now we wait. Spoiler alert, I never found him. It was fine though. It was actually extremely painful and traumatizing, to be honest. In school, I was an overachiever, and to be honest, the teacher's pet. I was even valedictorian in grade eight, and also very naive. And I just know we'll be friends forever, because that's how real life works. (applause) A moment of silence for all the friends we thought we'd have forever. In grade 11, my family
moved from Scarborough and to another town, but I still kept going
to the same high school, but had nowhere to go after school, because I couldn't go home. So, I used to go to my
best friends' house, and they were two Tamil twins. So, basically, I was part
raised by a Tamil family, which is why I'm so
proficient in the language, and I can pelvic thrust
like my life depends on it. (Tamil music) - [Woman] Oi, Lily, come down and eat! - Mummy! (speaking in Tamil) Being an overachiever
wasn't just in school. No, in life in general, it
used to really bother me, and continues to really bother me if I don't do a really
good job at something. Back to that obsessive behavior. So, even my first job at Harvey's, which is a fast food restaurant, even though it was a
crappy job, I was like, no, I will be the best employee ever. (heavy electronic music) Your burger and fries, ma'am. - [Customer] Took you long enough, loser. - Have a great day! As I grew up, I had a bunch of jobs, and they were all kind of crappy. The worst, though, was when I
worked at a collection agency. Lord help me! Hello, I'm calling about
your outstanding payment. - [Man] Shut the (censored) up! You (censored) suck my
(censored), you (censored). - Okay. Hi, hi, yes, I'm following up on that outstanding hydro bill, remember me? - [Man On Phone] I'm a
little busy right now. - Oh, oh my, did you
want me to call you back? I could call you back in like two minute? Or, like, five? I don't mean to be offensive. How long do you think you need? I don't wanna assume. Not to mention the boss
was 100% verbally abusive. - Hey, what the hell are you doing? Are you stupid, are you crazy? You're wasting my money. Are you mental? - Aka, the type of boss that
I will never be in my life. Yo, shut up, I'm trying to
make a video, you stupid! I'm just kidding, there's no one here. I'm all alone! (laughing) And that's my childhood in a nutshell. Of course, except for all
the other dramatic and really heartbreaking stuff that happened. But this is a comedy channel. I'll save that for my
episode with Dr. Phil. Hey, hey, now that you know me, the ins and outs of Lily Singh, the person behind Superwoman, go ahead and click subscribe, because, yo, I'm clearly a well-developed,

card, get out of here! Yo, sorry to cut this video in two, but I did it, and it was

That is a wrap and zoop 
- If your friend sent you this video to watch, there's a reason. (hoofbeats) (whoosh) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman, and since the beginning of
time y'all have been asking me to do the video "Types Of
Guys In Relationships". And every single time, I've ignored you. Why? Because I can't write about
things I don't know about, okay. It's been since forever
since I dated someone. Like honestly, my most recent boyfriend? He bought me an iPod
Shuffle for my birthday. But my friends date people, thus, Types Of Guys Your BFF Dates. So grab your BFF, grab some popcorn, grab a booty 'cause it feels
noice, and get ready to relate. Number one, the Flaming Hot Cheeto. Now this is the guy your BFF dates that is hot as hell, okay. I'm talking mus-cles,
chiseled jaw, boy band charm, but has the IQ of a Cheeto. Beyond good looks, there's
just nothing there. So, Alex, what do you do? - I chill. Do my thing. - Do your thing. And, and what is your thing? - Pfffft. Spend time with Lauren. - (sighs) Does that pay well? - Hmm? - It, it was a joke. - Who's there? No wait, you say knock knock. - You get me water? And here's the most shocking part, right. Usually when you ask this dumb person, "Like yo, what do you do for a living?" You cannot even fathom their response, you're just like hoe, how? I mean your job. Like, what is your job? - Oh, I'm a financial planner. - I'm sorry, what? - Pfffft. Financial means money. I help people decide what
to do with their money. Excuse me, I can't decide what to get, 'cause there's no pictures in this menu. You know what? I'll just have the chicken par mesian. - Parmesan. - Bless you. - Then when you talk
to your girl, just like "Yo girl, what, honestly what
the eff is happening here?" She's gonna respond with some trash like-- - I just love his personality. - "I just love his personality!" Gah, you love his personality when he ain't wearin' a shirt, get real. But you know, I can't even
hate it, I'm just jealous. Girl, live your life. Number two, the potential queen. So you're meeting your best friend's boyfriend for the first time, and something just seems a likkle bit off. So you go through the
following thought process. It's so nice to finally meet you. - Same. Uh, by the way, your hair looks great. - Thank you! Ah, a man who appreciates
the little details. - Hi there, could I get um, a Cosmo? - Same. - See, that's nice. I love when a dude is secure
enough to order a girly drink. So, Alex, what kind of music are you into? - A little bit of everything,
but loving Fifth Harmony. - Oh. That's really openminded. But also what? - And also, Alex loves football. He's obsessed. - Oh, okay. There we go, that's like a
stereotypical dude thing. - Seahawks? Yasss. - Wait... was that yes, or yas? - Yas. - Spell it. - Y... (suspenseful music) A, S. Yas.
- Yas. - Girl, he gay. My friend's just like,
"He's not gay, okay, "he's just sweet and
understanding and sensitive and... "holy crap, he's gay." - Number three, the waste man. Now this is the dude your
best friend dates, that you've probably already heard about
through the grapevine, okay. Or you probably even met him before when he was dating one
of your other friends, or he's even accidentally
hit on you once before. Or he just has that goddamn smile where you wanna knock his teeth out because he's definitely a player. So, how long have you two been dating? - One month, ah, three months.
- Three months. - Mm-hmm. And where did you meet? - My ex's birthday party. Yeah.
- They were having problems. - She had trust issues. - Right. (soft digital clicking sounds) - [Waitstaff] You guys ready to order? - Well hello, Jennifer. What a unique name, is that Irish? - Jennifer is a unique name, really? - Oh, and that smile, wow. - Jennifer Lawrence. Hudson. Aniston. - You have Insta? - Lopez, Jennifer Lopez. No? No? Here's the thing about the player, right, he's also somehow a
hypnotist, because your girl is just blind to everything
that's happening. Like homegirl stared at the eclipse without those special
glasses, now you need to like, spell it out for her in braille. She'll say things like "He's just being social and polite, okay?" Yeah, yeah he's being
polite with his penis, girl. Wake up. Number four, the catch. All the annoying guys your
best friend could date, this one is quite possibly
the most annoying. Why? Because he's wonderful. - And for our anniversary, he planned a surprise trip to Hawaii. It was so romantic. - Hawaii? - (sighs) She's too kind. And enough about us. Tell us about you, Lilly? - I've never been to Hawaii. (phone ringtone) Oh, aw, I'm so sorry, this is so rude. It's Kevin.
- Oh, okay, yeah. - Um, I have to take
this, but I'll be back. Excuse me, excuse me, hey buddy! - Kevin is the child that Alex sponsors. - What?!
- Yeah, he saved his life. - Really?!
- And he just adopted a dog for him! - Heh. - The dog only has three legs,
but Alex believes in him. - Hmm. - He's also really good in bed. - What?! - I said this bread,
it's really good bread. (sighs) He's also really good in bed. - Dammit! Like where did you find this perfect man, and how can I obtain one? No straight up, because, you
know, just those rare moments where you're just like "This guy "is too good for my trash friend", okay. I know that sounds
mean, but let's be real. Some of your friends are trash. I knew this one girl, she was a jerk. She was such a jerk! She used to drive past the speaker and the first window at
a drive through, okay. And then just take whatever
paid for meal was provided. Just like "Oh, thank
you, this is my order." Hoe, that's not your order. And I'm just like, how girls like that get sweet guys like this? You know, hold up, just sec. Hello, Karma? Yeah, where you at? You want me to drop a pin? Number five, the quirk! So this dude seems pretty normal and nice, and you're like "Holy hell, did my girl actually find a decent
human being, like congrats!" But then. So then I said, "It
takes one to know one." (loud, grating laugh) - You, you take one, and
if you don't take it, you don't know it!
(wheezing and cackling) Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, alright. (sighs) Can we have the check? - They have some effin'
weird tendency or quirk that your friend can't see
but is driving you insane. - This was so much fun, we
should definitely do it again. - Mm-hmm! - Yeah, for sure, let
us know your se-zual. - My what? - Your se-zual.

- Skedgeual. - Sezual. Schedule. - That's what I said. - Anyways, you know what

that is a wrap and zoop! 
- Dis video about to have more characters than your recent tweet. (horse neighs, hoofs clicking) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman! When I was younger, I used to be so intrigued by movie sets, actors, and pee-pees. And now that I'm older, I've had the chance to be
on a lot of movie sets, actors, and pee-pees. What? I wish. What? Huh? Moving on. And when my friends ask
me how movie sets are, I tell them they're awesome, but there are a few things about set life that are absolutely ridiculous. So, if you've never been on a movie set, here's what goes down. Number one: over-communication. Now there's a lot of
reasons to communicate everything that happens
on a set, you know. For efficiency, for safety,
to sound cool, et cetera. But sometimes it's a little overkill, not to mention it's not English. (straw slurping) Yeah, you know what? Let me get fill. Copy. Audition it. Striking. Striking! Copy. Spraying. Copy. Martini's up! Copy that. Last looks. Stepping in! Standing by. Camera speeds. Sounds speeds. Yup. Second sticks! Copy that. Second sticks! Copy. [Offscreen] Copy. Copy, copy that. Copy
you. Copy, copy, copy. (straw slurping) This is not an exaggeration, literally. And that language gets
engraved into your mind, okay? I be out there flirting
with boys just like: Stepping in. Hey, so I was wondering, did you want to like want to go for, I don't know, craft services
together sometime, maybe? - Maybe Saturday? - Copy that. You know, I finish
last looks at around eight, so why don't you pick
me up around magic hour? - Uh, kay. - Copy that, that's a wrap on flirting. (whispering) Excited in
my loins! Exiting Frame. That's right! My flirting is like a movie. You mean like the bloopers? Get the f outta here! Number two: job descriptions. On a set, every person
has a very specific job that they take super seriously. Which, basically means: yo, back the f up and respect my craft! No one does anyone else's job, no matter how minor it is. - [Voice Offscreen] Okay, pictures up! Uh, no, wait, no. We got a
little, uh, hair on her cheek. I could just... Hair, can we get hair? Oh yeah, there is a hair on the cheek. So, can you just? Hair is flying in! (dramatic music) (quietly) Okay. Uh, no, we got a little
bit of her tag in the shot. Can we get a wardrobe? Number three: hurry up and wait! Anyone who has ever been on a set is very familiar with this term. It basically means that you're
gonna arrive to set so early, they're going to tell
you to get ready ASAP, then once you're ready, you're going to wait anywhere
from two to five hours to shoot your scene. [Voice Offscreen] Thanks so much, Lilly. I'll come to get you when we're ready. Okay, sounds good, thank you! (clock ticking) [Voice Offscreen] We're
all set for your scene! (cane loudly clinking)
It's my time to shine! Straight up the younger and older version of Rose from Titanic was played
by the same actress, okay? They just had to move lights in between. Everything moves so
slow and takes forever. And that's wrap! (clapping) (sighs) 14 hours? Not bad. Uh, can we get a playback
on what we shot today? (mysterious music) Man, that's good. Wow. Wow. (clapping) It's beautiful. (louder clapping) Number four: blocking. Now the first time I went on
a set and someone was like: "hey, we're gonna go
through the blocking," I was like 'what the f is
someone gonna punch me?' But then I learned that blocking is rehearsing the movements of the scene. So like: you're gonna stand there, then you're gonna walk here, then you're gonna look there, then you're gonna hit that mark-all that. But here's the thing
about blocking, right? Sometimes you're expected to
not move like a human being. Uh, can I see the picture up? We got a little bit of
a glare. Tilt it down. More. More, little bit
more. No, no, too much. Split the difference. Up, to
the left. Little, little more. Little more to the left,
oh no right. Right, right. Tilt down. Perfect! Perfect, right there. Hit that exact same spot. For sure. Now I'm on set feeling
like a bad boyfriend because I can't hit the right spot and the director's out here
faking it to not me me feel bad. (sucks teeth) Okay, and action! I mean, oh yes! That was
the one, oh so good! Yes! (quietly) Can we just fix
it in post? Fix it in post. (louder) Oh, right in the
middle, that's the spot! When you have to dress
up like a male character just so you can hear those
words of satisfaction. I swear to god zoomed-in
Lilly I'm going to hit you. Mhm, bet you won't hit it right. Number five: creepy sound guys. 90% of the time I've been on a set, there's been a male sound technician. Which, by the way, why? Here's the thing about sound techs, right? Essentially, it's a complete
stranger approaching you, putting his hand up and down your shirt, taping things to your boobs,
sticking things in your bra with minimal, to no words
exchanged. Just like: My name's Chuck, can I
put this down your shirt? (tedious music) And 100% of the time,
this mic pack is freezing. Not once in my entire
life has it not been. Now, this might be a little cold. (fabric tearing) Yeah, we've got two, uh, nipple rips in the front of her shirt. Can we get wardrobe...and a hot chocolate? I swear to god, sound people
will always find a way to mic you, no matter what. I could be wearing a onsie, okay, no bra. I could be nude! And they'll just be like: 'yeah, okay, we're just
going to put the wire through your belly button,
you know out your left ear and just staple the mic pack to your-.' They'll find a way! Straight
up, I was changing once and then someone walked
in and they were like: 'yo, nice thong!' And I was like: 'um, that's just the mic wire.' Yeah, the sound was crap that video. Well hello there! If you liked this video,
give it a thumbs up! Comment below and let me know who was your favorite character
that I played in this video. My last video is right over there, bloopers to this video right over there on my second channel. Make sure you subscribe cause I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday. One love, Superwoman.

that is a wrap and zoop! 
- I cried three times
while making this video. (horse neighing and galloping) What up, everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman, and straight up, I'm not
scared of a lot of things. I'm gangster. I'm ruthless. Sometimes when I'm baking cupcakes, I don't even use a toothpick to double check if they're
cooked, because I'm crazy. Except for this one thing. - Guess what? I buy new Apple computer. - [Mother] What? I thought you went to go get a- - Oh my god, Lilly. I think someone posted your nudes. - Huh, how many likes? (ominous music) (sinister, dramatic music) (creepy vocalizing) Lame. (glass crashing) (screaming) - Nobody move. Nobody move! Put your hands in the air! Put your hands in the air! - Weak. - You think I'm playing around? - Lilly, I'm so glad we were friends. Although, watch out for that spider. (Lilly shrieking) (Lilly gasping for breath)
(Lilly shrieking) (creepy vocalizing) (shrieking) - I don't do spiders. Or, to be honest, any bugs. I know what people say, oh, they're good for the environment, but I'm just here like,
yo, I don't give an F about the ecosystem, Mother
Nature, or the circle of life. All of that can get in a
little bag and go F itself, because the many legs are dumb, and that many eyes, sis, no. Okay, why you need that many eyes? What, you trying to be
my YouTube username? Ah, bad choices. Bad choices from back in the day. Moving on, that's not
what this video is about. Because I'm so scared of bugs,
I'm hypersensitive to them. If I walk into a place, I will
be the first person to notice if there's a spider anywhere near me. - Hola. So nice to see you ... Oh. There's a spider over there. - [Friend] Where? - Ceiling, top left. Between the second and third tile. I'll wait in the car. - You know what I hate? When people say dumb things
like, "Why you scared? "They're smaller than you." (mocking noises) Like, what, are you dumb? You know what else is smaller than me? A bullet, a grenade, bacteria,
a pop quiz, a pregnancy test, a goddamn notification on my phone that tells me my mom is
following me on Instagram, the goddamn notification on my phone that tells me my mom liked
a picture of me on Instagram where I'm showing so much cleavage and the goddamn text message from my mom that follows that double tap. What kind of goddamn logic? Real talk, I'm not ashamed to say, if I'm at home and I see a bug, everyone is going to have
to stop what they're doing, and they're going to have to come save me. I don't care what time it is. (Lilly shrieking) Dad! Dad! Help me! - [Father] Where is he? Where is he? They are gone? - No, it's a spider! It attacked me! It came out of nowhere! - What the bloody hell? I thought you bloody getting murdered. - I am! I am! It's right there! Don't let it get away. Don't let it get away. Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew. Promise you got it. Promise. Double check. Don't flush it. What if it crawls up the drain? (Lilly sobbing and screaming) I know what you're thinking,
that I'm being dramatic. This is a skit. This is a YouTube video. This is all an act. No, no, this is how I actually am, because when I see a bug, I am
filled with irrational fears including, but not limited to, somehow, someway, this
spider is going to eat me. I don't care what you say,
this spider's going to eat me. If I look away, it'll
probably hide in my house literally forever. Not to mention it will probably lay eggs that will eventually infiltrate my brain. What if it jumps, what if it flies, and last but not least,
what if it chases me? Y'all know I can't run. Some people be crazy. Some people be doing
crazy things like camping. Let's go camping. White people. Are you dumb? Are you dumb? No, no, are you dumb? You want me to go into the
epicenter of where the bugs are and just lie there? You want me to sleep there? Like live bait? Hell nah. So much hell nah I just hit puberty. Hell nah. Although, I did go this one time camping, but, yo, I was prepared. ♫ Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya (off-tune recorder) ♫ Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya - Every once in a while,
I'll be home alone and I'll see a spider, and
I cannot explain to you the sheer panic that overcomes my body because no one is there to save me, the police will take
too long to get there, and I'm too scared to let it bite me in hopes of becoming Spiderwoman. So I have to take
matters into my own hands and enter survival mode. (dramatic drumming music) (Lilly shrieking) - Die! Die! (dramatic drumming music) (gun firing) Now, I want you to know
that that skit you just saw is nonfiction. Okay, I did not make that up. Those are all things I've
actually done to kill a spider. Every single one of them. I mean, except, obviously,
except for the one. I would never waste Cheerios. But I have tried to hairspray. Straight up, that spider looked like it belonged in High School Musical. (mimicking spider) But then I go through the whole debate of living things, a spider,
but then, yo, honestly, I feel like I'm a good enough
person otherwise, you know? If none of that works and the
bug disappears into my house, there's only one solution. (Lilly whistling) Yup. By the way, I'm looking
for a new place to stay, so if you're looking
for a roommate, holla! Real quick, before I go into the end card, I wanted to remind you that I have a wonderful campaign going on with Omaze. Basically, I want to fly one of you to my last tour stop in Singapore. All you have to do is
donate to my Omaze campaign. All the donations to towards
helping women around the world through the wonderful work of Unicef, so every donation makes an impact. When you donate, you are
automatically entered to win a trip for you
and a friend to Singapore to join me on the last
stop of my Bawse book tour. The link is in the description. I'll also put it right here. Go ahead and do that
because time is running out, and it's almost too late
to join the contest, so ... Go do that now. Okay, now do the end card, go. (drumming) Yo, I hope you enjoyed that video. If you are also scared of bugs,
give this video a thumbs up, because I need to know if this is just me. Also, you can check out my
last video right over there, bloopers for this video
are right over there, and make sure you subscribe, because I make videos
every Monday and Thursday and I would love for you to be there. Dubai, get your tour tickets,
I'm coming to you next. One love, Superwoman. That is a wrap and zoom. 
(bells ringing) - [Crowd] Four, three, two, one. Happy New Year. (cheering) - No one came to our New Years party. This is an epic fail. - Okay wait. Maybe they got the date mixed up? - I even borrowed my mom's
DVD player and everything. - We can still have fun, okay? Look what I borrowed from my stepdad. (gasp) - OMG, is that alcoholic? - Four percent. (screaming) - What are we going to
do when we're like, high? - We should do something
totally off the hook, man. We should make vision boards. - Alcohol and a ten year plan. (screaming) (energetic music) So what do you want in
the future, a space ship? - I want really big boobs
on evenings and weekends, you know like when I go
to a bar or something. But I want smaller, more
manageable boobs when I'm doing jumping jacks or wearing a
shirt with buttons in it. - I hate when my blouse has a boobie gap. It's so uncomfortable. - Me too. But in the future that's not gonna be a problem, they'll figure that out. What about you? - I'm starting this thing
called a YouTube channel. - Is that like a MySpace? - Kind of, but it's with videos. - Wait, videos online? That's never gonna work. We have Blockbuster. Just pretend it's SunnyD. - Okay. - [Both] Ew. (coughing) - I even feel it already. Is that a boy on your board? - Yeah. It's Kevin Jonas from Camp Rock. I just know he's going to be the biggest and sexiest star out of all of them. - I have Channing Tatum on my board. We're gonna get married
one day, I just know it. - Lucky. (giggling) (coughing) (heavy breathing) Okay, chillax. - In the future I want to finally
learn my correct bra size. - Oh, me too. And instead of just
wearing the same good bra every single day, I'm gonna
buy 10 of the same bra. - Totally. Because if right now I
take out my good bra, I put it into my laundry
basket, and then I cave/ - [Both] And I take it
out and put it back on. - Totally. We're so freaking gross. - So gross. - But I betcha the future
girls won't do that. I mean we probably won't
even wear bras in the future. - Totally. Evolution
is absolutely going to make us smarter and less sexist. We'll probably have like two
female presidents by then. - Yeah, and I bet that global
warming won't even be a thing. I mean, we can't possibly
ignore it for that long. - Totally. - I want an airplane. - Yeah. - It's so flippin' annoying to go to the airport and go through security. - Yeah. I can't wait 'til we don't have to take our laptop out of our backpacks anymore. - Or take our Crocs off. Hey, I wonder what BBM will
look like in the future. I mean, I can't imagine
Blackberries getting any cooler. - I wanna do a rap song with Soulja Boy before he gets, like, too famous. Can you imagine hearing your own song play on your iPod Shuffle? - That is so balling. I bet you by then rap songs won't even be about like, naked
girls and gross stuff. - Exactly, like how many more
years is that gonna work for? - I wanna marry someone
with a really stable job. You know, something that's
gonna be around forever. Ooh ooh, like a taxi driver. I mean people are always gonna need rides. - Or a mail man. - A mail man. - Okay, this is crazy. - Tell me. But I kinda want a digital
camera with like, 10 megapixels. - Shut the freak up. - 10. - 10 megapixels? That's like, super, super HD. - What's with the
picture of a messy table? Do you want a maid? - No. I know by 2017 I'm
gonna be married for sure. And one day when my husband
comes home after working a long shift at RadioShack
I'm gonna be mad at him. I'm gonna throw a tantrum
and take my Baby Phat purse and throw it right at his head, and then I'm gonna slam, yo but first I'm gonna say talk to the hand, cause
the face ain't listening. He's gonna grab me and then
he's gonna kiss me on the mouth and he's gonna put his
tongue behind my retainer. And then we're totally gonna
do it all over the table while listening to Closer by Ne-Yo. - Whoa. That's flippin' awesome. - Or I might have a maid if I'm rich. - You can win American Idol. Everyone who wins that
show will for sure be rich, famous, and relevant for a long time. - You know, I'm really glad we did this. You're my best friend. - We're totally going to
be best friends forever. - [Both] Like Katy Perry and Taylor Swift. - Thank you so much for
watching this video with. - Jena Dewan Tatum. - My new best friend. You should check out her YouTube channel, link is in the description. Go show her some love. My last collaboration is right over there. Second vlog channel there. Comment below because super 60 starts right now and make sure you subscribe because I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday. One Love Superwoman,
that is a wrap, and zoop. 
- Today is soon. Happy soon day! Sunday, Monday, soon day. Big news: I got merch. Y'all have been asking me since
forever to release new merch because it's been a minute. But I have this thing where if I don't do something I wanna do to the best of my ability... I didn't wanna just rush something, so for a long time I've
been working on merch. Some quality merch. And today I am happy to say
not only do I have new merch, but I have a long-term
sustainable merch plan, so get used to this. Shut up and tell us about the merch. Launching today, Tuesday,
December 19th, right now. What you talkin' 'bout, Willis? One. See the thing about Team Super is we don't just hope for our dreams, we hustle for our dreams. So, now while you hustle for your dreams, hustle in style with the

AKA I'm wearing it right now. That was my tata (laughs). Available in black and this red maroon, it's like a deep red... It's pretty, it's pretty. Cue montage. (hip hop music) Woo, okay. Am I done, nope. Four. See, the thing about Team Super is we don't just survive
life, no, we conquer life. So, while you're conquering
life like a boss, do it in style with the official like a
bawse long sleeve shirt. Available in black and

dad bod or your fit bod or any bod. Every bod is fine, we love everyone. Okay, now that's it. Just kidding. Six. See, here on Team Super we understand that unity is strength. In fact, we also understand that empowered women empower women. In fact, empowered people empower women. So, make sure you rep that with the official girl

official Team Super ring. I have worn this for like 10 years and it is so important to me, but here's the thing: this is limited edition, limited quant... There is only a thousand. I literally bought a thousand
rings and that is all. Now if there's 12.7 million

more meeting for today and sign me up for bootcamp. Three ways we can increase sales. - [Man] Mimosa's? (phone ringing) - Sorry, I got to take this. Hello? Mm-hmm (affirmative) Yeah. (people chattering) - [Bootcamp Instructor] 14,
15, is that all you got? - I know I'm not alone. - Yeah, uh, thanks for coming in. (alarm clock beeping) (lighthearted piano music) - [Cashier] No tomato. - Yup. - Here is a list of people
I would like to meet today. So, sales are still at 1% growth. Yeah, let me check. (people chattering) - [Bootcamp Instructor]
20, 21, keep going. - Thanks for coming in. (alarm clock beeping) (upbeat happy music) - One percent. I can double check. - Hey, egg sandwich, no tomato, right? - Yeah. - [Bootcamp Instructor]
39, 40, fastest now. - Thanks. (alarm clock beeping) - Sales are up 3%. Thank you so much. No, I won't let you down. - I actually have this friend
who's a big casting director. I'll totally introduce you two, if you eat this tomato. - That was great. - I did it, I did it. I got the part. (alarm clock beeping) Five percent. I know I'm not alone. - [Director] And cut. Amazing, moving on. - Can we get a comb over here? - Hey, thank you so much

- Where in the world is Superwoman today? In Trinidad and Tobago! (neighing) What up, everyone? It's your girl Superwoman. I have hugged a lot of people. In fact, over the past four months, I've hugged over 10,000 people, which means you should hit
the thumbs up right away because of the accuracy
and authenticity of, yo, the teleprompter froze. Scroll up, scroll up. Too far, too far, too far. Thumbs up, no, no, keep going, keep going. Accuracy, authenticity, okay, here we go. Authenticity of this video. (laughing) Straight up, every once in a while, I have guys come up to me
and ask me questions like, "How do I know if she likes me?" "Yo, is she mad at me?" "Why are girls so confusing?" And I'm just like, bruh, you gotta learn the language of women, because you're up here listening to words and she's delivering you braille. You gotta feel it out, boo! Women don't only
communicate through words. No, no, they communicate
through body language. So one way to find out
what a girl is thinking is to pay attention to
the way she hugs people. So here are all the ways
a girl can hug someone and what those hugs mean. Number one, the cheek kiss. Now, this hug means that the
girl is probably classy as F, travels a lot, and regularly eats brunch. She also loves to confuse people because they never know if
it's one cheek or both cheeks, if it's a double or a single kiss, and she loves that. She's like, "Mother F'ers, I
wear the pants in this hug. "That's right, I sit on
the Iron Throne of hugs. "I am the lead Care Bear up in here." Now, if she does this hug and she's meeting you for the first time, chances are she's trying to
make a really good impression. For example, she might
hug your mom like this if you two are dating,
just like, hey, cheek kiss, future mother-in-law. Hopefully this distracts
you from the fact that you can see my thong when I sit. Now, if you're not meeting
for the first time, and she gives you a cheek
kiss when she hugs you, probably means she likes
you more than most people, enough to risk getting your cheek herpes. Number two, side hug with eye contact. Now, this hug means you're cool, but she's not really
emotionally invested into you. There's probably a lot
of people in the room that she has to say hi or bye to, and you're just another
one on the assembly line. You know, she can't really
spending too much time in this engagement
because it doesn't align with her priorities. Also, you're probably
in the same category as, like, her uncle that she kinda knows, but she's not completely
sure how you're related. Number three, side hug
with no eye contact. Now, you see, this hug right here, this hug means that, before
she entered this room, she had to mentally prepare to see you because you are trash and she wants no part of you in her life. It means I'm mad at you. I don't like you. Okay, I would rather hug
a grenade than hug you. This hug is a complete obligation. Yeah, I'm just hugging you
because people are looking and I don't wanna seem rude or mean. You know, I wanna appear
to be the bigger person. And when I leave this establishment, I'm gonna think about how
stupid you and your hugs are. Yeah, your hugs are the dumbest, okay? Your hugs tripped over a cordless phone. Your hugs went straight to DVD. Get the F out of here. Number four, two arms with squeeze. This hug means I genuinely like you, and care for you, and you know, when you're not here, I might
think about you spontaneously. I hope you don't die, because
you're a quality human being. In fact, you know what, you
ever ask me to hang out, I might actually pull through
and not cancel last minute or pretend I'm sick. Number five, two arms with neck grip. This hug means we've made out in my mind at least four times. This is my way of getting my body as close to your body as possible without us being Siamese twins. And through this hug,
I just wanna remind you that I have boobs. Here they are. And I might even arc my back a little bit, just so you can see how flexible I am. Number six, hug with head cradle. You are like my child, and I will destroy anything or anyone that tries to hurt you. I don't care how old you are. I don't care if you're a
full-fledged adult, okay, you are my fetus, and I
will protect your neck, and your spine, and
cradle you in my bosom. Number seven, arm latch. She's probably in some
sort of social setting, and your arm is her safety blanket, and protection, and
escape from being social. She's just like, "No,
don't make me go out there "and talk to all these other people, no!" It also means I'm codependent, probably to an unhealthy extent, but I'm okay with that. Number eight, two arms
with starfish dance thing. This hug means you are my best friend, and you are my mother F'ing ride or die, and I missed you like hell because everybody sucks compared to you. I don't care how long this hug is. I don't care who's watching this hug. This hug is our moment. This hug means you've
seen me at my worst, okay. You knew me when I was ugly. You told me when I smelled. Girl, you let me know when I was a ho, and therefore we are
spiritually connected always. Number nine, hug with lift. This hug means somebody's
about to get laid, straight up, because we probably haven't
seen each other for a minute, and I missed you, and
I'm gonna put my legs up in the air and defy gravity just to give you a sneak peek of what's to come later tonight. Number 10, the dap and hug. This hug means that we
understand the similar struggle that other people just don't get. There's an unspoken respect
between the two of us, and we have a deep connection. We're probably from the same city, the same team, the same motherland, speak the same language. This hug means that if we ever
drink together and we cheers, I will make sure my glass
physically touches your glass, because I have that
type of respect for you. Number 11, the wrestle hug. Friendzone! This is basically the
friendship bracelet of hugs, so baby boo, if you got one of these hugs from the girl you like, you should know the only way your fingers are gonna be going through her hair is when you're braiding her hair during a goddamn sleepover
while watching Clueless. Boy, move on. Number 12, head resting on shoulder hug. This hug means, yo, everything
is dumb except for you, and I need you to hold
me as I give up on life. This hug means my post
ain't getting likes. I cheated on my diet. I got a degree in something I hate. Honestly, my Uber can never find me. My new shoes keep peeling the skin from the back of my ankles, and I just cannot. So please support me
through this trash life. And there you have it. Now you know what it means
when a girl hugs you, and now, Team Super, this is your cue to go back and check all
those meet and greet pictures, and overanalyze them, and
send me all the receipts like I know you will, ya nasties! I love you. And don't forget, do hugs, not drugs. Yo, I'm hoping you like

(unicorn hoof beats clattering) (mellow music) - Hi, welcome to Sefora, with
an F because of copyright. (ding) - Yeah I'm looking for some new lipstick. - Great, what did you have in mind? - I don't know. I mean my personality kind of sucks so I'm looking for something to fix that. - I have the perfect thing. Try our new Talk Filter line. - What the hell is a talk filter? - Try one. - Sexy Rouge. Hm, sounds like a porno crayon. - Girl French makes
everything sound like porn. - Touche. I don't see what the big
deal about this lipstick is. Like, it just makes me want
to climb on this table, wrap my legs around you
and bite your lower lip until it hurts. What the hell? - Sorry sister, you're
barking up the wrong tree. - I know, oh my god I'm so sorry. I just, I just feel like a coach you know, and you're a gymnast. I just want to come over there
and try to make you flip. - Doubt it. - Maybe you've just never experienced a woman who's done it right. - That's because I am the
woman who does it right, sis. Makeup wipe? - Yeah. (laughs) I am so sorry. I am usually not that forward. - That makes one of us. (laughs) - What is this one? Nerdy Nights, ooh. I really don't get how
this lipstick works. It's almost like the
pigment from the lipstick is affecting my Broca's area, which is formed by the pars triangular and pars opercularis of the interferior frontal gyrus therefore affecting my
production of speech. (gasps) - I didn't know Sheldon
Cooper was a cute brown girl with cute little boobs. - Aw, these old mammary glands. - Here try this one. - You know darling, I've
been here for what seems like an eternity and someone
has yet to offer me an iced latte, or at the
very least a moist towelette or a hydrating face mist. - From ladies free before
10 club, to country club, like that.
(snaps) Bougie Pink - Be a love and show me some products from the Michael Kors line. - Michael Kors doesn't have a beauty line. - Well I'll tell you this. My life is becoming more and
more difficult by the moment. - Do tell. - First my barbaric driver bumps the curb and nearly breaks my pearls. I've been here for a lifetime
without an iced latte and it's been 20 minutes since I've sniffed
anything lavender scented. - Girl I'm going to need one of those. - Isn't it sad that I feel
the need to wear makeup or society won't accept me? (melancholy music) - Buzzkill Gray. - I'm a slave to the social constructs that have been embedded into my psyche and now I feel like if I
don't have a strong highlight on my cheek I am unworthy. - Well, it's not completely wrong. - Ooh, Liar Liar. Sounds fun. Where is this one? - Sorry, we're all sold out. We just sent a huge
shipment to the White House. But try this one. It's Nicki Minaj's new nude shade. - This lipstick be so poppin', feel like Barbie when I'm talkin'. Boys want cookies and cream. I'm like this ain't Baskin Robbins. Ain't no floppin' when I'm droppin'. Ain't no croppin' when I'm flauntin'. The whole pic is so lit,
ain't no face to fix in it. Put moscato in my glass and
there ain't no mixing it. Yeah my money is my crew. Yeah my money is my fetus,
all the rest are my sons and you ain't gone beat us. - Girl, my wig just flew all
the way off to South Korea. - That was exhausting. I need something more simple. Like this. I don't like to complicate things, you know like makeup and relationships. Honestly, sometimes I feel like I should just date my brother. - What? - Yeah I mean that way
I wouldn't even have to change my last name. - Forbidden Romance. Take that off. Incest is nasty. Unless you're Jon Snow and Daenerys, and in that case yas. - Wait what's this one? Old Taylor Swift. Okay I have to try this. - Sorry girl, she's discontinued. Yeah like her way. - What happens if you mix the lipsticks. - Let's take this one
and let's take this one. - I just want your phalanges
all over my epidermis. I want to increase your
production of oxytocin. - Let's try these two. - This one is for the gentleman with the rather booming
system, top lowered, air conditioning with the cooling system. When I arrive at the
venue he is blazing up. Got investments on
deck, must be saving up. - This is so fun. One second. (laughing) You gonna buy something or not? (booming) - [Lilly] What the hell is top filter? - What do I say? (laughing)
(beep) - Do it one more time
where you're almost like, Michael Kors doesn't have one. - Perfect, more (bleep). - Yeah exactly.
(laughing) It's like the pigment is
affecting my Broca's area which is formed of the pars
triangular pars operculis? (beep) Which is formed of the pars
triangular and pars opercularis interfer--- Pars opercularis... - [Kyle] Of the interfer-- - Of the interferior frontal... - [Kyle] Gyrus. - Which is formed by the pars triangular and the pars opercularis
of the interior designing. (beep)
It's almost as if the pigment from the lipstick is affecting my Broca's
area which is formed by the pars triangular and pars opercularis-- (screaming)
(beep) Formed by the pars triangular
and pars opercularis of the interferior gyrus
frontal lobe of my production. (laughing) Frig! Is formed by the pars
triangular and pars opercularis of the interferior frontal
gyrus therefore production my-- Oh I was so close. Frig, F me, F me. (laughing) (boom) Hey thank you so much for

because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday. One love Superwoman. That is a wrap and zoop. Hi! 
- Do you ever stop what you're doing in the middle of the day
and just think, I'm a moron. What up, everyone, it's
your girl, Super Woman. And I've been through
years and years of school but I still feel like I
don't know how to function like a proper human
being in the real world. Like every once in awhile, I have no idea how to do a simple task. Like I literally just walk
past my degree on the wall and I'm just wondering like how the eff do I still get lost in
Ikea every damn time? And how can I never remember
where I park my car? And I never have enough Icloud storage. Mostly because I don't know what that is. That's because sometimes, aka
very likely, aka like Monday to Friday, school teaches
kids useless things. I'm just saying, school should prepare you for real world struggles. Number One, Mathematics. I'm lost in a strange
place and my phone is dead, what do I do? Recite your nine times
tables said no one ever. Let's just be real, most of
the math you learn in school is completely useless in everyday life. Today we're gonna learn how to measure the circumference of a circle. The diameter of a circle. The radius of the trigonometry. The length of this side of
this triangle, the hypotenuse. Math is also going to include letters now. Okay, math is now pretty little letters. Fall for A. Parabola. Two parabolas, parabola, two parabolas. Acute angles. - Aww, cute. - Trapezoids. - Eh! - And the equation of
this hexagon cole sign parallelogram tangent isosceles. Any questions? And because school fills your head with all these complex
equations when it comes to simple everyday math,
you're an idiot box. That was so good. I need to like unbutton my pants. Oh thank you. Oh actually can we split the bill? - No sorry, not for parties over two. - Oh. - Bust out your calculators everybody. Who got the steak? - Depends, how much was it again? - What do you mean how much was it? Doesn't matter how much,
did you get the steak or did you not get the steak? - I honestly think it's
just like $30 each. - Yo, I didn't drink. Both of you did. - Also, yeah, you got guac on the side. - Guac isn't extra. - Guac is always extra, shut your mouth - Does it include tip yet? - No. So we have to tip individually. Let's just tip individually. Cash, credit card, what are you doing-- - Let's just call it 20 bucks each. - All right, but this includes gratuity. - Okay, okay, I loved that movie. - That's Ratatouille,
ho, this is gratuity. Boy, you stupid. - Okay, we're like $80 short. - How? - Because of the tax. - What the hell is tax? - Hold up, I didn't carry the one. - What's the standard, is it 13%? - Plus it, divided by two-- - Can we get some graph
paper, just can we? If I had a dollar for
every time my friends and I could not figure out the
division of the bill, I would have enough money to
just pay for the whole meal. Because me stupid. Number two: foreign languages. Growing up in Canada,
I had to learn French. (speaks foreign language) So for nine years of
my life, I had to learn this as a second language. So tell me why the
biggest language barrier I have ever faced while
traveling is in France because I had no idea what
the F anyone was saying. Why you ask? Because ... (speaks foreign language) Welcome to your first day of French class. Today we're going to learn
all about pizza toppings. How to conjugate the verb to jump. (speaks foreign language) Today's lesson, circus terms. (speaks foreign language) (speaks foreign language) No no. (speaks foreign language) (speaks foreign language) (speaks foreign language) - How do you say, I need help? - You know what they
should teach you in school? How to understand foreign languages you will see in your daily life. - Wait, can you park here? - It says I can park here
between noon and three. - Okay, so you're good. - Oh wait, but it also
says not on Mondays. And on days that have a T in it. - Think you're good. - Also not during street cleaning
or during a quarter moon. - I think you're good. - And by permit only at 5 p.m. - We're good. - And I think it's a tow
away zone on Saturdays. - We're still good. - Okay, dope. Oh no wait, forgot my phone. What the F? Reading parking signs 101. I'm just saying, this the
type of education we need. (speaks foreign language) Worksheets. You don't know what
frustration or inner turmoil is in life unless you've had to cut out those geometric paper shapes
and glue them together to make 3D shapes. You know exactly what
the F I'm talking about with the effin' tabs and
the effin' gluestick. I just can't, I'm sweating,
I'm literally sweating just thinking about it. In today's day and age that
whole process makes no sense. All right, students, now
today I want you to cut out these shapes and then
glue these shapes together to make 3D shapes. It's important you learn how to do this because 3D printers will never exist. And then I want you to answer
questions about the shapes. - What if I already know how
many sides are on a cube? - Make the cube. - I can literally just
count the sides of the cube without building it. - Make the cube. - I'm done with my sphere. - Hey, make the cube. Instead of giving me worksheets
full of mindless work, teach me how to work
with sheets in real life. (upbeat music) (screams) Number four, dress codes. Now I'm gonna be straight up. The only dress code I had
in my school growing up was no gang signs. Yeah, that should put a lot
of things in context for you. But today dress codes in schools
are absolutely ridiculous and not at all a good reflection of what the real world is. Class as you can see,
this young lady's skirt is one inch too short
and I'm not woke enough to realize this dress code
is sexist, so, go home. Tuck in that shirt, young man. Pull up those pants,
sir, this isn't a yolo. Hey, no hats. Looks like your top is one
centimeter above your mid drift. We don't want the male students to lose focus, now do we? Schools you have failed as educators if you drill a dress code
into your students' minds and then they graduate
and after they graduate they get invited to events. And they still don't know what the F is appropriate attire to wear. Hey, so what's the dress
code for the event tonight? - [Man On Phone] Business casual. - Like a pant suit? - [Man On Phone] Nope,
just nice and casual. - Like jeans? - [Man On Phone] No, more business casual. I'll see you there! - K. Business casual. Hello, I'm business casual. Oh, hey, hi me? I'm business casual. What's up? Biz cas. Goodday, sir, my name is business casual. That's what they should teach in school. Okay, I don't give an F
what to wear in math class. Tell me what to wear to a wedding. To a meeting, to a social,
also, what the F is a social? Since when is social a noun? First of all, what, what, what? But real talk, can I
just be real with you. I know how school feels. Everyone going back to school. It is true, a lot of the specific things you learn in school, you will
never ever use in your life. But hear me when I say, you
will use the time management, social skills, the work ethic skills. All the life skills
you learn through being in that environment, you will learn. So you know what? Tough it out, figure out the
God damn hypotenuse, okay? I promise it'll be worth it one day. Kill it, hustle hard. Oh you you, stop stop,

houses, buildings, castles. In Minecraft. - In what now? - (clears throat) It's a sandbox game in which you collect blocks and then you build
things with said blocks. - Wow, yeah, no, totally cool. I could see how that would be considered like a real job on a dating profile, yeah. - I'm also really into being
an automobile thief (chuckles). - Oh, I get it, like Grand Theft Auto? - What, what's that? - I did not get a Brazilian for this. (application boops) (beeping) ♪ I don't know who's gonna

- First comedy video of 2018. Give it a thumbs up after you watch it just in case it's trash. (unicorn galloping) What up everyone? It's your girl Superwoman. And it's a new year which
means a lot of people are on that new year,
new me vibe, you know? Making crazy decisions
likegoing to the gym, changing their hair,
and the most terrifying, deciding to get married. I personally thought marriage
was one of those trends that we were gonna leave in
2017 with like fidget spinners and irresponsible vlogging,
but apparently not. It's here to stay. Friends, friends everywhere
getting engaged, and if you think it's not happening
to you, you're wrong okay? Just check the international
marriage database. Ring pictures, same-day edits, captions about marrying
your loyal best friend, and I'm just like you're
marrying your dog? Prepare yourself for the weddings of 2018 by expecting the
following types of people. Number one: painful public speakers. Now these are the friends and
family members of the couple but have no public speaking
abilities or experience, but they up there making the
speech anyways just as if I just hit puberty damn
damn I just hit puberty. God damn finally at the tender age of 21. Okay wait, now before
you think I'm evil, okay, I'm all for people's friends
and family expressing their love and pride and all
that stuff for the couple. That's fine, but I feel
like if your friend is gonna make a speech at your wedding, you should at least prep them. For example, require
them to write it down. (people chatting) (microphone feedback) - Hello everybody. Uh, Pat, buddy, huh? Uh... Okay, I'm... I'm Pat's friend. Hello. Hi. Pat, you know, Pat's the...
what can I say about Pat? Pat's the type of guy who everybody knows the type of guy that Pat is. Maybe you don't know, but his friend... I'm Pat's friend. Hello. Everybody, we all know the
type of guy that Pat is because Pat's the type of guy you just on his wedding, you wanna say uh, yeah. He's like the type of guy
where everybody knows... You know what type of guy Pat is. I love you buddy. Cheers. Like hoe, this is not an essay okay? You do not need to hit the word count. I leave that wedding not knowing
a single thing about Pat. Also, there should be guidelines about the types of stories
they're allowed to tell. - Yo, what's good? Yo let me tell you a funny
story about my boy junkie. Yo the day he met pretty, right? They just finished their date or whatever. And he's like yo I wanna roll one, right? Like, you know, get high and stuff? Junkie loves drugs. That's my boy. There's a devil sitting there, you know, smoking a thing and a
sweeter thing walks by. Junkie goes and gets them digits. That's my boy right there. You're my boy. You know what I'm saying? So pretty I tell you
you're mad lucky still fam because this guy, he's fire. He gets all the gals all the time. Even today, I saw mad gals on his thing. You know what I'm saying? Yo, anytime I ever wanted
anything, Junkie stole it for me. That's what's up. All the bridesmaids, holla
at your boy, you know? What's good, fam? D-Town represent. My boy. Alright, Singh. - Are you dumb? Are you dumb? No, are you dumb? Why are you trying to
make their wedding day the same day their grandma
had a heart attack? Are you dumb? Not to mention that a speech
should be like two minutes max. Some people are up there forever, and they don't even realize it. I'm just like, bruh, the
couple's already divorced. Sit down. Number two: the drunk unk. I'm gonna be honest, I'm
not sure if this is like a universal thing or just something that I know because I'm Punjabi. Like comment below and let me know. Every wedding has that one drunk uncle who is sweating profusely that
takes over the entire event. And sweating is mandatory, okay? If he ain't sweating,
it's not the drunk unk. His back needs to look like this. Like his shirt should look
like the world map, oksy? Because if it doesn't, then
that's not the drunk unk. It's probably like his
understudy or something. Drunk unk is for sure gonna grab the microphone in the middle of dancing. (upbeat music) - Hold up, hold up. Stop the music, stop the music. Please, please. Let me do it. Let me do it. Please. Hello everybody. I want to say many happy
return to happy couple. Johnny... And Pablo. You know I want to say Johnny remember that happy wife equal happy life. Maybe I'm wrong for doing like this. I'm sorry. But in my heart, I feel kid are future. Thank you. Johnny... I am so happy today I am going to give everybody 50% off sofa, okay? And one for Mitchell. Come talk to me. Okay. Play Justin Bieber. - Drunk unk is for sure
gonna get pissed off when the DJ tries to end the night. - What are you doing, man? No, just one more. One more. No shut up, okay? Shut up. One more Justin Bieber. One more Justin Bieber. - And drunk unk gonna be
all up on the dance floor dancing with sexual undertones
but not realizing it. (upbeat music) Is it just me or are all uncles like homosexual when they're drunk? And from their sexual
movements when they're drunk, you're like yo I got a lot of questions about how my cousin was conceived because clearly the man has no rhythm. So like, did my aunt have to learn how to offbeat to get pregnant because I- Is my cousin adopted? Number three: the evasive camera guy. Quite possibly the most annoying
person at a wedding is the invasive camera guy that takes
his job way too seriously. In the way 100% of the time. Blocking your view from the
action 100% of the time. Yeah you'll have your wedding
video in three months. 100% lying. Just while you're dancing. (upbeat music) while you're eating. - There she is. Alright, here we go. - Thank you. Okay, thank you so- Thank you. Thank you so much. - There it is. - During the kiss. - You may now kiss the bride. (camera clicking) - Take it easy, okay? Do you realize that the
moment portrait mode starts working in low
light you won't have a job? Number four: water works. So stupid. Here's my question. Have movies like Moana, Coco, Inside Out not prepared you for the
harsh realities of the world? Why are there still so many
people crying during weddings? Like okay, maybe I understand the parents and the siblings and the
close family et cetera. But they'll be randos. Okay I'm talking straight
up wedding set extras that got invited through like effing Cajiji and Craigslist and crap, okay. They're just bawling their eyes out. And also like what exactly
are you crying about? They are happily getting married. You out here acting like
Mufasa just died again. Like what? (loud crying) - There, there. It's gonna be okay. - They grow up so fast. - How do you know the couple? - Oh, I don't. I'm just part of the catering. - There we go. Keep crying. - Number five: bitter bridesmaids. Now it's important to
remember that the wedding is not just about the bride, okay? It's about the bridesmaids and the one job they're there to do. Support the bride? Don't be a moron, this isn't Twilight. The bridesmaids are there to prove that they are closest to the bride. Closer than any of the other bridesmaids. That's right. It's actually there wedding, okay? It's about them. Because every bridesmaid
believes in her heart that yeah all the rest of y'all hoes
are here for aesthetic but me, I'm the one true bridesmaid
that is closest to the bride. For sure they'll be
some sort of competition in the speeches like yeah well
you know me and the bride, you remember that time we made out once? The next girl just be like
yeah, well you know me and the bride, we've known
each other since grade two. Shh. You hear that? All that passive aggressiveness. As a result of this, you
would think that the bride is dying of like some
sort of terminal illness the way all the bridesmaids
are at her beck and call. - Are you hungry? Have you eaten? What can I get you? - You look so beautiful. Okay, don't worry about anything. I love you. - Are you thirsty? Let me get you water. - Tell me what you need. - Are you itchy? Tell me where. Just tell me where. - Straight up bridesmaids
are the only people who post more pictures about the
wedding than the actual couple. Like when the hell did y'all
have your own photo shoot? Just like yo, the bride
is crying with her family. We've got five minutes. Who got the best phone? How do I know this you ask? Please. Because I've been
that basic hoe bridesmaid. Real talk though. Don't be offended by this video if you are engaged, if you're
married, or whatever else cause leave getting offended
behind in 2017, okay? This is all good vibes. And if you're genuinely
happy about getting married then I am happy for you and I
wish you nothing but the best. I hope your wedding hashtag flourishes. I've actually been considering
marrying my own bae, too. I know it's crazy but
I've been considering it. You know what? First video, I'm gonna show you a picture. First time I'm gonna show you a picture. We are so adorable. Aren't we so cute? Look at us. Me and the bae. Yo yo, not so fast. Hold on. Wait, not so fast. Before I go to the end
card I gotta tell you if you like my sweater,
my girl love sweater, what's stronger together on the sleeves, as well as a whole bunch of other merch, you can get it at lillysingh.com. It's available right now and
it's super soft and it's lit. If you don't believe me, ask Twitter because if it's on the Internet it's true. Okay bye. - Talking about my boy Humble, yo. Still this guy. Like 10 years ago I'ma
call myself Humble the Poet cause that's not a long
hashtag or username. - Everybody knows. His friends know, but
maybe you don't know. Sorry. He was so absent, let
me tell you one time. Bringing up a Monopoly deal. I done him. He got canceled fam. (laughter) I've seen just so many morons do this. Sorry. Sorry fans. If you've done this you're so talented. Drexel, Scarborough. It's an East Side thing, eh? Humble the Poet signing out. I only got two minutes
to fill your cranium and three minutes to fill whatever. Hey. Happy New Year. If you enjoyed this video please subscribe because I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday. You want a little sneak peak what my next video's gonna be? Hold up. One love Superwoman. That is a wrap. And zoop. - Manjeet Singh. Sector 17. - Hello. Happy new you. - New year, new me. 
- Yeah, I broke into your
phone, and I know what's up. (galloping) What up everyone? It's your girl Superwoman, and the other day I was scrolling
through my phone, right? And at least 30 times,
I was like, "who this?". Because, straight up,
there's some names in there that I've never even encountered, let alone people I'm friends with. Let me show you what I'm talking about. Maggie. Who the hell? I have literally never
met someone named Maggie. I have no clue who this is. And I'm convinced some
of the names in here -- Damn. You know, straight up, I'm convinced some of the contacts in my phone are like example contacts that came with the phone. Like, hello, here's your new iPhone with a U2 album and an example contact, and that goddamn stocks app
that you're never gonna use. What's that, sorry? Headphone jack? No we got rid of that. Doi-elf. Here's the thing though, right? How you're saved as a
contact in someones phone says a lot about your
relationship with them. There's level's to this ish. Number one, the anti-contact. Most, oh my god, it's so hot I'm sweating. (growls) Now most the time you get someone's number because you wanna stay in
communication with them but some contacts are the exact opposite. You have their number in your phone so you can block them from your life. Everyone has at least one of
these contacts in their phone. (phone rings) And ignore. (phone rings) Not today. (phone rings) He'll get over it. I was like no I'm an
independent woman, ya know? (phone rings) Nah, I'm past that. Just kidding I'll see you later. Number two, the reminder. Straight up, I have like
200 contacts in my phone, and I probably know the last
name of about 12 of them. That's because I don't save full names. Okay, that last name field, that's not for your actual last name. What the F do I look like, your doctor? Nah, it's an empty field for me to insert whatever helps me remember who you are and how the hell I know you. And I know what you're thinking, Lily, there's a company field where you can put this information. No, I don't care. If you're my neighbor, you know what your name is in my phone? Adam Neighbor, that's your name. That's your family history. I will change your ancestory like that. Kelly Babysitter. Joel Security Guard. Mark Weed Guy. For my garden, obviously, calm down. Cool guy though, always
super chill and relaxed. And I will never change these names. - Sent. Did you get it. - Yep, thanks. - Is my name in your
phone as Mark Weed Guy? That was seven years
ago, I'm a lawyer now. - So? - We're friends now. - I can't change it. - Put my real last name in. - No I won't be able to find you then. - I guess I'll just change it
when you let your guard down. - Yeah well I never let my guard down. (clears throat) - Have a brownie. - Yum. Thanks. Oh, so good. Is that cinnamon? A little something to it. I don't care if I marry Adam Neighbor. Adam Neighbor is gonna be
Adam Neighbor for life, okay? People still have me in
their phone as Lily Uni brow. It is what it is. You can't change history. There is a place called Bangkok. Stop complaining. Number three, code names. If you really mean a lot to me your name will not be in my phone. But rather you will be saved by some adorable hilarious pet name. If you're saved as Jessica in my phone we're just acquaintances, okay? But if you're saved as
Ratchet Queen of the North we besties. And the more emojis, the better. (phone ringing) - I can't find it, is it still ringing? I hear it. - Oh, found it. Hoe Bag Supreme? (laughs) I am so flattered - Eh, Hoe Bag Supreme. (hip hop music) - Hey, over here. (phone ringing) - Hey, baby, what you wearing. - And I just feel like
I have the right level of professionalism for this position. (phone ringing) I'm so sorry. Just one second. Mom, mom I'll call you
back, I'll call you back. As I was saying, professionalism. Number four, old schoolers. Now back in the day, before Fidget Spinners and before people were
offended by everything we used to have these
things called house phones and even though today,
everyone uses cell phones I still have contacts saved
in my phone as Nosh Iphone, Kevin Blackberry. Brian Home. And if you're real ancient,
you probably even got -- (phone rings) He'll call me back in one to three hours. As soon as he gets to a pay phone. Let's go play Atari. Number five, thing one and thing two. You know what I never do. Have a boyfriend. Shut up zoomed in Lily. Okay, no, you know what I never do. Get views. I will smack you. When people text me their new number I will never delete the old one. Is that just me? They'll just be saved as Kevin one, Kevin two, Kevin Old, Kevin New. Why, you ask? Because it is literally rocket science to change someones number. I feel like it is a
universally known truth that it is easier to
just make a new contact. Am I the only lazy one. Please comment below and let me know. This can't just be me. It can't just be me. It's not just -- (mutters) Or like if people have multiple phones for different areas of the world like Jessica America, Jessica Europe, like goddamn it hoe, buy a travel plan. I don't want to text an Atlas every time I have to get in contact with you although it doesn't matter how many times, or which number I call, Jessica, because you never answer the phone. (phone rings) Ew, no thanks. - It's literally so hot
I'm sweating buckets. If you like this video
give it a big thumbs up. Comment below and let me know, do you got these contacts in your phone. Don't lie, eh, you dotie. Check out my last video right over there. You can check my vlogs and my second channel right over there. Subscribe because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday. One love Superwoman. That is a wrap. And zoop I knocked my glasses off my face. 
- Every waste yout about
to relate to this video. (magical shimmer)
(horse whinnying and trotting) What up everyone it's ya girl Superwoman! And I'm gonna be real, back in
the day when I was in school, I was actually a very
successful student, okay? I got good grades, I worked
hard on my assignments, etc. But, I had one kryptonite and
that was my love for sleep. Straight up, if I had a
dollar for every time I chose sleep over school I would be
in Lil Wayne's crew being like, "Young moolah baby" also
not making any damn sense. The problem was, the version of Lilly that set the alarm clock at
night was very delusional. Okay, I need to leave at 10 because of traffic, so 9:30. Although, I do think it's important to have a complete breakfast
with all four food groups, so nine. And you know what, I really
could benefit from morning yoga. So 8:30. You know what, let's just
say 8:00 a.m. to be safe. I have a really good feeling about this. (sigh) Ho shut the eff up!
Talking 'bout breakfast. In the four years of university
I legit had breakfast twice. And both times it was
because I swallowed my gum. Girl, you know damn well what's gonna happen the next morning. (upbeat music) Here's the thing, right, I can shut off an alarm clock
without even realizing it. Like I will legit shut off my alarm without even interrupting my REM sleep. It's just second nature at this point. Even those apps that they
have made for people like me that are like, "Your alarm
won't turn off unless you "answer this mathematical question." That doesn't work on me
because when it's 8:00 a.m. and you love sleep as much
as I do, I am Pythagorean. And this is my goddamn theorem. (upbeat music) Carry the one... Y equals mx plus b... Hypotenuse... (groan) I before e except after c... (sigh) Hey, a little bed mass in bed, badum tish. Hm, when the only way you can get your ex in bed is through a math equation. Shut up zoomed-in Lilly! And once I actually figure out where I am and what's happening, morning Lilly can literally convince herself of anything. (upbeat music)
(groan) Wait, what's that noise? Oh, my alarm. Eight? Why did I set it for eight? Is it going off again? Oh, crap, wait I have a test, that I can think about in 10 minutes. And 10 more minutes. One last time. Ugh, fine. Actually wait,
it's Monday morning. There's probably like no traffic. I'll just sleep more and drive faster. And grab breakfast on the way. And I'm not gonna do my makeup. Yeah, I love myself just the way I am. Also, summer school might
be really fun, just saying. Ugh, okay I should get
up, I'm gonna be late. Although, wait, do you
really wanna be someone who believes in the construct of time? Ugh, is this how you wanna live your life? Don't you deserve a break
for your mental health? Maybe school is just an
institution meant to enslave you. Rebel against the system, Lilly! You're not a puppet! Eff the test, eff school, eff the system. My name is Lilly Singh and I'm
in control of my own destiny! - Yo, you missed a test. - Hi, Dr. Patel? True story I probably got
like 30 doctors' notes in my university career and I feel
like all students have this deep-rooted ability to act
because of this process. I swear to god if I could
do as well in my auditions as I have done in doctors'
offices, I would be a star okay? I would be in like Lord
of the Rings or something. As the fat hobbit? No, as like Frodo or something. Hm? What's that fatty,
you say you want fro-yo? Can you stop? Okay fine, I'm kidding,
I actually saw you on TV the other day, and you did really good. Really, where? A commercial for SeaWorld, effin' Shamu. (groan) But straight up, I would
step into the doctor's office like okay, what is my
motivation, what is my backstory? And honestly I've become a
pro because I know exactly which key elements are
needed to lie to your doctor. Blame a sickness that can't be measured. I think it's my period,
or something I ate. (bell chime) (pen click) - Hold random parts of your body in pain. - Yeah, I couldn't sleep all night. (bell chime) - Show various symptoms. (sneeze)
(bell chime) - Excuse me, I'm so sorry. - Bless you. - Oh my god, I'm so sorry. (cough) You were saying? - Poor thing. - And always ask for a tissue. - Excuse me, sir, can
I just grab a tissue? - Of course. - Yeah, thank you.
(bell chime) Ugh, my nose, ugh. You gotta sell your sickness, boo. Okay, I don't care if you walk
into the doctor's office like "Yo, I just have cramps",
you better be limping into that office holding Vicks
Vaporub with an eye patch, okay? We going all the way here, and then boom, doctor's note for $75. Here's the thing, right,
it's a two-way business and both parties, they know what's up. - [Woman] What was wrong with that one? - Missed her test, probably slept in. Charged her $50, gave her a discount. She's a frequent customer. - By third year of
university I'd walk into that doctor's office just like
"Yo, Doctor P, what's up, "give me the regular.
Let's switch it up "a little bit though,
what do you think about, like, appendicitis?" Obviously, doctors know
students are lying. That's why they charge them. In Canada, you can
literally get hit by a car and your healthcare will
be free but if you need a doctor's note, boom $100. Like ho, you gon' pay for these lies. Honestly the best thing
school has ever taught me is how to BS my way out of any situation. Ugh, I should probably sleep early. Although, you know what,
I feel like I'm ready to become a morning person, yeah. I feel like I'm just gonna
need less sleep moving forward. So yeah, I will watch this movie with you. Wait, let me set my alarm, though. Okay gotta leave at 10, so nine, uh no. I'm wanna totally redeem myself
for the whole yoga thing. Eight, 8:00 a.m., perfect. I have a great feeling about this. Every single night. You wanna know what happens next? (vinyl record rewind sound) (upbeat music) What's up bootyful? If you like this video give
it a thumbs up, like actually do it, like believe it or not,
that actually matters to me. My last video is over there,
bloopers for this video, right over there, subscribe! Because I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday and that also like, you
know, that makes me feel good and stuff yo, you know what I mean? One love Superwoman,
that is a wrap and zoop! 
I'm about to expose everything you won't admit. What up everyone it's your girl Superwoman! And it's a regular day, right? So you're having that relationship talk with one your friends. Honestly, I can't even imagine being in a relationship right now. Totally. It's like I'm too independent, you know? For sure! Also, I don't need to seek validation from someone else's love. You don't need no validation. I'm just too, like, woke as a person. You know? Like, I'm drinking a kale smoothie right now. This is gluten-free. Cruelty-free. A recyclable cup. This company? They employ abandoned puppies. Yeah, so I can't do all of this plus be in a relationship. It's too much work. And THEN she hits you with - I heard Kenny has a crush on you. What? Yeah, Kenny told me he has a crush on you. Hurry the hell up Someone has a crush on me Ho, call me a parking ticket cause I just got validated when you find out someone has a crush on you on the outside You might act like you're unfazed but on the inside your like I'm the most bomb person on the planet and for some reason it makes you want to be even hotter Let me put in a little bit of extra effort and see who else I can snatch on these streets Yeah And you catch these crushes like Pokemon just absolutely feeling myself feeling myself all on the gram feeling myself while staying hydrated Feeling myself in my bed Lilly? Get out, I'm busy! And all this leads to phase one of someone having a crush on you. The lead on... now I hate to say it, but when someone has a crush on you shut up shut up You're gonna deny this, shut your face, when someone has a crush on you whether you like them back or not you are going To leave them on why because it's human nature. Why for real cuz it makes you feel powerful You gonna hit them with the mild interactions like Yo, I'm gonna drop this pencil for you. Imma a bend-over I'm gonna allow you to look at this booty. Okay consider it a charitable donation. Wait don't charity only take non damaged goods Shut the F up zoomed in Lilly It's like reverse flirting like you have a crush on me. Okay cool Let me talk to you here, and there... you know, make your day Um hey, I'm totally lost can you help me? but I wasn't lost I just enjoy the power of making someone nervous It's a factorial so you just multiply each one by N wrong is that the summation. Yeah, do the same thing wrong He was so wrong maybe he only had skills in picking beautiful crushes this leads to phase two Delusions When someone has a crush on you, you  start to read into everything they do and you conclude like yo this person's life Revolves around me Obviously and you throw them a pity party every opportunity you have because Dang it must be so hard To have a crush on someone as fine as you Mmm. Look at him over there. Just crushing on me so hard He's literally just drinking juice duh the juice is a metaphor for how he's bottling up his emotions for me. I think he might just be thirsty exactly he's so thirsty he's practically shaking He's just shaking his juice You know when he talks to me he chokes. Oh my god. I think he's actually choking Like he literally dies over me i think Kenny just died It's like watching an episode of South Park over and over again poor Kenny. He used to have a crush on me Are you okay After this one of two things are gonna happen all right? Number one you like the person back and y'all gonna get jiggy with it Number two you don't and when you don't it's just another regular day accept the idea romance has been infiltrated into your mind So you're having a conversation with your friend like I honestly imagine myself in a relationship these days totally You know it's nice to depend on people sometimes for sure I even stopped recycling and eating healthy because I'm like what's the point? People crush on me either way. I think was like naturally quirky an attractive and Then she hits you with I heard Kenny doesn't like you anymore   What? Yeah, Kenny. He likes Trisha now, he told me. Thus entering phase three. The break-up Yo straight up, breaking up with someone you're not in a relationship with is the worst how dare you Not be dating me and be cheating on me Wo-wo-wo, listen hey, hey, what's all this with you're not liking me anymore hey well, I thought you weren't into me That's it. You're not gonna like fight for me? Fight who? Anyone, Honestly is chivalry dead? I'm sorry. I like Trisha now. No. No you don't. listen. Focus. Okay? I am your crush, but you said you didn't like me That's irrelevant, listen You're supposed to have a crush on me for a really long time. Why? because it makes me feel good God Do you know nothing about girls? Okay, fine. I like you damn straight. You like me now pull yourself together God. You're practically drooling over me He has a crush on me what? It all of this is my cheeky way of saying that I have a huge crush sike got ya gurt Yo my lipstick matches my shirt okay for that alone give this video a thumbs up check out my last video right over second vlog channel right over there yo super 60 starts right now, which means for the next hour I'll be responding to your comments down below So go ahead and comment make sure you subscribe because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday one love superwoman that is a wrap and zoop ends 
- Hello, Unicorn Island. How can I help you? (hip hop music) - So, you want to learn how to be a Bawse. - What's a Bawse? _ Quick question. Walk with me. A Bawse is someone who stands
tall and exudes confidence. Someone who's charming
and make people feel good about themselves. God, you're handsome. Congrats. Whew. Someone who gets hurt efficiently and learns from their mistakes. - Hey, that recent investment

discuss where we went wrong. Oh, and make sure there's a pie chart. There's always gotta be a pie chart. A Bawse is someone who
finds solutions to problems. (banging) Not one, not twice, but over, and over, and over again. - You hang up. I don't want to hang up. No, you hang up. (slamming) - Problem solved. (phones ringing) Someone who hustles relentlessly. - I need you to sign here, here, and here. - Can I confirm your 3 o'clock meeting? - What time did you
want to do asset accrual on the Live today? - Done, yes, and 4 p.m. And I'll take those. Someone who understands
the importance of gratitude and knows when to pause. (whooshing) Yum. - [Woman] Coming through. - Someone who genuinely
loves and accepts themselves. - Hey Lilly, I have a flower
delivery for you from Lilly. - Aw, how sweet. - Send her one back. A Bawse is someone who
their priorities in order because you know never
know when FOMO can hit. - Skip your meeting and work out with me. - I mean, yeah I could. No, no, no I have a meeting and I confirmed it. Now, I know what you're thinking. This all looks and sounds great. The buzz words, the expensive
camera, the hair and makeup, but how do you actually
be all of these things? Well, that's where I come in. It's time to learn how to be a Bawse. (hip hop music) 
Forget about all your stresses and laugh with me for a few minutes. *magic rainbow unicorn noises ayeee* What up everyone it's your girl Superwoman and if you know anything about me You know I love horror movies mostly because when I say horror movies people think I'm saying "whore"  movies And that's just like a completely different genre, but ya know just adds to the fun. Let's faceplant right into it! Number 1 I'm a colored woman *GUNSHOT* *gasping* what the F! I didn't even make it to the opening credits. You were only here so we can say we had a diverse cast! Since the beginning of time colored people have been the first people to die in horror movies. That's not new information but as a colored person. This is why I personally find it so amusing when a brown person dies on screen so quickly in the stupidest and most basic way. Hoe this brown kid's parents probably immigrated from across the world took seven flights and three ships to get to this new country. Probably had to deal with the wasteyutes at customs. Had to bribe them, had to find a new job because they were told that their degrees were now worth nothing. Had to learn a new language, a new culture, a new way of life! And then had a wasteyute kid and that brown waste yute kid probably got whooped if he or she ever wore a tank top if he or she didn't get straight A's okay? Had to deal with racism! And now lives in the world where Trump is a thing and this kid with that background for those horrific things... ...is gonna see a dollar store scary mask and get stabbed with a butter knife in a horror movie?! NAH. How??!! Like yeah, we survived slavery and racism like that mother-effer right there on the screen mask? Yeah, he gonna be the death of me *phone ringtone* Hello? Who is this? It's Kimberly. Is anyone else there? *Kyle I mean "Bob" stammers* This- this is Bob. Bob? Ugh! Is there like a Jamal or something there? Er...he's in the washroom. I'll call back in 5 minutes. Number two: The Pothead. Horror movies always have one person that's the druggie and he always looks the same, okay? He's always scruffy wearing some hot mess clothes a straight up scrub *sings scrubs by TLC* What was I doing again? Here's the thing, right? No one else in the movie ever takes this druggie seriously, cuz its just like, "Oh you! Be quiet with your theories. You can't be right. You smoke marijuana!" And I'm just like, "Girl you think all these geniuses that make all these hit TV shows are just "creative"?! Stop." But here's the thing- the druggie is always right! *druggie whispers* Dude, I don't think we should be here. Oh Pothead Pat, you're so funny. I'm serious! I feel like an evil presence. Like we've awakened something, man! Oh yeah, is her name Mary Jane? No! Listen to me. I literally hear someone coming. *mockingly* Oh! look at me my name is Pat, and I do drugs. Everyone's trying to kill me. *makes a face* We're all gonna die! And it's gonna be beca- *Screams* Do you have any snacks? Number three: the obvious friend Horror movies that involve some sort of mystery killer always drive me insane because more often than not is the main characters Naive as f actions that gets everyone killed. She's gonna Have a group of friends people are gonna start dying So she's gonna stop trusting everyone except for her one close friend who she tells everything to Who is 1,000% the killer. Here's an idea right if there's a killer and the person is clearly within your circle of friends take a vacation Leave why don't you leave that place? I mean the average human leaves a washroom line if there's 2 people ahead of them They're like yo, I gotta piss so bad. Yo, there's two people and I nah f this I'm gonna pee. I got a pee bad I gotta be that bad the r.i.p bladder But you can't leave this killer situation just like nah I'm gonna stick around for a bit You know see what's good. See what pops off. Are you dumb? R U dumb? R U dumb? R U dumb? R U dumb? You are stupid person. I'm so happy I can trust you Really, cuz I've been giving you suttle hints for the past hour that I'm the bad guy I just feel like I don't know who anyone is anymore. Killed all those other people that we're trying to warn you as well I Just wish I knew who was after me. I mean to be fair You've never even seen the killer and I on the same frame. I'm sorry this is all because of your lack of attention to detail Can you stay the night? I just- I don't feel safe. Where did I put my gun? It's on the table. Ah! Also, do you ever think we could be like more than friends? Number four The weird person. Okay, well, I'm gonna need some halls after that now Now, this is the person that the movie people want you to believe is the killer and to be honest you should believe is the killer because they're always doing some weird crap I can explain *pen scribbling* Don't trust everyone you meet Don't trust everything you hear So you're definitely the killer Noooo no no no no, no no But then this happens... You know the weird creepy guy who does all the weird have creepy things? Yeah, he's not the killer Wait let me get this straight. The dude that's always around the people who have been killed that has the blood all over his hands He's not the killer? What- why is he there? What the f is he? What is he? Some sort of like menstruation assistant Like I don't understand because here's the question that no one seems to ask at the end of the movie Hey you why were you doing all that weird crap? If he's not the killer does no one agree that We should still be concerned that he does all this weird crap like we can't be friends with him either way Number 5 that's The scary ghost by far my favorite character in any scary movie I'm talking the demon, the spirit, the ghost that is terrorizing everyone always lurking around Haunting you making you feel all scared and until you Actually see the face of a ghost and that ish turns into a comedy movie or real quick.

(unicorn hoof beats) - [Ryan Voiceover] Ooh aah. I'm so cute. Hey what's up everybody
it's your girl Superwoman. So today I'm going to
give you guys a tutorial starting off with smelling my hair. It smells like oils. Um hi, yup, said that already. So yeah let's get this started. What you want to do
first is start with these facial stretches. This is called the monkey. This one's called the no neck. And I don't know what that one... Oh we're ready to go apparently. Here are my Listerine mints that I'm going to start off with. Oh no it is a cream and I'm
going to start rubbing that on my cheeks incredibly fast. Have you ever seen hand
speed like this before? Because I haven't. Damn son, done. Next we have these two eyeliners. They're my favorite eyeliners. You always want to start
with your false eyes. See all five of them. What you want to do is put your eyeliner on your wrist first. Then you're going to kind of rub it-- Oh you're going to shake it up, no, you're going to rub it on
your hand or shake it up, whatever you want to do I'm
just showing both methods. Throw it, throw that shit
away, you don't need that. See just put it on your hands, boom. And then you get your paint brush. Same paint brush you guys
used for your Father's Day paintings that we taught you last week. So now we get to the application process. As you can see you don't want
to just paint it on your face. Oh don't tell anyone this is a secret. What you want to do is dab it everywhere. Fun fact this is where the dab came from. It's actually from a makeup tutorial. My makeup tutorial. See? Wipe your chin because
it gets itchy sometimes, hairs growing out. So now you're done with your eyeliner. Next thing you want to
do is your foundation. This is a cream based
foundation from Mac L'Oreal. Oh it's so ticklish when you do your ears. And you want to start off by
contouring with the foundation on your jaw. Yes, it gets repetitive. And you do that over. Now you get your nose because you want to contour your nose to make
sure it doesn't look flat. Oh got a little boogie right there. Don't want to get any
boogers in your contouring. So you continue to
contour your entire face. I like to do it not in my hair apparently. That's how you get dandruff. Make sure you guys don't do that. I like to get under my hairline folds for that nice LeBron look, and then I work on my chins. So this is great for if
you're starting to sprout new mustache and beard
hairs, so you want to really get around that section to make sure that that doesn't show up. And yes I'm also starting
to get chest hairs so what I want to do is cover
that up with this ball. This ball is basically like
the fidget spinner for the 90s. This is called a stress ball. You flick that away once you're done. And then you pull out your
Father's Day paints again and what you want to do is
start painting your eyes. Remember my favorite color is this one, which is literally invisible color because nothing's happening. See, look at that. There's literally nothing. It's one of my favorites. The whole point of makeup
is so that you don't see it. You don't want to have
too much make up or else people will think you're a clown. So this makeup color
is also called Nothing. As you can see as I apply
it, it actually looks like nothing is happening,
but that's what we want, because you don't want
to look like a clown. So, done. Next what we want to do is
get this black toothpaste and shake it up a little bit
because the last thing you want is clunky makeup eyes. So you pull your eyes back and I swear this is not a racist thing, this is a technique to put on eye makeup. Ironically it originated in Japan. So what you want to do is
grab you fidget spinner pen, it's from Smashmouth, you know, ♫ Somebody once told me and basically you do that,
sing that song in your head while you apply this to your eyebrows. As you can see the difference between the side that is done and not, what it really does is
bring out the caterpillar in your eyebrows and that's
what you want to go for. I don't know. See like I don't know. This next step is called the
eyelash squisher and yes, it is very scary and very painful. See you've got to pray. And basically you squeeze your
eyelashes as hard as you can. Ooh that hurts so much and
you know it's uncomfortable but it's necessary to kill all the germs. After you sanitize your eye
hairs what you want to do is coat them with this nice
little eye hair conditioner. You know it's like after you die your hair you've got to take care of it. Next you want to put a little
bit of spit on your eyes. As you can see I used a Q-tip. This is for that all natural spit smell. It gets all the guys, all the cuties. As the saying goes, "With
spit eyes you get more guys." It's a repetitive process but we're going back to the eye thing. And this is the part where
a lot of girls give up on because you don't want
to do this over and over but I'm telling you, you need to do this as many times as I'm doing it because you want to have
a very thick, dark coating around your eyes. That's the whole point
of putting on eye makeup, is that you don't have to squint when the sun's really bright. If you notice, football
players do the same thing below their eyes. They put eye paint next to their eyes so that they're not squinting and they can catch the football. Same concept. The next step in making
makeups is to apply your powder and this is for your cheeks. This is called blush powder
and what you want to do is basically spread this
all over your cheeks for that contouring look. It'll make you a little bit red
like you had a couple drinks if you're Asian or if you
spent some time in the sun for white people. And then we're going to get to the lips. Apparently I'm going to
go with a nice bright red. I really like this color
because it brings out my pillows in the background. I don't know if you guys can
see that but it really does. And this is my famous cologne. It's called Believe by
Justin Bieber and I basically spray it on my face to make
sure that I am always not dry. (imitates kissing) And we are done so thank you
guys so much for watching. Check out the comment
section so you can tell me how good I look. And this is your girl Superwoman. Like I always say at the end of videos, tee hee. - Yo hope you enjoyed that video. If you did, give it a big thumbs up. Not even for me, for Ryan,

- Hi, I'm gonna smile an abnormal amount. - Honestly, I forgot
this was happening today. - I'm so nervous I might throw up. - Well, I've already judged
you based on how you look. I tried not to, but I did. - Should I start lying now, or did you wanna small talk
about the weather first? - You can just like, go ahead and say everything you wrote on there. - Sure, well as you can see here, I made up six years of experience. - Head of marketing for Mr. Jones, nice. - Correct. That's my dad, I told him you might call, and he has talking points already. - So tell me about this
management position at this company I've never heard of. - Technically I wasn't an assistant but I feel like I could've figured it out. - Mmhmm, lets see what other interview questions I've googled here. Ah, yes, why did you leave your last job? - I just feel like I needed
a bigger challenge, you know? And also I was fired. - Mmhmm, mmhmm. Tell me about one of your many weaknesses, and don't say perfectionist, you liar. - Honestly, I don't really work that hard. - So why do you want this job? - I like money. - Says here you're
proficient in Photoshop. - Oh yeah, I face tune all
the time, its one in the same. Potato, potato, am I right? - Fluent in French, very nice lie. - Oui. I know exactly three words,
that was one of them. - Mmm, trustworthy, I'm not
really sure that's a skill. - Fair, it also depends
how many drinks I've had. - I know it seems like I'm
taking informative notes but really I'm just writing, "Don't hire." literally, look, "Don't hire." stupid answer, dumb dumb,
you're not getting the job. - You know I'm sensing
this isn't going well so I'm gonna say a bunch of buzz words. - Go for it. - Reliable, a team player, self starter. - Mmm, maybe something about efficiency? - Time management. - There it is. - Problem solver, eh? Eh? - I'm really enjoying feeling
like I'm in power right now. - Oh, fast learner. - Listen, shut up. You're talking a little too much so I'm gonna tell you
about our company now. - Oh, I'm squinting my eyes and nodding as if I'm very interested. - Same, yeah, no, I could care less about this god damn company. - Well I'm going to overthink everything I said as soon as I walk out. - We might settle for you. - That's what I'm hoping for. - Absolutely tragic, so sorry. Aye, you alright there, mate? If you like this video make
sure you smash your thumbs up. If you check on my last

that is a wrap, and zoo. 
- Some videos are so
important for humanity, that you just have to make a part two. (horse galloping and neighing) What up everyone, it's
your girl, Superwoman. And this video is my way
of encouraging guys around the world to do cute things
for their girlfriends, and when I say that what I mean is: Can a man please do these things for me? What? Who said that? Okay don't act like
I'm a different person, just because I step closer
to the camera Lilly, okay? Let's be real, you thirsty
in a close up, and in a wide. True. (sighs) Here are five things
guys do that girls love, so fellas, take notes. Or ladies, if you're dating other ladies, you can also take notes, although
I guess you don't have to take notes because the same
stuff might also apply to you, because you yourself are a woman. Oh my God, being gay actually
makes a lot of sense. Number one. Fellas, there is fine
balance between dating a boy who needs to be taken care of, and dating a boy who we
want to take care of. In general I'd say most girls
don't want to date a guy who can't do anything for himself. But if my man has his ish together, and is usually independent,
and just killing the game, but in this specific
scenario needs my help, yeah. Something about that, turns me on. Perfect example, injuries. It might just be the innate
motherly instincts I have, but when a man gets hurt, I like it. Hello therapist? Yeah,
booking for my friend. She's in the wide shot. I don't know what it is, I
like taking care of people. Hmm, yeah, would you like
to rephrase that sentence, this time using your psychology degree? Sure, zoomed in Lilly. I like to feel needed. Babe, what happened? - I just hurt my hand. (soft gasp) - You hear that? He
survived a serious injury. - I was just flipping through a script. I have no clue what happened. - He almost died at work. - I wasn't even reading fast. I was practically just
staring at the pages. - Yeah, he probably fought off a robber and saved the company. - Maybe my hand slipped or something. - He's being so strong about this. Oh, my brave hero. - I'll be fine though. - Wait what? - I said, please help me babe, I'm desperately in need of your care. (soft piano music) I don't know what I'd do without you. - We're in this together babe. - You're saving my life. - I'm here for you baby. - What the hell are you doing? - Huh? - What are you doing?
It's just a paper cut! Eww, no stop! - Number two. Terms of endearment are tricky
because in some instances, they might actually annoy a girl, AKA; "Babe make sure you don't put
tomatoes on my burger okay?" "Okay, princess." "Excuse me?" Or like after you messed up. Hey beautiful. Boy shut the F up. Do not use terms of endearment, just to make a situation better okay? Because words, boo-thang and emojis, don't make situations better okay? Actions do, come on now. And don't say them in
every sentence either because then they lose meaning and value. You want to use them casually,
and also know that calling us sweet names, will
impact us differently, depending on the situation. Here's the breakdown.
(soft whistle) - Hey babe.
(kisses) (bright cheerful music) ♫ Baby I like your style Goodnight beautiful. (kisses) (Lilly sighs) - So I was like, I gotta
cook these muffins, somehow. What should we put it into? An oven? What are we in that right now? Are we the muffins? Oh, hey sweetheart. (kisses) Yeah, so I feel like a little muffin. Just a little muffin in an oven. Little muffin in oven. (he laughs) So yeah, do you guys agree? Are you hot? You look a little hot. You look like you're sweating. Allow me to be the most basic right now, and admit that you calling me beautiful before we sleeping, that's nice. Okay, but you calling me beautiful
in front of your friends, that just makes me think, okay. My baby's willing to be calling whipped to call me beautiful. (cheering)
Come through! Okay, but am I? Cause that's exactly what
your friends are going to say. (soft cheering) Number three. You know what makes me
want to be single forever? Scenarios like this. - And... (camera snaps)
Got it. - Okay, lemme see. Are you dumb? Are you dumb? Are you dumb? Are you-- - Does that mean you don't like it or... - You're telling me that we
fart in front each other, but you still don't know
me well enough to know, I'm not going to like
this picture of myself? Where is the effort, huh? Where is the love? You out here acting like I'm
a stranger on the street. Asking you to take a picture
for me and my family, cause we're on vacation. It's like no, hoe where? I ain't no tourist, okay? You know I spend two hours getting ready. So you better get them angles, like you see and appreciate,
these curled lashes. (camera snaps) - And got it. Oh wait you know what,
you won't like this. Let's try it again. Okay, chin down, and
a little to your left. You know what, lemme get higher, and try and smile a little bit more. Ahh, there you go. (happy music) - Oh my God, it's perfect. How did you, the outfit, the setting. - Portrait mode. (Lilly sighs) - I love when you talk like that. - Portrait mode. - Again.
- Portrait mode. - Say it again.
- Portrait mode. - Again.
- Portrait mode. (Lilly moans) - Portrait mode girl. Portrait mode. PM, PM, PM. (Lilly moans) - One bae secure enough to help you get a fire picture for Instagram. (Lilly sighs) Number four. Spontaneous hugs from behind. Yes boy! I honestly can't even explain
and don't even completely comprehend why girls like it so much, and I know what you're thinking,
it's not that ya nasty. Okay, it's just, I dunno what it is. It's just unexpected and nice. Makes you feel warm and safe. And most importantly, it
100% of the time evokes this reaction from our friends. (girl sighs) That's so sweet. And we live for that reaction. It's no biggie. (clicks tongue) (slurping) - Mmm, no you know girl,
no yeah he always be doing cute things like that for me. Yeah no, it's just a
regular Thursday ya know? (laughing) Number five. I'm gonna be honest, I'm
pretty shy when it comes to sexual stuff, like if you
say a sex joke in front of me, of course I'll laugh, I'll be like; (laughing) But inside, I'm like. (nervous laughter) They're talking about the pee pees. So when it comes to relationships
I'm pretty reserved, and I don't like PDA. And only one thing can change that. Alcohol. Okay, so two things can change that. Number one, alcohol. Number two, music. Because when I hear sexy song, it's not just a sexy song to me, no. This is my chance, to live
out my dream music video. (Lilly sighing) Hey babe. - Oh, how was rehearsal?
- Good. - Oh was it? Does that mean you're in
the mood for some, you know? - No, no. I'm sweating,
need to take a shower. (he sighs heavily) ("Bad Liar" by Selena Gomez) ♫ If you're the art I'll be the brush ♫ Oooh you're taking up
a fraction of my mind ♫ Oooh every time I watch you serpentine ♫ Oh I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' ♫ I'm tryin' I'm tryin' ♫ Oh tryin' I'm tryin' I'm
tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' ♫ Not to think about you
not to think about you ♫ No no no no not to think about you ♫ Not to think about you ♫ No no no no I'm tryin' I'm tryin' ♫ I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' ♫ Oh tryin' I'm tryin' I'm
tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' ♫ Not to give in to you give in to you ♫ No, no, no, no, not to give in to you ♫ Give in to you ♫ With my feelings on fire ♫ Guess I'm a bad liar ♫ And oh baby let's make (phone ringing) - Babe, the music! - Oh, got a phone call. - Oh my God, I'm taking a shower. - No, no, Selena's gonna come back. ♫ Oh baby it's Selena it's Selena - Ooo, I swear to God, music
transform me as a person, okay? Just from shy Lilly, to Optimus Grind. (loud thud) Yo, sorry Dom couldn't

(bells jingling) - So what did you get up to last night? - Oh, nothing. - Cool. - But did you see what I did with my face? I said... Nothing. That means I did something, but I just want you to get it outta me. - God, you're a lotta work. So, what were you up to last night? - Oh, me? Nothing. - You're doin' it again. Okay.
(Lilly slurps) - Oh my god, Lilly, I'm so dying to know what you did last night. Please tell me, tell me, tell me. - Okay, fine. If you insist. God, you're so nosy. I totally went out with a boy. - Okay, cut to the chase. Did you wake up with a boy? - No, I did not wake up with a boy. But I totally kissed a boy. - You (beep)? - No, this is kissing a boy. - Oh. (kissing sounds) - No, that's not-- This is when you actually have sex. (scoffs) - Was it a lizzy kiss? - What do you mean, "was it a lizzy kiss?" - It's when you stick out your tongue, and you lick the other person's lips. Like this. - No, stop that. Stop that. Charlize, stop, we're in public. - That's how you do it. Everybody in this room
knows that's how you do it. - Innocent people, I'm so
sorry enjoy your coffee. - You're like the only one
that doesn't know a lizzy kiss. - We just put our lips together like normal human beings. God. - Lame. - Okay, how is that lame? - It's not what guys want these days. - Really? How do you know what guys want? (magazines slam) - Right there. That's how I know. 'Cause I read all of these. - How big is your bag? - This is everything you need to know about how to please a guy
written by a group of women. - Makes sense. - This month alone, there's
14 ways to kiss a guy, 27 ways to style your pubic hair and 72 ways to drive him wild in bed. - 72 ways?! Are you kidding? I know like three. Lingerie, sex... - Pouring hot oatmeal on his nipples... - Yeah-- What? How is that number three? How is that even a number? (scoffs) - You've got a lot to learn. - Twenty new sex tips? Are you kidding me? I thought sex involved one tip. - No, you take a bath together. But be sure to put four
drops of lavender oil, three drops of sandalwood and a drop and a half of olive oil. You mix it in the water. - Olive oil? Wait, guys care about this stuff? I thought guys liked
Call of Duty and butts. - Lilly! Guys know the difference
between essential oils. - Frig! Okay no wait, you're going too fast. Tell me, how should I kiss him tonight? Should I do the reptile thing? - Oh my god that's so two issues ago. - Okay, right. Obviously, ew. - Here's what you do. First, you take three grapes, and you put them in your mouth. - Okay, three grapes. - Yes, do it. - Right now?
- Yeah. And then when he kisses
you, you massage his tongue with the grapes. - Why wouldn't I just
do this with my tongue? - What is this 1999? - No. - Oh my God. - No, ew, of course not. - Step two, you keep your eyes wide open like you're putting
eye drops in your eyes. All the time, don't blink. - Isn't that awkward? - No, it's great. - What do I do with the grapes after? - Well, you squish it on his back. Guys love that. - I feel like an idiot. - No, actually it looks good. You look like a desirable stripper. - Really? - Yeah, so now tell me how're you gonna make babies with him? - Okay, well... I'm gonna go to his
house, take my pants off. - Mmhmm. - And then wrap my legs around him, and have sweet consensual lovemaking. - No! Wrong! Do you wanna end up with 38 cats? - Just tell me what to do! - You wrap your legs around an ice bucket for 22 minutes 'til it's
really nice and numb, and you can't feel anything. And then you let him bang you really fast. And you listen to the "Frozen" soundtrack. - That makes total sense. My God, I don't know any of this. He's never gonna find me attractive. - Quick! Three things to rub on his inner thigh. - Okay, um... - Too slow. - Oh, okay, my elbow. Something like that, okay. A feather and apple slices. - Bingo! Now tell me the 16 best positions. - 16?!
- Yes. - Okay, uh, me on top, uh, him on top. What else? - Let's ask pink. - I am not going to ask your
vagina for advice right now. Oh okay, obviously. That makes sense. - She says you're on stilts
and he's on a trampoline. - Pink would. - It's great advice. (iPhone beeps) - Siri, can you remind me to
pick up Advil on the way home? - Hey, listen Lilly whatever you do, make sure you exfoliate with
raw sugar, honey, lime juice. - Exfoliate where? - Everywhere. - Everywhere? - Everywhere. Guys love it. - Ouch. - Yes. - Seein' Lily again tonight. Gotta good feeling about it. - You should get her flowers. Girls dig that. - That is a good idea. (clink) - Thank you so much for

- (Sighs) Sorry I'm late. - Wow! I didn't realize you were so disrespectful. - Dude. There was so much traffic. Sorry I'm late, my bad. - I'm not talking about the traffic, Lilly. I'm talking about the Starbucks cup. Christmas is about Jesus, not themed lattes. That cup is too simple and offensive. Conspiracies...Hmm. - Wow, that's really disappointing, Shane. Here, I thought you didn't judge me for my religious beliefs. - What are you talking about? - Heh, I don't know. Just the fact that I came here to spend time with my friend, and now I'm basically being converted to Christianity. Yeah, you can't say "Christmas" to me. It's "holiday". - Oh Well then how was your "holiday" shopping? - Eh, it was pretty easy. Only one of my nephews is nice, so the rest of them are getting a lump of coal. What about you? - Well, I recognize that coal is bad for the environment, so I resent that fairytale. And I don't know we don't really do gifts 'cause that's not important, but, we go caroling. - Mmm, right, right. Yeah well, you know I was thinking about "Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" is basically promoting adultery, so, I won't be doing that. - Oh, I see. Because I'm bisexual, everything I do is associated with adultery. Huh, I thought you were different. - Oh, so now because I'm colored, I'm different. Also, why is your name in blue and mine's in pink? Gender-based stereotypes about color are not okay. - I don't appreciate you dictating what color my name, Lilly. Especially somebody like you, whose name is culturally appropiating a flower. And the flower community is pissed. - Wow! Are you man-splaining what my own name means? - I can't believe you're manipulating my words, and exerting your power over me. - Mmm, yeah of course: "man-ipulate." Why wouldn't it be woman-ipulate? - Hey guys, would you like to sign a petition to protect net neutrality? If we get enough signatures, we can make a real difference. - Huh, so you're all about #GirlLove and you're so crazy for it? - What about #BoyLove? - So now I'm crazy because I'm on my period? Also, that's offensive to everyone that suffers from mental health issues. You can't just throw around the word "crazy". God. - Excuse me. It'd only take a moment of your time. - OK, I'm sorry, can I see a script? Ha, I knew it! You didn't capitalize "God". You worship Satan. - We're gonna protest as well, and-- - But wait, when you said the word "Satan," you only had 6 points, so really you worship Satan. Also, I am so offended by your shirt. Definitely child labor. - This is Amazon Prime, Lilly. Bite me. Although, I bet you're too busy biting vegetables that are not sourced from local farmers. - Bite you? Wow! Listen I'm not an object here to fulfill your sexual fantasies. You're unreal. - So now I'm fiction? Huh Well, I'm glad I'm entertaining you. - Makes sense since the Entertainment Industry is dominated by men. Yeah, that must weigh heavy on your conscience. - Are you calling me heavy? Because that is not body-positive, Lilly. - OK, just to clarify: I'm the offended one here. - Uh, no, I'm definitely more offended. - There's no way you're more offended than me. - Oh, really? Take a look at my Twitter. I'm literally shaking with offense. - I am quaking with offense. - It doesn't make sense when you say it like that. - Wow, did they just make an earthquake joke? That's so offensive. - I made a video with... - Shane Dawson. - And he's so lovely - I'm in love with him. You know he has a YouTube channel. It's in the description. Check it out. He's amazing. Last collaboration right over there. Second vlog channel. Super 60 starts right now for responding to your comments. Make sure you subscribe because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday. One love Superwoman. That is a wrap and zoop. I'm offended. 
[ horse neighing] [ whoosh ] I don't understand why you're upset! I did everything I could to make you have a nice night. You're just annoying and gross! Recently, it seems like nothing I do is good enough. - That was cute. - I'm just not sure if I'm satisfying her anymore. What if we just improve our products so we don't need to spend as much on marketing? - Absolutely not. -- That's a horrible idea. It'll never work. It's been two weeks since anyone has taken my idea seriously. Is your love life falling apart? Is your girlfriend, for sure, faking it? Do you sound like a dumb moron? Introducing ACCENTrin™ ACCENTrin™ instantly gives you an accent making you sound 80% more romantic and has been shown to improve your sex life by 2 times more Netflix and Chill resulting in less people thinking you sound like an idiot all the time. - Now, it doesn't matter what I do or say. She loves it. Listen mate. I think you're cringe, init. I reckon we should see other people. - Oh, babe. I love you so much. - I don't even have to try anymore and she gets turned on. Hey babe! Y'know, I've ran out of fresh knickers this morning? Had to take an old pair and turn it inside out. - Oh yes! - Now, everyone thinks I sound really smart even if my ideas are stupid. Bruv Don't worry if the product is dangerous, mate. Allow it. We'll just get a celebrity endorsement. - That's a great idea! -- Revolutionary. - Groundbreaking - My name is Ed Sheeran and before ACCENTrin™ I was just a regular singer on the streets trying to make a name for myself. My name is Ed and I'm gonna be a star. But now that I have an accent everyone can relate to my music. ♪ She played ♪ ♪ the fiddle in ♪ ♪ an Irish band ♪ ♪ But she fell ♪ ♪ in love with ♪ ♪ an English man ♪ ♪ Kissed her on the neck ♪ ♪ and then I took her by the hand ♪ ♪ Said, "Baby, I just want to dance" ♪ Same. - Ask your doctor if ACCENTrin™ is right for you side effects may include dehydration... - May I get a glass of water please? - Sorry.

One Love Superwoman That is a wrap and ZOOP! Bollocks, it's hot! 
♫ Where in the world is Superwoman today Toronto, which means I'm
in front of this old wall. You know the "I miss the old wall"? Yeah wait for me to get sued. You gonna pay my legal bills? (unicorn hoofbeats) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman. And the other day my
girl was talking to me about this dude she liked
and then we proceeded to talk about it for like 19 hours and in those 19 hours I realized, yo this is rocket science. Talking to your crush is so complicated. Like straight up, why don't
they teach this in school. Like great, yeah, I know how
to make a paper mache volcano erupt but my love life
remains unexplosive. Thanks education. You really pulled through for your girl. That and f-ing long division,
like ooh yay I can divide the number 2,374. Yet your legs remain undivided. Don't piss me off, zoomed in Lilly, okay? We don't even have that
much space in this old room, so we're almost the same person. Shut up. Crushes, first of all
you overthink to death when you text them, right? 'Cause you're like I don't
want to come on too strong but I also don't want them
to think I'm not interested, so it's like how do I be 2010
and 2016 version of Beyonce at the same time? He hasn't texted today. Well don't text him first. Honestly don't be so petty, okay. If you want to text him, just text him. Yeah if you'se a thirsty ho. You've got to make it
seem like you're busy and don't have time to waste. But you don't want him to
feel like you're too good to think about him. Well when's the last
time he thought of you? Check the time stamp, girl. He texted first last time. Okay then you text first this time. Whoa, we out here keeping score now? (phone dings) Oh, he texted. Wait, wait, you just gonna instantly reply like a parched ho? Like your thirst is unquenchable? You have to make him wait awhile. I don't care how mature,
responsible and woke I become as a person, okay? The version of Lilly that texts
you back will remain petty. Like oh you took three minutes
to reply to my text message because you were at work. Okay yeah well you'll
hear from me next week, through a subtweet. While I date your brother. And I key your car. What? Too much, too much Lilly. Rewind, rewind. While I date your brother. And key your car. Dammit. When the pettiness cannot
even be edited out. When Final Cut cannot
even remove the pettiness. Oh no but for real, this ain't a joke. It could be like our two year anniversary and I'm still gonna be like. (marker squeaks) Oh sorry according to our Excel sheet, I think I have the first kids,
so this one's on you, ho. Let's go get your uterus installed. What is this video even about? I don't even know.
(thump) What's happening? (thump) What's happening. Also I'm just kidding. Don't think I'm a horrible person. I'm totally not like that. (thump) (thump) So then you start consistently
talking to your crush, right? Things are going well and you're like, yo I might actually be on the steady path towards a relationship, until what happens? Every sexy man on the planet
suddenly wants to notice you. Just like (sniffing) what? (inhaling) Why is it that when you're
about to be in a relationship or you're in a relationship, suddenly you're a magnet for people. Just like oh now that I'm
potentially in a relationship, every sexy guy with a
good heart and a six pack just gonna hit me up. Suddenly what's his face
broke up with his girl. Suddenly Zayn Malik is my new neighbor and he wants to borrow some of this sugar. Like where were you when I was drinking and watching Netflix
alone, two months ago. You were gay or taken,
that's where you were. But now that I'm textually
active with someone you gonna come out of
nowhere with the text like hey long time no talk. Shut up your bloody face. It's like god is playing
some sort of cosmic joke. Just like okay let's make
all those boys available, all those boys near Lilly. You know what, actually
tonight I'm even feeling like a solar eclipse, something real beautiful, but let's make them
all get special glasses or else they'll go blind. Who do you think you are? (thunder clapping) Okay. And then there's the absolute worst part about having a crush
or talking to someone. That is that moment where you're like, wait, are we dating? Like I don't know the
rules, you know what I mean? Like I don't now how to
tell if I'm dating someone. And I honestly feel like
there's this time period where no one knows and
everyone's just playing along. And I'm just in this awkward
gray area where I'm like, what, is, am I Pinocchio? Did I get swallowed by a whale? Like where am I? Just filling out an application
like okay, name, yeah yeah. Relationship status. (throat clearing) It's complicated. Like hold, this ain't Facebook. You at the doctor's office. It's either in a relationship or not in a relationship, okay. They're trying to check
your blood pressure, not comment on your status. Get it together.
(snapping) And I just want to know, are
you flirting with other people? Are we exclusive? Are we intrusive? Are we inclusive? Am I a rapper? Does it matter? This is blabber, just chatter. Unrelated, are we dating? If you're playing I'm
just saying, tell me, that's all Super is
saying, aka Super Saiyan. What up tee shirt reference. You can go ahead and click subscribe now. You know, I know it's not
a dis track or a reaction to a dis track, but I
promise, you'll survive. (sucking) No for real though. I don't know how to tell
if I'm dating someone. Can you comment below and let me know, because there have been
so many times in my life where I'm like, am I in
a serious relationship with this dude, or does
he just take me places? That's not a relationship. That's called and Uber. (thudding) Yo wait, before you go
pay attention to all these promotional things I'm saying, 'cause look at all the
hand motions I'm doing and how animated I am. You should definitely stay. Yo, if you're not subscribed,
make sure you subscribe because I work really hard on these videos and if you are subscribed then

Look how nice it sounds. (bell chiming) Okay go ahead. Yo, I hope you enjoyed that video. If you did, give it a thumbs up. I actually want to see how
many thumbs up I can get 'cause I feel like I just say that, but maybe, like, it doesn't happen. Do it. Want to watch more videos like this? Right over there. My second dope vlog

- [Lilly] No no no! It's not worth it, you'll regret this! I will cut you, ho! (mellow music) (screams) You can't keep us locked
up in here forever. I'm already sweating. This fabric is kind of nice, though. Shut up! Hey, just because you're bigger, it doesn't make you the boss of me! Right, cleavage? I don't want to get in
the middle of this, okay? Gimme gimme more, gimme
more, gimme gimme more. I feel kind of funny, I'm not
sure if I can handle this. Soldiers, prepare for war. I want to tattoo your face on my pupils so I can stare at you all the time. I'm ready to settle down. Double tap, double tap, double tap! F me, F me! ♫ Hallelujah, hallelujah Yes, yes, that's the spot! Yes yes yes, that's that spot! - [Man] Okay, one, two, three. - [Lilly] It's my time to shine! Trying to suck in, please hurry. Let me see. Oh my god, we are ugly,
nobody tell the heart. Sorry, I don't lie. Should we eat some cookies to feel better. (screaming) Tell my family I love
them and I died a hero. - [Man] Due today. - [Lilly] What's happening? I'm getting tight, I can't
move, why do I feel heavy? I'm turning gray! Stop stop stop, this won't solve anything, goddamn, no, now we're uneven. May day, may day, she's about to blow, this is not a drill, earthquake! Achoo! Ladies and gentlemen, that
was a seven on the Richter scale, four injuries, no deaths. I lost everything! ♫ Freedom, freedom I have a dream. What's happening, I'm
skipping, I'm moving too fast, don't cheat on me, let's get married. Touch me, please, touch me. We're tingling. What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman, did you like this video? Give it a big thumbs up,

that is a wrap and zoop. 
- How you doin'? (horse galloping and neighing) What up everyone? It's
your girl, Superwoman. And you know what's worse
than going through a breakup? Having a friend who's
going through a breakup. - [Man on TV] I am so happy. (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Beth] Hey, Lil. - Oh, hey, Jess. - What's up? - I was watching Chopped. - Kevin and I broke up. (sobbing) (Jess sobbing)
(TV host talking) - Oh, you thought I was that friend because I was eating ice cream and crying. (scoffs) Nah, nah, nah. I just do that regularly. What up, Miss Direction? I'm going that way? Having your heart broken sucks, okay? But when your friend
has their heart broken, not only are you sad and angry for them, but it's also a lot of work. Like, straight up for
the next couple months or days if your friend is that girl. Your friend is gonna be
legit broken and useless. You mine as well change your occupation. - And what do you do
for a living Miss Singh? - Babysitter. Wait. Do my glasses make
me look like a monkey? (imitating a monkey) Like, you and your girl
used to be on the same page, but now y'all can't even communicate because she's so devastated. It's a what? - You want to get her to say that word. - This word? But I can't say these words? - Exactly.
- Okay. - Okay. Ready?
- Mhmm. - And go. - Okay. Uh, uh, it's a part of you. - Tears. - No. Uh. Everybody has it all the time. - Expectations. - No, no, stop. Listen. Ooo. Sometimes it hurts. - Your heart?
- No. - Your head? - No. Sometimes it hurts. - Your neck.
- Your heart. - No! - Is it your heart? - No. - Is it your heart? - Stop! - Your heart. (wails) - Jackal? Jackal? Is it a jackal? Jackal? Jackal? Is it a jackal? If you know where that's from, come and pull up because
we can be friends. That's phase one, okay? When your friend can't do or say anything without bringing up her breakup or her ex. Now, phase two is when
your heart-broken friend becomes a menace to society. Like, okay. No. I don't want to be insensitive. I get it. You're sad. You're lonely. You're sexually frustrated. Okay. You have to get
your own Netflix account. Oh, the terror! But, girl, you need to get it together, especially around kids, okay? My heart-broken friends be talking to my younger cousins like, - I love you. No, I love you. (smooching) - What ya doin', kiddo? - My toys are in love. - Oh, are they? That's a little unrealistic, isn't it? - I know dolls aren't real, okay? But it's still fun to pretend. - (scoffs) No, no, no, dolls can be real. Haven't you seen Chucky? It's love that isn't real. - Mom? - You'll think it's real. Then you'll put all this
extra effort into your hair, but no one will ever notice. You know why? Because you don't matter?
(suspenseful music) - Dad? - And one day the person you
love will leave you all alone and all your other friends
will get married and have kids and you'll be swiping through
Tinder at 2 a.m. on a Tuesday. - I think it's past my bedtime. - And then everyday you'll look
at the tattoo on your wrist of his name and wonder,
"Could I turn it into a swan or maybe a butterfly," but
deep down inside you know that you'll just have to cut your arm off. - Mom! (wails) - Kids, never take candy from strangers and never talk to someone
who just got dumped. Like, why you all here
emotionally scarring kids, okay? Don't you know one of them has to grow up and become the next president? Go and F it up for the rest of us, okay? One your friend is done
being dev-a-ma-stated, okay, they'll enter phase three,
which you'll be able to convince them to
finally leave the house. Like, girl, put on some lipstick. We going dancing. And the mission is simple: Empower her and encourage her
through positive self-talk. I'm kidding. (chuckles) Yo, find that hoe a rebound. (sighs) - This is going to be so much fun. I promise. Let's listen to some music. ("Hello" by Adele) Let's listen to something a little more-- - Don't touch it. - Okay. ("Hello" by Adele continues playing) (gags) (mouths) Party. So much for that rebound. Eventually, your friend
will reach phase four, okay? And this is when she goes from being sad to being extra as F. There is a 100% chance that
your friend is gonna be on Instagram doing the
most after a breakup. Do you hear that? Shh. Do you hear that? It's all my friends watching
this video being like, "Mmm, yeah, that's you, Lilly. "You a hoe." What? Now it's unhealthy to
have double taps as validation? Get the F out of here? (giggles) Once your friend starts recovering, you should remember that she is for sure going to have a
relapse every time y'all go out or she hears a specific song
or she consumes alcohol. That's phase five. Yeah, and it's dangerous. - I can't do this anymore. - I'm gonna need you to calm down. - I'm gonna do it. - Do not do it. - I have no choice. - You're not thinking straight right now. - I am, okay? I love him. - Put it down. It's not worth it. - I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna send him a text. - Give me your phone. (Jess shrieks) Yo, straight up. Am I recording? Oh, God. Jesus Christ. I would rather give my
Indian mom a wooden spoon to beat my face with, okay, than give my drunk,
heart-broken friend her phone. Straight up. People
going through a breakup, they should have a license,
okay, to carry their phone. Ma'am, are you legally allowed
to be carrying that weapon? But I love him. By the power invested
in me through Dr. Phil, I'm gonna have to confiscate that weapon. Fine, whatever, okay? I'll just call him with this. That's fine. Have a nice night. Jackal. Jackal. Is it jackal? Nope, it's merkel. Now, after a few relapses your friend will eventually hit phase six, okay, where they'll do ridiculous
things to try being positive. Jess? What ya doin'? - Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming. - Now, if you've made it
to phase six, congrats! You're a great friend. And on behalf of your friend I thank-- (phone ringing) I'm shooting a video. Hello? - Hey, Lil. It's Jess. - Yeah. Jess, I'm a little busy right now. - I'm back together with Kevin. (sighs) - Welcome to phase seven. Tell me all about it. But wait. Stop. Don't go anywhere. No, shut up. No, look at
me, look at me, look at me. Pretty motion. Look at
me before the end comes. For Valentine's Day I've got
some new merch coming out. It's not out yet, but when it comes out, if you want a discount on it, follow this account, right here,

♫ Where in the world is Superwoman today - Hyderabad, India. (neighing and hooves beating) What up, everyone? It's your girl, Superwoman and yes I am in India
right now for my book tour. Right off the bat, shameless plug. I'm also going to all
of these other places. To get your tickets, link
is in the description. www.LillySinghBook.com/tour Just saying. Okay, enough of that. Now because I'm traveling so much, I've been in airports a lot and airports are always fun said no one ever. JK. JK. They're all right. I mean I guess it depends if there's a McDonald's. Anyways, here are the types of people you will for sure see in airports. Number one, the liquid smugglers. So you're waiting in the
security line, right? Waiting to put your stuff onto the belt and walk to the machine which by the way is for sure giving all of us some sort of disease. I can't wait until 2050 where we all just have
tails for no reason. But anyways, you're about
to walk through this machine and the most annoying thing
about this entire process is that person who works there that just sounds like a robot and is all like, "All right people "I need laptops out by themselves, "shoes off, everything
out of your pockets. "No water bottles or liquids in your bags "and stay with your bin "and push your bin into the machine." This person annoys me so much because they're so
monotone and repetitive. But you know who's more
annoying than this person? The goddamn passenger that ignores everything this person is saying. I really don't understand. Okay, there's a sign
that tells you the rules. There's a real life person
yelling out the rules. How are you confused? Because straight up everything around you is just like "Laptops by themselves." And you step up to the spot like "Ready." "Shoes off." "Ready." "No water bottles." "Ready." And without fail, every single time, the entire line will be held up because not only will someone have a water bottle in their backpack, they're gonna argue about it. Just like "What do you mean? "It's just water. "Nobody told me about the water bottles. "I was never warned
about the water bottles." And I'm just standing
there with my goddamn bin since you were warned about the water more than the poor people
on the goddamn Titanic. Get the F out of here. Hurry up to the lines, so I'll go through this
machine and get a tail, be mother effing Avatar up the joint. Okay, the heat is getting to my head. Number two, evil airline staff. Here's the thing about
airline staff, right? Is they're either Mother
Teresa or Voldemort. Okay, there's no in-between. It's either nice or pure evil. You walk up to the little
kiosk in the airport where you gotta give
your bags and check in and you're in a great mood. Okay, you're like I'm at the airport, I'm about to go on a vacay. Let me go up to this person and be like "Hi, how are you?" And then that chick behind
the counter's just like "Welcome to your tape." Because, straight up, I make it a point to be really nice to that person that's checking me in and taking my bags because I know she's
about to weigh my suitcase and let's be real, my suitcase is 100% overweight. My makeup bag alone weighs like 20 pounds. It's filled with all those
lip glosses I never use. So I'm just like "Hi, great day! "How was your day? "Look how personable I am. "Don't look at the scale, look at me. "Look how long my hair is." Now the limit is 50 pounds and I am overjoyed when
I see my suitcase is 50.1 and I'm like, my god,
I'm such a light packer until this chick says to me, "Ooh, that'll be a hundred
dollars overweight charge." And I'm just like, "A wha? "Overweight? "Girl, I will open up my suitcase "and take out a single Q-tip, okay? "Don't be trippin'. "You can't let 0.1 slide?" It's just a fact, some airline staff want to make your life hell. Just like, "Yes, Ma'am,
here's your boarding pass. "If you'd like a seatbelt with your seats "that'll be an additional $60. "Oh what's that? What's that? "Sorry, speak up, Sir. "Oh, you're vegetarian? "Well, we only serve steak so... "Oh, you requested a window seat? Okay. "Here's a middle seat in
the middle of the plane "with a seat that doesn't recline. "Bye now!" Number three, doodlers. So right before you walk
into the security line, you go and give your passport
and your boarding pass to someone who is sitting
in that little booth and they check your documents. They take a pen and
they scribble something on your boarding pass and I cannot be the only person that's wondering, "What
the F are you writing?" They literally circle random things and now I'm stressed because the markings on my boarding pass do not look like my friend's boarding pass and I'm convinced they
100% have flagged me. That's right. You know why? Because of my skin. It's dry. But honestly, I don't
think it means anything. I think they just all make it up and it's a scam to make it
look like they have a process when they really don't. Straight up they're probably just like, "Okay. Hi. Yes, Ma'am. "Circle, circle. "Triangle. "Let me pretend to look
up and match her face "even though I'm on the wrong page here. "Okay, dot dot. "Now I've got my cootie shot. "Alright. Here you go, Ma'am. "Actually no, wait one second, sorry. "Hashtag, that's right. "Because of the dry skin." (laughing) My skin is really dry
though with the traveling. What the hell is this? Hotels have the weirdest lotions. Just like cranberry citrus lemon pepper cotton candy butt hole. Alright, back to the video. Number four, baggage bullies. So you've landed, you've gone through customs and now you're going to
pick up your luggage. The moment you touch your suitcase you can expect 17 porter
people, baggage people, to come and offer you
to help with your bags. Now depending on which country you're in, these people can be a
little bit more persistent because in some places around the world, these people will straight up harass you until you let them help you. I will just be like, "Oh no, I'm fine. "It's okay." And they'll be like, "Ma'am." "No, I'm fine, I'm fine. Don't help me." "Ma'am, bags." "No, I'm good. I really
don't need any help." "Give me your bags." And even though I've said
no like three, four times somehow this man is now holding my bag and I'm like "Fine! Help me with my bags. "I simply cannot manage." And even when you try asking them. Like, "How much is it gonna be? "What's the fee?" They will never answer you. "Oh, don't worry. We'll figure it out." ♫ La la la ♫ La la la with your bags. And then straight up, the person helping me
with my bags will be like, "That'll be $20." Where was the agreement of sale? Where was the point of transaction? Why am I getting robbed right now? Obviously I'm going to
give them the money. I'm not trying to piss off
nobody in no foreign country and get taken. My dad ain't Liam Neeson. Call my dad, just be like
"Dad, I've been taken." He just like, "You getting married?" Number five, the walking dead. Carl! Now there are two places in the world I feel like you can find
sleep-deprived soulless people. Number one is in your school library and number two is in the airport. These are the people that are
catching that six a.m. flight, had to wake up three a.m., walking through the airport, holding their pillow, wearing their PJs, not giving a shred of an F. Not only are they walking like zombies but they will take every opportunity to get a nap even if it's
for like four minutes and I cannot stress how
much I am this person. I get to my gate and I'm like "Yo, hold up, we got 13
minutes to spare, yo. "Let me catch some REM sleep real quick." Oh. Airports think they're slick. They put those armrests,
dividing the chairs so that you can't lie down and take a nap. I'm like, "Bruh, you don't know me, okay?" I will straight up turn into
a contortionist right now to lie down on these seats. I've done it before. Okay let me put my leg to this armrest right here, okay. Rest my neck on here, balance, curve my spine. (laughing) Oh my god, I've done this so many times. This explains a lot. I'm like this explains a lot. And if not, if that doesn't work out? You better believe I will find
a creative way to take a nap. You can catch me at
the airport just like-- (Brahms' Lullaby) (snoring) But straight up, I love airports because I love traveling and I loved meeting all of you on tour. It is literally my favorite thing to do. Speaking of which, aside from the tour, if you haven't got my book yet, it is available literally almost everywhere in the
world and in bookstores or you can go to www.LillySinghBook.com. I'm so happy to announce it is a New York Times bestseller for the third week in a row and I would love to keep
this momentum going. Don't listen to me and read the reviews. I feel like people really
really like the book. So if you want the book
you can get the book. That's all. Okay, bye. (yelling) Namaste. I hope you enjoyed that video. If you did, yo, give it a thumbs up. I'm so sorry I've been missing uploads. It's really hard with the WiFi

Deeps in your contacts. Perhaps you meant one of these. - What, no, no, no. Call Sukhdeep. - Calling Coco. - Coco who? Call Sukhdeep. - Calling Suck Deep. - God. - Eh, Paramjeet. You calling dirty hotline? - No, no, no, no, no, Manjeet, I'm trying Sukhdeep, my cousin. Hello, Sucka Deep? Sukhdeep! - Trying to do Boomerang on time. Kay, ready? Tell me when. Go. Let me see. No, again, again! Ready? Let me see. Okay, one more time. Ready? Garbage! - Global warming. - Pick a head or tail. - Mouth. - Okay, global warming. - Now, a lot of scientists
and planet people will tell you that global warming because of pollution. - Cars. Fossil fuel. Greenhouse affect. - But now, the number one
cause for global warming has been discovered. - Inappropriate behavior. - AKA shame, shame. - But no, let us prove
it with science, okay? With the ecosystems. - You see, when young people
start doing shame, shame, they start to feel very hot. - Hormones. In body, okay? Physical activity. (coughs) And take a socks, it all
cause young people to sweat. - But they don't, oh yes, getting hot and heavy. And when you're feeling hot and heavy, this go into the atmosphere and
create dome of shame, shame, thus creating climate change. - Example of irresponsible behavior: touching, kissing, texting, talking, looking. For every eggplant emoji used incorrectly, one iceberg melt. - And one Titanic lives. For every peach emoji used incorrectly, one polar bear die. - And I want you question, okay.

places with people, okay, because then... Instead, you leave every single light on. - If you feeling hot, leave open fridge for minimum 10 hour to cool down. - If your car break down, don't sleep over at some shame, shame
friend house, no, no, no you sleep in your car and you leave your car running all night. - I know what you thinking, you thinking, what about when adult people do the shame, shame,
why no pollution then? - Unpossible. Because when adult do the shame, shame, they married and there is no shame, shame, they not giving any pollution. Why? Because when you married,
you giving less energy when you doing the shame, shame. You getting more comfortable. You eating more carbs. You shaving less. Therefore, you not giving any heat. Marriage is less hot. - But a young people? No, a young people dancing like this. Like this, look at my everything moving! - Like this. Like this. - Smashing, passing, Netflix chilling. So much heat and pollution. - If you want to help the
planet, don't do shame, shame. - Or if you want to help, get married, okay, because this usually
make people more cold. - Cold? What do you mean cold? - Shut up, okay, you stupid, you ruin all my bloody dreams. We doing our part, are you? Hello, before you go end card, I have something very

- You know you need to click the thumbs up right off the get go because
my hair looks hella cute. (unicorn hooves beating) What up everyone it's
your girl Superwoman. And I like to believe I'm a kind person. You know I'm nice, I'm
giving, I'm considerate. Except when we're playing
some sort of game or sport because then I'm your
worst f-ing nightmare. I can't help it okay? Straight up I go from
Disney Channel child star to Ex-Disney Channel
child star who is now 20. From ♫ I've got the limo out front to ♫ Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it and I know I'm not the only one. Here are some signs that
you're competitive as F. You don't see games as just games. No, no, games are a reflection
of who you are as a person. You see you won't admit
it, but that's how you feel because if you miss the
ball in a game of ping pong, mm mm it's not just about this game okay. You know deep down you missed the ball because you have split
ends and trust issues. You missed the ball because
you can't do long division and you can't spell the word schedule. And when you suck, you get angry. Are you even listening to me? God damn it Lilly what are you doing? Did I tell you to do that? Did I tell you to do that? Are you dumb? Are you dumb? No wait, are you dumb? (paddle slamming) Stupid Lilly you can't do anything. (forceful exhaling) When playing a game mistakes
are never your fault. Oh no, no. If you threw a ball and it
did not go in the basket, no it has nothing to
do with your aim, okay. It's because of the recession. Are you ready for this? Are you ready for-- Now hold on hold on, I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready. That was the breeze. Look, look I'm eating my hair. That was the breeze. (groaning) No I got a cramp, I got a cramp. Send it back. Woo, okay! Money! (groaning) Yo, yo I think I have appendicitis, eh? Oh my tonsils. Yeah you know I'm still shook from the OA. That's what it is. All net. (plastic rattling) Yo man the camera keeps getting in my way. Get outta here! You know you're hella competitive when you do eventually lose and you can't give the
victor any type of credit so you pull one of these. (grunting) Yo I let you win, okay? I felt bad for you. I know this means a lot to you. I don't want to lower your self-esteem. I wanted to give you hope. I know your parents are getting
divorced so I didn't want to you know, add more to your plate. Let's go again. Let's go again, it's cool. Yo straight up, I hate
when people do this to me. Like what you mean you felt bad for me? Like sis I'm getting paid. I'm getting fed. I just took a piss and
it was so transparent because I'm hella hydrated okay? My life is great. You just suck. (laughing) And to be honest, the only
times you do actually lose it's just because your
opponent is super lucky. Yeah and you let them know that. Wow. Look at this luck. So lucky, whatever. Whatever let's play. Let's go. I could win too if I
got all the good cards. Are you serious? Go. Bruh hurry up man. Bo mother f-er. Are you seeing this? Wow, wow! Okay wow. Whatever. Must be nice to have a four
leaf clover up your butt hole. This game is pure luck. There's no skill involved, so. No go, win, win, go ahead win. Mm, the amount of saltiness
in that bloodstream. That bloodstream is straight up Vegemite. You see me, I'm so competitive that when I do finally
come to terms with the fact that I may not be the best at something, I become obsessed with it. Because from that point on my entire life is dedicated towards mastering that skill. (driving rock music) (plastic ball clicking) (clapping and cheering) (driving rock music) Straight up I don't care
what else I fail in life, okay, as long as I become a pro at that one thing you beat me at. - Lilly, I think you forgot to
fill in one of your eyebrows. - Oh yeah? Remember the time I beat
you in ping pong, though? But I mean at the end of the day, when someone competitive starts losing, they begin to realize
that maturity is key. I mean we're all adults here, okay, and a game doesn't change that. (ping pong balls clattering) - Game point for me. - Okay whatever. Winning isn't everything. There's more to life. (ping pong ball clattering) Game point for me. (paddle thudding) I win mother f-er. Yo what's my name, what's my name? (shrieking) Hold on wait, let me just
ride on my win right now. Oh snap. I'm surfing on my win. I can't even swim right now. I'm drowning in my win. I'm drowning. Ah help me! Help me! (laughing) You like this video? If you did give it a big thumbs up. Fun fact, I'm on tour right now and I might be coming to a city near you. Lillysinghbook.com/tour

because I make new videos every Monday and Thursday. One love Superwoman. That is a wrap and zoop. 
- Now don't get your
panties all in a bunch. (horse neighing) What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman, and a lot of people ask me if I've ever suffered any extreme cases of racism and to be honest, no. I'm fortunate enough
to say that I haven't, but since moving to LA I have definitely had some people say some
ridiculous things to me. But here's the thing, I
find it F-in hilarious. Here are real things that
white people have said to me. My dad's name is Sukhwinder. - Sukwinder? Sukwander? I'll just call your dad Sam. - Oh my God you're Indian. I loved Slumdog Millionaire. - So your last name's Singh, are you related to Ranveer Singh? - You know, one of my
co-workers is Indian. What a small world. - So I went to like an
Indian wedding once, and I wore the full
costume and everything. - Your parents must be really strict. - Did they expect you
to get married at 23? - I even belly danced to Bollywood music and I wore that little dot on my forehead. - So why aren't you a doctor or a lawyer? - Are you allowed to have a boyfriend? - I went to Little India once and I got the best tandoori chicken. - Do you speak Indian at home? - Are you a very strict Hindi? - So is your real name Lilly? Stop lying, I've never
met a real Indian Lilly. - Do you know Priyanka Chopra? She's Indian too, right? - It's so terrible everything
you see in movies about India. - You probably want
something spicy, right? - You know who you look like? Mindy Kaling. - You look so exotic. I thought you were from
Brazil or something. - You know I've always
wanted to visit Dehli. - My friend went to India last
year, it changed his life. - So where are your parents from? - They're from Punjab. - Oh, that's in the Middle East, right? - I will take the veggie burger, please. - Is that because you're Islam? - Do you have to get an arranged marriage? - Did you experience a
lot of racism growing up? - So you're not allowed to have
sex before marriage, right? That's crazy. - Here's the thing though,
right, I don't believe that every person who
says something ignorant is trying to offend me. I think they don't know any better and no one has schooled them. So this is my attempt
to make you understand. Here's what the reverse would sound like, if I spoke to white people
how they spoke to me. - Yeah, my dad's name is Peter. - Pa-tah? Pa-tad? I'll just call him Brubjub. Wait, are you white? Oh my God, I love Taylor Swift! ♫ Shake it off, shake it off - Wait, Smith, are you
related to Derek Smith? He's also from America. Oh my God, the girl who served me a latte at Starbucks this morning was also white, so I totally get you. I went to a white wedding once, beautiful, but it was so short, and
your families are so tiny. You probably tell your mom
to shut up all the time. I even did the chicken dance and wore a tie around my
forehead, it was so cultured. Wait, so you're not a country singer? Are you allowed to be a virgin? I went to Burger King
once, and I loved it! Wait so do you speak fluent
American at home, or British? Or Scottish? Irish. Are you a strict English? So is your real name Sarah? - Yeah. - Oh my God, I know
like nine white Sarahs. Do you know Ellen? She's also white. Love her. (sighs) It's so terrible everything you see in history books about white people. You probably want something
with no flavor, right? You look exactly like Jimmy Fallon. Yeah, like the features, everything. Wow. You look so... common. I've always wanted to visit Utah, so cool. My friend went to Ohio last year, and he said his life was exactly the same. And you're from Chicago, right? - Mhm. - That's in Europe, right? - I'll take the steak and potatoes. - Is that because your Christianity? So will your parents
force you to fall in love, or are you allowed to get arranged? So do you have a super hard
time recognizing your privilege, or are you aware of it now? - Oh I don't have any privilege. - Okay, so you're not. Is it hard to have so many options when you're shopping for foundation? Crap, they don't have
any egg nog on the menu. Do you drink anything else? Look at your hair, can I touch it? Do you mind? Wow, that is so soft, is that natural? - Yeah. - It's beautiful, look
at his hair, look at it. Yeah, touch it. So what's the religious
symbolism of the hat? Wait, so let me get this straight, you actually turn red in the
sun, like you change color? That's crazy. I watched a documentary about your people, called Supersize Me, so sad. So did they like expect you
to be pregnant by sixteen? And there you have it,
it's not meant to be offensive or anything it just... - Wait, wait, wait. Aren't you actually related
to someone named Runveer? - Okay but that doesn't...
- And didn't your parents actually want you to get married at a really young age? - Shouldn't y'all be doing
the YMCA or something? Get the F out of here,
get out my frame, get out. It's all about one love,
thanks for watching! We're all friends, this
wasn't meant to offend anyone just a lighthearted video. If you enjoyed it give it a big thumbs up and check out my last
video right over there. Bloopers for this video
are right over there. Make sure you subscribe because I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday. One love, Superwoman that is a wrap and... ♫ YMCA - She tricked us. 
- Time flies. (gently chiming bell) (whoosh) What up 2018 it's a girl Superwoman, and what better way of jumping into the new year than looking back and reflecting on 2017,
and just being grateful. We accomplished so much in 2017. And hold up, hold up wait, I say we because I understand
that no matter what I do, it always involves you in some capacity. Let me explain. If you know anything about me, you know I don't like the word luck. Like anytime I achieve something
or work hard for something, people say, "You're so lucky." I go, "No-no-no-no, ex-squeeze me." I don't believe in lucky,
I work really, really hard for the things that I have. But having said that,
I kind of eat my words because I am lucky because I
do know that there's people out through the world that
work just as hard as me, are probably more talented than me, and don't have the support of you. So in that sense, I am really
lucky to have your support, your viewership, your
time, your energy, however, and in whatever capacity, you support me. Whether it's a comment or thumbs
up or a passive reviewing, I am lucky and grateful
to have you so thank you. Without further ado together, in 2017, we (uptempo rock music) - Landed a role in HBO's

that is a wrap and zoop! 
L: [sighs] It's so depressing reading about so many issues in the news. A: I know, there's literally something new every day. L: Right, like today, apparently Jay-Z and Beyonce are getting a divorce. A: Shut up! L: Yeah, exactly... I mean, that's if they're even married in the first place. A: How do you know? L: I read it on Twitter
A: [laughs] Oh, then, it has to be true L: Exactly!  Well, I guess they're not all that bad, since she wasn't even pregnant A: My friend's friend works with Beyoncé and she told me Blue Ivy is a hologram. A: Just like that Tupac hologram a few years back at Coachella. L: Except I heard that was actually Tupac, because he's still alive. A: One time my sister saw him at Forever 21. L: Also wasn't he just in, like, Barber Shop 2 or 3 or whatever? A: No that was Drake.
L: I heard him and Meek Mill are actually brothers. A: [laughs] Publicity stunt. Waiter: Okay, have you had a chance to look at the menu yet? L: Oh no, sorry. We've been really distracted by all the crazy stuff happening in the news. W: Net neutrality, that's insane, right? L: ...What?
W: Oh, were you talking about DONKA? L: No. I'm talking about, like, Sam Smith just posted a picture of his latte! A: Ugh, what a sellout.
L: Right? Yeah, I wish I got paid to post about MY latte. L: Also. I heard that Cardi B and Offset aren't even really dating! A: Let me Google it. 
By the way, how are things with you and Ryan? L: Oh, girl, we broke up. Yeah, too many people up in our business. A: Ugh. So annoying! A: By the way, I like your shirt.
L: Oh, thanks! You're supposed to wear blue today to be against cyber bullying. A: Sorry one sec. Did you see this?  Kim K had a wardrobe malfunction on a live TV? L: Oh my god, shut up! Send me the link right now. I have to share it! A: I have no idea how the Kardashians are famous.
L: Same, like have you seen Kim K's sex tape? L: I've watched it like a million times, it's so sad.
A: And don't get me started on Nicki Minaj... A: My friend's dad's daughter is her makeup artist, and apparently she makes like 1.3 million dollars every day! L: Day? I thought it was every hour. Ugh. And she only donates half a million dollars. Disgusting! A: But I did hear that when she performs, she only drinks diet room temperature water in increments of 1.75 liters. L: Room temperature? Seriously? What a diva. L: [to waiter] Oh, excuse me, I asked for no ice. Yeah, it hurts my teeth. Thanks. A: What do you think about Taylor Swift? L: Ugh, Illuminati.
A: For sure. L: I also thinks she craves attention, and that's why she talks about other people SO much. L: Yeah, I tweeted her that because I think it's important that she knows my opinion. A: And she's always trying to make everything a competition. A: Who do you think is better anyway: Taylor or Katy?
L: I'm pretty sure they're cousins. L: Oh my God!
A: What?! L: Taylor Swift just favorited my tweet! I love her! A: No way! Screenshot it.
L: I can't believe she noticed me! Aahh! This is the best! A: Oh my God. Did I tell you what my mom did? She went in my room and read my diary. L: No.. That is so disrespectful. A: Yeah, like what ever happened to privacy? It's totally-
L: [shushing] L: I think Selena Gomez is behind you.
A: No way! L: She's wearing these huge sunglasses and a hat, so I'm not sure, but pretend to pose. I'll take a picture. A: No way, that's totally her! L: Right? And Rihanna-?
A: Implants. A: The weekend?
L: Sex scandal! Justin Bieber? A: Auto-tune. Shakira? L: Heard her hips lie. Lady Gaga?
A: You mean Joanne the scammer? A: J. Lo?
L: Botox! Lil' Wayne? A: Too many tattoos.
L: Oh speaking of which, I want to get another tattoo. A: Cute! Of what?
L: On my forearm, right here, that says "Only God can judge" A: Cheers to that! L: Hope you enjoyed this video with...!
