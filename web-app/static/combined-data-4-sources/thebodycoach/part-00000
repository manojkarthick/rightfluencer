👉 www.youtube.com/thebodycoach1. The reason I stay lean all year round is because I am consistent in my actions and lifestyle choices 🙌🏽 Here are the things I do on a regular basis to stay in shape!😀 1. I train 5 days per week  2 Rest days
2. Short intense HIIT sessions (20-25 mins) on bike or treadmill 
3. Or body weight stuff like pull ups  press ups  dips  burpees  sprints 
4. I drink 2-4 litres of water each day 5. I get boozy about twice a month 🍺🍸
6. I prep my own meals mainly having high fat & protein in 2 meals and one big high carb meal after I train 
7. I usually train fasted and eat after 
8. I eat out a couple of nights a week 9. I try to choose healthy options but do treat myself to a dessert or Ice cream or🍦 burger now & again 😉
10. I have a proper big blow out day where I eat loads of sweets 🍫🍬once a month and always feel exhausted afterwards which puts me off doing it more often 😇
11. When I go on holiday I eat more food & treats but I still workout 
12. I always try to get a good nights sleep (7 hours usually)
13. I keep doing all these things all year round 🙌🏽😀. Body Coach Schools Fitness Week Is Back 🙌🏼

“This is my first time doing the 90 Day Plan and I am LOVING it 😃 I was a self-confessed couch potato who did little to no exercise and ate whatever I wanted. I was so nervous when I started but I really needn’t have been! The food is delicious and not once have I felt hungry or craved any additional treats. I’ve also managed to do 5 hiit workouts a week which is something I had always thought was totally unachievable for me. My favourites have been the PB&J smoothie and the Chicken Burrito Bowl which has been fab to take to work. I have so much more energy now - bring on Cycle 2! 💖” 😊😊🔥🔥💪🏼💪🏼🙌🏻🙌🏻

“”I want to thank Joe and The Body Coach team for helping me not only change my body but my entire outlook on food and life. I have struggled with weight  eating and diets for the past 20 years since I was a teenager. My weight has fluctuated +/- 20 kg accompanied by extreme behaviour - either dieting or bingeing  and over exercising or doing nothing for months on end. I was miserable with the way I looked (regardless of my weight) and obsessed by everything I put in my mouth or didn't. It was this constant murmur in my brain which in hindsight totally affected every single aspect of my life. Food was the enemy and I fought a battle every single day.
The programme has totally changed my life. I now enjoy my food  and enjoy exercising  specially weight lifting. I am proud of what my body can do and not just obsessed with how it looks. Food is a source of fuel and also pleasure and I don't obsess about what I can or can't eat. I feel like my entire life has transformed  I am happier  healthier and more balanced. And have also lost 7.5 kg and 20 inches but I don't care anymore!!
Like most people  I read the testimonials before starting and doubted that it would work for me. But it does. Don't hesitate - sign up  make the commitment and see what happens. It's only 90 days and the changes you see from the first week will give you the motivation to keep going!” 😊😊🙌🏻🙌🏻🔥🔥💪🏼💪🏼

“”This is my 2nd time completing the 90 day SSS plan since having my twins a year ago. I’ve always been active and loved exercise so linking my food and eating habits according to my workouts has taught me so much about my body and what it needs when. I’ve tried lots of faddy diets over the years (often low fat or low carb) and have just found they’ve left me tired and are too hard to maintain long term. The 90 day plan gives the variety of healthy fats and carbs so you don’t feel deprived. The new meals on the updated plan have been so yummy and I’ve seen better progress this time round during Cycle one and hope the same goes for the other cycles!”” 😊😊🔥🔥🙌🏻🙌🏻💪🏼💪🏼.

“”26.5” in 30 days!!!! Having completed the plan in 2015 and having amazing results I was excited about carrying on with the epic food and workouts but unfortunately I had a few traumas in my life and let myself get even bigger than when I originally started. I was so low that I decided I needed to do something about it so I signed back up. The recipes are all amazing this time around  the exercise is short enough for it to not feel like an ordeal and I truly can’t believe I have lost 26.5” in my first 30 days. I do not regret signing back up one bit  I’m starting to get my confidence back slowly and I am so excited about moving onto C2. I LOVE THE BODY COACH!””

I'm Lucy and I recently graduated from the 90 days plan it's definitely been one of the best decisions that I've ever made and I followed Joe for a long time on Instagram used to make a lot of his recipes and do a lot of his workouts on YouTube until one day I kind of finally plucked up the courage and made the decision to take control of my eating and properly sign up to the plan I haven't looked back since it's definitely been one of the best decisions for me that I've made I've always been a bit of an emotional eater I've always been quite active but I always knew that nutrition and my eating was always sort of let me down so huge reason me signing up was to take control of that and to understand the kind of nutrients and things that I shouldn't using and when when you first get the plan through it's definitely very daunting because there's a lot to take him there's a lot to read you have to get in the habit as well of doing food prep and I'm definitely a bit of a free spirit in the kitchen I like to decide what I'm having for dinner on the day so food prepping and preparing in advance it's definitely something that it doesn't really come naturally to me so that was something I really had to get used to the workouts were really enjoyable really manageable they're hard initially but you can feel yourself getting fitter quite quickly and also initially they don't take up a lot of your time so it's really manageable and it's easy to stick to particularly if you've got a bit of a busy life most of all I've gained a lot of body confidence from doing the plan I'm a lot more confident at the gym and I now have a personal trainer I love going to the gym it's weird a week having a week not doing sort of exercise three to four times a week it's really built into my life so and I definitely learn a lot about nutrition and eating the right things at the right time you have to eat a lot of greens and drink a lot of water but you soon get used to it and I massively crave vegetables now I couldn't I couldn't live without them so if anyone thinking of doing wholeheartedly recommend it it takes a lot of commitment but it's absolutely worth it when you get around to it I mean you ain't it back so definitely sign up 
so why do I do the SSS plan I was turning 31 drinking too much bie too much pizza not doing the exercise back a lot of people really great so it's a bad combination but a trap that we all fall into I think so has just decided to do something different for a bit I'm her teacher a few people were talking about it so I bought his first book and did recipes out up for a few weeks and like his style so started checking out testimonials on its website on his Instagram account on it what like you were doing a lot of good for a lot of people so I thought I'd try the full plan out as well and all those people have asked men it's the plan D either it's nice proper artwork but it's really good it changes your own mind so that you don't see going to gym as a chore it's just something that you want to do want things that I have to overcome from day one was planning meals in advance and I'm not very funny I'm still not going to be really but you do have to do it it makes it makes a week easier if you can see out there back there what you're going to do I think one of the things that I've gained most from the plan is probably knowledge realized a little lost on nutrition and different styles of training stuff that I just didn't know before and it leaves you in a position where you feel like you could carry on your own once you finish the plan you get all you macros and stuff like that and you can you can solve your own meal plans out and you're on training schedules so yeah I mean if you can think about doing it then check out testimonials like ideas and yeah just just do it it's it's really good I'm sure you won't regret it so yeah just stop think about it and do it it's good 
[Applause] put that there so hello everybody can you hear me okay I'd like to say first of all congratulations to everyone who's graduated from st. Mary's University today as he said that I graduate in 2008 with degree in sports science and when I got the letter through the post it arrived at my office with the letter you know st. Mary's University I thought oh no I earn more money they're coming after me but I did pay off my student loan took me eight years but I've got there and I'm really nervous public speaking so this is a lot of really scary thing for me to do but I thought there's so many of you out there in the audience that will know exactly what you're doing you would have smashed your degree you've got your sat-nav on you know where you're going you know how to get there but there'll also be a lot of you in the audience that are feeling confused and a bit worried and sort of unsure about what you're going to do where you're going to go and the question that Francis is asking everyone was what you're going to do next year what you're going to do now you graduated and a lot of people not in the head gun I don't know I've got a clue I don't know what I'm going to do and that was how I felt for so many years I called it the quarter life crisis between the ages like 22 and 25 I didn't know what I was doing didn't know where I was going and I went traveling and kept running away and kind of earning a bit of money I was laboring worked in a bar but ultimately I know it's a cliche but when you find out what you love to do and you're passionate about something then success can come really quick because my career is actually only three years but it's been a lot of work behind the scenes so I wanted to go back to the beginning and explain yeah what my ambition was in the early days because I come from a working-class family my mum's a Social Work and my dad's a roofer and me and my brother Nicky were the first two people to go to university and I always thought I was going to be a PE teacher that was why I did the degree in Sport Science I came out of university with the degree and I was like well I've got a degree in sports science but I don't want to be a sports scientist I can't teach because I didn't have a person you know the one year I'm PGCE I couldn't get on the gtp lot because every time I went for the interview they could tell that I didn't want to do it they could see through that I wasn't ready for it it wasn't really what I wanted to do so I bummed around a little bit again went travelling grew my hair never Hyacinthe and I work as a teaching assistant I go into a school I have to sign up a teaching agency and I was I remember just not being very happy enough what I've got to do something I've got have a crack at something so I worked as a teaching assistant in a really rough school and they were going through like special measures with Ofsted really naughty kids and I remember thinking this is hard work they were pulling my hair they were kicking me in the shins nicking my lunch they used to Nick my food and I'd go to my lunchbox to eat and I'd have nothing to eat so it's pretty rough but I realized after about nine months of that I thought I'm not quite cut out to be a school teacher and I think many of you might have done a degree and you might have signed up to that when you're 18 thinking this is what I want to do and maybe like a year into it like this sucks I don't enjoy this but you've persevered you've got it done so don't feel like it's a waste of time because it's really not and I think you should be excited by the change of direction you might you know my brother did law he never became a lawyer he works with me helps move the body coach and I think you should be excited there's so many opportunities out there so don't feel like you've done a degree and you might you might feel pressure to kind of go into that career and that been that job and that with that degree but really the world is so different now there's so many opportunities so don't feel like you've got to and you know necessarily do that yeah and so when I had done my after I'd become a teaching assistant I was doing that for nine months and I thought this ain't this ain't right for me so I borrowed two grand off my dad and I went and did a personal training qualification a six-week course called premier training where learns become personal trainer came out of there really ambitious because I remember thinking this is what I want to do I love exercise and I really love taking somebody who hates exercise on a journey to really enjoying it and getting fitter and I get a massive sense of achievement from doing that and that's why I do every down social media so sorry so did my personal training course and I sat down I thought I don't want to work for fitness first or David I don't want it I don't want to work for someone else and you know get paid five pound an hour and worked really hard and that'll be my job I want to work for myself and so I sat down with piece of paper and I wrote down all these words that were meant fitness and health and motivation and I come up this word the body coach and I was like yes I see it the body coach so I set up a website I set up a Twitter account and started a boot camp in Richmond called Rumble in the park and at the time I didn't have I didn't have a single penny like I literally bought a bit in my life my mom when I got some kettlebells got a few boxing pads a few flyers and whatnot started sort of marking the best I could and I couldn't afford a van so I had a little trailer this little like trailer that clipped onto the back of my bike and I just he get up every morning at 5:30 and cycle from Surbiton all the way through kinks and it was nice and flat all the way through Kingston you get to like Petersham nurseries and you've got that nasty Hill and I would remember it must have been about 70 kilograms just pulling this really heavy trailer but I remember it's a really warm morning I just said to myself this is what I want to do this is what I love do and I felt like I'd finally found out what I was going to do and it was amazing because as soon as I got that dedication and that focus my career just accelerated enough to stun so much in such a short time so don't don't be concerned if you haven't found out what you want to do yet because you will get there it took me a long time like I said I was 26 before I even had a single clue about doing that and I'm now 31 so I've done a lot in such a short time so be patient and explore travel the world don't panic about knowing exactly what is you want to do right now today because it's fine you're going to get there right so I'd get to Richmond yeah 6 a.m. start my boot camp I'd set all the stuff up I'd have a TRX hang on the tree I'd run down there and put the battle rope round the other tree I'd have kettlebells and 15 stations I'd be like because I in my head 15 people going to turn up yeah every time and sometimes you know nobody could turn it would turn up sorry I always get really emotional and tell his story you know how many times so yeah something I'd get there nobody would turn up right and I used to think I'd just be like right this ain't the same the same can happen I'm not going to give up and keep going and I would go to I pack up all the stuff in the trailer and I you know rain or shine I'd go to Richmond station I had a little flyer that I hand down and I used to get on peoples nerves everyday that hate me now just be in such a rush didn't want to see my face and I'll be like come to my bootcamp running the park you know check it out and maybe only ten people would take a flyer and I stand in for two hours but if one of them came it was like another client it was another chance to grow the business and I kept doing that I just kept going back and you won't believe how many times I'd get there never be nobody there like in the night because I did it twice a day so it's a cycle home and then I'll be knackered then I'd cycled back to Richland even do it twice anyway I kept going and I built it up and I eventually it became a little business and then I set one up in Surbiton and I was sort of you know doing alright and I felt right I've got my boot camp and then I started doing some personal training and I kind of got really busy and I was having a great time and I was loving it and really was loving it but you don't you do sacrifice a lot of time being a personal trainer it's like you're up early you don't get much time at the weekend because we're your clients on the train at the weekend so anyway I've really cracked on for a couple of years and then I started just shared some stuff in social media I started posting recipes and stuff on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and then I had this idea one day right in 2014 it was December I was in my flat in Surbiton and I wrote I'm gonna share a recipe and I'm gonna do it in 15 minutes and I'm gonna call it lean in 15 right so that was just an idea hashtag lean in 15 showing a 15-second video and you know I had so many people like friends and I'm really close friends a lot what are you doing why he wakes the time get back to the bootcamp we do my night in every night on Instagram Twitter and Facebook like chill out is boring right and so I didn't listen to them because I just was having fun and I just carried on kept doing what I was doing like with the boot camps every day breakfast lunch and dinner I'd record it and share it on Instagram I had no idea I was ever going to have a book deal or monetize my social media or create an online business I really didn't and that's one thing I think everyone should learn that lesson that it's not about making money shouldn't try and always think I've got to make money it's all about the salary if you make a difference to someone and you make a change in someone's life and make them feel good about themselves you can do amazing things and it will eventually come back obviously in success in certain different areas when I got the books and stuff but so I'm tweeting away doing my Instagram building that community suddenly I get an email from HarperCollins about wanting to write a book with me so I said I'm not really an author I've never written a book and I don't think to be honest that I'm a very good cook and I was like now coming up a meeting with me so I went and had the meeting sat there with them and they were like look we love you and doing many great things on social media I had 50,000 follows an Instagram at the time and I called up my friend Bev and said look Bev do you think I should get an agent or should I just sign up with these guys she said well it's important to get a literary agent so I am I got an agent and it became like they call it a blind auction where publishers as eight publishers were bidding for the rights to lean in 15 and overnight it went from a one-book deal to a two-book deal and then I released it on Amazon pre-order and it went to number one like six months before it is ours anyone got a Lina 15 book in here yeah thank you so my publisher just went crazy was that we've got a sign here so I then got an eight book deal so it became the shooting and I remember my mate at the time a really good friend of mine says what I was really excited about the book deal and stuff and he was like well you should have just done an app non-buyers book so what's the point just do an e-book and it really light up set me on the day said that and I thought now I'm gonna go and do it anyway and you know lean and 15 is now the second best-selling cookbook of all time after my man Jamie Oliver my hero Jamie I'm still sick my heart is I felt on during a hit session my heart is pounding so fast this is more scarier than Guinness World Record we did in Hyde Park so yeah lean in 15 has become this phenomenal success and this aside from you know the financial gains of that that was never what it was about for me I do book tours and I meet these women and these guys that have had you know bulimia and anorexia or they've been overweight or they've got diabetes and they do these plans they follow my ideas and they're it's changing their lives and that's what it's all about for me like even even today I wake up and I do a snapchat or an Instagram is it's always the same thing all I ever try to do every day is to get one person exercising and feeling good and to get one person cooking a healthy recipe so you know I've solved a problem and that's what you should always think with your ideas you know how can I solve a problem and and give people something that's going to make them feel better and that's what you should always be when you're being entrepreneurial and in the process of the whole book thing going on which is pretty crazy I released this online plan called the 90 day shift shape and sustain plan which is an online business selling tailored fitness plans okay so I did that it in a way just to kind of kind of like you know for for if I can get a few people to sign up and do less PT and have a little bit more time to myself and with my girlfriend and whatnot and it's become this huge global company like we've got 40 staff it's a multi-million pound business and it's just grown on social media and my office now got a 5,000 square foot office like 20 meters some ways to stand and give out the flies in Richmond so it makes me proud but every day I go now just walk past and I'm not I can't believe I used to stand there no in commuters and now walk up to this building and this and I've got all these staff is mad and obviously I'm really proud to tell that story so what I want to say is basically I'm gonna get to my final point now is that so many people will say your ideas no good and it won't work and it's been done before and it's already a body coach so why go and do Instagram why go and share recipes you know you're copying someone it always be yourself it's never too late okay and secondly you will get rejection you're gonna have doors down on your face all the time you've gotta be willing to like turn away go and regroup come back knock again keep going because you can't just give up when you get you get one one knock back and that's that's the thing of all entrepreneurs I think they just keep going and they keep working and work in yeah another thing is you know if you are bit scared and confused about going out into the real world and you want to go and live in Thailand and live on the beach for six months up go and do it have fun because that's all it's about you'll get there you'll find out what you want to do in the end but you should be really proud of yourself for doing a degree I bet all your friends and family buzzing I was here in 2008 and I remember thinking like how epic this place was and what a wonderful day and I bet you're just desperate to get out of here now because I'm sweating and you're pretty really tired but yeah so I'll leave you with three things okay and this is three simple mantas that I live my life by right and if you do these three things you can't really go wrong okay and I hope you've enjoyed my chat I hope you found inspirational and I hope um go out there and achieve your goals but the three things I live by a case three simple things it's work hard have fun and be nice if you do those three things whether it's online and social media in the real world in business with your relationships you'll do well you'll succeed and you'll have a great life so good luck everybody and I'm going smash it 
allô everyone I'm cooking a brand new recipe from my new book the fat loss plan and I've got a very special guest I'm joined by my favorite TV chef of all time here is mr. Jamie Oliver do you like a burger I do love a burger delicious do you like a mango chicken burger yes I've never had one but I am gonna give it my best shot so it's a really quick and easy recipe I'm all about healthy food fitness and this is a great recipe to have you know after a workout I'm gonna serve them some sweet potato wedges it tastes bangin so I'm here for you brother okay so first things first time we're nice and simple we've got some lovely herbs some ginger some garlic a little bit of fresh chilli and some coriander we're gonna do some lime zest and lime juice in the blender nice well then slice slow do you put stalks in your one yeah well I learned from us he stalks a bit of flavors yeah absolutely you want to keep some for put on top later yeah what you're gonna need then is a food processor Jamie if you put a little bit of ginger and there just like a little centimetre or that little bit of garlic and we've got fresh chilli but if you're not found in these spices you can always put some you know some Paige and some peri-peri in there you can flavor the chicken burger everyone really but one thing I'll tell ya butter and chips you think how can that possibly get me lean but you know when you exercise in you can even you can enjoy these photos right yeah look you got skinless chicken fantastic protein you've got all those fragrant at home and spices that's so healthy yes so anyway yeah you got some breadcrumbs in there and I'll just chop up this chicken breast slice up into little squares and then put a little bit of lime juice yeah just give a bit more flavor a nice one if you wanted to time just by two three or four and do a batch and then freeze little patties there's nothing wrong with out and you get a job in the bag during your season out now bro a little bit of salt and pepper again you know this you could do this with turkey mince but chicken really lean protein sauce and it's naughty stuff that you think I can't have a burger picked about you can see do you want me to just to make that into a patty shape so yeah we're gonna do then this is your base your mince patty burger oh you're gonna squish it up that is a big old burger in it but like I said I don't like small portions I don't believe in low calorie diet in my exercise and like to fuel the body so I feel that really happy the oil is nice and hot we're gonna get that pretty no 3 to 4 minutes on each side make sure it's cooked through and then we're gonna serve that with a lovely brioche bun which I've toasted whenever I go to M your Italian burger mate I'm that's the thing isn't it like of course you have burgers but you know we had to put a bug on the menu because everyone just loves a burger Robin and use mayonnaise I'm using the healthy alternative some you know Greek yogurt so spread a little bit out on the bun yeah it's important get your greens in so you know anything you can and commit spinach rocket I'm using cucumber tomorrow and a little bit of lettuce and then we're gonna add the secret green just whipped chicken burger you want a little bit of flavor you want a bit of extra moisture so I've got some mango chutney which goes down so well the chicken one glazed it up I just put up with dollop on the end yeah I love that I love that what kind of what was your motivation how do I do a healthy burger yeah I think people you know assume that you know you can't enjoy the food you love when you're on a fat loss plan right so I thought why not take these things like curries pancakes burgers turn them into a healthier version you can enjoy your training it was the idea but it's not work out so yeah yes so let's not look at the colors here though I don't big enough vote for this look at the size of the burger and repair to the bun but I quite like the idea it's gonna be like overhang in you're gonna struggle and I like that but I only just put the foot on top but you haven't you're frozen with a Pammy try something make it real sticky we should we go like properly like yeah all right naughty glaze sticky we do a boat all right yeah go on top first and then we'll fry it in yeah cuz that's sugar like it's gonna go nutty quick sticky mangoes like burnt sticky mango this is gonna make that burger taste wicked do it we got room I mean that's the proportions but but it's still generous no you know you wouldn't kick that out of it Jamie ain't finished yet we've done the burger but serve it with some lovely sweet potato fries he mooks yeah I do love a sweet potato so I basically just chopped sweet we kept the skin on bit of salt and pepper a little bit of olive oil sort of 15 minutes in the oven so nice and crispy and that is a perfect thing to have with your mango chicken burger so they're my friends Joe wicks mango and chicken burger sweet potato fries I really love the way that that is big and like the fact that I can actually make a bit I really hope you're not disappointed you are Top Chef so go easy on me yeah here we go mmm that's love you see when you put those herbs in there with that mango chutney in that yogurt all that moisture that is a really satisfying burger I dunno that's a really good tip so

welcome back to body clutch TV today I'm joined by Tom from Technogym who is a capybara or master trainer at the gym kettlebell master trainer and he's the mass basically to make sure if you haven't seen it go back and check out our kettlebells technique workshop where Tom took me through the basic modes we're going to put on this workout but today's workout is basically going to be a beginners kettlebell workout so make sure you do a warm-up follow along in the same places up we're going to do five moves if I move to note four ball moves and we've got five rounds exercise I'm one's going to be swing for 222 handling for ten ten reps right so let's take it away ready sense rings do it you can talk to the technique as we go Tom to make sure we're snapping our hips through as you come up and making sure that we squeeze one brace the ABS keep your shoulders back ten much as possible an attempt to me including straight into goblet squat thank God that squats nice and you paid my first move of bum goes back get to the top squeeze your bum bottom trying to lay nice and tight through your apps as well seven and then see if you can go same place as opposed nine and ten do next exercise single arm swing so straighten reach inside foot today's movement husband two hundred twigs just a little bit more challenging now one side two and one good and the fourth exercise is one suitcase deadlift okay so so just sit outside the box nice and tight to the shoulders weak side first how'd you come down trying to stay as level as possible that'll pause at bottom just making sure it is the dead lotronex squat so on back not too much you bang like I 105 yes same again same again again squeeze that shoulder as hard you can five I wear so we got their cigarette that's round one I'm going again four moves for more round you can only see your heart rates up come out Brett we've chosen away I'm going 12 kilograms Tom's a bit of a hard game you've got 23 rounds it basically how do people choose their way it's going to be based on the hardest movement so probably the single arm swing give me the most challenging movement so you want one kettlebell for the whole thing so keep heart rate up the last you will do be dancing around changing capital bells giving your brain a chance at which often have more rest so jover the hardest movement is sting one swing yeah nay lot on your weak side with great technique and then if that feels really good you can increase the way they do sell that two and four kilogram but I mean for a swing you just don't your muscle groups too big to fill that right here I said eight kilograms minimum for a girl maybe yes so it's become for a guy yeah begin a female premier name alright second round well so kilograms start we've got ten from it again we really think about working your glutes and hamstrings oh hi again how'd you get tired just really make sure you switch it everything on specially the apps and hence good so up into the college squat that's got ten reps once give us our one good two three we're clicking it very cliquey needs on my knees but if you're hit four five six free them the way down and exhale time to breathe in and exhale to come up I've lost count alone touch ok so left single on swing swing I like ways kind of flow is there greater when you get going the mood slowing to each other was less register them okay

hello and welcome to body coach TV my name is Shona virtue and I'm going to take you through a super quick and simple energizing morning yoga practice you ready okay let's go so we're gonna start lying down on our backs cuz it's the best place to start you're gonna come down and just get nice and chill here yeah I'm gonna get you to place your hands on your belly close your eyes and just start to breathe we're only gonna take three breaths so we need to breathe in and breathe out really relax the body when you breathe out so inhale feel nice and energized and then exhale feel nice and relaxed this is a good time to just check in with the body notice if you've got any aches or pains back issues and neck issues we want to honor them when we practice one more deep breath in and a full breath out okay from here interlace your fingers arms reach up point the toes big stretch like you're still lying in bed and then hug your knees into your chest squeeze them in and then just start to rock from side to side what this is doing am massaging out your lower back yeah okay from here come back to Center we're gonna rock up and down the spine is kind of energizing and it's a bit fun Rock all the way up and down until we get enough momentum to rock all the way up hands to the floor if you can't get there that quickly doesn't matter just fake it till you make it okay we're gonna come down into this all fours position feet together knees out wide push the hips to the heels let's hit Child's Pose first so arms are gonna extend forward we're gonna drop the head down to the floor and really relax through the shoulders here okay if you're toast up cramping tuck the toes otherwise nice and relaxed here and this is just going to help us open into the hips so that we can get through our practice a little bit easier okay take a deep breath in release a full breath out okay inhale come forward into the all fours position let's just bring the knees so that their hip distance apart in the hands a shoulder distance apart let's wake up the spine a little bit lubricate the spine drop the belly down lift up through the head and the hips high opens shoulders pull back and then belly

exhale okay coming back to a neutral spine let's just tuck the toes and we're gonna lift the knees off the floor push lift keep the knees bent for me keep it nice and easy and just shake out your head yes and no the key thing in downward dog is that we want to start to press the chest back I don't want you to be rounded you're not in a sort of half push-up position press back and just start to walk out through the heels open up through the back of the leg so we just straighten one leg and then the other and we're just lengthening out the hamstrings okay so from here what I want you to do is find a push-up position so we're gonna come forward and we're gonna hold this now if this is a bit too strong this morning drop your knees to the floor okay roll the shoulders back either way whether you're here or here I want you to keep your core nice and tight and we're gonna start to lower it down as you lower down elbows come in nice and close when dropping to the floor okay roll the shoulders back and lift your chest off this is Cobra this is gonna kind of lift us away from our phones and our laptops this is like good posture muscles here then you're gonna bring your hands back

hello I'm Natalie and I want to talk to you today about my journey with the body coach 90-day FSS plans I find that because I was feeling really rubbish about myself and I'd spent a year just mindlessly eating and drinking a couple of glasses of wine every night and it you know catches up with you and I was just feeling really low and rubbish about myself and I knew I wanted to change but I didn't know how I didn't know where to start and I saw Joe on Instagram one night and he was cooking up one of his recipe doesn't look so good and I thought yeah that's what I want you know I would feel good about my food again so I signed up and I'm glad ideas it's difficult at first it's a lot of information to take in and but once you sit down and you read it you know take your time and read it and make a plan picked out a few recipes that I knew I would really like and made my shopping list and I would double up my meal so I've cooked something to dinner and have it for lunch the next day as well and you know that really kept me focused and on plan the workouts are great the hit weapon I've never done one before and I put like a right idiot jumping around bouncing around the first time I did it I couldn't keep up but you know stick with it it's only 20 25 minutes out of your day and it's amazing how quickly you can improve doing here and you know now I've actually grown quite like them and the most challenging thing for me I think was taking my starting pictures I saw four I really didn't want to do it and you know once I had done it I just felt so bad and you know I had two little cry about it and sent them off and I thought you know I never want to look at those again but now you know I look better I'm so glad but I did take them because you don't believe how far your you can call me and I would have removed it myself and you know having those pictures to begin with and having the comparisons you know in the cycle with each cycle as you go through it's just such a motivator and it really keeps you focused and on plan I was going to so much from the plan really in the sense that you know I sleep better I've got so much more energy you know Musti that's better you know that's drinking all that water you know drinking water and just having more confidence and belief in myself that you know you're capable of doing new things and IVA technically recommends the plan to anybody really and you know if you're sitting there now worries you know thinking that you can't do it you can do it anybody can you know if you don't know where to start then just let the body coach sort of take all of that worry away really and just let them guide you and you can ensure you can achieve so much more than what you think you're capable of doing so if you're thinking about signing up they don't hesitate just do them

up the last you will do be dancing around changing capital bells giving your brain a chance at which often have more rest so jover the hardest movement is sting one swing yeah nay lot on your weak side with great technique and then if that feels really good you can increase the way they do sell that two and four kilogram but I mean for a swing you just don't your muscle groups too big to fill that right here I said eight kilograms minimum for a girl maybe yes so it's become for a guy yeah begin a female premier name alright second round well so kilograms start we've got ten from it again we really think about working your glutes and hamstrings oh hi again how'd you get tired just really make sure you switch it everything on specially the apps and hence good so up into the college squat that's got ten reps once give us our one good two three we're clicking it very cliquey needs on my knees but if you're hit four five six free them the way down and exhale time to breathe in and exhale to come up I've lost count alone touch ok so left single on swing swing I like ways kind of flow is there greater when you get going the mood slowing to each other was less register them okay and swap we're really trying to keep up shoulder ties to the top right someone's going left hands out yet Yeah right pilots table same breathing as the squat and all the way down great for the bottom and then house the top that's a great exercise when you don't single are like this you know one kettlebell it's really challenging your opposite tell your body to work and strengthen up and stabilize Oh what um what two rounds down three to go same again for mode 20 think whether to be a bit whole breast you can always pause the videos a little bit but try and get back in time to a full five round alright it's a great workout I think people that are looking for a gym at home good bit of a kit and so it's a good bit keep have you know it's not much invested out these cost amount up to 12 and 16 are you probably looking at 50 60 good yeah so there one-time purchase the answer the gym right is that good holiday bridges you going away the car this summer stick in the car stick in the boot pal

welcome to the body coach TV I'm Ritchie Norton aka the Stremme temple I'm here at the body coaches house jodean kindly invited me round to do some workouts with him today this is going to be a cheeky little five-minute prep before we go and jump into one of Joe's hit sessions okay so really important you prepare your body for exercise so you don't risk injury but also see you say nice and supple and you get the best out of your body okay so firstly we do some breathing all right so take your time soften the knees and we do this standing first of all I like to breathe in for the nose and out for the nose breathe all the way down to the belly button breathe in breathe out three more breathe in breathe out start to loosen the shoulders breathe in breathe out okay so I'm gonna face you for this but again if you're on a mat start to fold forwards chin down to chest start to lengthen the spine start to move left to right so you're gonna stretch through the back breathing in breathing out okay then you start to come up and then start to work on that rotation start to twist through the back start to twist up onto the toes so the hips start to become a little bit more loose breathing in breathing out nice twist through the spine maintain that breathing rhythm yeah my trying to prepare the body so we want the blood and the option to flow around the body and then slow it down a little bit keep the shoulders nice and loose okay I'm gonna go side on now okay so from here take a little step to the front of your mat okay you're gonna take a step back on the single leg okay step in the back leg back as you lunge down you're gonna lift the right arm up and as you breathe out reach forward and lunge into the stretch stand up change fee okay let's break that down breathe in step back with the left leg as you come down the left arms gonna come up you're gonna open up for this hip as you breathe out lunge forwards breathe in step back one more time breathe in lunge down right arm comes up breathe out reach come back step up all right other leg stepping back breathe in breathe out and as you breathe out next breath reach forwards come back step back to the front okay shaking that off step into the side okay nice wide stance open up the hips remember the breathing's a big part of this now but I want to open up the hips mobilize the ankles free up the shoulders you're gonna start to work the whole body okay so squatting down to that nice sumo stance I'm gonna start to rock left to right I'm gonna start to open up the inside the legs perfect you're gonna be doing some squatting bringing the hands down if you can if that's more comfortable for you take a breath in and out I'm gonna start to do now is work into your back so again you might want to straighten the legs a little bit here we're gonna place one hand down the floor as you breathe in bend the left leg right arm comes up place the right arm down take a breath in bend the left leg so bend the right leg straighten the left leg the left arm comes up breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out breathe in last one breathe out whoa okay walking the feet in let's have a little fold can keep the knees nice and soft again start so just lubricate the hips ankles what we're gonna do here now little stretch of the wrist if you can do any press work it's important to keep the wrists nice and mobile maybe one at a time breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out and then coming back up to an upright position I'm nice and warm hopefully you're nice and warm by now one last little exercise now to bring it all together take a big breath in reach up learn from the spine feel that stretch through the side of the body as you breathe out bend at the hips fold all the way forward breathe out breathe in gently walking out into a high plank position okay so going to drop the knees down from here just gonna rock breathe in breathe out so stretching through the spine I don't flex in the wrists getting that joint ready and then come back to a stable position take a big breath in here push the spine up towards the ceiling as you breathe out the chin goes to the chest you breathe in tilt the hips up high and good for the spine breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out and now in this position taking a step out now with your left leg in line with the hips turn the right hand out to give yourself space for the shoulder and then gonna rotate the left arm we can do this a few more times so you can get used to the movement breathe in breathe out placing the fingers out now so we've got space to the shoulder bring that left leg in breathe in step out to the right breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out one more time both sides breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out last side breathe in breathe out you should feel a big stretch up through the back through the shoulder through the hip everything working bring it back place the hands down turn the toes big breath out stretch through the spine hip side stretch through the back of the legs walk your hands all the way back and then slowly come up big stretch breathe in breathe out I hope you were able to keep up with that if that was a little bit quick and you just getting used to these kind of exercises the idea is I want you to create lots of oxygen lots of blood flow get the soft tissue of the muscles ready for going into the high-intensity workouts you've got any injuries it might be the fact that you're not allowing the tissue to become more supple and mobilized for these big drops the high pushes and it's really important you put the time in before you workout okay so try this practice take your time think about the breathing energize the body and keep healthy I hope you enjoyed it I'll see you soon

welcome back to the body coach TV today I'm John my special guest Richie noir and also known as of strength temple Richard Channing little about yourself and why you're here helping me fix this okay so I am an ex rugby player that completely destroyed my body through injury poor flexibility poor mobility lack of knowledge smashing my body doing way too much training without putting the time and attention into the repair and the restorative process of stretching and rest okay so I'm going to help Joe today into a position where I mean that I've left it too late so this is about rehab getting people moving better I want me to avoid the risk of injury during your sessions get the most out of your workouts and you know feel better and this is gonna really help wrap for sure I'm sure so the idea is now what we're gonna do is a real foundation flow okay so even though I'm now a yoga teacher the importance of preparing your body before exercise will really help you perform better when you train if you neglect these simple exercises you won't be getting the best out of your hit training that's an important thing to remember okay so what we're gonna do is start off with some breathing really important to connect with your breath all right some of you might forget what your breath is about but it really helps you energize and get the muscles ready for training okay so try and breathe in for the nose and out for the nose breathe into the belly and out for the nose breathe in and out we do seven more breathing and now five to go really try and breathe it all the way down into your belly button and out four to go breathe in and out breathe in and out good you might feel a bit of heat coming for the body now you might also feel a bit lightheaded but we're getting lots of option to the brain that's good and then relax your hands down to the side okay high on your own supply okay so soften the knees here I can remove this really slowly okay the idea is take your time no matter what your ability level no matter what your fitness or flexibility is like right now take your time make the breathing rhythm your own rhythm part of the tempo of this practice that's a really important thing to remember as you get better okay so softening the knees we're gonna take a big breath in turn the palms out I'm gonna reach above the head as you breathe in big stretch lengthen the spine all the way up to the sky and then the next breath out hands go down to the side we hinge at the hips head goes down towards the chin to the chest rolling down you might feel a good stretch for the back maybe to your hamstrings keep the knees nice and soft don't hold any tension the neck again this is really important we hold so much tension in your upper body especially on that try and let that loose don't forget about the breathe in and then while we're down here now when I start to move left and right okay so keep soft through the knees breathing in breathing out again the idea is as you can see with Joe it's getting that stretch through his back but also a bit of work through the hips yeah and what's also gonna happen is that you can see the ankles he starts again a create a bit of mobility improving the mobility in ankles okay so stay nice and low big breaths in don't forget about the breathing it's really important to allow the muscles to get nice and supple to help them stretch okay again just start to feel what your body's doing right now you might feel a bit of a pull through the ribs might be a bit higher in the back breathe through it big breaths in and out so working about five to ten breaths here in your own time and then when you've done those breaths Center yourself again you should feel a nice bit of decompression through that lower back especially as well as their hamstrings okay so taking a big breath in now you're gonna slowly come up the head comes up last and once you're upright take another big breath in and we finished by raising the arms above the head again big stretch up the seams if you're the big stretch with the side of the body take another big breath in breathe out we're gonna fold all the way down again hinging at the hips okay so I'm looking to get their fingers or at least the hands maybe the fists down to the floor if your hamstrings are a little bit tight maybe want to walk the hand their feet sorry a little bit wider of the mat so you start to go into that sort of sumo warrior stance okay and as you can see with Joe here we're trying to work the ankles working into the hips try and keep your feet flat on the ground if that's a bit much and you're on your toes that's still okay sometimes it might be because your ankles need a little bit of work but we can cover that another time the idea is keep working with the breath we start to move a little bit left to right and then start to swivel a little bit so you roll the knee in and come up onto the toes if you again so if you're able to get here if you've got this ability but when you're doing squat work what we're looking to do is now have nice healthy hips not everyone can do this it takes time but it's really gonna help your squat and in more explosive exercises okay so if you're not quite there and that's a bit much take the feet a little bit wider and just try and sink the hips down as low as you can and start to balance you might feel a bit of stiffness in the hips so the idea is actually going through these exercises if you feel an area stiffness or it feels tight take a big breath in and when you breathe out try and sink a little bit deeper into that position but keep moving okay so now we're gonna walk the feet back onto the mat keep hunched over hinging at the hip stretch to the back of the hamstrings round the spine take a big breath in breathe out fold and as you come up now really slowly head comes up last again keep working on keeping that spine healthy big breath in arms come up above the head another big stretch through the spine hands come down by the side and on that now we're gonna take a little step so Joe is gonna face me okay so a lot much wider stance now so depending your flexibility we're gonna focus on the hips inside the legs some might people might find the groins a little bit stiff but this is all preparing us to be able to get heat into the hip to get towards the big exercise at the end that's gonna help him lock Joe's irritation in his hips and his glutes okay the breath in always let the breathe in with him control how you move that way you stay nice and relaxed and you can start to become more supple in these exercises okay Joe yeah all good okay so we take a big breath in and like again a big sumer worried gonna start to squat down to our hands come down to the floor so you might feel here you've got a big stretch on the inside the legs okay see if you can't quite get down there straighten the legs a little bit more breathe in as you rock left to right so we're eventually getting to the point where we're gonna be able to straighten one leg and the other leg is gonna Bend breathing in that's okay that's absolutely fine so that's a good point if you can keep your feet flat you're gonna work more into the ankle which is good for that ankle joint but what we're gonna start to move towards now Joe's already there you're going to come up onto the toe on the bent leg and come up onto the heel of the straight leg breathe in breathe out if you need to take a rest at any point just stand up and straighten both legs that gives you hips a bit of a rest otherwise breathe in breathe out when you transition take a breath in and when you breathe out try and deepen it into the strip so you can see Joe's on the side his leg into the hamstring that inside there dr. here okay and into the hip and the ankle okay breathe in couple more breathing and then last breath out here good come back up and then again slowly coming up again you'll start to really feel the hamstrings start to heat up also for the hips trying to create the warmth here to build up to the next couple of exercises okay to stand to the back of the map okay now get into the fun stuff okay so as we start again big breath in arms come up big strips with the spine breathe out hinge at the hips again coming back down lengthen the spine and then we're going to start to walk out into that press up position keeping the hands over the shoulders to make sure we've got the protection for the shoulder and drop the knees down under the hips so this creates a bit of a tabletop what much gonna get Jo to do is come back a little bit so the hips are over the knee so you're not stressing out the back okay and then his hands are underneath shoulders to give a nice bit of support for his shoulders okay from here take a breath in you're gonna turn the toes are you gonna push back your hips go high your spine is nice and straight you look down between your heels and you start to walk off the calf muscles for the back to the legs this is a variation of a downward dog those of you that might know some of the yoga so analogy you know that if you have tight calves you're gonna have tight hamstrings you got tight hamstrings you can have tight hips so it's really important you don't neglect these are the muscles over the big dominant ones okay from here knees come back down take a little rest i cain't gonna bring Joe back upon to his knees here okay just do a little bit of work the risks are something that's really neglected if you sit over a desk all day or you just end up just being hunched over work why it's really important to keep the wrist nice and healthy especially doing press up work okay the more flexible mobile your wrists are the better your press ups are going to be and the more agile you're going to be less pain you're gonna feel okay something keep an eye on okay coming back down to all fours here so what we're doing a little rotation now it's going to get into the upper back so we can take a big breath in and going to start the left-hand side - Joe can see me I'm gonna open up this left arm to get into the back and as you breathe out I'm gonna scoop this arm through bending my right arm and then twist and stretch yeah and we're gonna breathe I'm gonna do two more times come back up and then breathe out good one more time breathe in breathe out nice good all right other side all right so again breathing in lift up right arm up you find a bit more range with upper back it really gets into the shoulder blades and as you breathe out scoop through you might want to bend that left arm breathe in you can't for the range yeah okay okay breathing through now it's really reach if you're trying to bring the shoulder down towards the floor if you can't get there yet that's okay just still work on anchoring this hand down to get the stretch into the back one more time breathe in breathe out scoop through last one good breathing in come back to Center there's a good point to me if you're feeling a stiffening upper back one side can be off balance a little bit so we just gotta take your time and just start to find the end of range but don't push past any pain you'll start to free up a bit more space the more you practice these exercises okay so what we do now I'm gonna go into a little pigeon variation here one of Joe's favorites okay so take a breath in breathe out push back this is going to be a great one to start to really unlock the hip okay so as you come forward into that high plank position you're gonna drop the front left leg down towards the floor making sure the knee is outside of the body to protect the knee make sure you've got your shin and the foot grounded it doesn't have to be too high and let the back foot slide back okay so what we're trying to do here is open up for this side you should feel a bit of a pull here before Jo goes down if this is a bit of a tight spot just tune into your breathing and just maybe Rock a little bit left to right as you can see as Jo's hip to come down you can feel the pull because he's anchored his knee which is going to open up this socket of his hip okay yeah so if he starts to move too quickly it's gonna respond by kicking back okay so the more he breathes and slow it down slowed it down you're gonna get that flexibility and it's going to unlock where that tension is sitting in his hip okay this is a great prehab exercise as well as a warm down but again we're just trying to bring attention to the kind of movement and make it as easy as possible for you guys okay so we're gonna move back from here now you want to stay there a little bit longer so what we're gonna do now is gonna start to roll forwards let that leg slide back push back just let a bit of that blood flow through the hips and it's come forward to the right-hand side again so bring that right shin forwards before you come down put pressure on it good contact with the floor and let the back leg slide back to you open up the hip make sure the knee is outside and then start to move left to right remember to breathe that's it that's it yeah so everyone be a little bit different but this is a good chance to see what your body needs to work on if you do have tight hips so you feel a bit of a pull for the side the groin that will ease up the more you practice it but it will help every single part of your training prep okay so take your time no rush you might want to stay here a little bit longer maybe pause this video it's a nice big breath in and out if you're feeling like you want to go a little bit deeper you can always go and stay here for a little bit but I'm trying to treat this is more of an activation and mobilization prehab workout before we go and do a hit training session okay so keep it fluid don't stay there for too long keep it moving and when you're ready push off the floor let that leg slide back big breath in walk that off Micra twist the hips wiggle your bum whatever feels good [Music] and then going to drop down to the knees and this is my last tip of the day again this is the final move that really helps unlock that area now we've put all that heat and effort into these hips now we're gonna open that up okay so taking a big breath in you're gonna step forward okay and with the right hand if your left leg is forwards left hands on the left knee gonna take a big breath in and you're gonna lunge forward and reach as far as you can pushing the left knee out so again what he's gonna do that's it so his left knees gonna go out that's gonna feel upon the inside of his leg so he can change the range a little bit but the back leg is really open on the hip flexor but big opening through this hip okay but if Jo leans forward and lunges forward he's gonna get a nice big stretch through his back and deepen the stretch okay so we're gonna come back from there take the knee all the way back drop both knees next to each other take another breath in right foot comes forward right hand and right knee breathe out lunging forward push the right knee out look at the space we're trying to open up for the underside of the leg and called knee hip quad everything and stretch through the psoas the lower body here and I'm going to come back we're gonna do two more but we're gonna pick up the pace a little bit so we don't stay there too long we don't want to tire out the muscles breathe in breathe out come back one more good last one right leg breath in three reps breathe out let the breathing rhythm control how quickly you move breathe in breathe out good last one and then bring it all the way back bring the hands down to the floor breathe out just one more downward dog here so that little stretch stretch through the back twist the knees in do what feels nice here but really try and feel that length through the back hips nice and high stretch up onto the toes whatever feels good take a big breath in take a little bit of step out with the feet soften the knees and then gently walk your hands back so you feel a bit of heat for the shoulders breath in and then breathe out just that last little stretch wherever you are relax the head and then breathing in come up arms up that's it and out down to the side and you should feel magic yes hundred percent this is a practice I would do in the morning lunchtime before a workout after a workout before bed the idea is it's bringing your attention to breathing that is such an important part of preparing yourself for exercise because it helps get the muscles really ready for all that dynamic movement before training but it's a really nice way to wake up I've been lying down all day or it's been sat at your desk you need to weight your body up before you can go and do high-intensity training so that is a great way to mix that up follow me on Instagram the strength temple best way to get lots of tricks and tips and you'll be able to find on YouTube the strength temple Twitter and also a fit TV coming very soon and also stay tuned on the body coach TV for another mobility session which tricks you into taking on in zone so again more exercises learn some new moves to really be good body movement properly so I hope you enjoyed that I'll see you soon in the body closely be do that rise

welcome back to the body coach TV today this video it's slightly different because I'm done by the wonderful Shona virtue we've just cooked a recipe and you're now gonna take me through a yoga session because you are a qualified yoga teacher oh yeah one thing I'm really guilty of is I'm doing my hit sessions I do my strength training but I don't have the discipline to stretch and I'm injured I'm tight and stiff so right now I'm gonna give you my mind body and soul bend me like a prep so and do it you want yeah brilliant what your magics been do not break you okay okay so what we're gonna do is just a really quick 10-minute session that you can do kind of post your pony Yeah right or you can do it on your rest day it's perfect to just wind down but stretch and breathe and get nice and calm so slightly medicine meditative as well yeah and this is the key because actually post-workout it's good to kind of boost your or get your nervous system nice and calm so that you boost recovery yeah cuz your nose hits it and I'm like pushing my body to the extreme yeah it's very taxing on the central nervous system so just to stop and Bree van de actually stretch and open up their joints this is really important I don't do it enough but after this video Sharon is going to record three separate yoga videos for my channel so it's really gonna useful content so make sure you check them out and let's get going let's do this alright so we're gonna start in possibly the best place ever on the floor lying down living in that brilliant right let's just sleep ten minutes I think that's a good idea this isn't so the pose we're gonna start with this called shavasana which literally translates to corpse pose so but don't you fall asleep okay up or down so you're gonna actually put your hands on your belly right okay and the reason we do this is it we just want to start to get into the breath okay so let's say you just finished your hit session you're all sweaty you can't just drop straight into a downward dog right yeah so you just need to start to chill out so I want you to have your hands on your belly gonna take a nice deep breath in and I want you to hold the breath for a second and then open the mouth exhale relax all the way out and let's do it again breathe in hold it in so you nice and full when you breathe in and hold it you're feeling energized and full and then you gonna open the mouth exhale and the exhale will naturally relax you we're gonna do that one more time yeah so inhale hold it and then exhale I guess a joke this is really key you need to make sure that when we're moving through these yoga postures that you're breathing because that's what's gonna help relax come back to the breath man come back I always find that difficult to do I always think what does that even mean but you just like am i consciously thinking of my breath in and out of my lungs and just focus on that exactly because you know why when we're just having a chat now but look the reason why is that when you breathe in you energize yourself and when you breathe out you actually stimulate the release of a hormone called relaxin so right so women have more of this this is what helps us with like pregnancy when we're giving birth with more likes a more relaxed in the men's yeah and so we're gonna help you get those hips open with relaxin okay by breathing out right I'm focusing on okay so what do we do interlace your fingers reach up point your toes breathe in and then hug both knees in towards the chest squeeze knees in alright so how they feeling yeah I'm really tired did some deadly snakes in my hamstrings are super tired okay so extend your left leg down to the floor yeah okay hugging the right knee into your chest okay this pose is called Pavano market asana and it's a fancy word that actually means wind removing pose all right so if you've got a bit of trafficking trap to get after our beam session this is gonna get out don't do it now though all right take the leg across the body down to the floor yep so take it slow yeah you want to get into a little bit of a twist good your right arm is gonna extend back behind you come into a bit of it yes perfect good yeah brilliant and then bring it back to Center hug the knee into the chest go to them we'll change sides so release that leg down interlace the fingers arms up stretch yep stretch it out reset and then hug the left knee good so this is massaging you know not only is it giving you a bit of a stretch but it's also massaging your descending colon oh yeah really hot isn't it okay take the leg across the body good stretch take it slow one thing I will say if you're trying yoga or trying the sequence for the first time just be really really slow and easy coming into it you don't want to force yourself into a posture you just want to ease into it come back to Center we'll bring both knees back into the chest squeeze them in good okay rock it up and down the spine let's just do a couple of rocks cuz fun yeah this is gonna massage your spine either side of the spine Rock all the way up hands come to the floor that's it take your hands forward yeah just make it till you make it you don't have to do exactly as I'm doing it that's it okay so what we're gonna do is bring the feet together knees come out nice and wide you're gonna push your hips back to your heels that's it and then extend your arms forward relax the head down that's lovely it's called Child's Pose point I love it yeah it's really relaxing this from a competition and so this is gonna open up the hips the lower back this is gonna really allow the back of the neck to relax - Joey's got his head on the floor the shoulders are starting to relax at your feet cramping yeah okay this is really common to cramp yes so sometimes when you put the body in kind of awkward positions that it's never been in before it was yeah well okay come back and what you can do if that happens it's just tuck your toes that's it and I'll push back so you're still opening into the hips that's better yeah that was super cramping stress a bit crampy yep and it's really common for the body to react like that it doesn't mean you shouldn't do yoga it just means you give yourself body time your body time to actually get used to it okay so we're gonna take one more deep breath in here and then a full breath out perfect for that long slow breath is gonna stimulate that relaxing just in for the nose out for the matter exactly perfect alright let's come forward into an all-fours position okay we're gonna go into downward facing dog probably the most famous yoga pose right yeah okay so you gonna tuck your toes you're gonna lift your knees off the floor and come back into this down dog you want to press your chest back now I want you to keep your knees bent for me okay a lot of people when they start out the yoga practice will try and straighten the legs and what that does if you go ahead and straighten your legs let's see weapons before oh you're flexible okay so it's flexible but often what happens is that this starts to round don't want you to do this I want you to just keep the knees a little bit bent shake out your head yes okay what we're gonna do is straighten the right leg push the right heel to the floor good and then straighten the left good and then the right and then the left and we call this walking the dog and it's just gonna release the hamstrings a little bit extra you can fit ya through the shoulders and back yes but also through the carbs or the hamstring it's exactly good alright so from here what I want you to do is just bend your knees look forward and walk the feet all the way up to the hands perfect okay so your knees are gonna be bent you're gonna hang forward feet a hip distance apart to go a little bit bigger that's it take holder by the elbow drop your head and just shake out your head yes and no yeah so when decompressing the spine here and little bring your weight forward to the front of your feet so if you think about it your back takes all this pressure all day from gravity and what you want is to really elongates oh as Jo relaxes his spine is gonna decompress this is amazing if you get lower back pain yeah so as we start to come forward a little bit more the hamstrings will lengthen I want you take a deep breath in and then exhale get nice and heavy alright we're gonna release the arms and we roll all the way up to standing and just stack each vertebra one at a time good unroll all the way arms reach up good and then bring the hands back to the heart relax the shoulders let's check in how you feelin good yeah that's good I've really felt that stretch through the hamstring now what we need to do is we need to hit the front of the hips yeah okay so feet together bring your feet together toes touch that's it okay let's go inhale reach up exhale bend the knees bow forward release down good bring your hands to the floor you're gonna step the left leg back into a long lunge perfect grab your ankle just pull that foot a little bit further forward yes there it is back knees down to the floor we're gonna sink through the hips that's it I want you just stay here for a second breathe in and then as you exhale straighten the front leg and bow forward so keep the back knee on the floor yes hello hamstring yeah yeah so don't go back so far I'm super flexible so I can go this far but I want you to just keep that knee a little bit yes so let's come back forward inhale and exhales good and then inhale and then exhale it's okay if your hands on flat because I feel like to get flat really tough it's really intended to try to keep your things up it's still fine exactly exactly that's really from there you can keep it yeah okay inhale one more exhale okay hold it here for a second I'm gonna get you to tip your toes over to the right oh hello IT been going around the outside of the hamstring yes we're getting those different angles you're really working me girl good that's all we need we're doing all this hit bring it back toes up let's come forward you're gonna place your left hand on the floor yeah take your right hand to the inside and just kind of pivot that foot out good turn the toes out good come up to the fingertips again yeah exactly so where can you feel it right now I can feel it in the back hip flexor here yes and then the inside here effect that's exactly where I want you to feel it okay now we're gonna do one breath here because we want to stimulate that relaxin so that the body releases okay so close your eyes take a deep breath in exhale relax the body like you were trying to fall asleep almost good so you just relaxed a little and your body became a little bit more flexible so you drop in bring the hands back to the floor you're gonna lift your back knee off okay here's the tough part can you step it back to down dog all right bend your knees look forward walk the feet all the way up to the hands we're gonna come back to that rag doll position so dropping the body and then from there we're gonna unroll so I want you to roll your spine up so drop your head drop your head yeah you used to doing like a perfect deadlift that's it unroll unroll like a bad deadlift yes and then arms reach up inhale we just reset exhale let's go down we're gonna do the other side drop it down okay hands to the floor we're stepping the right leg back this time into the lunge good drop the back knee down okay so sinking forward inhale and then exhale front leg straightens body bounce forward that's the stretch it's good one right yeah let's come forward again inhale good exhale really focus on that exhale for me perfect inhale and then exhale so the reason I'm moving through this is that we create fashio which is kind of like cling wrap that wraps around your muscles it much prefers movement so you're gonna get more flexible if you kind of move in and out of these release back let's hold it here yeah okay turn the toes out hit that IT band a little oh wow banjo string effort it's gonna ping yeah so don't and that's really key what I love about yoga is paying a lot of attention yes so just really pay attention and only go as far as you feel you can toes come back up good hand on the inside pivot that foot out to the side turn the toes out sink through the spine what's well just degree sort of thing exactly Yeah right the way out no right the way out we want to just stay a little bit if you're super flexible you might find that that's better for you remember that you can always it's so good right that's deep okay I'm going yeah perfect okay so I think Joe is going to get deeper if he concentrates on the breath so breathe in and exhale just inhale deep yes okay come back up remember we're going straight back to down dog let's go shake out your head yes and no good bend your knees look forward walk the feet all the way up to the hands we're gonna unroll all the way up to standing arms reach up inhale and then exhale hands come back to the heart that's it wonderful how do you feel we're done yeah I feel great I feel like you've hit the muscles that I need at the most like the hamstrings my hip flexors and if I can just watch that video back every time I do I think I'll be feeling so much better and hopefully reduce the risk of injury like it's so much tension around my hips yes and it's literally a case of just dedicating a bit of time to isn't it and doing it frequently and not just doing like you said half an hour weeks great but if you could do 10 minutes a day you'll feel it more the benefits to be there so I hope you enjoyed that video and that's our first introduction we didn't shown that you're now gonna do three separate yoga videos

right good evening youtube and welcome to another youtube live with me Joe it's the body coach it's Sunday I'm having a great day so no high-intensity stuff today but I thought why not use this time to do that nice little stretch remote billion kind of relaxation sessions I think we all guild your training hard but maybe not giving ourselves enough stretching flexibility to work so I know for one that I've trained so much so I've got an injury and it's something now I'm kind of really taking it seriously so that I'm actually going to try to improve it because you know pictrain's great on the body whips you're not recovering resting properly it is really tough you don't mean just so okay so what would that be a 15 minutes just nice and slow we're going to chill there's no not high intensity running around or anything so slightly different to what you might see my youtube channel but it's important to start let's crack on so firstly when you're nice and simple just to get our breather this is the new fire deep breaths in through the nose out for the nose you can just close your eyes if you want or you can keep your eyes open but yeah so nice five deep breaths really big deep breath in and then exhale here we go really nice deep breaths in for the Notes app with the map nose good find one nice Andy okay right so we're going to go into our first exercise nice and simple hands on the ground and we're going to just basically get a breathe breathe in as we inhale we're going to lift our belly button up toward us once it inhale and then exhale arch in the back okay so inhale exhale in through the nose so just mobilize the lower back into the nut mouth nose and add one more okay so next I'm going to do into the presser position and what going to do from here is a downward dog so from that we're going to inhale exhale push up and then that goes into slowly you might not be the hill to the ground okay just push through the hands and then just walk those feet out just feel your your calf muscles your hamstrings getting warm just little steps good it's no ruffle taking our time but these moves okay good then you can start to leave a little bit left to right this feels kind I'm going to have things most people have super tight cars and hamstrings so come back to that plank position deep breath again exhale same again just walking those feet out seen that stretch okay so next I'm gonna do is a great one bracket flex okay so where the problems are one day you can have one in front hand on the left knee we write next back we're going to focus on pushing into my hip flexor here okay so from there between inhale and exhale reach forward if you're going to feel stretching your hip flexor here and also you're growing your own your hips up your left hip inhale exhale good take your time some of each exhale even affiliates have grabbed up with photo so inhale exhale final one inhale exhale brilliant we're now gonna go right leg forward left leg back same thing so you know and in the right name so good for the body you're going to sleep great after doing it and this is saying you should try and do you know before you train as well if you just open up the body and really get the most out of sessions good final breath inhale and pushing and stretch brilliant okay so next I'm going to do what we do is hands in this position again and we're now going to step the right foot out towards the right hand okay so we extend just from there that sort of meet quite tough okay so just hold that a few breaths see my funny little foots back there that's fine but the aim is to one day try to get up Minahan okay so from there now we're going to do is bring this right hand off the ground face it inhale exhale twist inhale down exhale twist we're going to start open up my chest and shoulders good inhale down exhale twist I can feel it I hit it there my crew in there and also my shoulders has really good move that okay inhale exhale you might be fun to go back things on the ground responds well if you feel them knee down upon the ground and keep like that I said food together do it look down the door go to walk out we're now gonna take the left leg out toward that left hand okay so press the position and bring the next leg out couple of breaths there that position just feel that stretch as I said you may not have any of the ground you may be that that's fine you're gonna fill massive stretch through there and also in your hip your left side right so breathe in two more breaths inhale oh really I think back together I stood up down with our well okay so I've got a big problem with my hip so this is a really wreck so that's I open up the hips it's called a pigeon it's a joke remove so let's go into the presentation again what we're going to do now is bring our right knee in front of this case you kind of you even at the IPS have your leg like if I'm so stiff that my foots off point towards my knees it outwards foot sort of towards the body and from that position there you can just inhale on the next time you walk down to sit into that stretch so you can feed it in the outside of your glutes you might feel a bit tight to the knee but go feel it right now the outside the glue so again there's just three thought to get that breath as you exhale just sit down until you can even bring your elbows in taking a bit further you try keep your hips pants grunts my back leg nice and straight I'm not rocking over too much I'm just trying to still keep my hips square on towards the ground and deep breath again yes we'll graph this slowly walk up back inside the plate and then do the damn dog okay now do the same thing with left leg so we've got left knee out towards the body just turn it up slightly and you might notice that one's much tight this is this is the time line for me so you see even harder to get that foot weight that you might find it right there you know right towards best fighters once that's anchored into the ground final position back leg straight and you'll just feel that stretch right there for you that's a good sign and loose Wow I'll do that something to hold my breath try to try and try and breathe inhale exhale I really need this I've had this injury going on here about three years it's by the London Marathon and it's so I've just never really dedicated enough time to just fix it I've always just tolerated I've always is probably so when I do I hit workouts on YouTube I'm actually always kind of feeling this pain I'm just kind of got used to it but mission to fix it okay right hands together feet together sorry okay that's someone today it's on our backs we'll thread the needle another really great hip opener which I need to do more so making this a regular things it's going to be so good for you for me as well but for you as well for your training get the most interceptions and just kind of you know just give me a body a chance to relax a little bit right so we make that on the back we've now gonna bring right the right leg bend the left leg right leg comes over the top like this and then from there you're gonna put one hand for the middle one hand on the back of the leg you're gonna try and lay flat on the ground I just pull that you know he's watching a lovely stretch through your glutes and the outside your hip good that stretch okay I'll actually exhale take it to let that muscle relax and say stretch a bit deeper sometime my final breath you know that's now stretch out okay right leg up bend left leg over the top left and then we're going to thread through again so one hand round one half in the middle and then we just pull that knee this is tighter so you will notice that you're putting light imbalances in your flexibility and just yeah like really in different joints from various things it could be from injuries from just overcompensating also just when you sit and the way to sleep so yeah it's good to do these things nice and slow and notice the angle of where things are mother leg is much further than that but this means toward really is just so confident rotation remember to hold your breath and tense it then try not to tense up fine inhale exhale and as you do let that muscles will like to let the joint open up my mom all right hello right legs down okay time brilliant right few more minutes time goes fast when you stretch and then it okay so now I'm going to do another good one next rank we're just going to bring our knee towards us and just have that name come out to the side to get a really cranky poke around stretching that out and the other one I'll do one more stretch off of this which is gonna be the hamstrings okay that's why the left side so right bring that knee in keeping the back nice and straight you can gauge that and then exhale knee towards your armpit there's a proper stretch so you might find yourself really really struggling so but the more you do this the more flex will cover the more the better you're gonna track the ball you're going to get out of your workouts all right it's just getting that this a bit not really struggling with the discipline of doing but I'm now making it now you think this tenant for bed this is the only one that fits injury disability right so stretch okay so final one that before we go and hopefully you've enjoyed this and you're gonna you're going to sleep like a baby smart and for the right so what we do now then yeah we're gonna enhance a nice straight back inhale inside my hair I'll just watch my breath inhale exhale you may not be have to touch those toes yet but just try remember inhale exhale I'm just doing a few breaths like you're just seeing if you relax and take it another day for each time you know Yeah right but I feel brilliant it's nice to have done so a bit more relaxed and lonely bounced up and down and out of breath and shout and stuff but hope you enjoyed that I'm gonna be doing more like workouts on my youtube channel so hopefully and every penny more but this won't really stop when I really start building because this injury will not leave and I want to be I think there's a lot about that I'm leaving we're going to kind of just get for it so I'm building to my content so that I get fit out on the low bar I'm gonna give it my injury and hopefully you do the same so have a lovely

comic relief has been fighting malaria for as long as I can remember and we're winning deaths have dropped significantly but we're not done yet a child under the age of five dies every two minutes from a disease we can prevent and treat and Sierra Leone is one of the worst-hit malaria is the leading cause of death here and it's the poorest who are affected the most but the fight back is on which one of yous Mohammed you nice to meet you do this is your gym yes yeah since I've never seen a gym like this before and we look at the muscle with everyone's massive it's amazing they've created their own weight shooting carparks man it's brilliant it's so cool Mohammed grew up in this tight-knit Freetown community this drainage you see have been causing a lot of problems for people in our community I got my disability from this place when I was a kid I used to play here you can come in contact with many diseases and this has been causing lots of malaria for people in the community actually it's a big big brilliant spot for the malaria parasite itself and so each and every person living in this communities affected by malaria understand and shock really I've never seen anything like that so I'm in a place where there's kids and there's people preparing fish and food and then there's this kind of huge dump site of trash where there's little pigs actual pigs and just a breeding site for malaria you can see how challenging it is to be living in this place but Mohammed is doing something about it he's a volunteer with a project funded by comic relief in GSK there's training young people offers journalists to report on the impact of malaria they see within the communities getting stories from those who are down there that are not being heard it's really great and so it makes me become a voice of the voiceless it's amazing I think it's wonderful you're so ambitious and I'm sure that if you keep working hard investigating you you know make enough noise and you'll be heard and you'll make change I wish you all the best of luck and keep training yet even lift in across town a program is underway to improve the way malaria is diagnosed and treated in Sierra Leone's biggest Hospital we're taking a holistic approach we're looking at the from the patient and the administrative analog the hospital the clinical angle involving even illnesses and the clinicians you know improving their knowledge about the diagnosis and treatment of malaria my idea of success is to drastically reduce the mortality associated with Maria I think we should be able to evaluate malaria on the face of this country so these guys are on a mission to recruit a team of young volunteers to combat malaria on the frontline so guys tell me what have you got planned oh you're here to launch a program malaria research program but of course we will do it on yeah we do we're targeting 13 to 24 year-olds if we engage that that target population they'll be best placed to actually spread the messages that we want to spread to as widest population as possible so have the guys about to go live on air on the radio station which they say is reaching tens of thousands of people so what great way of reaching young people and spreading this message across across the country it's clear that malaria is still a big issue here in Sierra Leone but it's a real energy and momentum towards bringing about some positive change comic relief in GSK are supporting this work and it's brilliant to see young people making it happen if you want to help support more work like this go to Sport Relief comm and you can make a real difference too 
hello welcome to the body coach TV I'm Shona virtue and I'm going to take you through a really relaxing chillout pre bed yoga sequence so let's just get started you're gonna come down onto the floor so you're gonna extend your legs come onto your back walk the shoulder blades down the back and this time we're actually gonna bend our knees drop the knees in together and that's gonna take a little bit of pressure off your lower back this one is designed to just get you nice and relaxed so we want to do as much as we can to really calm the body down stretch it out decompress things that have been compressed from lots of gravity right all day sitting hunched over our desks so I'm going to take your arms down by your side close your eyes and just start to relax in fact I want you to open your eyes stare up at the ceiling and then this time when you close your eyes really feel that sense of sort of being more aware of the body so as soon as we take away the sense of sight suddenly we begin to feel other senses so our ability to hear becomes a little bit more heightened and our body ability to feel becomes more heightened as well so I just want you to check in breathe in hold the breath at the top just notice that lightness that comes from holding your breath and then open the mouth exhale really breathe out really commit to relaxing as you exhale let's do it again so inhale take the breath in just hold it for a second and then open the mouth exhale kind of like letting go of everything you just want to really let go here relax the body completely let's go for one more inhale take the breath all the way in hold it feel the lightness and then open the mouth exhale relax the body okay from here interlace your fingers arms reach up stretch and then hug the legs in towards the chest squeezing the knees in okay at the end of the day sometimes you're gonna have a little bit of a sore back so we want to just mess out out the back rocking from side to side and then when you come back to Center you're gonna keep hold of the left leg the right leg go all the way down to the floor okay relax the shoulders I want to keep checking in actually because sometimes when you practice yoga things start to tighten up when you don't realize yes so sometimes if you're stretching one area to compensate your shoulders will tighten up or your jaw will tighten up so just keep trying to relax here you're going to grab hold of your thigh bone and you're gonna lift that leg up and just start to move it around in circles so want your leg to be really dead here just nice and relaxed just moving it around in circles and what we're doing is we're sort of breaking some of the hard tissue that forms in and around the joint that we just want to lubricate a little bit so that we can open into our hips a little bit okay so moving around and then go the other way okay and then come back to Center take the leg all the way across the body now take this slow all the way down to the floor okay so let it come right down your back comes off you're gonna take your left hand you're gonna reach it as far forward as you can we're gonna come up and around opening out exhale stretch so inhale we're coming forward you might get a couple of cracks reach forward and then up inhale and around now please notice I'm not just doing this right not some weird dance on the floor we're actually trying to reach all the way so that we stretch all through the back well through our lats all through our abs all through our chest and shoulders open up into the stomach okay bring it back to Center hug that knee into the chest then you'll right knee place the right foot down onto the floor cross the ankle yeah over the side and then from here we're coming into what's called thread the needle pose okay so your left hand it's gonna thread in between the legs lift your head grab hold either around the back of the leg which is a bit easier yeah or the back of your shin okay and then you're gonna try and drop the head on the floor okay if that's a little bit too tricky for you and you're up here just grab a pillow and just place it under your head or a towel anything will do put it and then allow your neck to relax okay as we start to pull this leg in you're gonna feel a stretch for your left glute here okay relax the shoulders relax the jaw take a deep breath in full breath out start to pull him okay place the right foot down onto the floor keep the leg rodas we're gonna lift up onto our elbows some of you gonna be like I can already feel that stretch and if you are you're gonna stay right here if you feel like you can go a little bit deeper you're gonna lift up onto the hands maybe gonna start to walk the hands in a little bit okay take it slow take a deep breath in if you're super hardcore you're gonna exhale and drop the head down maybe try and get your forehead on to that chin but take it slow breathe in breathe out okay we're gonna lift the head yeah lift the chest as much as you can which is gonna increase the stretch a little bit it's just work into this feel this if you're feeling super stiff don't worry right as we go on we're gonna get better and better take your left hand grab your foot pull it down to the floor bring that right heel in towards your groin and the left foot is just gonna be slightly out in front of you you're gonna take your hands forward and we need to take a deep breath in as you exhale round the spine and drop down now for some of you that are super tight you're gonna feel like this is about as far as you're going and that's totally fine just stay right there if you feel like you can go further go for it drop the body as far as you feel you can but wherever you are in this pose I want you to just sort of you're gonna move in and out of it okay because the muscles and the fascia which is like cling film that wraps around the muscles it prefers to move so it's gonna feel less stressed out if you move in and out of this which is going to mean you're going to stretch more okay so we're gonna close your eyes and together we're gonna just lift out of it slightly inhale and then exhale we're gonna fold forward and go as far as we feel we can then before our body in mind gets a bit stressed out here in that deep stretch we're going to come back out of it inhale and then exhale we're going to come down into it inhale coming out of it exhale coming down into it maybe you're gonna gain a little bit of flexibility inhale come out of it and then exhale come into it I want you to walk your hands around to the right side okay your left arm is gonna reach forward now I'll show you from the front because what's gonna happen is that you're gonna want to lift that left buttocks off the floor okay to make it happen but I want you to keep that left hip grounded and you're reaching out of it what we're gonna get is this delicious stretch all the way down the side of the body you're gonna feel it in your hip your gluts everything that gets really tight from either working out or just sitting still all day yeah dropping the head down come back to Center good from here you're gonna hug that left knee back into the chest right leg extends we're going back down all the way to the floor okay from here you're gonna kick the leg up as far as you can now if you're super tight this is maybe where you're gonna stop you're just gonna grab wherever you can and just start to roll the ankle if you can go a little bit further grab the back of the leg maybe all the way up maybe gonna grab the ankle or even the foot you choose whatever works for you okay so we're just gonna hold it here breathe in now as you exhale I just want you to start to pull it a little bit further feel free to bend the knee a little and you'll really stretch into the hamstring okay breathe in exhale relax the shoulders and start to pull a little bit further don't worry if I'm going quite deep into this remember I'm a gymnast breathe in exhale pull that little bit further one more time yeah breathe in exhale okay hug the knee back into the chest and then release the leg all the way down to the floor come to interlace your fingers arms reach up point the toes inhale and then exhale we're gonna hug both knees into the chest squeeze in how we feeling let's rock from side to side massage out through the lower back I'm gonna do it all on the other side so keep hold of that right leg let the left leg extend all the way down to the floor so eye opening into the hips a little bit I'm gonna turn around actually that you guys can see me so when we hug in I just want you to make sure notice if you're feeling at the front of the hip notice if you're feeling at the inner thigh or the back of the leg and each time you come down to practice your yoga I just want you to make sure that you check in and think okay maybe this is getting a bit more flexible maybe I need to stretch the front of my hips a little bit more just pay attention to what your body needs grab hold of the thigh and we're gonna start to take the leg around in circles right so we're opening it out here's a little tip so what I would like you to do is lift the knee up yeah and pull the knee pull the femur this big thigh bone out of the joint a little bit okay that's gonna create space and it's gonna get what's called synovial fluid which is really good for the joint to just make your joints feel a whole lot better if they get a bit achy make sure you go the other way okay and then we want to take that leg across the body for the twist yeah take it all the way down okay take it nice and slow take that right hand reach it forward I'm gonna go forward reach all the way around tracing that semicircle up and over open up through the chest belly pulls in so let's go again we're coming forward three then inhale and then exhale I'll open out the breath that's gonna be key here guys to really feeling relaxed tonight breathe in up and around exhale and out okay let's bring it back to Center squeeze that knee back into the chest bend your left leg cross the ankle over the thigh use your right hand to push the knee away slightly so we create more space at the front of the joint okay and then we're gonna take thread the needle so right hand is gonna thread in between the legs or coming around the outside now either going the back of the leg or around the shin okay so take your time yeah if your head is kind of off the floor and you're feeling really uncomfortable feel free to put something underneath it yeah and just start to pull in a little bit here okay feeling that stretch for the hip take your time we want to breathe in deeply really get that deep relaxing stretch breathe out and the body will release yeah it's not enough to just kind of come into the postures and hope that our body will relax you need to use your mind as well to relax your body close your eyes let's do one more inhale really relaxed as you start to pull that leg in okay place the foot back onto the floor you're gonna lift up onto your elbows and maybe you're just hanging right here and this is enough for you otherwise maybe we're going a little bit further take it up nice and slow remember there are two things in life you can't rush that's love and yoga okay so we're gonna come a little bit closer this probably some other things as well all right so take a deep breath in and then exhale relax the back of the neck the closer your chest comes to the leg right the more intense it's going to be on your hip so take your time but find the edge of your flexibility and just try to relax one more breath here inhale and then exhale okay lifting the head grab the foot take it down to the floor pull your left ankle left heel in close towards the groin and your other foot is a little bit further forward okay make sure it's in the midline of the body we're gonna take the hands forward take a nice deep breath in we want to create length first so we separate the joints and then exhale we can kind of fold deeper into it okay so inhale we're lifting out exhale we're going into it inhale coming out exhale going in don't worry if you're back here okay maybe you're just doing tiny little rolls but each time just going that little bit deeper into it okay okay and then from here we're gonna walk the body around so walking around to the left you're gonna reach that right arm out of the hip remember from the front it's gonna look like this we're reaching and lengthening that hip bone stays on to the floor drop the head and just kind of move about right so to find those angles that is gonna help you get the best stretch possible for your body before you go to bed okay take one more breath in full breath out we're gonna come back around to Center lift back up and out of it how good be right knee into the chest left leg extends use your abs roll it down good alright hug that knee back into the chest and then we're gonna go for our hamstring stretch to keep the foot up towards the ceiling wherever you feel you can grab the leg if you feel like you're down here somewhere cuz the hamstrings super tight then bend the knee alot and just pull it as close as you can with the knee bent yeah grab wherever you can shin ankle or foot we're gonna take three breaths here together you ready inhale and then exhale pull the leg in inhale exhale pull it in a little bit further inhale exhale pull it as far as you feel you can doesn't matter if you're here good and then release it all the way down to the floor come to interlace the fingers arms reach up point the toes inhale and then hug both knees in towards the chest to squeeze the knees all the way in okay we're gonna bring the soles of the feet together and let the knees rest out wide this is gonna open into the hips but you know what sometimes lower back pain actually comes from super tight hips so it might be intense but I just want you to take three breaths here and try and work through that intensity as much as possible okay so you're either gonna take your feet further down the end which will make it easier or if you're feeling a bit hardcore tonight bring the hip the heels a little bit closer to the groin okay hands on the belly close the eyes let's do this together relax the shoulders take a deep breath in breathe out feel the body relax try to relax the hips focus your mind into the muscle breathe in exhale try to encourage the muscles to relax last one let's do it together inhale hold it and then fully relax you ready exhale all the way grab your legs carry the backing together my head a little bit good and then huh give it knees into the chest squeeze the knees in perfect and then extend your

hello and welcome to the body coach TV I'm showing to virtue I'm a yoga teacher and a personal trainer I used to be a gymnast a long time ago and I'm here to take you guys through a super simple easy introduction into yoga so yoga is basically stretching with breathing and so I'm just gonna get you used to some of the key postures that we're going to do in some of the other sequences that we're doing in this series we're gonna start down on the floor one of the most common postures that you'll see any yoga practice is Child's Pose okay and it's really nice to open up the hips and release the lower back if you get a sore back at the end of the day this is a good one to drop into and just take a few breaths in so we're gonna bring the feet together and take the knees out nice and wide you're gonna take your hands forward and start to extend here now if this is as far as you feel you can go maybe try and bring the forearms down stack your fists and rest your forehead on the back of your hands like this if you feel you can go further you can stack the hands like this or you can stretch your entire body down and drop the body here yep so what we're trying to do is create space for the hips and open up through all through the front the back the side and we're also trying to relax the shoulders a little bit here now here's what makes yoga yoga and not just a stretch is that we're going to breathe so when you're in this position what I'd like you to do is practice taking a nice deep slow breath in and a full breath out and what that's gonna do is help calm your nervous system when your nervous system is calm you can relax into the stretches a whole lot more and we start to see the benefits of yoga so coming down we're gonna breathe together for three breaths take a deep breath in release a full breath out breathe in again and breathe out so just pay attention to the areas that are feeling particularly tight for you and as you breathe in feel them stretch as you exhale as best as possible try to relax what you might start to feel is a little bit funky in the feet you can tuck your toes and just press like this and it will actually stretch out the muscles of the feet - okay let's take one more breath here inhale and exhale okay you're gonna come forward into an all-fours position and just adjust the knees so that probably the second most popular yoga pose that everyone knows is good old downward-facing dog so it's quite a tricky pose actually what you're gonna do is take your hands shoulder distance your knees are gonna go hip distance and your feet are going to be hip distance as well okay we're gonna lift the knees off the floor and this might be quite strong in the arms keep the knees bent and try to press your chest back towards your thighs what we want to do first is open up through the shoulders and really lengthen through the spine now from here you want to keep the knees bent if you're feeling really tight through the back of the legs or try to just straighten one leg and see if you can feel that stretch all the way down the back of the leg right feeling the hamstrings good okay then you're gonna bend your right knee straighten the left yeah and get a little bit of a stretch down the back of that leg now key things that can go wrong in this pose are we try to straighten the legs too quickly and if we're really tight in the hamstrings we're gonna be forward here like this which is just gonna be really uncomfortable in the shoulders and it's not gonna feel relaxing so as best as possible you want to bend the knees and then try and press the chest back drop the head shake out your head yes and no come down for a second we'll go back and again some of the benefits of these postures or this particular posture includes just decompressing the spine but also stretching through the back of the legs if you guys get those tight hamstrings that are just so annoying particularly when you finish your workout and you're like oh my hamstrings that pose is gonna really help to release and stretch them okay so let's try it again hands come down shoulder distance apart knees lift off let's stretch the back keep the knees bent stretch here take a deep breath in full breath out and then just walk out through the heels remember I'll open up through the back of the legs so one leg at a time we call this one walking the dog okay bend your knees look forward and then just walk your feet up to your hands just go as far as you feel you can hands to the shins we're gonna unroll all the way up to standing I'm gonna take you through a lunge now now lunges are amazing not just for the back of the front leg but the front of the hip okay so we're gonna take a nice big step back okay and when you take a step back back knee is gonna come to the floor now in a yoga lunge it's different to a kind of workout lunge yeah we're gonna go a little bit longer and we're gonna sink the hips forward now if I just show you on the other leg we're sinking forward and we're stretching out all through the front of the hip this is really perfect if you spend all day like this it's really important to open all of that out okay so we're coming down and we're just stretching into the hip here relaxing the shoulders this one is perfect if you suffer from lower back issues sometimes you think they come from your lower back but they actually come from the front of your hips so we want to sink into this and breathe okay let's bring the hands down to the floor and just hold it here breathe in breathe out one breathe in let the hips sink down breathe out two breathe in okay I'm going to challenge you a little bit we're gonna go into a high lunge this is another common pose so the back knee is gonna lift off okay so what we're gonna try and do is balance lift the body you can bring your hands to your hips maybe the hands to the front leg just for a bit of stability or if you want to go super hardcore take your arms up and just practice here now stretching and reaching through the fingers this is quite a strong pose but it will really help to open up through the front here breathe in okay exhale let's bring the hands back to the hips bend the back knee come back step back let's go to downward dog again lift the knees off and just reset walk out your dog good just noticing how you feel right in your downward facing dog it's a good way to check in after doing that lunge and stretching out let's drop down and check out Child's Pose so feet together knees out wide press back drop the head down and just notice if there are any changes to the sensation in your hips after we stretch to the front of the hips in the lunge you might find that these postures have become easy already and that's the thing I want you guys to really remember is that you don't need to be doing hours and hours and hours of yoga a week even just 10 minutes every single day is going to help open up your body de-stress calm your mind and you'll start to see the benefits much faster than if you were to try and do maybe like one class or one hour a week yeah so let's just do the other side come forward press back downward dog let's walk the feet up to the hands and roll okay hands on the hips let's step back and we'll do the other side I'll stand this way so that you can see the front of my hip stretching so I'm gonna drop back yep coming down let's do the first one where the knee is on the floor sinking forward feeling that stretch through the front of the hip you can either keep your hands up here like this and you'll feel a nice stretch or if you go a little bit more you might get your hips down a little and you'll feel that stretch to the front a little bit more okay now the breath is really key here okay otherwise we're just kind of stretching if we hold the breath the body won't relax properly you'll finish the practice and you won't feel like you've achieved anything if you close your eyes and just focus on your breath and particularly focus on relaxing you're gonna notice the muscles release so can we do two more inhale exhale let's go one more like that inhale and exhale okay we're gonna go into the hotter one so back toes attacked lift your knee you ready maybe one hand maybe the other so just get that balance first then when you feel balanced a good ways to just keep your eyes focused at one point you're then going to extend your arms up towards the ceiling hold it here try and balance good stretch up and then exhale come down bring that hand down step back broke the back knee to the floor let's go into downward dog lift the knees okay remembering our downward dog position shake out your head decompress the cervical spine which is at the neck and then we're gonna bring the knees down to the floor and we're gonna check in with Child's Pose again feet together hips to heels body goes down relax the shoulders and just notice are you getting deeper into your postures possibly okay and that's just after a few little postures here and there okay and deep breaths take one more deep breath in here and a full breath out okay and there you have it some of the key postures that we're gonna do throughout this series downward dog Child's Pose and some lunges now even just that sequence alone I'm sure you're feeling a little bit more loose in the body and that's really all it takes so don't feel overwhelmed by the practice just get on your mat it doesn't take any other equipment start breathing start stretching you're gonna feel amazing thank you so much thanks guys I hope you enjoyed that if you'd love to see more from me more yoga videos more workout so please subscribe to my youtube channel it's shown over to you 
hello everyone eight and welcome back to the body coach TV today's video is all about improving your kettlebell technique and I'm joined by a master kettlebell training at Taunton technology they go on and I've been doing this and why do you care well so much since for about nine years now and kettlebells made in a one-stop shop for a total body workout can do hit gives you strength training and you strengthen drawers of power and drawers and a gym membership because we needed one kettlebell when one of these okay so first of all you come before we get cracker and do the moves we're going to work through nine kettlebell move because I really wanna get better at I base will improve my technique so I can do more videos to do more videos on the channel for kettlebells and hopefully yes improve your watiam to Z you can kettlebells right so first one is a little bit my village so what you do for hips to drop down one day on the floor yet rocking forward should feel that stretch through the hip flexor and then you can reach up the same arm as the knee that's on the ground did you reach him forward open up that hip you might further go into your after the air really fill and insertion point that and then when leaking back we starts to get into off the back bit of extension through the spine how's that feel yeah I can feel because you do use a lot of hip flexors you know hamstrings and you don't wind yourself the Washington is getting there cold pick up a heavy kettlebell start swinging it up a hero and you injure yourself and you're out so mobility in wall not the body is really important always take it seriously and then yes so stretch that six legs yeah thirty seconds each child will do nice and easy so where did you learn to do kettle bells now and you've been and teaching it kettle bells would be probably one of the first things I learned we're going to industry just because they were I don't know really intense yeah I really like the idea of it come from come from Russia you know the Russians our local area near quite militant and we really got into it I learned from most from a really hardcore instructor she was awesome and then just carry on in my training all the time the ever use it requires love using it with other coaches they zeliha it's a great bit of kit to have them in all stage again if you can't afford a full gym membership or personal trainer getting a little pair of kettlebells you can really get a good workout and it obviously it's going to build strength but it also really gets your heart when you work with it some sequence complexes and started totally right I do our hamstring so you mentioned option for really important posterior chain exercise like like swing single arm suitcase deadlift every time you swing your kettlebell we need get those hamstrings going so we're going to go into a push-up position feet really wide apart which you can do an inchworm so you can walk the hands back and it gets far back as you can and try and stretch those hamstrings out move your hands around a little bit as well to get a bit of rotation notified until plane and then then last in fact again somebody please and I'll wrap up boards and then treat yourself to a push-up signature down there as well and then walk back and again you listen it like 30 seconds of work just trying to scroll that registry I'm sure if you can get your heels you can get to your ankles and then seeing as it's a sacrum rap let's do two push-ups session so when people are really part of their length of bending anything they can go bit wider wider stretch them out a little bit yeah you've made that because obviously not I wasn't ever really straight legs you might have a slight Bend but just feel the stretch a little bit yeah don't overdo it as long as you're not in too much pain as long as it feels nice and it's all good and then three push-ups shoulders nice and warm as well alright nice another one and I want one up for are the killaby maker somebody the ball up in it yeah we just want we're not there that'll do right Paulson lovely so as we go through the move ten yes what we're getting out to so first of all really important if I might be familiar with a kettlebell swing what weight we're gonna choose and also this for the viewers a lot of people ask the question is what weight do I need to invest in you know doing the pair what what advice you give on that so it's a really tricky on some skiers like it depends on so many different factors what you need to do is just be really really careful with technique how it feels as a rough guide really rough guide those ends are contexts you're a beginner you've never ever done this before you're probably looking at an 8 kilo kettlebell for a lady maybe a 12 for a guy and intermediate you're probably looking at like 16 for a guy's maybe a 12 for a ladies kilograms yeah yeah and in fact you may be looking at 20 or 24 for a guy but it depends on so many factors a golden rule would be if you tacked it on on point don't go up yeah and why that Emily folks kappa bulbs tradition to go up by 4 kilo weights so you're gonna have to play around and see how it feels we're going to do a complex so the 12 right we think yeah 12 will be good but you might find with the swing because just because you're a strong guy you are I'm not sure about that I don't open I've seen something ugly and we can another it's no I'm strong enough now yet I'm definitely not strong as I look back today if you use a weight that's too light for you you're just going to be like muscle if not or white the whole time you're not going to be using glutes your hamstrings and your abs so we'll see if we'll see what happens so do you want to demo at first and I can follow you follow your lead good call they're probably side on the best way to look at if you're looking for a hip hinge so a nice loose grip the whole time going to let this cap above come between my knees and just snap my hips up and I'm trying to keep my hands as loose as possible so I'm not using too much shoulder I'm just trying to snap my hips through men at the top be really using your hamstrings your glutes right yeah drive forward now as I get to the top and try to squeeze my butt break my ABS slam my heels down into the ground so my quads are nice and tight yeah okay quads glutes cantering but a big firm juicy butter this is the one to do a lot of people find difficult to connect and that beefy going swing and then I'm not doing how come you've almost sort of that just like clinch it's happening really is exactly that thing's what he's doing way bad things about trying to get your hips back to the window that's it nice so my pleasure my name's two months all that not a no that's good it's going to be because you've got tight hamstrings which you find out in the warm-up there's not going to be a huge amount and you've been going on what we're looking for is pelvis traveling backwards rather than pelvis rolling it down to the ground a lot of people come you know write down I mean how how long between kettlebells and as harsh as you come towards the ground we can do if you look at as you go lower you start to get a bit of a curve through your lower back yeah yeah we want to avoid that on a nice straight back so you want to catch the ball to pretty much for go between the knees no lower than that in an ideal world you can see how it is too clipping joe's bar at the back that's pretty good I'm really regretting my quickly my glutes now okay now I just snap through let's get the appetite watch hype you can see now as you start to drive your hips more high level starts calm down basically means it's to live so you yeah I'm I'm definitely speeding in a bun all right so you happy that in there is good just be aware like as the weight increases because that's when techniques goodness let's run over here our fire to try the necessary for 16 and standing in our faces slave much tired this kettlebell business right so let's do 20 strings no I'm like God loose grip okay 20 same triad not blue clips through I keep the heels as jump into the ground as you can the entire time and you can see as well go to the mo get nice and tight just not through and then half the back as well got the shoulder blades squeezing together at the top all right really good let's not come to life I can snap through sort of check that's right using some shoulder good zero keep squeezing your black pink appetite got a couple of right good map Wow koala fit heart rate elevated so it's like it read the card even when you start combining it other move to the smashinator yeah so you've got full body and high reps as well all right sighs cheese and I'm happy with that cat looks me next movie right single on swing I'll just swimming again same movements box and now it's single on well I'm going to our sanity going please set be stabilized so there's going to be a lot of rotation going on so it's a little like an anti rotation so anything with one arm is always going to be harder than with - yeah that's hopefully you thrive but sometimes we forget so one arm I'm going to go with my weaker arm first just so I get good technique on the weaker run yeah and there's a general rule on single arm stuff you always want to go with your weaker side first as soon as you've done a certain number of reps or a certain amount of time with the weaker side you've earned the right to increase away so if I use the twelve on this side it feels good so I my strong side I'm sure will feel good then I can go to succeed my weak side collapse get so glass and say something even through the hips just what are a little bit of rotation as I reach through between my legs nicely prospective cowboy slightly you do yeah just a little rotation that's as it swings through the mix over here something yes yeah and then with this other arms some people that we know what to do this but it's really important that we have it stabilized the balance yeah yeah so if I'm engaging this side here by the pressures of a radiation I'm going to get more muscle activation in every day yeah all right so your right to your elastic I'm right-handed so Jay can I figure let's get yeah good see now we've got your hips traveling down a little bit so let's make a really big asset to go back at that let me go and when we get to the top let's they connected through the shoulder blade one more good job well if you can same straight into great another arm a bit of a high school movement you can alternate like to go left to right when you've got the technique seem a little bit more simple to abs great so I'm happy to swing but if one I also find people do can get wrong with really engines also really important to watch that map a few times go through that a few times pick up the focal point so maybe in Japan you have got a mirror maybe doing the moves to see your form and see your body move but next we have gone to is a thing up to those suitcase numbers you click that there so it picks deadly so let's imagine you can't suitcase that's that's for a console simply which we all do now you're going to be up here so if you like the suitcase carried a really good exercise to throw in that so you just carrying it trying to keep your shoulder back it's going to destabilize you so we're looking at a 90 rotation exercise for the suitcase deadlift what the kettlebells are just be set up sort of just in front of your ankle the undead mitigates not squat so I need to be hinging from my hip the minutes are going to travel backwards that my knees coming too far forward it's going to drop down I'm trying to stay as stable as possible this mirror is amazing for this otherwise I probably over here I'm trying to say the level as possible get my shoulder blades nice and tight she can stand up from here first moving at the top its back little bit leave and again I want this arm you know run down your back nice and straight right as no pivot there's no kind of arch in the back strong lower back yeah you want to avoid this position you want to avoid this position nice strong then this position good what laughing what muscle groups you tell us working to make majority do network excess glutes hamstrings the glutes and shoulder stability so posterior chain in the upper back and how are those evident yeah master bungee rotation exercise as well as we have a tightness and even in trade keep it strike just like a suitcase unless you wheel a suitcase and then you know pull back off get a little bit more knee bend at the bottom than that even more yeah you really feel that that's it so that position you're in now is perfect get titleholders yep there you go really nice putting me what well you've got kind of this has got a lot strengthen up a little bit it's really pulling me to the right so that's the ante rotation side of it you haven't a really short Shaun what's the benefit of doing single arm work as all right really good yeah really good you just now let's make sure the knees they've trouble to fall forwards so we're going to further meet it back the mantra me back yeah yeah awesome oh and then make sure the way down we're really conscious and relaxed so on the way down got to make sure we we don't just give up I worked really hard from the bottom traditionally see there's quite a lot of people like okay and you stop the way here so we really tight when you when you said good I love EXO exercise not bad for a lot two types of swaps we've got a goblet squat hands we got this to a goblet work you can either hold of both handles or we call it upside down totally up to you makes no real difference it's just about come from ya know from a we're going to squat so everyone squats a bit differently find a comfortable position for you feet generally shoulder width apart toes out if you like from their first movement bombs going to drive back a little bit get a drop down knees out to the side get deeper I can go ideally below parallel pop back up trying to set it up right you can our pilot is really nice it loads through the quads nicely rather than a back squat thing you can't play with a front squat and goes up a bit you can't you really have to work the legs more you know yeah so on traditionally when when you put Barnes on the back most people absolutely looking through the shoulders to keep completely straight back to the bar on the back to recover that squat you're going to get the low into quad activation you can get the same very similar benefits from a back squat but it's just it's such a more accessible exercise to do you have to worry about shoulder mobility it's a very easy position how about cattle well Alberta oil just tapped it although it's tied you always want your elbows to be to be tight into rib cage which is going to allow that nice and tight to roll back I just filled up the weight when it comes through the body the nice it comes through me more that I think the back sorts people something use all that it's a good exercise that's the goblet squat next I'm going to do is from Frederick's work so still squat but with the cap above if we start to learn this position called the front rack what it's it allows us to be then able to do lots of things like cleans let's go ahead of you this one so head on from this one so it's going to sit might be aware if you've never done this type of stuff before like this part of your arm is gonna hurt because the kettlebell is quite unforgiving whether they're breaking things in it but will toughen up around so here will be your eyes from there we're going to twist and hold and where we're going to hold there so it's going to sit you with your hands in the middle of your chest right elbows tucked into your rib cage and that cat version certainly full wrong now it should be a position you feel really comfortable it you should be able to walk around like this although although just hanging around not too much on the shoulder I think when you're up there obviously showed you just resting it elbow down against your body if you're up and you feel your shoulder you're in a bad position that your shoulders going to fatigue but we don't want to squat so from here again like this not working on going to reach out get nice and nice and tight and then you're just going to squat from here again trying to stay upright naturally you want to tip to the right because that's where the weight is just front rail is stable as possible give that elbow entry ribs and I think it really really challenge your body in a different way to that's a normal squat or a smith's-machine it's like it seems more taxing on the body and you're really able to think about what you doing with your other bitchin it's tightened up the cork is really working the minute you send weight on one side and to really engage it season so you've got to call in like that too we can go into a double position yeah do you have other things I'll just leave them at totally up to you right if you go for high wrap that's where we go like that can be a label but if you're not this apartment complex where we just set to head now there's more weight but I'm more stable as soon as you take one away yeah it's a lot harder that's one of my favorite moves in front to up and you can see taking that again once you've got that rack you can go into another one of my characters which is the reverse lunge so that right hand in the middle right there yeah so Hanlon milli Jeff elbow tied to rib cage doctor so that's my hands me up so many where yes you don't meet it too much let's get about that okay again every will be different just find that comfortable spot that's all you know up and out brilliant right lovely motor what's next that next does number four next winning we're going to the claim cool so if you're going to watch Smart Watch probably good opportunity to take them off otherwise might smash alright so so we're going to finish in that program position because we just work the front right that's where we're going to finish so this is where we start okay where you start starting off from rep position now we're going to make sure our feet are back to our swing stance so they're not in our squat stance wingspan should generally be sort of hip-width apart would be ideal powered up if it'll turn out of it probably for the swing we want toes pointing forwards if we're squatting you can go out so good okay for a swing with dead less toes point forward ideally right from here we'll just feel that the cap of a roll and it's going to come down and we're going to find ourselves sort of in the middle position of a single arm swing okay so I'm just going to roll the kettlebell down we swing it up I'm going to pull it and catch it on my forearm so you let it roll down swing pull it up I'm trying to use my hips as much as possible try and drive my elbow up towards the ceiling and that kettlebell just going to roll in and land on my four so again when finishing up four position bit tighter finish there keep it really tightening the body so as you come up pretty big pull me over vehicle better don't know much madam - Koko I'm sure it's really funny joke close to the bear that's a nice big pull the elbow meant a Ford you may not put it up up yeah elbow zero and then I should come between your legs let it rotate yeah I did my tape so bad yeah thumb goes through and then spin back out and say pattern in it yeah put a little bit underneath school okay yeah finish really tight again let's get back from requisition all you will eat hurtfully when it's matching the bicep then if you go like get more of us so if it's that started to happen just starting to feel it smack you and your shoulder and your bicep just means that we've stopped driving with the hips and we're pulling a little bit too into it with the bicep right not get a nap yeah just keep it really tight and always remember we want to catch it here in that program position striking the other side it's quite a high school movement right you can't yet see that one so again with any single arm exercise we want to make sure we practice on oh yeah definitely feels like a different kind of movement weaker on so again let the thumb travel through behind you after that so then you drive up and then yeah we're doing it and that's finishing the front right position again every part to hand to chest okay that zip good definitely a bit more fidgeting that one takes it more perhaps it I think yes definitely and it's like if I get a new skill right imagine imagine trying to pick up a guitar and play it yeah you might have a few chords but you're not gonna you're not going to be able to nail stairway to heaven you first week I think Jimmy plays back so the band that lines we're now on today what's this on the breath my breath okay so she's gonna sing on the impress we've got into a program position we can go into our press okay so that we're clean so there yeah the press is up right yeah so what we're gonna do from here we can pick that kettlebell Schreck up overhead so it's going to come out to the side finish nice and tall your bicep next to ear and we want to make sure that our ribcage is down so we're not leaning back then it's going to follow the same path on the way down so from rock out and up so you get a little bit of transverse crane movement through the shoulder bit external rotation really good for that shoulder yes a lot of people sometimes I feel it when I so they said is there yeah you've got to really get up right that's it exactly try not that it's the ears to the bicep try and bring a fiber to meet the air good so Joe's like natural easing is like so they're not it depends it reduced so that's the push press one use your legs which is going to be little bit easier cuz you going to get hit drive if we want to really work off shoulders let's not use the like let's just use the shoulder pretty good since in there yep just pause at the top so what bro page down which get your appetite soon as you pull that rotation ABS come into flexion we take load off of the low bar for mantra left arm good work I'm going to Melissa just a digit just a technique like to just the next video match your workout so net right let's go no likes to start just abs really tight try to get those legs arranged squeeze your butt at the top as well all right from there just put all your energy into that Norman bicep tricep they're not here to back up good last piece of nozzle education so I wish we're that hard to do that to pull that down yoga Lee and because I put on six ounces to try and pull that then it's cool things to get in it this here so when we go overhead most of us are just naturally tight through here yeah really all my day like this and this and this entire like hanging out drinking with our mates like yeah and food we all do that so we're just really tight through here so subscribe spend as much time as possible in this overhead position because all the things I had right a to be that's all we're thinking so we just naturally want to go on that together be or is actually want to be not a my mobility you see I mean I'm not I've got really close to putting work on that but yeah i'm tighten my left is what i look pull up but that's a great move makes no the final one all this is a real challenge right half get up yeah wins that one now and so let's go let's put the two movement together so clean and press together just putting together first week using boats are going to clean we're catching our pro crack and I'm going to press come back down when we go back into the clean so the two movements together put them into almost like the complex or a superset that's a great move so as soon as you blows those two movements on their own you can put them together the problem most people make is they want to do that movement together but they have you learn to clean and oppress separately oh and even the first bit to swinging it really so you got up it and then Childre add that good just make sure you get back up from reps in research yeah turn it around so we go into our swing let's get a little bit more more hip driving back okay yeah they go good so that oh well just doing that we use that what 20 minutes is really giving me confidence so it's definite improvement technique so now that my kind of kettlebell content on the YouTube channel I hope you enjoyed that pump back to Pilate welcome back

everybody - everyone welcome to doing that see ya 
hello everyone eight and welcome back to the body coach TV today's video is all about improving your kettlebell technique and I'm joined by a master kettlebell training at Taunton technology they go on and I've been doing this and why do you care well so much since for about nine years now and kettlebells made in a one-stop shop for a total body workout can do hit gives you strength training and you strengthen drawers of power and drawers and a gym membership because we needed one kettlebell when one of these okay so first of all you come before we get cracker and do the moves we're going to work through nine kettlebell move because I really wanna get better at I base will improve my technique so I can do more videos to do more videos on the channel for kettlebells and hopefully yes improve your watiam to Z you can kettlebells right so first one is a little bit my village so what you do for hips to drop down one day on the floor yet rocking forward should feel that stretch through the hip flexor and then you can reach up the same arm as the knee that's on the ground did you reach him forward open up that hip you might further go into your after the air really fill and insertion point that and then when leaking back we starts to get into off the back bit of extension through the spine how's that feel yeah I can feel because you do use a lot of hip flexors you know hamstrings and you don't wind yourself the Washington is getting there cold pick up a heavy kettlebell start swinging it up a hero and you injure yourself and you're out so mobility in wall not the body is really important always take it seriously and then yes so stretch that six legs yeah thirty seconds each child will do nice and easy so where did you learn to do kettle bells now and you've been and teaching it kettle bells would be probably one of the first things I learned we're going to industry just because they were I don't know really intense yeah I really like the idea of it come from come from Russia you know the Russians our local area near quite militant and we really got into it I learned from most from a really hardcore instructor she was awesome and then just carry on in my training all the time the ever use it requires love using it with other coaches they zeliha it's a great bit of kit to have them in all stage again if you can't afford a full gym membership or personal trainer getting a little pair of kettlebells you can really get a good workout and it obviously it's going to build strength but it also really gets your heart when you work with it some sequence complexes and started totally right I do our hamstring so you mentioned option for really important posterior chain exercise like like swing single arm suitcase deadlift every time you swing your kettlebell we need get those hamstrings going so we're going to go into a push-up position feet really wide apart which you can do an inchworm so you can walk the hands back and it gets far back as you can and try and stretch those hamstrings out move your hands around a little bit as well to get a bit of rotation notified until plane and then then last in fact again somebody please and I'll wrap up boards and then treat yourself to a push-up signature down there as well and then walk back and again you listen it like 30 seconds of work just trying to scroll that registry I'm sure if you can get your heels you can get to your ankles and then seeing as it's a sacrum rap let's do two push-ups session so when people are really part of their length of bending anything they can go bit wider wider stretch them out a little bit yeah you've made that because obviously not I wasn't ever really straight legs you might have a slight Bend but just feel the stretch a little bit yeah don't overdo it as long as you're not in too much pain as long as it feels nice and it's all good and then three push-ups shoulders nice and warm as well alright nice another one and I want one up for are the killaby maker somebody the ball up in it yeah we just want we're not there that'll do right Paulson lovely so as we go through the move ten yes what we're getting out to so first of all really important if I might be familiar with a kettlebell swing what weight we're gonna choose and also this for the viewers a lot of people ask the question is what weight do I need to invest in you know doing the pair what what advice you give on that so it's a really tricky on some skiers like it depends on so many different factors what you need to do is just be really really careful with technique how it feels as a rough guide really rough guide those ends are contexts you're a beginner you've never ever done this before you're probably looking at an 8 kilo kettlebell for a lady maybe a 12 for a guy and intermediate you're probably looking at like 16 for a guy's maybe a 12 for a ladies kilograms yeah yeah and in fact you may be looking at 20 or 24 for a guy but it depends on so many factors a golden rule would be if you tacked it on on point don't go up yeah and why that Emily folks kappa bulbs tradition to go up by 4 kilo weights so you're gonna have to play around and see how it feels we're going to do a complex so the 12 right we think yeah 12 will be good but you might find with the swing because just because you're a strong guy you are I'm not sure about that I don't open I've seen something ugly and we can another it's no I'm strong enough now yet I'm definitely not strong as I look back today if you use a weight that's too light for you you're just going to be like muscle if not or white the whole time you're not going to be using glutes your hamstrings and your abs so we'll see if we'll see what happens so do you want to demo at first and I can follow you follow your lead good call they're probably side on the best way to look at if you're looking for a hip hinge so a nice loose grip the whole time going to let this cap above come between my knees and just snap my hips up and I'm trying to keep my hands as loose as possible so I'm not using too much shoulder I'm just trying to snap my hips through men at the top be really using your hamstrings your glutes right yeah drive forward now as I get to the top and try to squeeze my butt break my ABS slam my heels down into the ground so my quads are nice and tight yeah okay quads glutes cantering but a big firm juicy butter this is the one to do a lot of people find difficult to connect and that beefy going swing and then I'm not doing how come you've almost sort of that just like clinch it's happening really is exactly that thing's what he's doing way bad things about trying to get your hips back to the window that's it nice so my pleasure my name's two months all that not a no that's good it's going to be because you've got tight hamstrings which you find out in the warm-up there's not going to be a huge amount and you've been going on what we're looking for is pelvis traveling backwards rather than pelvis rolling it down to the ground a lot of people come you know write down I mean how how long between kettlebells and as harsh as you come towards the ground we can do if you look at as you go lower you start to get a bit of a curve through your lower back yeah yeah we want to avoid that on a nice straight back so you want to catch the ball to pretty much for go between the knees no lower than that in an ideal world you can see how it is too clipping joe's bar at the back that's pretty good I'm really regretting my quickly my glutes now okay now I just snap through let's get the appetite watch hype you can see now as you start to drive your hips more high level starts calm down basically means it's to live so you yeah I'm I'm definitely speeding in a bun all right so you happy that in there is good just be aware like as the weight increases because that's when techniques goodness let's run over here our fire to try the necessary for 16 and standing in our faces slave much tired this kettlebell business right so let's do 20 strings no I'm like God loose grip okay 20 same triad not blue clips through I keep the heels as jump into the ground as you can the entire time and you can see as well go to the mo get nice and tight just not through and then half the back as well got the shoulder blades squeezing together at the top all right really good let's not come to life I can snap through sort of check that's right using some shoulder good zero keep squeezing your black pink appetite got a couple of right good map Wow koala fit heart rate elevated so it's like it read the card even when you start combining it other move to the smashinator yeah so you've got full body and high reps as well all right sighs cheese and I'm happy with that cat looks me next movie right single on swing I'll just swimming again same movements box and now it's single on well I'm going to our sanity going please set be stabilized so there's going to be a lot of rotation going on so it's a little like an anti rotation so anything with one arm is always going to be harder than with - yeah that's hopefully you thrive but sometimes we forget so one arm I'm going to go with my weaker arm first just so I get good technique on the weaker run yeah and there's a general rule on single arm stuff you always want to go with your weaker side first as soon as you've done a certain number of reps or a certain amount of time with the weaker side you've earned the right to increase away so if I use the twelve on this side it feels good so I my strong side I'm sure will feel good then I can go to succeed my weak side collapse get so glass and say something even through the hips just what are a little bit of rotation as I reach through between my legs nicely prospective cowboy slightly you do yeah just a little rotation that's as it swings through the mix over here something yes yeah and then with this other arms some people that we know what to do this but it's really important that we have it stabilized the balance yeah yeah so if I'm engaging this side here by the pressures of a radiation I'm going to get more muscle activation in every day yeah all right so your right to your elastic I'm right-handed so Jay can I figure let's get yeah good see now we've got your hips traveling down a little bit so let's make a really big asset to go back at that let me go and when we get to the top let's they connected through the shoulder blade one more good job well if you can same straight into great another arm a bit of a high school movement you can alternate like to go left to right when you've got the technique seem a little bit more simple to abs great so I'm happy to swing but if one I also find people do can get wrong with really engines also really important to watch that map a few times go through that a few times pick up the focal point so maybe in Japan you have got a mirror maybe doing the moves to see your form and see your body move but next we have gone to is a thing up to those suitcase numbers you click that there so it picks deadly so let's imagine you can't suitcase that's that's for a console simply which we all do now you're going to be up here so if you like the suitcase carried a really good exercise to throw in that so you just carrying it trying to keep your shoulder back it's going to destabilize you so we're looking at a 90 rotation exercise for the suitcase deadlift what the kettlebells are just be set up sort of just in front of your ankle the undead mitigates not squat so I need to be hinging from my hip the minutes are going to travel backwards that my knees coming too far forward it's going to drop down I'm trying to stay as stable as possible this mirror is amazing for this otherwise I probably over here I'm trying to say the level as possible get my shoulder blades nice and tight she can stand up from here first moving at the top its back little bit leave and again I want this arm you know run down your back nice and straight right as no pivot there's no kind of arch in the back strong lower back yeah you want to avoid this position you want to avoid this position nice strong then this position good what laughing what muscle groups you tell us working to make majority do network excess glutes hamstrings the glutes and shoulder stability so posterior chain in the upper back and how are those evident yeah master bungee rotation exercise as well as we have a tightness and even in trade keep it strike just like a suitcase unless you wheel a suitcase and then you know pull back off get a little bit more knee bend at the bottom than that even more yeah you really feel that that's it so that position you're in now is perfect get titleholders yep there you go really nice putting me what well you've got kind of this has got a lot strengthen up a little bit it's really pulling me to the right so that's the ante rotation side of it you haven't a really short Shaun what's the benefit of doing single arm work as all right really good yeah really good you just now let's make sure the knees they've trouble to fall forwards so we're going to further meet it back the mantra me back yeah yeah awesome oh and then make sure the way down we're really conscious and relaxed so on the way down got to make sure we we don't just give up I worked really hard from the bottom traditionally see there's quite a lot of people like okay and you stop the way here so we really tight when you when you said good I love EXO exercise not bad for a lot two types of swaps we've got a goblet squat hands we got this to a goblet work you can either hold of both handles or we call it upside down totally up to you makes no real difference it's just about come from ya know from a we're going to squat so everyone squats a bit differently find a comfortable position for you feet generally shoulder width apart toes out if you like from their first movement bombs going to drive back a little bit get a drop down knees out to the side get deeper I can go ideally below parallel pop back up trying to set it up right you can our pilot is really nice it loads through the quads nicely rather than a back squat thing you can't play with a front squat and goes up a bit you can't you really have to work the legs more you know yeah so on traditionally when when you put Barnes on the back most people absolutely looking through the shoulders to keep completely straight back to the bar on the back to recover that squat you're going to get the low into quad activation you can get the same very similar benefits from a back squat but it's just it's such a more accessible exercise to do you have to worry about shoulder mobility it's a very easy position how about cattle well Alberta oil just tapped it although it's tied you always want your elbows to be to be tight into rib cage which is going to allow that nice and tight to roll back I just filled up the weight when it comes through the body the nice it comes through me more that I think the back sorts people something use all that it's a good exercise that's the goblet squat next I'm going to do is from Frederick's work so still squat but with the cap above if we start to learn this position called the front rack what it's it allows us to be then able to do lots of things like cleans let's go ahead of you this one so head on from this one so it's going to sit might be aware if you've never done this type of stuff before like this part of your arm is gonna hurt because the kettlebell is quite unforgiving whether they're breaking things in it but will toughen up around so here will be your eyes from there we're going to twist and hold and where we're going to hold there so it's going to sit you with your hands in the middle of your chest right elbows tucked into your rib cage and that cat version certainly full wrong now it should be a position you feel really comfortable it you should be able to walk around like this although although just hanging around not too much on the shoulder I think when you're up there obviously showed you just resting it elbow down against your body if you're up and you feel your shoulder you're in a bad position that your shoulders going to fatigue but we don't want to squat so from here again like this not working on going to reach out get nice and nice and tight and then you're just going to squat from here again trying to stay upright naturally you want to tip to the right because that's where the weight is just front rail is stable as possible give that elbow entry ribs and I think it really really challenge your body in a different way to that's a normal squat or a smith's-machine it's like it seems more taxing on the body and you're really able to think about what you doing with your other bitchin it's tightened up the cork is really working the minute you send weight on one side and to really engage it season so you've got to call in like that too we can go into a double position yeah do you have other things I'll just leave them at totally up to you right if you go for high wrap that's where we go like that can be a label but if you're not this apartment complex where we just set to head now there's more weight but I'm more stable as soon as you take one away yeah it's a lot harder that's one of my favorite moves in front to up and you can see taking that again once you've got that rack you can go into another one of my characters which is the reverse lunge so that right hand in the middle right there yeah so Hanlon milli Jeff elbow tied to rib cage doctor so that's my hands me up so many where yes you don't meet it too much let's get about that okay again every will be different just find that comfortable spot that's all you know up and out brilliant right lovely motor what's next that next does number four next winning we're going to the claim cool so if you're going to watch Smart Watch probably good opportunity to take them off otherwise might smash alright so so we're going to finish in that program position because we just work the front right that's where we're going to finish so this is where we start okay where you start starting off from rep position now we're going to make sure our feet are back to our swing stance so they're not in our squat stance wingspan should generally be sort of hip-width apart would be ideal powered up if it'll turn out of it probably for the swing we want toes pointing forwards if we're squatting you can go out so good okay for a swing with dead less toes point forward ideally right from here we'll just feel that the cap of a roll and it's going to come down and we're going to find ourselves sort of in the middle position of a single arm swing okay so I'm just going to roll the kettlebell down we swing it up I'm going to pull it and catch it on my forearm so you let it roll down swing pull it up I'm trying to use my hips as much as possible try and drive my elbow up towards the ceiling and that kettlebell just going to roll in and land on my four so again when finishing up four position bit tighter finish there keep it really tightening the body so as you come up pretty big pull me over vehicle better don't know much madam - Koko I'm sure it's really funny joke close to the bear that's a nice big pull the elbow meant a Ford you may not put it up up yeah elbow zero and then I should come between your legs let it rotate yeah I did my tape so bad yeah thumb goes through and then spin back out and say pattern in it yeah put a little bit underneath school okay yeah finish really tight again let's get back from requisition all you will eat hurtfully when it's matching the bicep then if you go like get more of us so if it's that started to happen just starting to feel it smack you and your shoulder and your bicep just means that we've stopped driving with the hips and we're pulling a little bit too into it with the bicep right not get a nap yeah just keep it really tight and always remember we want to catch it here in that program position striking the other side it's quite a high school movement right you can't yet see that one so again with any single arm exercise we want to make sure we practice on oh yeah definitely feels like a different kind of movement weaker on so again let the thumb travel through behind you after that so then you drive up and then yeah we're doing it and that's finishing the front right position again every part to hand to chest okay that zip good definitely a bit more fidgeting that one takes it more perhaps it I think yes definitely and it's like if I get a new skill right imagine imagine trying to pick up a guitar and play it yeah you might have a few chords but you're not gonna you're not going to be able to nail stairway to heaven you first week I think Jimmy plays back so the band that lines we're now on today what's this on the breath my breath okay so she's gonna sing on the impress we've got into a program position we can go into our press okay so that we're clean so there yeah the press is up right yeah so what we're gonna do from here we can pick that kettlebell Schreck up overhead so it's going to come out to the side finish nice and tall your bicep next to ear and we want to make sure that our ribcage is down so we're not leaning back then it's going to follow the same path on the way down so from rock out and up so you get a little bit of transverse crane movement through the shoulder bit external rotation really good for that shoulder yes a lot of people sometimes I feel it when I so they said is there yeah you've got to really get up right that's it exactly try not that it's the ears to the bicep try and bring a fiber to meet the air good so Joe's like natural easing is like so they're not it depends it reduced so that's the push press one use your legs which is going to be little bit easier cuz you going to get hit drive if we want to really work off shoulders let's not use the like let's just use the shoulder pretty good since in there yep just pause at the top so what bro page down which get your appetite soon as you pull that rotation ABS come into flexion we take load off of the low bar for mantra left arm good work I'm going to Melissa just a digit just a technique like to just the next video match your workout so net right let's go no likes to start just abs really tight try to get those legs arranged squeeze your butt at the top as well all right from there just put all your energy into that Norman bicep tricep they're not here to back up good last piece of nozzle education so I wish we're that hard to do that to pull that down yoga Lee and because I put on six ounces to try and pull that then it's cool things to get in it this here so when we go overhead most of us are just naturally tight through here yeah really all my day like this and this and this entire like hanging out drinking with our mates like yeah and food we all do that so we're just really tight through here so subscribe spend as much time as possible in this overhead position because all the things I had right a to be that's all we're thinking so we just naturally want to go on that together be or is actually want to be not a my mobility you see I mean I'm not I've got really close to putting work on that but yeah i'm tighten my left is what i look pull up but that's a great move makes no the final one all this is a real challenge right half get up yeah wins that one now and so let's go let's put the two movement together so clean and press together just putting together first week using boats are going to clean we're catching our pro crack and I'm going to press come back down when we go back into the clean so the two movements together put them into almost like the complex or a superset that's a great move so as soon as you blows those two movements on their own you can put them together the problem most people make is they want to do that movement together but they have you learn to clean and oppress separately oh and even the first bit to swinging it really so you got up it and then Childre add that good just make sure you get

[Applause] put that there so hello everybody can you hear me okay I'd like to say first of all congratulations to everyone who's graduated from st. Mary's University today as he said that I graduate in 2008 with degree in sports science and when I got the letter through the post it arrived at my office with the letter you know st. Mary's University I thought oh no I earn more money they're coming after me but I did pay off my student loan took me eight years but I've got there and I'm really nervous public speaking so this is a lot of really scary thing for me to do but I thought there's so many of you out there in the audience that will know exactly what you're doing you would have smashed your degree you've got your sat-nav on you know where you're going you know how to get there but there'll also be a lot of you in the audience that are feeling confused and a bit worried and sort of unsure about what you're going to do where you're going to go and the question that Francis is asking everyone was what you're going to do next year what you're going to do now you graduated and a lot of people not in the head gun I don't know I've got a clue I don't know what I'm going to do and that was how I felt for so many years I called it the quarter life crisis between the ages like 22 and 25 I didn't know what I was doing didn't know where I was going and I went traveling and kept running away and kind of earning a bit of money I was laboring worked in a bar but ultimately I know it's a cliche but when you find out what you love to do and you're passionate about something then success can come really quick because my career is actually only three years but it's been a lot of work behind the scenes so I wanted to go back to the beginning and explain yeah what my ambition was in the early days because I come from a working-class family my mum's a Social Work and my dad's a roofer and me and my brother Nicky were the first two people to go to university and I always thought I was going to be a PE teacher that was why I did the degree in Sport Science I came out of university with the degree and I was like well I've got a degree in sports science but I don't want to be a sports scientist I can't teach because I didn't have a person you know the one year I'm PGCE I couldn't get on the gtp lot because every time I went for the interview they could tell that I didn't want to do it they could see through that I wasn't ready for it it wasn't really what I wanted to do so I bummed around a little bit again went travelling grew my hair never Hyacinthe and I work as a teaching assistant I go into a school I have to sign up a teaching agency and I was I remember just not being very happy enough what I've got to do something I've got have a crack at something so I worked as a teaching assistant in a really rough school and they were going through like special measures with Ofsted really naughty kids and I remember thinking this is hard work they were pulling my hair they were kicking me in the shins nicking my lunch they used to Nick my food and I'd go to my lunchbox to eat and I'd have nothing to eat so it's pretty rough but I realized after about nine months of that I thought I'm not quite cut out to be a school teacher and I think many of you might have done a degree and you might have signed up to that when you're 18 thinking this is what I want to do and maybe like a year into it like this sucks I don't enjoy this but you've persevered you've got it done so don't feel like it's a waste of time because it's really not and I think you should be excited by the change of direction you might you know my brother did law he never became a lawyer he works with me helps move the body coach and I think you should be excited there's so many opportunities out there so don't feel like you've done a degree and you might you might feel pressure to kind of go into that career and that been that job and that with that degree but really the world is so different now there's so many opportunities so don't feel like you've got to and you know necessarily do that yeah and so when I had done my after I'd become a teaching assistant I was doing that for nine months and I thought this ain't this ain't right for me so I borrowed two grand off my dad and I went and did a personal training qualification a six-week course called premier training where learns become personal trainer came out of there really ambitious because I remember thinking this is what I want to do I love exercise and I really love taking somebody who hates exercise on a journey to really enjoying it and getting fitter and I get a massive sense of achievement from doing that and that's why I do every down social media so sorry so did my personal training course and I sat down I thought I don't want to work for fitness first or David I don't want it I don't want to work for someone else and you know get paid five pound an hour and worked really hard and that'll be my job I want to work for myself and so I sat down with piece of paper and I wrote down all these words that were meant fitness and health and motivation and I come up this word the body coach and I was like yes I see it the body coach so I set up a website I set up a Twitter account and started a boot camp in Richmond called Rumble in the park and at the time I didn't have I didn't have a single penny like I literally bought a bit in my life my mom when I got some kettlebells got a few boxing pads a few flyers and whatnot started sort of marking the best I could and I couldn't afford a van so I had a little trailer this little like trailer that clipped onto the back of my bike and I just he get up every morning at 5:30 and cycle from Surbiton all the way through kinks and it was nice and flat all the way through Kingston you get to like Petersham nurseries and you've got that nasty Hill and I would remember it must have been about 70 kilograms just pulling this really heavy trailer but I remember it's a really warm morning I just said to myself this is what I want to do this is what I love do and I felt like I'd finally found out what I was going to do and it was amazing because as soon as I got that dedication and that focus my career just accelerated enough to stun so much in such a short time so don't don't be concerned if you haven't found out what you want to do yet because you will get there it took me a long time like I said I was 26 before I even had a single clue about doing that and I'm now 31 so I've done a lot in such a short time so be patient and explore travel the world don't panic about knowing exactly what is you want to do right now today because it's fine you're going to get there right so I'd get to Richmond yeah 6 a.m. start my boot camp I'd set all the stuff up I'd have a TRX hang on the tree I'd run down there and put the battle rope round the other tree I'd have kettlebells and 15 stations I'd be like because I in my head 15 people going to turn up yeah every time and sometimes you know nobody could turn it would turn up sorry I always get really emotional and tell his story you know how many times so yeah something I'd get there nobody would turn up right and I used to think I'd just be like right this ain't the same the same can happen I'm not going to give up and keep going and I would go to I pack up all the stuff in the trailer and I you know rain or shine I'd go to Richmond station I had a little flyer that I hand down and I used to get on peoples nerves everyday that hate me now just be in such a rush didn't want to see my face and I'll be like come to my bootcamp running the park you know check it out and maybe only ten people would take a flyer and I stand in for two hours but if one of them came it was like another client it was another chance to grow the business and I kept doing that I just kept going back and you won't believe how many times I'd get there never be nobody there like in the night because I did it twice a day so it's a cycle home and then I'll be knackered then I'd cycled back to Richland even do it twice anyway I kept going and I built it up and I eventually it became a little business and then I set one up in Surbiton and I was sort of you know doing alright and I felt right I've got my boot camp and then I started doing some personal training and I kind of got really busy and I was having a great time and I was loving it and really was loving it but you don't you do sacrifice a lot of time being a personal trainer it's like you're up early you don't get much time at the weekend because we're your clients on the train at the weekend so anyway I've really cracked on for a couple of years and then I started just shared some stuff in social media I started posting recipes and stuff on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and then I had this idea one day right in 2014 it was December I was in my flat in Surbiton and I wrote I'm gonna share a recipe and I'm gonna do it in 15 minutes and I'm gonna call it lean in 15 right so that was just an idea hashtag lean in 15 showing a 15-second video and you know I had so many people like friends and I'm really close friends a lot what are you doing why he wakes the time get back to the bootcamp we do my night in every night on Instagram Twitter and Facebook like chill out is boring right and so I didn't listen to them because I just was having fun and I just carried on kept doing what I was doing like with the boot camps every day breakfast lunch and dinner I'd record it and share it on Instagram I had no idea I was ever going to have a book deal or monetize my social media or create an online business I really didn't and that's one thing I think everyone should learn that lesson that it's not about making money shouldn't try and always think I've got to make money it's all about the salary if you make a difference to someone and you make a change in someone's life and make them feel good about themselves you can do amazing things and it will eventually come back obviously in success in certain different areas when I got the books and stuff but so I'm tweeting away doing my Instagram building that community suddenly I get an email from HarperCollins about wanting to write a book with me so I said I'm not really an author I've never written a book and I don't think to be honest that I'm a very good cook and I was like now coming up a meeting with me so I went and had the meeting sat there with them and they were like look we love you and doing many great things on social media I had 50,000 follows an Instagram at the time and I called up my friend Bev and said look Bev do you think I should get an agent or should I just sign up with these guys she said well it's important to get a literary agent so I am I got an agent and it became like they call it a blind auction where publishers as eight publishers were bidding for the rights to lean in 15 and overnight it went from a one-book deal to a two-book deal and then I released it on Amazon pre-order and it went to number one like six months before it is ours anyone got a Lina 15 book in here yeah thank you so my publisher just went crazy was that we've got a sign here so I then got an eight book deal so it became the shooting and I remember my mate at the time a really good friend of mine says what I was really excited about the book deal and stuff and he was like well you should have just done an app non-buyers book so what's the point just do an e-book and it really light up set me on the day said that and I thought now I'm gonna go and do it anyway and you know lean and 15 is now the second best-selling cookbook of all time after my man Jamie Oliver my hero Jamie I'm still sick my heart is I felt on during a hit session my heart is pounding so fast this is more scarier than Guinness World Record we did in Hyde Park so yeah lean in 15 has become this phenomenal success and this aside from you know the financial gains of that that was never what it was about for me I do book tours and I meet these women and these guys that have had you know bulimia and anorexia or they've been overweight or they've got diabetes and they do these plans they follow my ideas and they're it's changing their lives and that's what it's all about for me like even even today I wake up and I do a snapchat or an Instagram is it's always the same thing all I ever try to do every day is to get one person exercising and feeling good and to get one person cooking a healthy recipe so you know I've solved a problem and that's what you should always think with your ideas you know how can I solve a problem and and give people something that's going to make them feel better and that's what you should always be when you're being entrepreneurial and in the process of the whole book thing going on which is pretty crazy I released this online plan called the 90 day shift shape and sustain plan which is an online business selling tailored fitness plans okay so I did that it in a way just to kind of kind of like you know for for if I can get a few people to sign up and do less PT and have a little bit more time to myself and with my girlfriend and whatnot and it's become this huge global company like we've got 40 staff it's a multi-million pound business and it's just grown on social media and my office now got a 5,000 square foot office like 20 meters some ways to stand and give out the flies in Richmond so it makes me proud but every day I go now just walk past and I'm not I can't believe I used to stand there no in commuters and now walk up to this building and this and I've got all these staff is mad and obviously I'm really proud to tell that story so what I want to say is basically I'm gonna get to my final point now is that so many people will say your ideas no good and it won't work and it's been done before and it's already a body coach so why go and do Instagram why go and share recipes you know you're copying someone it always be yourself it's never too late okay and secondly you will get rejection you're gonna have doors down on your face all the time you've gotta be willing to like turn away go and regroup come back knock again keep going because you can't just give up when you get you get one one knock back and that's that's the thing of all entrepreneurs I think they just keep going and they keep working and work in yeah another thing is you know if you are bit scared and confused about going out into the real world and you want to go and live in Thailand and live on the beach for six months up go and do it have fun because that's all it's about you'll get there you'll find out what you want to do in the end but you should be really proud of yourself for doing a degree I bet all your friends and family buzzing I was here in 2008 and I remember thinking like how epic this place was and what a wonderful day and I bet you're just desperate to get out of here now because I'm sweating and you're pretty really tired but yeah so I'll leave you with three things okay and this is three simple mantas that I live my life by right and if you do these three things you can't really go wrong okay and I hope you've enjoyed my chat I hope you found inspirational and I hope um go out there and achieve your goals but the three things I live by a case three simple things it's work hard have fun and be nice if you do those three things whether it's online and social media in the real world in business with your relationships you'll do well you'll succeed and you'll have a great life so good luck everybody and I'm going smash it

and all we're going to do is first one then it's hands on the side little squeeze of the ABS to 20 seconds we're going to do 20 seconds of work 10 seconds rest so the aim has to really engage these core muscles try not to just use your neck you can support your head if you need to look really squeeze those ABS last couple good food wrestling with 10 seconds look all you're doing is Han your size exhaling to go up breathe in on the way down and exhale all the air out of your apps okay so here we go focus on the mastery squeezy good way to lapel goes andressa to steps on each line next I'm going to do Lex to 90 degrees has Tom behind you it's crunch up and touch the ground in front of you see when you really activate them they fatigue really fast we've got a squeeze those ABS and reconcile remember you can do five reps like this is rough and clearly you're not really using me out so I slowed them down as probably controlled reps and just sparkfun same again some pre real annoys out and then exhaling come up I can track two of them squeeze it like I'm kind of putting my chest toward my knees and squeeze my abs [Music] right the next one is doing single leg leg up in the air and we're going to sue 22nd on the right leg and then 20 seconds on the left leg so that leg Lucas is lovin my Bentley right my lower abs a little bit lost 100 still that one right so now left leg up again present to closer you have a little bit away from you and go those up let's go chucks at least bullshit if you can really XS come up last 100 right next one is the bicycle crunch like this we're going to lift both legs up and then kick away and twist as you go for oppositely it's officer elbow ah and the beginning up you could do the same thing that was one foot on the ground if that's really too much like Cheerilee neighs 5 4 3 2 5 oh ok so same again even the full bikes or the half bath tub [Music] the knee to elbow knee so take it away but again the slower the better this one really still is muscles working slow down 5 4 3 2 ah ah ok next I'm going to do give our next little wraps we're going to do a reverse crunch feet hit the ground and then just reverse so they can rest on the ground set and then drive ah oh ah so painful you've really got a lot focus on rasulina so really really contract then you'll feel this pain you get there you'll know you're using your abs

it go three right it's interesting that two units ripped up write it slightly second on this one Chester elephants hand up you're just going to get you down really low pathway it's not bad cuz you've been talking the whole time so take a bit froggy hockey mask abroad or anniversary type war book by the hunter few times my little rest third move in sync on clean and press so quite a high skill move so really important we get back to our front rack position hit drive and then dip dip the legs and drive so we go push press get our shoulders a little rest try these are hips blow mate right 15 seconds on the all non-dominant side 15 on your dominant side all about occurs today yet and then you'll press I just come down and the press let's make sure your hips keep that cat up already touch to the body as well time for one more and then change good work we gonna five-second surprising I'll move that one okay bit more technical and before you'll find that one side is a little bit easier than others you will come and get the movement pattern right so next one one of my favorite you can't market my hiny podium spot in classical Greece it's like sprint and really to give it up so hello heart rate 30 seconds of high needs that we're exercise you look at finally the press up to be your bread and butter Network I like these core moves and collapsing Bourbons and stuff you just do like the CBD steps first I'm doing a lot of mountain climbers split up these basic points of Mayo meaning it keeps you fit so I get those three folder it's not rude people showing up then as a dip I just generally do do really short in temperatures right so quickly slipping three two one hamstrings yeah ah so little reps will get me down on the floor press and press up that will be round while oh my god will they want to go yellow with lunges first I'll slide it but I run reverse lunge lunge ease and the prepped up so let's wrap them up left arm in to look clean non-dominant side first try and keep that front rack you're going to DC you may be unstable as well to try and stay ready upright I'll write that right through that yeah just a balance you're out and then you can get that back knee as low to the ground as possible nice big stride time for one more let's go slide onto can sit on the side it really does make a body work and you'll see with number so single kettlebell up in it yeah good set right brilliant one i'm dr close next move then to press up if you want though it's all pressed up by all means colonies is fine try and get as many as you can as you can on the full press up there may be drop to your knees is technique if you spend a little on a technique just take it up use your shoulders a lot already in the workout so they're going to be fatigue doesn't make you a bad person if you can't stay up in total yet so get what you can I'll tell you what we're going to do it more rounds I'm so glad you broke that ball around military yeah we're thinking four rounds or

hips back towards both of the wall behind you I think about driving your hips back towards a wall making sure that as we snap our hips through we're going to get lots of hamstring and glute activation as we come to the top try to keep our shoulders tight spots fill up tight glute pipe talking through that as makes a lotta mate yeah I'm feeling about it you can create not feeling the glutes in the arms and hamstrings so once you do connect with that muscle that's a brilliant ex-husband work from the bump and combine out the lunges you're going to be getting our strong boot a flat Oh God full burpees the burpees now again 30 seconds on this if you need a bit more rest taking on 10 seconds but try and get in and finisher the ramp so hands down with insulin and up and then release the hands

elbow toward the ceiling so I left arm first nice thing catch and use your legs to help that push press there's definitely a bit more technical this one your think about a little bit more alright one more other arm press we've got five people on this block locked up the Rebs ah well then fly right if people can't get that ten a penny of your both we can do that so a little basically we could just

welcome back to the body coach TV today's workout is an upper body strength session you're gonna need two things one set of dumbbells I'm using 12 kilograms and one bench but if you don't have a bench you can use a chair a step or the edge of a stove a foot to do your tricep dips we've got six moves to do in total we're gonna do 30 seconds on each exercise we're really short 10 second rest between each one and we were the whole thing four times okay so the first move we're going to do nice and simple just probably at the timer it's gonna be a dumbbell curl so from the side curling those weights together up for 30 seconds of Casey here we go 30 seconds starting now so nice straight back and just curl this is folks on their biceps so I'm using 12 kilograms here you might wanna go lighter or heavier and I just want to keep the same weight throughout really so look you can see I'm squeezing the muscle slowly lowering the muscle the weight sorry and contracting the back steps that come up so don't just swing them up take them take your time of control and move last rep okay so Dumbo's go on the ground we're now gonna do another exercise a tricep dip it's a basically from the edge of the bench bend the elbows and extend so we're doing biceps into triceps so again yet the further your feet are away the harder is the closest they are to your knees or is so just keeping those elbows together so close together and keep your back close to the bench or the chair or the sofa where you're doing these to slow and extend these are really great for working the back your arms couple more and reps right next exercise picking out the weights so side on putting a bent over row to fill that position squeeze the muscles and your upper back good give me a nice straight back and squeeze up brilliant squeeze those weights up five second one o'clock okay so weights on the ground when happening going for a press up so straight down working our chest every second gonna press up again nice controlled reps if you can't do full press ups you can do these from the knees good last few seconds this is hot yeah okay so next move then on the ground we're gonna be doing much simple from this mission so that you're sticking this go get the ABS in bold then I love smooth it's gonna be a dumbbell shoulder press this is focusing purely all these folks today no legs I'm resting my legs skipping leg day right so help we get we're not gonna be using the dumbbells just do it shoulder press so from here seek your shoulder clips let's go so this is gonna be really tough four rounds on this short rest controlled reps building up strength but also around your heart rate as well good it's sort of much heavier than it looks 12 kilograms it's not even that heavy right few more okay so that's one round three more of those same again we go another bicep curls step around this is not a little rest good curl those weights this side of them you can see control and straight how their arms feel I'm getting a little pump on now definitely but these are greatly slow reps what you want so now I need to feel it burn on the way up but on the way down okay so weights down second set tricep dips it's all just shoulders arms okay so remember bend those elbows and extend you can be doing these on the edge of it so far or a chair good and you really want to dip low and extend it
