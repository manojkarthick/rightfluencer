There are a number of factors but to sum it up: don't spend your whole life waiting for that next day text.. You're always learning.. Your debt isn't going to bury you. (via Girlboss). I love a pretty soap  sue me.. They're my inspiration.. Documenting your outfits could help diagnose a rut.. Finally  my guiding light.. Be honest  who isn't?. Frankly I'm on board.. "Everywhere I looked  women just like me were falling in love with their hair and with caring for it. Meanwhile  I was delaying  avoiding and half-heartedly doing the bare minimum.". Today's a good day to mix and match.. "Rihanna’s comments put me on notice. Even though I’m doing better at accepting my body  and loving it because it’s my home  I don’t think I’ve ever called bouncing between sizes a pleasure.". The two versions of yourself can be difficult to reconcile.. I hate how much I love it.. There's no such thing as girl drinks and boy drinks.. They're the only people I want to be following.. Tomorrow's looook whaddya think?. Eyebrows are the window to the soul.. Celebrate #InternationalWomensDay by supporting these businesses all the time.. Every type of breakup is covered in here.. You've never tasted food like this before.. "Setbacks happened  women marched on. While women in the Americas continued to organize marches against sexual violence  rape culture  and in support of reproductive freedom and equality  miles across the ocean  100 000 Iranian women marched and protested against islamic revolution in 1979.". I'd like to steal every single thing  please.. Until recently it was completely uncharted territory.. Today may be #InternationalWomensDay but you can take action towards equality every day.. “At the end of each day  I like to ask myself  ‘What did you learn today?’ If I have answers  then that day has been successful.”. "It felt almost unfair  too  to ask questions I didn’t have my own answers to  like whether we were headed toward a boyfriend-girlfriend type of relationship and whether both of us even wanted that.". "I use clothing to communicate something about who I am  and as armor to guard who I think I am. That weekend  I felt unprotected.". Sorry now it's in your head too.. A true industry veteran breaks down Paris Fashion Week.. New York Fashion Week was ripe with inspiration.. This blue couch is my future.. Turns out they're the most popular workouts for a reason.. Don't forget to appreciate the simple things.. "Fun jewelry is one of those things that should be universal. I am already discouraged and disappointed enough when it comes to the limitations in the plus-size clothing market.". "The ability to intuitively understand people’s complaints and ailments cannot be taught. That is something that comes with practice.". The RepliKates are basically outfit detectives.. "The novelty wore off after a few months  however  when I realized my propensity for forehead sweating.". Wait until you discover plopping.. You have to go out of your way if you want to find some good ones.. Snow in March doesn't put a damper on iced coffee season for some people.. Patchy brows are a thing of the past.. The iciest hearts don't stand a chance.. Would you try it? (via COVETEUR). This should be enough to keep me busy until next season.. The marriage is for you  the wedding is for everyone else.. They've all come from different backgrounds to shape an entire city.. Don't be afraid to let your mind roam.. "It took me a minute  after a week of figuring collections out  to remember that it’s also okay to just watch the show and enjoy them.". Yes what you're seeing is a puppy.. Warning: you're going to want a blue wall.. It's gonna be a cold one today  bundle up.. They're not actually a magical cure-all.. My greatest inspiration is this window.. They can't all be winners.. Crusty skin season isn't over just yet.. They're fun to live and still fun to read about.. Minimalism has made it's way to the hair.. "Once you realize everyone’s self-conscious  it becomes easier to prioritize your own track.". It passed every test in the book.. Hindsight is 20/20 right?. Amelia put them to the test.. Watch Louis Vuitton at the Louvre at #PFW.. "Gleaming like a two-legged daffodil  Greta epitomized optimism.". There's a reason people can't stop buying them.. It's the ideal in-between seasons style.. Gloves are the new sleeves  and that's just the beginning.. "I look the same  I act the same  I feel the same way I did when I owned 10 times the amount of product. But there is more space  both physically and mentally.". CROSSING MY FINGERS.. Your bookmarks tab tells a very important story.. Take a peek behind the scenes.. “My mom’s pesto tastes like love because it’s made with fresh basil from my dad’s vegetable garden in the summer.". The rest of this winter is going to look sooo good.. Suddenly getting ready takes no time at all.. Prepare your toes.. It's like a trip to outer space.. They're the most important part of the song.. People come from near and far  and all for different reasons.. "I was worried I looked corny. Everyone seemed to love it  though. Now I’m very into it.". If you're looking for love you have to actually LOOK.. It's honestly kinda spot on.. “I don’t know who I fooled to let me into a category with someone as talented as Mary J. Blige  but I’ll take it." –Timothée Chalamet. It was the first time I realized beauty was more than skin deep.. "Being a magnet for said drama has also helped me develop a deeper intimacy with those I love  a sense of empathy for the way we all hurt and heal.". What's not to love? (via COVETEUR). The 80s are back in a serious way.. Suddenly I need to add pink accents to everything.. "My natural hair is wild and alive. It has a mind of its own and I’m OK with that.". "Like traditional art  great fashion can shake up the inside of a living  breathing person." http://bit.ly/2Fiq2YP. "When I consume more slowly and intentionally  it can restore something lost by the pace of modern life. It can put me back in touch with the world  or myself.". There were a lot of seasoned voices there calling for us to pay attention to the new ones and that's important.. It's still basically winter but it never hurts to be prepared.. Funky in the best possible way.. Here's to the greatest of all time.. If you ask me there's no such thing as too much coffee.. Consuming media changes when *everyone* is a critic.. It's not weird.. Preparing for next awards season.. The Oscars tonight were just further proof.. It's time for the truth.
welcome to the Dolce &amp; Cabana what do you think of the concept of being iconic I appreciate the concept it's something I certainly have never considered or ever thought that anyone would turn back on me having inspiration or having like something to look up to I think it doesn't just mean you want to be that but I do think it's about appreciation and finding like your own way to feel beautiful is important just wearing red lipstick make you feel powerful or maybe I should ask when you feel most powerful I think I feel most powerful my son actually does what I ask him to do we've done in a white denim I do not discriminate sweatpants are sweating neither neither my love to say neither yeah you can lipstick or chapstick so I feel like you're really good at cuffing sleeves and pants and stuff thanks man oh maybe maybe we can do like a quick how to paddle yeah how to come so the thing I see that people do that I always think is really wrong as this is the absolute no no don't to you ever seen that and then when it hangs it hangs like a like a - not so sheep and like this not okay even that not okay this is our trick and I can't believe I'm sharing this with all of you but so you pull the cup all the way up and then you roll it from the bottom and let that move so what happens that pulls the shirt down tight here and then it gives you a little cup and then you get a little twist at the end and we're going to do who could put on lipstick better without a mirror I can put it lipstick really well without a mirror oh I bet I can take your eyes do that well I have lipstick on and I bet I could kick your ass I don't know maybe are you really good at it no I'm terrible at it's gonna be awesome this is a lipstick application contest no mirrors just faces and hands ready to this set okay I'm done whoops get that girl Amir how'd I do oh not look good I see reflecting and I do not like it 
so I'm curious about whether or not you have style tips for women who are trying to find their style I feel like the concept of figuring out who you are in terms of fashion has become such a packaged and meditate identity in 2015 yeah I've always tried to wear what suited me but I don't think I ever evolved into a different style I think what suited me when I was five I still look the same I mean have photographs where I still have looked the same I guess I'm just so curious about how someone arrives at the destination of knowing what suits them I think just you walk outside and you feel comfortable and I think you have to be conscious of what you look good in yeah I feel like my sense of whether or not I'm dressing like me always comes if I leave home and don't want to go back and change exactly yeah of course you feel comfortable and you just feel confident if somebody actually asked me well how did you get to the gray hair and the glasses you know I inherited the gray hair I just got it I didn't ever want to dye my hair and I wear glasses because I can't see so it's it's not as if I chose this look it kind of chose me I think I totally just figured out your style you're very very honest and that's why you're capable of knowing yourself and you're dressing yourself yeah yeah no I'm nothing if not honest I I just can't bear to lie that stuff just it's it's like I don't ever want to be a fraud mmm you know that's scary to me so you recently released a fragrance under your label Roden right yes can you tell me a tiny bit about it yes it's a fragrance that I actually made it came out last May but too very little we didn't do much of a push and it's an ode to my mom it's coming up this Mother's Day for real and it's really just how my mother smelled kid I don't know what perfume she wore but I do know how she smells so I worked kind of verbally with my perfumer david muntz and we we really got it building out your own beauty label is such a cumbersome task and you've done it so phenomenally you are now a partner with Estee Lauder can you talk to me a little about the process and maybe give some advice to pretty young things trying to build their own businesses well I think I wouldn't have been able to do this when I was a pretty young thing because I were pretty moderately aged yes to build their own business well I think it was necessity and I wanted something for myself so that was the driving force right but I never saw it as a business and I think if I had envisioned where I am now I would have just stopped dead in my tracks you would have been way to over well Harold I see yeah do you feel like you look at big picture now or you still try to take every day as it comes I yeah every day as it comes I've never had a plan in my life yeah so this is not a new way of operating it didn't fall into my lap but once I made one thing and I saw that you know I would give it to models in here this is everybody loved it and I thought oh so maybe now I'm gonna make it still wasn't on the business trail but I said I'm gonna make a body oil because I need that too so I made products out of necessity but I never saw the big picture and I think when I heard that people loved it Wow so I can't have this very unique point of view that's totally mine but other people find yeah wonderful that's a generous gesture it was and I was actually quite surprised and that gave me confidence and not that I would have changed it you know I would never do a focus group I'm not that type I don't want to know what everybody thinks cuz then you boil it down to nothing because you can never please everybody and I never wanted to be all things to all people in any aspect of my life that is very good advice also that when you get too many opinions it boils your product down to nothing yeah or you remember that or your life or anything you know you can't get so many opinions because then you've lost sight of what is meaningful to you people often ask me why haven't launched a clothing label and if I intend to and I'm like no I'm the only person who's gonna buy those clothes yes well you'd be so I would customize I was by them and harpy but when it comes to things like food or wine or clothes or I have anybody else know have you ever been married no have you ever told on your breth laptop almost for not to the altar and no wedding of what you were engaged for time I was thought this was going to be that would be the next step in four different relationships and I just said to myself I know it's pretty funny I may be a relationship regrets um no I had a great time with the people I was with and I have no regrets about not being with them or being with them or you know but I I'm not I'm a loner anyway so I don't unless I lived in a house that had two wings I wouldn't be able to manage it anyhow so it was nothing that ever really I never got on board with that's so inspiring for so many women who spend the majority of their 20s in pursuit of the perfect man oh well that doesn't exist anyway so that's you know do you have three pieces of advice that you wish you could give to your formal performer self that maybe people watching this video can reap the benefits of I wish I had a bit more confident as a teenager but I think we all have peer pressure I think that's almost unbuttons also does come of age absolutely level of seasonality yes and knowledge I mean you don't know everything I mean I don't I love learning things I mean it's fascinating and just sticking to your guns you know just not being swayed by things that like why did everything listen to it personal which also comes with confidence right yeah and I think that's just layers of living you 
your hygiene formula seems really similar to mine it's just like if I can shower in it I'll wear it don't shave yes I I have deodorant can't tell you last time I used it yellows him yes I just have been hydrating I scared I tell you and very agitated so do you for someone who just came off a plane no thank you can you believe it we're sitting here with scissor with heat I mean um so it's an acronym it stands first Arvin's exact a lots part of this came off of it what's derived from the sipping rava bath so every letter stands for like a meaning of self so S stands for savior sovereign and then you have zigzag Zig which is enlightenment of oneself and Allah the most high that's the a so you grew up Muslim Orthodox yeah is that a thing there's like Orthodoxy in Islam I just I mean there's like the Nation of Islam there's Sunni Frank they're just they're a little different like the Nation of Islam I think because my parents are African American and I guess my dad always went to like me differentiate from like the difference between the nation and Orthodox Islam because they're very different I'm so interested in compelled by what I read about you're feeling bullied after 9/11 yeah is that you felt less comfortable being identified as a Muslim person absolutely I think just as a kid just being like insecure and how old were you all right this was seventh grade I want to say so we're kids just like calling you terrorist and say like my mom said that your dad probably blew up the twin towers or whatever yeah like just even just like petty stuff like calling me Arabian night like just foolish nonsense and like my dad's mosque was going through a lot and you know it just caught it got it got weird and I felt like I was already getting picked on for other reasons completely outside of my religion and and I just didn't want anything else I couldn't take another reason so I just and it was weird because I think me and my dad were going through something too at the same time and I directly associated Islam with my father so and then it just things just got very strange so I think I just kind of walked away from myself and then walked away from my dad for a little bit and I just want to blend in like Superbad oh yeah you know I think that that's the experience for a lot of young girls yeah and it's so hard for them to understand or to actually like come to the point of realization that all other girls go through that all these women that they idolized went through the same exact thing like what else what do you feel like oh god are you kidding I got picked on for everything I got girls we'll wait outside to jump me they would follow me all the way home my dad would be outside waiting because he knew that there were a crowd of girls and I also think I've always been a little different like my parents are super conservative in a like just a traditional way so like my music choice has been super like whatever my parents was at the time so it's Coltrane and Miles Davis like my only plug - what was contemporary and in was like my neighbor Ashley who ended up being my best friend but she listened to like alia and my sister my older sister listened to cash money and looting but other than listening to that on the outside like that wasn't I never had a real connection to like what was hip what was now what was happening like my parents and let me watch like MTV or like I had to go to Ashley's house to go watch those things now you know when I parent to be asleep and we watch videos or whatever but it was just a different experience so it's like as a kid like you wanna you want to be down you want to be you want to be well-versed in pop culture you want to be able to talk about Big E and and connect to alia and as I cannot just you one I was in another place yeah I wanted to enter like same I just wanted to I wanted to feel like I could chat at the lunch table about something yeah so I feel accepted yes absolutely do your parents support your career trajectory um they do now yes they do they were in it some time yeah for sure it definitely just took me to just do what I wanted to do and piss them off a lot I think it took them to come to a show I mean the first thing I think when they really started to like feel me was when I did that Apple store I did like this Apple in-store thing and all these kids came like all these people came and I was super just like I want to cancel it before cuz I was like no one's gonna come this is gonna be embarrassing I don't want to do this my parents are here and all these people came and I sang like a couple songs and talk to these kids I'm like my mom was just like super like emotional and like even for me was the first time that I felt like like on my coast like where I live that like kids like don't hate me they know who I am they care they're like sweet about it so for my parents I think it was just crazy for them to like to know like what I went through in high school and when I went through a middle school and like almost like not having any friends until like adulthood no like core homegirls until I was an adult so for them they're just like I'm so stoked that people with you like it's such an it's such a dope opportunity and it's so I'm so excited that you get to be yourself finally and not I have to like pay a price for that yeah I was afraid of letting go in the booth or in the studio or around anybody else on stage I feel like I'm by myself so it's like I might as well be a hundred percent by myself blacked out I usually don't remember most of the randomness that happens on stage but I don't know it's like in a room full of ten people I don't know I don't know if I'm busy apologizing to be me or I'm just into just being a musician into being an artist so I think this winter when I just started like being like no I can channel the I can do that like I can create this moment again and again and then try to channel into my music and that's when I realize I'm in love like I need to do this all the time I want to get better and now where I want to be and then you know when you have that urge to grow in it you know you love it cuz you want to just like perfect it you want to master it you don't I care way more than I did before I haven't put out music and so long this is literally all I can do like this is who I am this is just my body when music comes on I can be by myself in a room at home I will dance like I'm just that I'm a mover I want to I want to flail I jump around in my house like I'm at the ballet like it's just what makes me happy 
I really like our guest today because she's one of my really close friends her name is Rosie azulon you're probably familiar with her big-ass billowy well I guess Billy's not the word but her big-ass silk file tops and even bigger pants made for women who are hitting any inflection point of life be it puberty adulthood pregnancy her period transgender Ness your for every woman Rosie because they think I saw a guy in these in these in the jasmine dance we went to Miami South Beach one white and mine white it probably was him where no was I knew the guy he was them do you feel like this is strange because we're actually a friend so you're like knowing my on-camera persona not knowing no this is you month with you all day I lied to them this is this is legit your clothing emits this sense of like urgency and necessity yes but it's also like frivolous in this really beautiful fanciful way and resort seems like a good season to launch for specifically a brand like Rosie well so why did you launch well there's so many reasons we had we ran out of Iran out of excuses not to you guys were bullying me and it was mean it was rude it deserved it you deserved it how do you feel seven seasons integrate and and just it's nervous and excited about happy part of it and also you know we'll see what happens like I've no I still feel the same way where I hope we get to do it again next season and I hope we get to keep going but we're small like we're small you're like a little baby you're a little jewel we're a little baby drool I hope well I guess the goal is kind of to make it continue to feel like it's a jewel right it's a small jewel even though it's not we're small so we can't be everything to everybody that's doing everything that's the genius of Rosie as all this glamorous clothing that's actually utilitarian that's the whole vault and hunt I could unite two functions in your oh for sure panting there should be a back tab hot pocket - cuz these are kind of cute just for like finger warmers no crumbs clink Ruth but I'm sorry though back to the balloon top yeah who are you thinking of when you first built that top myself that's what that's all you wanted to wear pretty much the entire first season was just like Rosie telling us all the things I always wanted maybe not just to wear but to see and you know we tried we tried you know you don't always get there but we tried to go for it I still look at that season the first season and I say basically we're doing reiterations of everything we did there I think it's like Mad Libs adjective-noun for we're pretty much doing it that's that's a really good analogy just came up with those good ones I'm gonna use then could we can we talk about your girl for a minute and what kind of woman you you hate that you hate when people say stuff like that yeah well then I guess that's kind of telling about who she is I feel like even like when we do our casting I like what kind of girl we don't have there's no kind of girl I don't know who that is where's their kind of girl you're not it do you want to be feeling like anybody's putting you in a box into it there's this sense of an appreciation for fashion that doesn't minimize intellect right it's like exactly what I hope Man Repeller does nice that's a nice compliment that you just gave me myself for you no question she's like that's so cute I gotta taste it all no one likes you man you know what you're trying to do and what I'm trying to do is kind of the same I think that it's very much about this dynamic relationship with what's going on and present and sort of being involved in your environment and being sort of alive and excited and curious about things so that's I guess if ever we were baking off a girl that's that type of girl sort of still curious and so once that fun but still has stuff to do and get down against does it make you feel like you've succeeded or uncomfortable and you see knock-offs because whether or not you want to admit it to the boner moving doesn't bother I I think everybody has to experience it and bind to it where they can none of a bit of F stuff is you know all made in New York really expensive fabrics you know quality is unbelievable and so but um you know it's not everybody could buy into it and they totally get that and fashion is not about I mean there's so I mean I hate making this fashion it's not about statements but it's not just about a price point it's not just about a luxury consumer it's about form of expression not everybody can everybody can use that you know how are they fine then they'll really get what dude what have you found to be the most challenging element of building a business it's not having that crystal ball no one was gonna have them no one has it but like you kind of wish you knew so you can make the smart decision now and you're like if I could make the smart decision now what would it be you know and we're so fortunate great opportunities come over you know and we we want to make the right choices with them it's just trying to make the right choices and still be true to yourself and go with your instinct and then not want to kick yourself in the pan for not taking opportunities when you say true to yourself what do you mean like what it's amounted to water it's like a muscle - it's like a muscles like that insulated it's everything doesn't feel right or not yeah that's the whole thing do you think that all designers should go into business or all aspiring designers should go into business hmm I don't know what you mean by that like it if you want to do it should you do it should you go for it if you can't push it down and trying to push it down means trying to stay in a bit and shut the windows and close the doors and not feel life because you're afraid that you're gonna and yes you should do it I like asking that question because it's interesting to hear what kind of advice people would give to themselves not even just themselves but people going through stuff like if Man Repeller had it worked out for me and I needed to figure something else out how would I reacted I wouldn't have been like Leandra you're so stupid why'd you do that my ego was so big and I was so like ignorant ignorant I mean I still am a narcissist but I was so yeah I was very naive and so I feel like I would have been like okay this wasn't the way to show your name in the light no it wasn't about shine your name I don't see I don't think that that's true that's the other thing that's funny is that I don't think that you're trying to make women feel like they're the only woman in the room either but it happens it just happened really mm-hmm if someone was being introduced to the label and they were all right ro/di by one of eyeing one really good thing kind of her self sounds like Rosie I love your clothes I'm only buying one piece this is my gateway drug oh that is my joint can we drugs yet but which one do you looking for and who do you want which piece do you think I should buy for you oh no one piece for you okay fine cuz I stated burbs on me I really like it I guess I don't know also my sister just texted me about it it's very flattered it is very flattering so I like when people say I like when people feel flat everybody clothing that's like the greatest compliment you could feel okay like anyway here's the item that I would recommend anyone trying to forge their way into the Rosalind brand oh I would probably have them buy it one of the jackets because I think that you get the best juice out of the jacket like probably one of the jean jackets that are actually made in linen or so class right as you can wear so many different types of weight yeah there's no wrong way to look better than these I love the money I like jackets and the double breasteses are my breakfast to type of Brooks this is good I'm a brekkie what else Lee is it okay

at the weekend I was in Philadelphia and I went into a thrift store and I got a blouse for $18 and it's literally perfect I love it is it literally perfect yeah literally literally would you literally literally perfect I had I had a very difficult time with that word this morning while I was writing cuz I wrote lived you already right now this morning hmm I wrote literally and I meant it literally and I just thought to myself I can I literally can no longer use the word literally because it's never used literally oh my god you're Carrie Bradshaw right now you're Carrie Bradshaw ring out you know when you're on a plane anyway you're already emotionally vulnerable but there's something about being suspended oh is a thing oh but wait tell me about that's just your tear ducts are being squeezed more or what does the altitude makes you actually have an emotional reaction to being so high in the air like the air pressure is not natural and something happens with your hormone levels and you become super sensitive also even though it's quite normal to we've all accepted that that's people get on planes now it's still weird that you're putting your life in someone else's hands and you're just following the crap you're just sitting there like sardines yeah you're just sitting there like sour sardines traveling through the air yeah it's unnatural in the cockpit it's called a cockpit yeah still budget cooks so many Cox intimate yeah and they're all the Humber hit that is really fun right it's a weird thing cockpit yeah it's like the best English Insull ever like this is Captain Charles reporting from the cockpit yeah and that's a porno waiting to happen or some Richard Dickey its dick dick from the cockpit here do you travel a lot you put you fly a lot don't you have you figured out a formula to get through the airport to look nice in an airport also not hold up the queue when you're taking off you're like me hi lace up boots yes slippers always yeah like those Gucci first slippers have been a great I can't keep those things on my feet you can't oh I just in the apartment yeah I can't do it I have to walk my toes upgoing at this this doesn't oh that's good travel shoes cuz they're quick on and off and do you get changed on the plane into like a if I'm traveling a really far distance yeah or I'll just wear athleisure on my place I don't know leggings athleisure leisure like you had a pleasure athleisure yeah mmm do you have a system no but sometimes sometimes I like to look weird in an airport like because I think I love airport outfits I love watching people because it's the best people watching you can do yeah there's people from everywhere going and you like to imagine their stories so then I like to think that lots are like look over and be like wonder where she's going I trying to spell it out so what why did like a traditional arrow bikini no I don't have a typical one I don't know it depends sometimes I wear something completely impractical one time I wore hot pants um from London to New York and then there was a journalist on the plane and she wrote about how I wore hot pants even on the plane and then I felt silly for wearing hot pants meaning like really high waist tight shorts yeah from you and those all the time I do hate wearing trousers I hate pants so much why I don't know I just think legs are cooler no no they are I'm just wondering what you do in winter it's hard I wear these I like jeans high waist jeans how do you look nice in winter how do I look yeah winter generally speaking yeah like do you go into the sleeping bag coat zone come March or are you just in layers of fur and nice things I know I try to make myself feel good March is a difficult month for me here's my theory is that when I can't make the choice I feel like I'm being imprisoned by climatic circumstances and then I get depressed so I have to triumph I think hair has a lot to do with how nice you dip in winter well I tweeted before coming here that we were doing this and asked Twitter if they had any questions and like 15 people said how does she get that hair that's so weird cuz I have literally three strands of hair on my head and I spend my whole day looking at people with nice thick luscious hair and getting really sad and jelly looks thick you know how half kids have really good hair because it's so tiny it's so thin that it goes must up really quickly and it does this thing nice thing in the Sun I've got kid hair so it looks deceptively okay but actually in reality it's it's I'm a balding woman I did a whole show yesterday my boyfriend before I left the house where I was putting on the layers of manly clothes I was about to worth the day and then I like ran back and I was like the sexy rock sack and then I walked back in they came back him with the hat I was like and the PS took resistance now I am a full man I was like boys won't whistle wolf or otherwise see you later wait oh can we talk about the app a little bit I'm curious about why you decided to launch what your favorite part of it is I just like learning things and I don't really know that there's like a big reason where I was like I have to make this thing it was just something I was thinking about you know I love fashion and I love Instagram and I love lurking on other people's you know sites and looking at what they are wearing but personally I don't feel that comfortable sharing my style on that social outlet I thought there could be a different place and that perhaps it could be linked to online shopping my original idea was that it could be sort of incentivized in a way like you get tokens you could then spend or some kind of gamification of that and at the same time the Norwegian office was setting up something similar and I was approached by them to join forces and I just really liked the team and I really liked the idea and it just seemed like a challenge and something I can learn about I still feel like I didn't go to university so most of the jobs I take on have some element of education do you ever feel uninspired when you look at your clothes and how do you remedy that we were talking about that with the weather right I absolutely do I absolutely do but I think um it's just about sometimes that's when like investing in something or buying something from a thrift shop or even like getting a weird straw bag or something it's about context right so if you bring something new into that environment then suddenly all the other things look different again because when I have a new thing say I bought a spaghetti strapp silk top from Isabel Marant and when I went into the into my room and then I was like ah this could go with this and listen and suddenly it's about a jigsaw that comes to life right someone wants to know what your recipe for success is well it depends what what you how you quantify success I guess it's personal how do you quantify success I just like to be creatively fulfilled I realized it's not necessarily the pursuit of money or status things it's more like what interests me and does it because my brain I get so bored so easily that I know I get depressed if I'm not being stimulated right how many poses do you think I've assumed sweets a lot there's a lot you could speed through the footage and I'm pretty sure I'm in this starts the entire time and you're like throwing shape I haven't done a headstand there's time out 
hey it's Leandre but you already knew that we're back in Washington Square Park today asking people about the concept of perfectionism you might remember the last time we were here we asked people to ask me for free advice today we're here in partnership with a spree and celebrating the launch of their recent campaign called hashtag I'm perfect so let's hop to it do you ever look in the mirror and think like damn - perfect and what is that really like this is my perfectionism or this is my perfect face yeah that's a good one when people first think of the word perfect they think of someone who's like the model model person their main aspiration and but for me I think perfect is someone who is able to do the best that they can do for themselves and they're their own model have you ever heard the quote nobody's perfect I'm nobody therefore I'm perfect I love that though you can use it you're welcome back I feel perfect when I don't feel a need to appear perfect for anyone else I feel perfect when I'm taking care of myself when I'm eating well and exercising and getting what I getting done what I need to do and not putting up some kind of front to make others happy if you had to define all of this stuff about perfectionism that we're talking about in a single hand gesture what would that hand gesture look like it could be anything from like I guess it would be like oh say you're giving advice to the ladies out there who are in pursuit of perfectionism what are you saying to each and every one of them to ensure them that they are beautiful just the way they are um I would say be be absolutely comfortable with what you do what you say what you think don't like pulled my hair out of your mouth it's absolutely and regardless of where you are who you're with pull all of the hair that's stuffed into your mouth out of it are there any perfect figures in your life any role models any people who gave birth to you yeah I'd say my mom is perfect what makes her perfect she's faced a lot of hardships in her career path but um now she's doing what she loves and she's loving it and loving me and my siblings at the same time and yeah just doing everything well and she's happy too is that what you aspire towards yourself yeah I I want a family and a career that makes me happy and being able to do it all at the same time I'd say that's yeah that's what I want me to want to do together yeah it's such a great idea right yeah what does a perfect outfit look like perfect outfit is the one that you get up in the morning and you feel like wearing it no matter how ridiculous it looks but the other you're happy with it he always tells me I look literally close and I don't care I just do just think you know what everybody else does anyone well that about settles it no one is perfect but you and why because you define perfect by your standards you 
my mother-in-law like when I first came to visit she was like wow Dean's last girlfriend looked like Angelina Jolie but you make him laugh Oh so how long after you got married or maybe you weren't married yet was Marcel the shell born we had been together maybe three years mm-hmm we made Marcel you know do you have a lot of people that try to talk to you in Marcel's voice know that a lot of people asked me to do it and then I don't mind it at all but it's like that was oh my god Marcel's here I think it's probably the best thing that's happened to YouTube since soon I don't know jumping cats I don't see anything I mean no I think the Internet is very vast and I feel intimidated by it iris apfel doesn't use the internet either I'm sure she doesn't I mean like sometimes it bothers me like my mom really doesn't use the internet and like is the kind of person that's like well I couldn't get my email up because it was Sunday and you're just like no it's completely false last week my mom asked me why her iCloud wouldn't let her talk to my grandma recently I was in an airport and like I knew that the seats on this plane were like they were getting like thought up and the guy that was doing my you know transaction was like hold on I'm sorry I'm waiting for my computer to boot up but or not no it doesn't no it isn't like why was your computer off never turn your computer off also what does it mean for it to boot up nothing it means you are in 1993 I have a new bit that I think I want to do this week about one time when I was convinced that working out pound hurts my vagina and then feels that I just had my thong on backwards I thought I was working out it was like no you're strong he's smoked so much weed and wear your underpants backwards to the gym it is that's why I don't want thongs cuz I never ever I hate flossing my teeth so why would I want to floss between my butt cheeks I don't like how they call me right not that I don't like how my butt looks I think it looks cool but I just think they're like silly I had like a bad move y2k era and bellybutton Sears oh you did and that was like very so how many years in a row where you bring these videos for Halloween subsequently you were saying before that a lot of people come to you for advice about being a comedian and then it's kind of difficult to give that advice you know all the advice that I really want to give always sounds so cliche right talk about yourself you know if you feel like you're telling a lie you shouldn't didn't do it those aren't fishes for a reason feel really really true every time in my work I felt like I'm really pushing it and it doesn't feel right it's always been not right you just have to have the faith in yourself that it's okay to have like a complex experience and that you have the ability to be thoughtful about yourself the person that you've known for long oh I love that yeah so at the end of these interviews I like to have the talent in question teach me something that they're really good at oh okay I've got a good oh it's it's just in it's just in there nope mm-hmm I can't do it hi I'm Marcel 
do you around any day not particularly why not seems very forced I think I kind of agree with you because we've never really celebrated Valentine's I had we're actually canceled on me twice two years in a row well one time you try to take you to a restaurant that you used to frequent with your ex-girlfriend not ex-girlfriend I went on dates there are various that I graduate this restaurant but it's a really good restaurant it was rather you remember exactly I'm talking about sure but that's why you cancel fashion but not when did you know that you loved me probably when we first started dating again we got back together whoa I am I love joy like a week ago okay seriously come on I figured it out when you were putting that cream on my back for my fungus and I was like gosh I can't do this for me and it's still one of procreate that's how I know it's real baby how did we meet we met on Facebook no I stopped you on Facebook but never really how we met randomly is doesn't meeting cross paths at a Halloween party in Chelsea yeah and where I think I spotted probably spotted a friend and then did you spawn her thinking damn I'm gonna piece it at no no then I went spotted her friend and I think what what worked for us right off the bat was the hello that he gave me and how warm it was and how I'm precipitated and can you reenact about that hello do you remember what is like oh really so I'm like that's good you should do that more often yeah I should try that on Anna Wintour I love you attitude what do you find to be my most man repelling garment I actually don't know this not right now I have to think I have to think about all your literally going through your closet right now I think I know you hate all my baggy jeans so much I don't like the boyfriend jeans anymore they're not boyfriend jeans their husband people husband jeans their brother jeggings I don't want the boyfriend jeans with the stiletto heel like that look I don't even know if you wear that that's such a good look Oh what what don't you like about it I'm just I'm very curious could it feel like if you're skinny like in in the wide Jean skinny heel it just there's so much floating you got radiant balance I personally like tighter pants you know I feel comfortable for you it's perfectly fine that my legs are just floating yeah in a way I understand if your mom comes home I would be uncomfortable about wearing that and I know that's what I don't want and I would be uncomfortable if I were wearing women's jeans as a man really very very skinny jeans what's so comfortable about them you've got a caddy but there's enough room there so what's your favorite thing that I wear like if you could dress me what would you put on me formal or informal I like when you dress up for four occasions you do you wear designer whatnot hey man I would what is it like that we like really went to China day when you drag out the lien yes good there's some sort of crop or kind of stomach her back or whatnot a beautiful sea like a bottomer of showing skin and a beautiful flowing bottom how you find that more comfortable than Oh largely better yeah I mean while I can we're ready you know we're dressed up ready to go to wedding or something yeah because they're mine Dumars yeah yeah I like when you're in that oversized rose white sweater and packable jeans do I don't have the real thing that sweater everyone another date do you think that when we go out for dinner it's still dates no I don't want to fake my preference you just covered in your over for dinner I know but I like what we call it a date because then I feel like you have to talk to me how longer supposed to look at your phone and feeling lazy my phone did I don't know anybody who goes to Mykonos yeah and isn't been every night at 10:00 p.m. except for us we're not a creep man crazy days though Pelican watching know what I do like summer vacation what I know enjoy no I don't regret I'm just saying I was expecting like I was expecting this day like have some cocktails and dance and Islands our own table but I'm not the drinker so I know I know I'm just saying that I find it unusual that my parents had a more robust social experience did you keep using robust too much oh it's not supposed to use like that I'm turning out to be a non robust evening this is nice yeah since this is the number of us this may is the opposite of robust I'm gonna robust you ass cheek Oh 
where did you think you would be I thought I would be in medical school right now huh yeah what kind of doctor did you want to be maybe attrition of course Karlie Kloss wanted to pediatrician I kind of wear a lot of hats like I I don't and I also don't like to be kind of judged for being one thing yeah if I were a Karlie Kloss such a fun thought just like add another foot to your body as a fan you're mounting pants all together I would definitely never wear pants after I did that when people asked what I did I would probably be like well I have a voice because of my work in fashion but I'm a philanthropic we charged businesswoman who eats a lot of cookies that's that's what I'd go it I should've said that on like a business card you should or make it like not your tinder bio but your Instagram is so bio oh yeah my career in fashion is funny enough kind of happened slightly accidentally I was 15 and I and I kind of had this opportunity to walk in a show for New York Fashion Week mission of Calvin Klein and that was really real that's a dream that's real are you Francisco yeah Wow I owe it all to him I really do but he took a chance on me and I came to New York actually the exact week that I started high school so in Monday was my first day of freshman year so I'm like figuring out the school like the layout figuring out where my locker is like a total normal freshman girl and then by Wednesday I get this call that's like you come to New York it's either like now or never there's this opportunity they really want to meet you there's a chance you could come to New York and it doesn't work and you just go back home and then you're back at school on Monday you know I've recognize that like through this kind of journey and career that I'm on there's so much opportunity that kind of it's what you do with it I think really that makes that makes the difference in matters at the end of the day and whether that's building a business or making like meaningful impact in the world you know I think with like having a platform and having a voice comes like I don't know what I think comes a bit of responsibility with that you know I use this job is my key to the world you know what's really interesting also is that because of social media we really are living through the era of the person as publisher so I don't think it would be far-fetched to say that Karlie Kloss is a media brand especially because of your YouTube channel and the work you do with code with Carly and all of this fun stuff that you have slated as a model you're typically seen and not hurt or faced that's historically been the case the power is democratized in a way that is really interesting and exciting because it's like somebody with a great voice and a great idea and perspective can build can be a media Titan and and can reach more people than then you know some of the most iconic publications and so it's it's this really interesting shift that I think you and I both have been in the industry through and I feel really lucky because I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity that comes with it let's talk a little bit about Swarovski I feel like it's a brand that I have had the privilege to wear for a long time and even before my fashion career I know some of my first like special pieces of jewelry were from Swarovski and I remember my grandmother gave me a necklace after a ballet recital you know I think jewelry is like a super personal thing it's like you're yeah like it's good news that's how I inori's unique stories it's it's it's part of you and if somebody really special it gives you something it has even more value and so when they approached me about working together I was really excited and and it's been fun because it's not just me showing up and being in the pictures but I've really been able to be a part of the creation process and to create new content for coffee and make videos and you know they they're really clever about kind of storytelling and I really am excited to be a part of that storytelling certainly doesn't hurt that Nadia Swarovski's like the original leaner inner Jesus I'm only the original - such a career oh I'm sorry Harry career Oh usually at the end of these episodes I like for the talent that's you to teach us one of their skills and so I think that your skill is totally the crosswalk so are you gonna teach me how to walk like a model I want to walk like a rowdy flash how they change out of my slippers here okay keep on supers um I will teach you how to class walk which I we got a coin that that's great you know look before I show you what I think that I'm doing or like what I think about when I walk down a runway I'd love to like see what you think be my mirror image like show me what do I look like measure okay this ought to be good we're done okay action I'm about to do the Carly crosswalk oh well you got move for just around the same height oh yeah our body mass index is pretty similar it is the most amazing thing that I can make a career out of walking so I just in my mind always thought all right I don't want to mess this up I'm gonna walk this is like a job so I'm gonna do it the best I can and I saw all these like a girls stoic face too but I always watched all the other models and I always like thought okay so they're like very focused I'll just do what they do and I always in my mind think that I'm just copying everybody else and like if it's a show where it's all about like confidence and like sexy lady and like you know be be a character or like if there's something to it then I always kind of give it a little extra pep in my step now that one's I focus straight at the end there's usually a wall of cameras and I kind of just find one and keep my focus on it and that lucky videographer haha and it helps me to to kind of just like zone zone in I think left foot right foot and kind of a little I guess I definitely do have a little bit of a little sway or swag and there's something happening with you shoulders all - wow she's like she creates an air left leg first mm-hmm yes like nothing really happened with your shoulders that's been a figment of my imagination this whole time and now hearing that it's all really nice having their amazing you're hired I'm practically Carla close by 
all right she recording say these are the flowers office it's better without flowers right three flowers are enough you don't need those if they fly down you jump down to pick them yeah now introduce yourself say I'm Leila Medina i'm laila mehdin so thank you for telling me who I am I warn you by the way I'm Laura Medina and you Mary tell us mom the rigid Commission today we're talking about why we love Mother's Day I love Mother's Day you know when everybody appreciates some others I personally love Mother's Day because it reminds me that I don't have children what the hell I have children why maybe I'll start with triplets or something yeah maybe I'll start with triple exes and get it over with so you're the million dollar question mom how's your favorite kid oh I love you all the same I really do I have a different relationship with every kid who can look like that doesn't mean which finger do one level to know which finger I I personally I would love to cut this one this one and cuz I look at the real yeah right but um I would never do that because I don't have acted very many 9 yes it's it's own so now now that Mother's Day is coming up and you both have offspring and offspring once removed or twice removed why can you talk can you speak to why you love being women I know it wasn't really your choice but now that you haven't you know I can I go where there's a woman so if I don't regret mango woman it means that I love mango also don't you find it really nice that like your nipples nurture life whereas men's nipples are basically futile what are your mother's day plans I have no specific plans but I'd love to have lunch with the entire family oh I'm busy sorry oh yeah okay what are you doing for Mother's Day I don't know am I invited I don't know you said you're visiting why would you be invited if your music because I always neat I don't like to be refused hmm she refused to refuse are you gonna are you anticipating any Mother's Day gift no yeah I am you are yeah well for like the feed from av do you think that do you think that Mother's days is a deserving holiday using it should exist before no of course it's a deserving holiday yeah you know what Mother's Day is overrated okay so you just saw that you love it so much but now that I'm learning about it it's just like I really every - okay I should be appreciated we do be a righteous woman and love it how do you feel that the fact that your children don't typically get you gifts I don't want gifts if I try these life is a game you all get together and have a meal together that's it tired I love gifts Journal grandma loves gets it I feel like I actually came out of grandma by osmosis happy Mother's Day Oh me like every time I see a ballsack I'm really happy that I'm a woman in ballsack super Wombles okay like testicle oh no no comments no okay you 
Oh girls music finale what do you think Fran for starters is majoring man but I don't like his haircut I just need to start with that okay that's good deed ya know I was thinking before I watch the episode is he do you remember the first season when Hannah was really jealous of the girl who'd she was in that writing on the chopper came about that I guess that reading and she was so jealous of this girl who'd experienced like terrible heartbreak and a dead parent and she was like you're so lucky yeah yeah and so all I'm attacking was that in the last three episodes she's gone through her version of a tragedy which is essentially that her father coming out and her mother losing it right and she hasn't so much as mentioned writing I know it seems like that's such an abandoned like pastime of hers dude I just I wonder if she I feel like she's on a moment old sabbatical from writing I thought about that too and they know that there's essentially can obviously shape like those who can't do teach which I don't agree with like but I feel like she's I feel like she's having like a full Hannah recharge yeah and that is really evolving it was so cool to why but I don't think that she's realizing yet that everything that's happening to her for once is actually like she's gonna finally be able to put it to use have something to say yeah a little issued for the first time it sort of seems like all of the girls are navigating adulthood except maybe Marnie but even she had her moment last night where she got on stage with her guitar and played without desi you know and as that was happening Jessa was like I'm gonna be a therapist and Shoshanna was like I'm gonna move to Japan and Hannah was like Adam why are you trying to get back together with me over a newborn Cabbage Patch Kid I was shouting at my TV this morning and that's this like if you take Adam back right now I will come through that screen and psych partner things or something yeah yeah I was proud of all of them but it almost it almost left me why don't we should get to the ending at the end but it almost left me an easy bet they all kind of had a bit of a bow right well do you yeah they would even even like the six months later it would like the perfect snow and Hannah Roxy I may be nervous I've never felt satisfied at the end of the season the shrimp did we we're only in season four I felt satisfied to know there's something about that satisfaction that made me uneasy because I'm used to girl with ending sort of with like a no you can't even find satisfaction in satisfaction no I survived I'm like Anna yeah oh my god Hoffman's dark nipple let's talk so much about Gaby Hoffmann first of all you know what I want to talk about is Adam walking into the bathroom and not feeling jarred by his naked sister I've been passed out in her Bush that one time when she broke the glass like he's had he's had many full frontal moments with his sister family yeah they were definitely naked house like an open door whooping house yeah Gaby Hoffman's my hero her character's insane really yeah that's what mattered I love you too I was wondering the whole time kind of championship I like that he needs to be a man if he's so sweet yeah but he's gonna be a father that seemed to be so uneasy though it's Hanna okay okay will you talk about that first of all the hyphens it's just I - Hannah yeah she's not oh not so the character deceased Feeny Rose she the New Age mimi-rose she may just want to be a therapist I loved that moment and Jess it was like they were just was if I had just obscene it with me I love that moment because I thought that it was gonna be really cliche and like as as soon as just so walked into the apartment with her having the baby I was like if it was justice grandma and I realized I got she she wants to be a doula to just like one more thing injustice throwing career and so then when she came home and said I'm gonna be a therapist I was like I did not see that coming about you're gonna be endure life well so I also really appreciated so Shauna's pursuit of Rae and not finding him and then coming upon this really prolific man in a bandana who was like are you familiar with Sheryl Sandberg this is your median moment you have to go to Japan though I do think that her boyfriend is kind of sweet but it is a strange ask right stay here stay in New York they'll hire you there was something yeah it was a strange s there was something weird and desperate about him saying I'm almost falling in love with you like normally that line is used I never heard that line before so that one got it to fall in love with you I think that line is used frequently in like very romantic situations it's just it's said in like I think I'm calling a monthly plan in love with you but like that is code for I'm falling in love with you ever I not freak you our day as opposed it is very technical finite on March 31st yeah I am sure that I will be in love with you I'm not sure if it'll at 9:00 p.m. or 9:00 a.m. but it will certainly happen yeah it's like that's um you it's like your 16th month review or something yeah and then that the fact that she's late for a moment was gonna hang on to that and of course she anyway yeah yeah but I thought I was really um I hope she goes to Tokyo I guess she can't I hope she doesn't go to Tokyo and then I mean that's what's hard about TV and frustrating is that these characters often get these really exciting opportunities like in almost every series I can ever think of they get these exciting opportunities you're so happy for the character selfishly you want them to not take it because you want to see them all the time but if they do take it then that's like their real character progressing in life but it never really happens like Hannah came back from Iowa Coach Taylor didn't take the job at the better University like it I don't know what's frustrating it so I just sort of like I'm sad already they know sure Charlotte's gonna come back you hope it's then unless she doesn't but if she does come back you hope it's not her the guy right does that never works out especially not when there's a date set for the love to happen when I so when I was watching last night with Edie he said that reads only bad quality is his affection for Marnie so um should we talk about that or is that a dead horse I don't know I I actually fell into his whole monologue - desi because I think it was the first time I think Frank puts up such a I mean I don't think that is like old man on the front porch shaking his fist as the facade I think that really is him but I think that when he's like super lame and gooey about Marnie who sucks I think that's like very real the me she doesn't suck right maybe there's something to Marnie that we're not quite seeing that ray is he I think he see me I think he sees a pretty girl and really him and I think he held on to that feeling that someone desperately needed him but who is who at the time was less obviously eating than Shoshana like she shot I needed him to but she's I think more independent than Marnie is in some ways I think that having this like total damsel in distress like game brain is sort of like fulfillment that he probably wouldn't otherwise seek or let himself feel in his normal state well I think the problem with Marnie rate is that she never Marnie right right in fact she never hits rock bottom she never allows herself to hit rock bottom and maybe that's because she's able to rely it's so comprehensively on her looks so she never actually learned the lesson right because she just powers her notice and sings a song yeah I really I was doing that she didn't did she have their except she had the curled hair and a smoky eye this time I did not know that does he wore eyeliner I never knew that that was something else happening on his face did you and just needs a sidebar for that I mean it doesn't surprise me I didn't I didn't even think about it as I watched he was wearing an artistically desperation aalverson of Marnie he's healed like the king of putting band-aids on wounds that need stitches Marnie's like trying to put God's bat pads on like gun wounds yeah does he's also like an anthropology in there CERN I really I wanna like I'm gonna look at my notes pause because I really was like I really was like oh actually we can stand Marty in this episode until she I wrote I feel bad for Marnie until she said I actually got my start as a solo artist flashback to her performance of was it Kanye West heartily yeah yeah better faster stronger and so started from the bottom now we're here that's Drake yeah I yell but like yes so her song is kind of like started from the bottom it's still here huh still here although I guess she stopped so I guess this is not even to help our conversation but I always have a hard time with music in TV shows too because I have to respect that like okay someone had they're writing a song for this TV show that's probably really hard because you probably told you right like a mediocre song that theoretically could be on the radio that isn't awesome but like that's I don't know that goes back to our conversation about perfection but that kind of booing I did the whole time I was trying to think is this supposed to be a good song or is this a good song like like if Marnie's supposed to be good at this or she was the kind of mother who said also yeah a B and I when we were watching last night I guess had very opposing opinions where he was like the block am i explosive and I don't want to get through this I don't want to keep watching this I want to fast-forward it her song felt such bad secondhand embarrassment that he covered his face in a pillow that was the first time I didn't get secondhand embarrassed and I ain't really watching cuz I was on my computer and taking notes and I was just listening and I was like this is fine I don't feel uncomfortable if I heard this on the radio it's like the little black dress equivalent revi of a song I don't think anything about it do you like a witness right now yeah it was actually this money safe secondhand garrison is clearly the first time that Marnie has been on stage that I wasn't cringing early had to leave the room or like to get an awkward position on my couch do you think that's telling them anything they must be I think it was I think it was actually a pretty earnest performance yeah it was like the first time where she was performing like as a as a as yourself as herself and not like you know making googly eyes at desi but also I think the problem is that if that's her performing as herself do we really care to learn more about Marnie to be really care to continue watching her through cease it's because still as I felt every character progressing and reaching this sort of growth high it was frustrating that morgan's Barney's growth who's just this like silly acoustic guitar solo act with Ray Rock watching but she probably wouldn't have been able to execute if Ray wasn't there then afford been holding her hand anyway yeah do you think that they're gonna have sex by the way I can see that those like weird blank stares that they projected they're getting they're gonna have sex they're gonna do the sex and I think they're gonna think I'll do ii think i think she's gonna fall back to him but i hope she gives herself some time to be on her own has she ever i guess other than when she was like achingly from close charlie I don't think she's the kind of person who can aid with this Don around yeah any closing ideas any any projections for next season did you like this episode did you not like this episode I loved this episode I loved this season and I felt like this season I mean I think I mean anytime I have a discomfort with girls it's probably because it it's almost too close for comfort I mean the situations and the neighborhoods are and the people are so different from mine but I just feel like the thoughts that they go through it's just like that like mid-20 you struggling you probably think you know more than you know all at the same time feeling desperately like you don't know anything like we think that that hits close to home for all of yours which is why it's so uncomfortable seeing my look like shouting at my TV like what are you doing what are you thinking like this I was just sort of like yeah made that mistake yeah had that same thought with all the characters across the board well I think I'm just starting to feel like the show is actually called following a television for me like a TV show formula where there are characters and there's actual character development and you're not just watching this pendulum swinging both claims to watch it end up exactly where it started yeah which is really satisfying and I think goes back to that point that we were making earlier about I guess you're either on these but satisfaction but my my feeling like okay we're we're making progress we are on to something new Canon definitely is she has that light at the end where you are in the middle somewhere where that layered says like there she's like this is crazy and he's like it's not crazy it's happening and she was like it can still be crazy if it's happening like that's two people you like what crazy means yeah and I really like that book in the flavors it's about to sound like that sort of life like I think so many times especially things happen in here just like this happening to me this isn't happening to me this is insane this is insane you're like nope this is happening to me and it's insane and now I have to deal with it and get out of it it's so bad you think you're gonna make Darrin and you realize you're not you happen to me four times last week yeah then I have to touch my quickly legs to remind myself that I'm here in reality I mean impressive do you need me the foyer area further out of it my

I want you to know that now my boyfriend when like if I'm wearing a really cool pair of pants like high-waisted pants he's like nice man or a pillow nice how does Man Repeller become group approved if my boyfriend is referring to my clothes as man or power approved I think I'll take that we are largely here today because I want to talk a little bit about your perfume launch edition edition oh one winter we're being completely transparent about what's in it which for us is really important because the word fragrance companies can hide like thousands of ingredients and keep it as a proprietary secret but unfortunately it's come to mean that basically 99% of conventional fragrances and also if you see fragrance and home cleaning products or deodorant or anything it means that they can hide you know endocrine disrupting chemicals and carcinogens and they can put anything they want but would you feel the difference on your body I think it depends on the individual person I mean I notice in my life that the cleaner that I eat and the cleaner that my personal care products are the better that I feel but I do think that when you make an effort towards cleaning up your personal care routine and your what you're using in your home it does make a difference yeah do you drink a lot ah yes I do but you have something good yeah because of my products I swear by them I'm not kidding um this is such great news you can drink a lot and still look like one culture oh I try to eat organic food when I can and eat local food when I can and eat you know as little processed food as possible but sometimes you need a bag of Doritos and a beer and an airport or whatever you know so we have to be modern and easy on ourselves as well so when you launched goop was this always part of the plan it really started because my friends always called me to say like where should I eat here I'm going on this trip where am I going where am I staying where do I buy a vintage poster like anything and I was like I'm just going to put it all online so they can go and then I decided to do a newsletter and it was this tiny homespun thing and the response especially that New York Times piece I was like why is there a 4 or 6 page article like dissecting what I'm doing and being so critical it was actually fascinating like from a gender and sociological standpoint it was but how do you learn to like mute that noise and keep going I think you have to understand innately like who you are why you're here what you're here to do and stay so true to your course and your vision that all of that other stuff just becomes noise and I actually really like criticism when it's constructive and helpful and I love input but when somebody's coming to something with such a gender bias or with a bunch of projections of their like this to on to you it's like well there's no you know it just doesn't help me so I don't engage and I don't read it I don't um and I just stay really really true to my vision it's like I see a bull's eye way off in the future and I'm just like going for it do you feel like some of the criticism that you get is I don't know if the question is do you feel like it's warranted but how if ever do you respond to it we are trying specifically to ask questions move culture forward introduce topics and we press buttons and we do it sometimes we do it intentionally I mean the conscious uncoupling piece was the perfect example of that because I wanted to tell the story from us and I didn't want to you know give a quote to a magazine or something to announce it and I wanted to sort of say hey we have learned a really amazing way of doing this and our children are kind of unscathed that's far from that I'm sure we're skating them in other ways and the reaction was so bananas just like a bunch of projection where it's like if people feel you know in some way that they're being given information that's illuminating something that you know and especially if the if it makes them feel like they did it wrong which is never the intent or that there's a better way to do something I think people get mad about that unlike you don't tell me like you have a better way of doing something and fair enough but we just really wanted to say hey if anyone's interested this is this is working for us and then you see two years later you know it's become not something that people like joke about or they're like wow this actually works and you see other people doing it and talking about it you see it like being written about now in a much different way so so for me that arc is very important to keep in mind always especially at the beginning and I thought you're starting to have like very um thoughtful or meditated conversations with your daughter cuz 12 is is getting older oh my gosh how are you teaching her to be a woman I think that work ethic is everything so I think she sees work ethic and so she understands that and you know it's interesting I feel like they they're born there so who they are and by about the time they're like three years old you're sort of done in this weird way like they really are who they are and then they go through all of these changes and ups and downs but it they're kind of like you know pretty early I think that the more conscious you are about like what kind of person do I want to put into the world yeah when they go to college and the more you can keep that in your mind like in those tough moments it's been that's been really beneficial for me when you were pregnant were you a really clean eater also not at all I went from being completely macrobiotic I got pregnant with my daughter and if I smelled brown rice or salmon or vegetables I threw up yeah so the only thing I could eat was grilled swiss cheese sandwiches french fries jamocha almond fudge ice cream from baskin-robbins yogurt and apples what advice do you have for a woman who is trying to find her place in the world that's part one number two maybe launch a business well I think it's we're living in such a fascinating time to be a woman and I certainly don't think that our mothers felt all of this permission to be all of these things yet be them all at the same time and you know I think there's an always say like I feel that there's a new archetype being created for a woman which is that you can be incredibly intelligent and sexual and maternal and you know we're we're far more complex and we're allowed to be we've always been that complex mm-hmm but now we're allowed to be we have the license to and I and I see it in my daughter and her friend and that generation they are so integrated with who they are and they have this incredible strength and power and they don't they're not worrying about the same things in seventh grade that I was worrying about right and I think that's a byproduct of how far our culture is coming I think we still have a long way to go in terms of of women and but I think you know just be you just be the most integrated version of yourself possible and you're kind of fine like I wish I hadn't learned that past 40 you know I wish I had known that when I was 12 or 26 or whatever I had no concept I was constantly trying to be what I thought I was supposed to be and trying to fulfill somebody else's idea of who I was supposed to be and I think it's the same for starting in business it's like a lot of it is just self belief you know I think it's even for me with goop it took me a long time as I was saying to really decide to jump off the cliff because I knew I was gonna take a world of and you know I was like why I have a perfectly good day job like yeah why am i walking away from this okay well if I do the dirt cleanse Man Repeller is to take the for it not goop com

hi it's me Leandra Medine formerly of Azkaban if he likes my outfit in Bryant Park today we're in Washington Square Park offering free advice at the discounted rate of free reasons I believe I'm qualified to give free advice are this polo when have you ever had reason not to trust someone wearing a polo shoes on my feet which are fur-lined in spite of the 88 degree August day with which we have been blessed and finally these ice colored lenses because if you can't trust someone who's going to see the world through rose-colored lenses you can rest assure that someone in ice colored lenses is going to give it to you real welcome to the free advice station guys what can I help you with so we're kind of dressed casually right now but if we had to like jet to the white house how can we change up our looking apartments your route of the white house I needed a comfortable man shoe right not a hard bottom sheet not leather have you considered the pumps of Manolo Blahnik I did they're not flattering for size 12 D unless you're directly which there's nothing wrong with that um call me my girlfriends kind of crying but my friend wants to go out drinking tonight with me so I'm thinking if I should actually console her or just go get flat-out drunk for no reason you're probably not in the right relationship you should do her a service and let her know that she's breaking up with you I never actually thought about it that way oh my god I just I she needs to break up with me I can't thank you so much i wern't have known that I would have to do that right now you're welcome enjoy your eggs thank you so much they're well a few does a two you see that saving women one bag of eggs at a time what can I help you with well man me and Jamie are from Canada and she just moved to New York so what would be your best advice I would say get a tuna sandwich how young is too young to get like a car loan for a car what do you want a car for are you trying to escape of course what do I do if I go in for a hug and they just want to do a handshake I have to do this a lot with kissing because there's a lot of like double single triple happening and I never know if I'm supposed to go in for the figure skater triple or the standard one so you're coming in for the hug I'm going in for the handshake I would just say that you you are like fell swoop eat like all the way just go ahead not know now you're gonna come in half handshake path hug okay so why do that work yes perfect what do I do when I go out I don't know smarty pants I'm not what do you do in you uh you tell me mr. market research backpack man would you ever consider going to City Hall and changing your name to Mortimer I would not why doesn't my boyfriend text me back how long have you been dating 13 months and you're calling him a boyfriend in spite of the fact that he's not texting me back yes separate Willie do you see him every day how do you connect if he's not writing me back it's complicated I think this seems like a classic case a beautiful girl unaware of her beauty trapped in relationship with ugly man unaware of his ability to use opposable thumbs all he'll the woman with opposable thumbs and the ability to use them so if you have to prioritize your three favorite activities they would be sex than walking than talking exactly yes and in that order that's just tremendous ask not what the city can do for you but what I can do no but what fun can do for inside your pants ah okay interesting thank you do you know how to jump rope I know how I could probably do two two jumps like two jumps so if I were you I would aim toward ten get to ten and then and then 11 I'm planning to go on vacation soon I'm not quite sure where I should go you got any ideas well first things first vacation my friend is a state of mind yeah I should take off my shirt and suntan I would I get you look great that's right Aviv man I've got tried to be even a certain Jonas a quad why are you still here Leandre I have a little bit of a conundrum I'm not sure if I should take a train to New Jersey this evening or wait for my husband to leave at 4 o'clock and sidon Midtown traffic with him well Deandra what are the upsides of taking the train well you know if I take the train I'll have some time to myself I'll think about things I'll be able to talk to myself you know really narrate my dream sounds like we both know what you need to do I don't know what you're talking about if I were you and as fate and your life would have it I am you I would do neither of those things instead hop on a plane and head to oh my god I know where this is going Romania 
I counted my shoes this morning because I was feeling hell maybe 236 236 yeah and that's fantastic because that's one of the most important things that you have to like you know what why because you need a pair of shoes to leave your house yes that's a very good point uh-huh véra fashion is supposed to feel frivolous it's supposed to be this decadent release from reality everybody say so yeah three bullets goes really close to fashion and yeah it's not true it's for your everyday in life but so it's paradoxical because that frivolity is necessary it's necessary I seen three polity is necessary and anything I read somewhere that you were known for your exceptional personal style even before you launched her label and Diana Vreeland was sort of involved in your life that nobody loved was my mentor let's say because she's the one who gave me the idea to do what I'm doing did she say you can do it and because I wanted to look design materials fabrics and I went to Diana to tell her my plans and she said well how would you want to do that you were there do a small collection and do something with fashion but in a different way and she gave me the idea and she was fantastic she was such a more than mine do you remember any advice that she gave you that you still hold on your head if you want to do something you have to be passionate about it and also you know that is a lot of work and you have to like it a lot right and stick to the to the idea what you want to do and if you created your own style for the collections stay with it right that's good advice can you discern any of the very particular differences from the time in which Carolina Herrera was just starting or through the first ten years of the business versus now what have been some of the the most intensive changes you've noticed totally different I really see because when I started it was the 80s mm-hmm that was exists everything was excessive Big Shoulders big every symbol dresses and all that and fashion evolves I mean you cannot stay in the same thing if I do what I did in the 80s I won't sell anything I don't like to look too much in the past I like my future and I love the women don't race in Carolina where for now right not in the past but would you say that it's very important to know your client because you're still dressing the same woman you just have to adapt to what she wants no dressing they say no I'm basically look for new ones - okay I do notice that you yes of course it changes yeah everything changes but I think there is something that every woman likes I think they like to be looking very feminine and sophisticated and elegant I suppose I was speaking about this earlier there's there's this sort of wave in fashion where clothing is starting to feel a little bit like fresh produce as though you're you get it and if you don't eat it it goes rotten yeah it why do you want to follow a trend why do you want to look exactly like the other girl next to you I for me fashion has to be original it has to be individual individual it is very important because you create your look right now that's probably your personal style your women have a hard time finding their personal style when you're getting dressed in the morning mm-hmm you are projecting something that you want people to see you so you put your look together that's your own style yeah I say that all the time that one of my favorite things about fashion is that I get to come in and out of identities as I please I could be one person one day another personality yeah you are projecting what you want to be maybe you want to be somebody else tomorrow yeah how lucky exactly I'm sure a lot of girls come to you actually and ask you for advice on how to launch a label or how to build a label how to establish an aesthetic what sort of I think they have to they have first of all they have to be they have to like it a lot and they have beach memes for sure that they can do it right first of all they have to have talent for that for what they're doing and second it's not only the glamorous side of fashion when you are in a fashion show which is absolutely glamorous or dressing someone that looks divine it's a lot of work so you have to give a lot of you in there and you have to love it do you have a hidden talent do I have what a hidden talent if I have when I won't tell you why because it's a secret why did a secret house you should broadcast it has to be a secret it's something very important in life misty I have heard you say that before yes mystery is important important in life oh gosh I would argue obviously I would tell you what I would love to have been a writer but a fantastic one mm-hmm like Hemingway know like like Jana Austen for instance one of my favorite books Pride and Prejudice huh I love it it's all about life and it's all about the right things in life the right values to write everything so that's a good piece of advice to read Pride and Prejudice yes that should be required reading for all for the entire fashion community can you remember any specific garment that you've designed that you were especially proud of that you still think about that you still reference I love my first collection ever loved it oh that's such a beautiful thing because it was um very glamorous mm-hmm and I loved it and that's the one that opened my name in in fashion yeah because from that first collection I went into all the big big alive stocks well what's interesting is that your clothes really do appeal to several different generations but if that's not an easy balance to strike I'm very lucky because I think it's the first of all is very feminine and I like we may like to feel like real women yeah they don't want to be wearing a costume for instance it's complicated right and for me has to be easy I have to be you know something that you can move in yeah you're not waiting for something that you cannot even move because it's fashionable you have to work something that makes you feel right and effortless yeah well my fashion has to be effortless those dresses that you can't move in I call those Met Gala dresses because they're just good to get you a book garlotte take a photo and leave I'm gonna say two words this or this and then you choose one really fast okay okay manicure a pedicure I'll busy group pedicure Rober caftan who would you rather attend a black-tie event or a barbecue it don't it bends where is a barbecue and what time of the year it is or if it's a black-tie barbecue a black-tie barbecue just that's fun it's a fun idea make sure you should do a black-tie karaoke party okay after I don't karaoke me too have you ever used a selfie stick no you know the sticks that you attach to your phone mm-hmm did you read my book no what's your favorite book Pride and Prejudice I already did yes I've had in pages your favorite reality television show mm-hmm you've got me there then it won one reality show you're the real housewives who is fighting those boards and Meno the one to see if I have seen Keeping Up with the Kardashians no no no keeping up with a cocky though I'm not getting no boots on be nice 
it was actually a little risque you know a little office something-something I got enough to get water one day and I came back to my computer and I had you know that blinking one in my inbox and I had this note that said I love your dress and no I just kind of feel like the rest is history I'm pretty old fashioned and I would normally never approach someone first but in this case I did I don't know what it was but something made me just send the message so I was kind of embarrassed about it and I just you know got on the old Facebook and opened up the message and I was like hey and it sort of started as simple as that I'm Leandre and I'm Amelia and this is how we met it was it was actually like if you text a guy first and then instantly you're like that was so stupid I sounded so dumb like why did I say hey was why do I use an exclamation point and I definitely do feel like I had a leg up I was like this idiot clearly not from New York wants to be my friend so bad it was right I wrote back thank you so much and I wanted to give a compliment back but I didn't quite have one cuz it didn't seem merited or warranted or deserve and I really did want to compliment her but her Facebook picture was her and like this like very decadent white bustier she was wearing a bra house and I just felt like that stood for everything that I hate it was from my 20th birthday and I looked awesome all I know is that when I turned 20 I wore a freakin button-down not for nothing she kind of is Carrie Bradshaw but so anyway we became really fast friends because I learned that she was living on the Upper East Side which is where I was living at I'm a Kay the artist formerly known as my parents apartment you left and you went abroad and I went abroad in August and I stayed in the city and she was she was in Paris and I still didn't I I joked and told her to come visit okay I was like yeah come visit I was trying to be hospitable but like not in an authentic way I was just like yeah definitely come bring your dad I don't know yeah she calls me like two weeks into my semester and she's like my dad bought me a plane ticket I'm coming to Paris I was like my apartment is literally the size of my foot which is a size six no you invited you were like no I miss you come uh-huh before that we did sure if I liked her yet well you invited me I think that I didn't that definitely solidified our friendship yeah I feel really really close and I became friends with your other friends he went see sacre coeur which is sign one March she was wearing these liquid latex black leggings as pants you've been like you could see the butt coming out of it and it was obscene I was a grapple xever toriel transition she was trying to find myself in clothes but you weren't wearing clothes is the thing right and then she took an internship she took so many and she worked everywhere she prostituted herself on the PR editorial fashion circuit you can't have a job that I haven't had I like my steps so like in my mind I had like this was the right step this is the next step this is a step that follows in Leandre what as she likes to do was try and I just like shake it up just it up well so I well I was asking her or my deciding to ask her to come work with me was really driven by my own like stress and frustration and understanding that I was sitting on something that was so much bigger than me that needed to be supported by people who had the same vision that I did who understood what I meant who would be able to to contribute to this like very unified voice that wasn't just my voice and so I like literally called her one afternoon and essentially threatened our friendship and was like you don't come work at Man Repeller I don't think I can know you anymore which is oddly also how I got my husband to marry me not about working for me then lots of threatening I do that a lot yeah yeah well definitely lets you know when you're when you're needed mm-hmm and then when that happened I remember hanging up the phone and I thought about it for a minute and then I was kind of like you know like what are you waiting for what are you waiting for and then um and then I asked few people and they're like I don't know what you're waiting for you should do this and so then I called her back and I was like guess who's coming to work for Man Repeller I think we're pretty good at like leaving it in the workplace too like we could have like a very tense and like heavy you know very completely work focus day and then it's like the clock strikes and then were like not gonna drink and we still talk about work but like the friendship high-hat comes up friend that's so cool sometimes we text each other and we're like friend hat and like no matter what's Hallowed by I think I have a yeast infection um even like the front Hat rule is that like even if I accidentally set that like a post section in case you didn't hear me even a week instead of post live I've never had all those before having you on board has been the greatest treat of life other than raisins which are a literal treat from nature so that's that we'll see what happens next could be nothing could be everything 
it's summer icons so places like I common places to travel iconic people iconic outfits it's you know just sort of like the only one the summer summer rolls around you get like a little bit more ambitious about your wardrobe and start to feel like this amplified urgency to dress better it started like putting spreading that amplification across everything else is a trouble with summer dressing because it's there just when you're wearing glass closure those opportunities like say so many things I think any stories on like whether it's like to summer but how to dress cool that you be silly reposted um or something that I've been seeing in the comments is like afford more affordable options so baby we do a focused summer dressing story that's like three outfits that I'll take all the cost of your hundred dollars or we can be Twitter and I want to do a summer dance or make out guide how to navigate the FML that undid for me yeah yeah like escape them outdoors just total just a package like oh things let me go I want to do that okay so there are a lot of birthdays in June like celebrity one with North Kendrick Lamar making Ashley Olsen Meryl Streep thank you we want to bring that together you need to get in touch with modeling agencies like pull from the lower tier rosters that they have like we're not trying to book Joan Smalls right it's okay like a 15 year old just moved to New York and loves to be booked I remember your post last year like where to eat when I didn't work here I found that super interesting the other thing I was thinking about is never color money Diaries because somebody mentioned this in the comments of the story that I published last week about member yeah so maybe what we can do I was thinking it would be interesting to have members of the team like clock what they're spending on weekly basis like that I think I was just thinking like that would probably be good for me to do it will be very helpful for budgeting and it'll also acquaint everyone better with members of the team which I'm consistently trying to do and then it could be a series they're already 12 us that's fully sorry I have two questions via again you didn't do this so if maybe that's the answer would we be well I don't think we would ever do this but would we contextualize it with salary I know we wouldn't do that with the team but like I feel like sometimes the success is around like of those types of stories is around and maybe let contextualize the categories so each of what's like being shared because I know some stuff like you repeat contextualize it by saying with what our personal goals are for lay I'm trying to like save money from industry that is yeah and then you could be like I failed like holy should have spending what on this and just sort of like addicts and we tell us when they get quite microscopic so instead of like everything you're spending now is just what you spend on clothes designers - no I know like - like up-and-coming small but I don't really know many others welcome you like I've known of your label right like because as a plus size person it's like you only have but like it would be cool to have unique like yeah and it can even I wonder maybe instead not just doing know your labels but even like other sources like there's this great Etsy shop or like yeah vintage that specializes in plus sizes six time I also have a random did another like a vortex myself on Lily Rose down to cover up tips because that is literally my style from I mean I have friends who are not even 30 yet who have like in amounts of great he's just like totally today I definitely had like many but a lot of people are embracing is yep the story didn't say this explicitly but it was my deduction which is that the same way that we can now say with scientific evidence that not smoking can literally prevent lung cancer will not be surprised if it like two or three decades there a scientific proof and not consuming sugar can prevent breast cancer colorectal cancer colorectal cancer pancreatic cancer so yeah I mean just to like tie that up my note on that is like does sugar actually fall cause cancer if so what the fuck is it only refined sugar due dates count my mom and like my second mother figure are like Pilates and chiropractor and they're like constantly tells talking about Lake Havasu can you write story defining the second figure I don't know I think this is maybe boring but you want to talk about this a little bit like what can you do in the day that's like that will as an antidote to sitting a little bit the other thing is it's like a huge determining factor of what you're gonna die essentially from like the last but knowing what's the actual like it's not just like objects like not like feel good when you wake up like no actually tips to like prolong your life my mom's always telling me to like no matter how much pain you back as anyways it can all be fixed just by your own like there's okay I need surgery and she's like no I was gonna I was thinking for like a relationship story something about um in defensive the longest is just because I'm in one of the things kind of I love I think it's the best relationship on the planet yeah it's like the quickl you say members laundry sheets one two yeah I think it's like I think specks be harmful and like pretty conservative but know it and more and more I think this is also especially as I get older do you see your own one to that whenever I talk to you on stay I'm in long distance especially people my usual though they're like that's amazing how did you do that done stuff like magic electrons where that just moved here after they build ups which is like it can like me for long distance relationships yeah I got this program to like that act like living together after being at work just like being the same city after long distance just been in like the coping with that just 
hello I am Leandre but you already knew that today we're in Bryant Park and I'm pulling men on my outfit because that's kind of what I do I've also recently been given a microphone which I feel like was taken from me at birth so I'm having a lot of fun hanging out with it also my sleeves are doing this really cool thing we're just going to figure out what men really think about man repelling fashion and I know that sentence sounds horrific but we'll see what happens what is it called the bachelorette party or something like that shows your independence and also your creativity would you like to go on a date with me no but I'm sure a lot of guys would like to if you saw me on the street from a distance would you be like damn I want to take that girl home to mom not face like sure a problem yeah you are kind of okay so life is it kind of it is a little boys is this the kind of outfit that you would expect of a girlfriend would you want your girlfriend to be wearing this and would you feel comfortable introducing her to your dad my girlfriend could wear whatever the hell she wants I'm not crazy about it cuz it's just see I feel like you're swimming in it are you trying to say that I'm drowning yeah you might be drowning I'm uh Italian Cristiano don't speak Japanese you know like all those European classic French or Spanish all oh I'm gonna wear this the next time I have a wine evening and then the following week when I go back in time I'm kind of hot I've got bad breath under my arms if a girl showed up at your doorstep wearing this and said marry me would you say yes I don't know if I'd say yes I probably wouldn't throw off the porch though that's nice do you frequently throw women off your porch I'm a fashion designer and I think your outfit is very unique whoever made it they really need to pursue it more but your outfit it fits you and only you thank you that's so nice of you to say big on you isn't frame me at all it doesn't show anything about you but you don't feel like maybe this is a really subversive way of showing off my female independence and power first impressions are everything everything how long have you been single very very long would you date a girl wearing this outfit of course what do you look for in an outfit from a woman I don't know I'm more interesting about her eyes any and are you single yeah what's your phone number : whose toned-down didn't ever want to step on it be nice special shoes that's so nice of you to say can you talk to me a little bit about your phone say you're at a salad bar making yourself a salad minding your own business it's one o'clock on a Tuesday and you're hungry and you see a girl like three people away from you wearing this outfit and she's making a really similar salad there's keen line there there's tofu feta and you were just like damn we are connecting on a nutritional level do you go over to her and say hey can I buy your salad or do you say I have to let this one go because in spite of the fact that we both clearly loved tofu she looks crazy maybe I feel a little to be humble graceful reminds me of someone who could wield magic where are you calling me a wizard I'm going to go fly off in my wizard where 
Patricia Field she like the finale of the show membership Sarah Jessica war that you know purple dress to the premiere of the opening I think that big-ass probe that made no sense there was no way she could have packed it I know I had two kids that were 89 there that was a tiny to me hashtag tiny to me and she was like lying at the bed asleep and I didn't hit her and she said this beautiful hotel room and the whole speech that was laid later pull a dress on Bachelorette and the reason that dress happened and that scene can happen is Michael Boetcher king went downstairs into the wardrobe room and Patricia Field who smokes was like this dress wants to be in the show that's great I think for me personally and my generalization about comedians and I think you and I can relate on this level I think we all just need to be seen and heard and I think most comedians either weren't seen as kids or heard as kids if you go on stage and basically take you know thousands of people hostage to listen to you and they're not allowed to talk back and if they do security will remove them like you have an extreme need to be heard right you know and maybe if you're in fashion you might have a need to be seen you know in some way so I was invisible as a kid I didn't get enough attention to had to work really hard to get attention and now I sort of do that in my professional life when I need to be seen I dress a certain way to fulfill that inner need and when I want to hide I dress a certain way you know so when I do stand-up I dress very monochromatic and hoodie and nothing and I want to disappear because I want people to listen to my jobs when I'm not doing stand-up I dress super flamboyant because I still have that need to be seen but I don't get to tell jokes to get attention so it's filling a like very deep emotional need and one that's my whole thing with fashion right is that it's just another language that I used to connect yes I like people and I like talking to them and I like I noticed that first thing but it says it's so interesting because I thought because growing up around fashion I felt it was a little bit frivolous like when I was younger when I couldn't afford it especially I'm like why would you spend $1000 on this ridiculous thing you know I had resentment towards it and my mom would go around and was doing PR for clothes so in my head I was always just competing with fashion and I was like why is that better than me and me and then as when I became a writer I realized how important fashion is because the costume designer is sometimes the most important person in a staff because you need to be able to say who a character is without them talking right so when a character walks on screen I need to know everything about them how much they make but they do for a living if they're married if they like themselves if they're sexual I need to know so many things solely based on their outfit and I learned the value of a fashion yeah so in creating a character writing is like 20% of it casting is like 30% of it and like 50% of his wardrobe yeah it's you need to be able to tell me everything about this character in one second because otherwise it looks like I'm a bad writer don't you think there's no room for dishonesty anymore in standup it is in generally across the board it is impossible not to be authentic I think it's harder to lie to other people but it's easier to lie to yourself so it's easier for us to say like I mean uh it's harder for me to say to you I like Kim Kardashian yeah like I'm totally a family no I'm this woman's you know I'm lying or whatever or like that looks really cute on you like you know what's happening we're all smart now but it's easier for me to say like uh I'm not addicted to my phone and I like will pick it up on the freeway while I'm driving right you know we lie to ourselves a little bit more yeah these days well I think we always lie to ourselves as like what that Joan Didion quote we tell ourselves stories in order to live right yes we tell ourselves lies or later to tweet or like I'm following someone like oh my friend like I can't really call you my friend yet but I'm totally calling you a friend well you're my best friend like myself I was a play sister Whitney yeah this is the longest I've hung out with anyone in like year four special um and I think that we have this artificially thing that's artificial I think now is our sense of connectedness right and our sense of intimacy yeah whereas our authenticity as you said is absolutely I think more increased our sense of intimacy has debased I learned this recently it was literally a news flash to me that I read somewhere in a self-help book not that I need it um they said love is not earned approval is not earned and I was like what yes it is you constantly have to go around every day and burn approval with your clothes with your body with your jokes with your makeup with your this like it didn't occur to me that you're not supposed to be trying to earn people's approval all day so I just started putting that into action recently I think it's made me a little more boring uh I'm gonna say it's not true thank you wait so approval is not earned that makes a lot of sense but then what is approval approval which is sort of another person so you liking me the goal is for me to not be like I really hope she likes me wait by the coalition I like myself her her opinions not really into my business I think that I use what I wear to compensate for whatever I'm lacking in a certain day so I'm feeling vulnerable or weak or scared I will dress in a really tough way right and like boots and or sneakers and like a leather jacket jeans and you're aware of that happening is it's happened I think I'm pretty aware of it and what I'm feeling strong I'll dress in a more I hate the word feminine but in a more delicate way my whole thing with fashion is that I really like I feel very satisfied when I can surprise people I have aspirational clothes that are like one day when I get the self-esteem to wear that I will that's cool I have a lot of things with tags on them that I like you know it's like a goal it's like some people have skinny jeans like I want to fit into those mine are like I just want to one day have the balls to wear that like I have these cysts bragging bone white suspenders that are have leather straps why don't you feel like you have the balls to wear those because I feel like as a comedian I can never wear something that I would make fun of if I saw it your interest in fashion should not minimize your intellect like we're allowed to sit here and talk about my skirt from Topshop and then with like the same conviction to talk about the psychology of an eating disorder Andrea also allowed to which I love what you do we're also allowed to UM be in the fashion world and like not be super serious and like you know I'm still respected I'm still respective and I think that conversely what I'm sort of trying to do a little bit one step at a time at comedy is feel like we're allowed to be funny but also be fashionable and also if I'm on stage and you think I'm less money or take me less seriously because of what I'm wearing if you're that easier really really frustrated yeah it's like you're lost if like you're focusing on what I'm wearing instead of what I'm saying like what's going on with you or I need to write better jobs or that's my problem 
right we're about to do that fun thing tries to back out on the driveway oh yeah oh making my way downtown walking fast faces pass super quick video update Emilia forgot her phone in Athena's we were there interviewing Athena Calderon and her amazing husband for a kind of a funny story and literally about 25 seconds after us leaving she realized it took all of ten minutes to navigate ourselves back to the house and I would have videoed it all look at this cute card all right so we made it to Laos point as you can see it is indiscriminately beautiful for better or worse we're now leaving uh it appears as though Amelia is trying to leave without me which I'm not so into okay you're not trying to leave without me right we're on the beach amelia is having a titty attack we all notice being configured behind us and if you're wondering about the noise we could fall into the sky not to bite Julia okay we have just gotten out of the car and we are walking into the most G dang adorable farmers park in addition to you super cute not sure what we're gonna get but my guess is sunflowers yeah these orange tomatoes so we're eating them now and I know I'm not a food critic and I'm not saying that I should be a food critic I'm not even saying that you should listen to my opinion on food but I am gonna say these days like little droplets of fun and surprise and I feel like get your hands dirty everyday all you need is oh my god my check what you want is all you need is a mushroom haircut all you need look I'm sorry I'm up in here you see my double chin oh well you're about to get hit some hydrangeas you ready Wow look at this it's like we couldn't have staged this better if we tried ah I work okay something tells me that we weren't supposed to do that but I might be wrong like if I needed to compare them to a single President presidential candidate I would probably say they're the most like Ted Cruz because were they liked house you just you just look at them and you're like I don't know about you and then you bite into them and you're still like I I don't know about you and then I guess they're also kind of like Hillary Clinton because the after 2f by the time you get to the aftertaste you're like I want to hear more from you I think we've been in a car together for too long you've got home we have changed clothes and as a result of that there are libations or responsible there would never be libations if there were not and I do believe that this wraps our tango with each other in the studio apartment of a Cadillac so here we are exhibiting the way in which Amelia parked this car about 20 minutes ago after a fitness class because you know when you're on a road trip all you need to do go to fitness she just attempted to get back oh no I'm taking a picture of our part someone just thought I was taking a photo of their car but I wasn't a video so what we're going to observe right now is as Amelia gets out of the parking spot without upsetting the hello well thanks 
hi Cindy hi how are you it's so nice to meet you I feel like I'm staring into the Sun do you get that a lot that's the first time actually you have to say steering the first time yes I have so many questions for you okay so you're 51 you have essentially weathered a hundred careers at this point or it feels like you went from supermodel to actress to businesswoman and now you have an incredible beauty line with Dr Seberg how do you keep yourself from burning out I think it's every modern person's challenge right I mean life is busy modern life is busy I kind of know my limits like I know okay this and I'll like at the beginning of the week I'll review my I look ahead like what's my week look like where could there be a potential problem where am I going to be burned out and like okay now I need the next night to come home and put on sweatpants and like you know binge watch Netflix so I I'm good about organizing my time in that way I am it's not second nature to me it's like something that I kind of had to learn and also learn who I wanted to be so Instagram was the first one that resonated with me because I was like oh I get it it's pictures I've been doing pictures for you know over 30 years and so Instagram was the first one that I was like okay I get this and this is fun and then how much do I want to reveal you know I don't come from a generation where it's like everything is for public consumption but at the same time what's interesting about Instagram is that it isn't those carefully edited perfect pictures that we all see in magazines so it's kind of finding that balance of um you know do I want to show my kids I mean now my kids are you know forget it like and now they're public yeah people as well but when they were little like how much did I want to expose them and it's so funny that you say it's not carefully edited because one of the larger criticisms of I suppose my generation and I'm like an upper millennial is that we are creating these lifestyles to show off that don't exist in real life and then probably kaya's generation which like really pioneered the fence tub which is a bacon yeah those are cool well let me follow her on fence to my real Instagram is offense to the thing that I love about social media is that it's your chance to be your own PR person you you have a direct relationship with your audience which I never had as a young model I had to wait for people to write about me and write about who they thought I was as opposed to okay that's your opinion but here's how I want you to see me which again I'm not saying is 100% the truth when we all usually try to put our best face forward but I have a voice in how I want to be seen and then other people are gonna say what they want to say anyway but at least I have a voice too alright that's a really good point you are controlling the brand messaging in a much more granular way now yeah direct way and it also doesn't have to be so serious it doesn't have to be so like you know like brand messaging it's just like it can just yeah it's more authentic I think well so now that you're kind of on the models are good again because you're here with your daughter and your son how do you feel like modeling has changed in New York and do you get very nostalgic like when you're here in September feel does it feel like the old days back in the day like we didn't have stylist that got us ready to walk into a show like now what you wear to and from the shows is as important to your to who you are as a model that's it and that's a whole nother level of pressure I think like you know I just like whatever I could roll up and put on the floor because you know normally you get to the show they put you put they put you in a robe and your clothes ends up in a little wad underneath your rack so doing a show is doing a show you put on the clothes I tell you to you walk down the runway when they when they say go so for that for my kids it's the same but I think some of the other stuff surrounding it is different the generation right before me there was showgirls and there was print girls and they were not the same like my generation is really one of the first generations where the print girl started doing shows and I think that's what supermodel is it is because it kind of it was like we were doing both so like people with on the runway and then they'd be seized in the editorials and they would see us in the print campaign so that became the new normal one of my favorite documentaries is unzipped oh my god and I look at that and I just think and maybe this is because I'm romanticizing a time that I wasn't really part of but I just think that was fashion that was it I I think it was a great time I feel very lucky that kind of my heyday as a model was during that time where you know it was exciting but I think it's I think this new generation I mean I think it's exciting now - it's just different you know when did you know you wanted to be model I wanted to be a teacher when I was like an elementary school and both my sisters or teachers I don't I probably would have taught science or math then in seventh grade I want to be the first woman president and then what did I want to do oh I think I had like I was like a nuclear physicist cuz I was like that's like the most interesting job I can think of and then I kind of just threw chances I met someone I started modeling and it was like a good way to make money I was working I had worked in cornfields my since eighth grade like that's what you do in Illinois in the summer when you're a kid you work in the cornfields and you know I was making minimum wage and it's hard work it's hot work 10 over 12 hour days and my first modeling job it was like $75 an hour and I'm like this is awesome I'll have to just put on this cross your heart bra and stand there for an hour I'm doing this have you ever been insecure about your mole oh for sure when I was a kid first of all my sisters called it an ugly mark because they said it's only a beauty mark if it's on this side if it's on the left side it's an ugly ideal for that I know sisters and then I remember like the first day of high school walking in and there was a kid a guy like a senior guy that my sister was friends with and he was like hey little Crawford you got chocolate on your face or something like that and I was like morta because it was like all the senior guys sitting on like the main steps and I was like slinking along the side like just trying to be invisible and I never walked those stairs like the rest of the year I would like always cried at that back stairway and and I asked my mom I was like I want to have my my mole removed and she was like she was so smart she was like okay she's like but you know you might have a scar and you don't know what that will like you know what your mom will look like but if ever you want to go you make the decision so it's kind of good because then it was like oh shoot now it's mine it's up to me she didn't say no can we talk about meaningful beauty yeah absolutely yeah how long has the linemen around we launched and I guess 2005 so we've been around over 10 years what are your favorite products from the line are the ones that you use every day so we have a new than meaningful Beauty six it's meaningful food beyond is coming out this fall and so I've been using that for like the last well as we've been developing which the last nine months and we have a new serum that I'm obsessed with which has the stem cells the melon leaf stem cells in it and then we also have a night cream that has retinol in it now and then we have a new scrub that's you know I love scrubs so serum moisturizer during the day yeah that's my normal morning and then at night I do the serum again and the night cream and then I will do the scrub like two or three times a week do you feel like you've come into yourself more and more as you've grown oh for sure I mean I felt like very when I came to New York at 20 I was like I know everything and I'm totally together and then you you look back now and you're like oh my god it was such a baby and I knew nothing and I think that's the beauty of aging and time is that hopefully and again it really comes down to though are you willing to do the work on yourself and then and then the experience and knowing yourself that all comes along with that you're like I thought I knew myself so well until I hit like 26 and 26 to 28 which is where I am now have been such a unique lesson in nothing you know just like the complete unraveling of identity but I think women I think if you when you get to 30 I have seen a pattern with a lot of my women friends it's like 30 is like okay you come into your own and you're I think less willing to try to you're less willing to just be a pleaser or to make someone else happy you kind of you kind of know yourself and and know your faults as well like so something to look forward to yeah yeah there's some of my closest female friends are in their fifth yeah and you can be one of them if you want okay absolutely that's it it's done [Music] 
hey I'm Leandre welcome to my room this is my room tour trying to go viral on YouTube and hope it works so this is the side of bed that I sleep on this is my blankie asleep with him every night this is a lamp that's next to me that sometimes I turn it on sometimes I don't it really depends on whether or not I need to see before I go to sleep to how dark it is these are some perfumes that I attempt to wear but never actually do this is the jewelry that's mostly in rotation right now sometimes I wear all of it sometimes I wear none of it this is like a really small rendering of the Guggenheim there's no actual art in it but you know that could change technology's crazy so there's that these are my parents they were super cool and you know chillin out maxin relaxin shootin some b-ball outside of the school that's my husband when he was a youth I know the thing you're all really excited about and that's my closet so I'm going to show that to you right now my closet um this is one of my favorite pieces it's my Amelia so you just can't hangs up here sometimes you like Cole's closeout and gives them to me to wear and I think people always assume that my closet is gonna be really big given how how weird I am and how frequently I change but fundamentally I think it just boils down to the fact that I never wear the same thing the same way twice but this is it these are all my clothes this is what I wear almost every day I'm saying almost every day because some days I just like you know stay home and wear a robe I think that's all I got for you thanks for coming to my room see you again one day soon a bit your 
what is the one thing all Americans who don't speak French should know how to say when they're in Paris she got denim Oh hazel you're so wrapped because if you know how to say in any language you're so right people are gonna think you're very intelligent and you speak fluently they're gonna think you're very intelligent because you agree with them - at 10'o hazel how do we make ourselves as American women feel a little bit more friends a lot of women they are French women that yes she can all not that much the problem I think with the way that they dress in New York is they're going for their blow-dries and they're getting their man and cures and I have these colors on and they're it just it shows that they tried I know being friends they don't want to show they've made any efforts right the big difference I think it's when they can afford Browns friend letters and expensive brands they keep on going to the Manocchio Oh real cheap places to buy things and the mixed things it's not that the dress up only in Uniqlo H&amp;M and Zara or Army in AMAs plan yeah uh-huh then maybe this is French that right what are the five things that you believe every woman should have in her closet yes it's quite boring things to buy right like it navy blue sweater mm-hmm but it fits everyone and black varnish she's like flats of ballerinas it can save majority of looks I wouldn't say a white shirt because much of sad and boring and we've said that too much and then let's say a man shirt like good pair of jeans who makes your favorite jeans new clothes and I say that really honestly it's great because they know about them yeah and you find a port and aren't you stretchy which is nice exactly and then no way the little black dress because it doesn't mean anything and you never wear it and then what can I say oh let the jackets okay try a little bit too tiny dinner big for me so it's a little bit dress up like a nun gladly boring to find a little tiny leather jacket do not can save the whole thing because it gives you something a bit rock and roll but I think you don't need much no I really it's better to spend a little bit too much without guilt and something that really wish it's better to have shewn and good do you have a small closet yeah I'd take off away things I give to friend to have too much doesn't make you happy what's your best talent oh maybe I can teach you to make a drawing and then first you make it the nose to stone okay after the eyes did you little tips like this system stuff so I give her bigger ones if you want to don't worry oh this is Robin good chick yeah I'm making Madonna you can write whatever you want happy Easter Merry Christmas Happy Birthday whatever what did Leandra - to mean good congratulation divided pupil thanks for teaching me no not I have a whole new career now I think thank you so much he knows that was fun 
holidays man Amelia Sanja best holiday gift you ever received worst Tolliver's best holiday gift I've ever received is probably some tickets to a Harry Potter midnight showing worst gift I've ever received was a training bra hell dream I don't know whether you need a training wrong can i still wear training bras right sometimes 24 do you want to know my customers yes worst I can very vividly remember was gag when I was eight I got it on the first night of Hanukkah and it was so exciting and so fun and I put it in my brother's hair and I was like mom you're so cool I can't leave you got me guess slime you yeah and then she got it for me again when I was 15 to be funny like remember when and I was like I want a purse yeah 50 mom I got a bird once like I'm like a bird with one of those things a cockatiel and that big orange cheeks like he was too much blush and I was like oh my god I was a bird and then they're just like surprised that's really weird question yeah I lost you after bird what do you want yet I want something I feel like since I'm older now like I want I care more about like delicious things that I only need one Doug and a cabbage or coat like a coat like a really beautiful coat that I can go we're in the right place we are like a really beautiful gem colored coat I think that I can like wear and we're getting again a common misconception is that it's really the thought that counts I don't believe that's true you don't well I believe it's true that the thought counts but I don't believe that that is an excuse for you not to get a nice gift because if someone is getting you something that you like the shot counted they knew what you liked so here's my things I think that getting a pair of sunglasses is a really thoughtful gift because in order to buy a pair of sunglasses that are going to frame a girl's face the right way you have to really know where you have to know the nuances about her nose looks like right and what their cheeks do when they smile and you know you just you put on a pair of sunglasses and they have to figure you won't buy sunglasses if they don't look good on you so for a person to assume the position of buying you sunglasses this is either really no visa yeah top I would be very happy to get these Maxim are sunglasses they do look good on you you will well-suited head for frames so you think that it was amusing that if a man or lady friend got these for me that that would mean they were like I know I know Billy's face look no wonder I know so many time I know that her left ear is lower than her right yeah so I think it some kiss for her what do you think I'm elves do with sunglasses they have funny shaped ears like Christmas elves do you want fellow Reapers pretty sure that's our kicker hi so I grabbed Amelia diamond one time she walked into a kosher bagel shop on the Upper West Side and that's for a bacon egg and cheese 
you thought this was kind of just a fun appropriate look for the interview we wanted to feel close to you well it's just so fortuitous that I felt the same way I know I wish we had that moment when we all saw each other this morning on tape he wasn't really great it was like showing up to camp and seeing all the other girls in the uniform and being like this tonight ladies I just got out of the elevator and there you were and there were trolleys everywhere no actually obviously the hell with this Gaga bra I well because you your bras on the west coast across on the west coast my pants are on the east and that is a metaphor for my life so guys you tell me a little bit about Lenny like let's say we were waiting for our ubers this is like the Chris Sacca pitch and mine was going to be here in two minutes and I needed to know why I need to sign up for Lenny letter what would you say to me well besides having extreme panic because groupers are coming so fast no time my over never comes out plus I would say that we are looking for a fun feminist norm free place on the internet that could be a really positive place but also a really funny place in a really informative place where you actually want to take the information and apply it to how you think live and you decided that it would be a newsletter as opposed to a website because there's a logistical reason behind it which is a beer put two women we have an amazing staff working on this newsletter but we really wanted to do something where we could maintain creative control the same way we have over girls the same way we have over all the projects we've done through our production company and so a limited amount of content that we really gave all our love to was what we needed in order to make it successful to make it successfully remain in our tone and our intent yeah and we like how kind of an old-school the idea of a newsletter is yeah we're coming at you coming Deary so yeah that's kind of my thing with newsletters I we've sort of started ramping up our newsletter about three months ago and for me it's very much like okay you don't have time to come to Mandor Polycom because that's what's happening everyone's like I'm a desktop nobody's listening to it we have to say on desktop anymore then I will bring the content to you you don't have to do anything but check your email I have obsessive-compulsive disorder or something we've both been public about and one of my biggest OCD things when I was younger was reading Us Weekly and when a couple would break up I would have to explain a perfect narrative to myself of what happened in their relationship like starting from the moment it began to fracture to the moment that they said they were going to be together anymore because the tabloids weren't doing and that's what that yeah I felt like I needed to fill in the blanks and I needed to do it perfectly and if there was a moment where my brain paused I needed to start again so there's never been a more like pop obsessed OCD tick how does your OCD come out now all the different ways I'm talking through some strange blinks and chests witches and there Phin a plate there's been a blanket a chest which there's an incredible need to delete all my text messages the minute I've answered them which is irritating for my friends a lot of us we've answered them yep and then I have to say can you please resend that can you tell me a little bit about how you decided to do this together we've been working together our six-year anniversary will be soon we're out of five and a half right now I'm at idahe for my angel right yes what do you get one for your sixth anniversary I don't know what anniversary that is I hope you all diamonds I think I mammal Oh beautiful umm so yeah we've been working at it for six years and we've been working on television show girls we have a production company together and after I went on my book tour I came back from the book tour feeling invigorated the midterm elections it just happened so obviously I was angry and I said to Jenni I feel like there's space for a web presence that doesn't exist right now and I sort of expected her to be like we have enough stuff going on will you just calm down and she was totally in and began expanding on the idea yeah I was like you deserve characters say what you want to say we feel like we've been so lucky to have an opportunity to share our voice as much as we have over the past five years and we felt like it would be a really amazing thing to have a space where that wasn't just for us but that was for a range of women - yeah a range of women are to find that as you will to express what they have to say I was just in the edit meeting yesterday finalizing our first month and a half of content I'm just excited because I feel like it really expresses the range of women and viewpoints and topics that Lennie represents well sort of maintaining a cohesive like funny but kind voice no does the world know about the future of girls think think they only are doing one more we're ready to you know send these girls off to the next phase of our life that doesn't include us filming them and then after this year are you going to focus more intently on Lenny or are there other what we're doing right now we're shooting a pilot with HBO that hopefully that's a bad second wave feminism that will hopefully be a series yeah we're working on a documentary about a tailor who makes suits for transgendered and gender non-conforming people our whole goal of our production company was we want to do something that's like pushing the ball forward on conversations about gender and unamusing and we so far you know gotten the pleasure of beginning on a bunch of projects that we think it hoped in that you really are making very difficult conversations feel easy to have right that seems like a really important like mode of communication that is exclusive to this millennial moment right it's like breaking down the really hard stuff and making it feel kind of simple but then there's also the the issue of what happens when it starts to feel inauthentic because like what's worse than getting a newsletter that says like hey good-looking okay and who started forwarding me from an unnamed clothing store emails that were like happy Wednesday sexy and she write back like  you they're the worst yeah and where they'd be like having having a fashionable Thursday she like no I'm not my child vomited on me and I'm lonely and everyone's always telling me to sit down with a glass of wine and I listen so frequently and sometimes I just sit down like I didn't even feel like drinking to it oh yeah Here I am yeah you know we've obviously there's been some scrutiny around girls at certain points that's just a little they don't look just too high any bit I just feel like it's so vanilla it's like going to the ice cream shop and asking for vanilla with nothing on at that show but we kind of are like well maybe if this is coming your inbox every week people will stop being scandalized give five reasons why everybody should sign up for Lenny one reason is because it's like a best friend coming to your inbox every week to tell you all the great things that are going on and things you should think about and feel and wear another reason is because it represents a diverse range of voices enough just one kind of lady another reason is because it's real pretty it like looks beautiful we have a really good designer I camp out now their reason is because every week you're going to read original personal essays and see original illustration and can I give the final reason yeah because I think it's really similar to a lot of the Man Repeller ethos which is that as a woman we no longer have to feel like our interests in like fashion and other things minimize our intellect that's a hundred percent right that is true here the best to the revolution 
welcome to the couch room it's the chat room but with a velvet couch so cold and I'm sitting here with Stacy London do you remember when we met I do remember we met I just remembered that it was on a street corner it was a very fateful Sunday I was going through a strange transition I wasn't sure if the audience the fans wanted to read my content anymore and I was still so married to the written word and you gave me some of the best advice I've ever received I replay you're saying it to me in my head like almost every day which is let them rise to your level don't done yourself down are you just very good at doling advice or is this something you learn from experience a little bit of both I'm great at doling advice I'm just not very good at taking it haha you know I'm one of those people I will tell you why you know it was very funny so I did ten years of a show called what not to wear on TLC just a little show it's a little school just outside of Boston exactly um have you heard of it anyway um yet no so I did the show and I watched that on Saturday mornings see too yet with a bowl of cereal Cinnamon Toast Crunch cancer cereal okay that well I actually am thrilled that it was in windowed scrubs because I love that cereal but the reason that you know part of that show really was for me about it wasn't had nothing to do with fashion it had everything to do with psychology right it wasn't it wasn't what you were wearing it was why you were wearing it and when I am left the show I kind of woke up and saw that the world around me had completely changed and that even reality television wasn't how-to based anymore and that the internet had sort of taken over the interwebs had sort of taken over that role and you know people start to ask me about bloggers and I was like blockers what is what is blogging I don't even understand like this is not my generation and then I started to you know sort of look at what that world meant and I looked around and saw a lot of people who really had no kind of understanding or insight into fashion saying I have a lot of money look at my new shoes every day and having you know pictures taken of them and when I found your blog I was totally came with it because it was so intelligent and it was the first blog that I found that actually moved the needle in terms of what fashion is doing in the world and he wants to see the same thing about what not to wear well I think you know thank you I think that but I do think reality TV was sort of a precursor in terms of fashion to what happened in terms of blogging which was we went from a how to culture in reality television to a movie to culture in blogging and the reason that I think you kind of created such an amazing following was that you finally took something that felt stuffy and in approachable unapproachable and sort of opaque and and broke it open into something fun and joyful and and that we're allowed to laugh at ourselves and nobody in fashion have to laugh at ourselves but nobody in fashion was doing that not not in a way that way you were yeah but you know even I will be honest I think I took myself too seriously in the meeting because I was worried since I've never been on television I don't know what the hell I was doing that I was supposed to be an expert and that if I if I was like self-deprecating or you know too jokey that I wouldn't be taken seriously it took me a good five or six years to kind of chill out well speaking of self-deprecation enjoys mists and funniness yes you were telling me about your guide to single girl dressing yes I think humanity deserves to know more about what you can know about if you buy Stacy yes oh right the truth about style that's right I do right um I wrote a chapter basically um the book is nine actually ten case studies nine women and me um about the obstacles that hold us back from dressing in the best and most authentic way possible and they're all different reasons there's like fear of judgment there is fear failure there's you know the idea I did one young woman who was 19 who is suffering from eating disorders and having trouble seeing herself correctly you know couldn't her brain wasn't catching up I feel like that's at the crux of it is not really knowing and fear it totally perpetuates this or maybe is informed by it's not being honest with yourself not knowing yourself I completely agree at that at the end of that book what I really discovered is that self-awareness is the key to great stuff and that if you try and do it the other way around and you know similar to saying you know don't don't let your your fans dictate your content it's sort of like allowing trends and an industry which is fashion to dictate who you are or who you think you need to be instead of understanding who you are and then picking and choosing trends based on your individual tastes so you're filming right I am I'm filming season two the idea behind it is it's it's you know it's still a transformation so it shows excuse me truth sort of hood it's transformative right I hate the word makeover I'm sick of it I'm sick of make under I'm just sick of it I mean really I'm just I can't I can't take any more of it I'd much rather call it like evolution yeah but the idea of it the title love lust or run um I'll be honest is not my favorite title in life you should have called it Darwin period oh my god good but that's like very heady yeah yeah but that would have to be unlike all of that we did people write off that people would have to watch that on Nat Geo you know what I mean like I don't know that that would go over well but a password-protected ha ha ha exactly channel um but the title refers to the way somebody might react the first thing that they would think if they saw you on the street and you know I am NOT one of those people who's like oh god well public opinion means everything what I'm more concerned with is that when people dress in a way that's very extreme that a they know why they're doing it and that they're self-aware and that the message that they want to convey to other people is actually the message that's being conveyed yeah is the difference between translation transmission and translation so what you think you're putting out what you think you're doing by wearing a long sweater because you hate your ass actually makes people think well she hates her ass because she's wearing that long sweater and she's trying to hide it right so that that applies very much I think to women who are you know doing all sorts of extreme style whether you know whatever that is and then say that there's a disconnect in their life like they're not getting what they want and they're not getting the reaction that they want from people maybe self-fulfilling prophecy exactly and in a lot of ways I've worked with a lot of women who you know display signs of defensive dressing it's like they were bullied so they went so far in the opposite direction so you can't hurt me I'm gonna hide behind this costume or this mask and they don't really want to be seen okay so I've never seen an episode of Sex in the City no way and you call yourself a woman well here's my thing about that okay I went through this period where I was like is this really women or is this gay men writing for women and I got very fitted some for chatted about the idea that it was like a caricature of what for women would be like well Sex in the City was an important show for me because I feel like those women became my friends yeah even though they obviously had no idea who I was and I often reference the television show and I'm talking about man recovering the future of Man Repeller because what I'm trying to do with the site and on the Internet is build that same sort of sense of community and treehouse and all Girls Club and Sex and the City was totally my escape from the finalities and like harsh realities of my life eg men breaking up with me and my friends being assholes right and did you feel like when you were watching Sex in the City that you could relate like they like when you say that you felt like they were your friends it's like didn't they have guys break up with him one broke up with one on a post-it or something yeah yeah I I mean I you know I know a little bit about it I was very young I was still super young so I think that there was also an aspirational quality there where I was like wow so this is what my life is gonna be like and it changed the narrative in that it became aspirational to be a single woman in New York welljust was revolutionary then and is revolutionary now and I got thinking about women who are comfortable being single but are uncomfortable with the fact that they're defying such a salient convent well I think I get uncomfortable with the fact that um there's this sense that the perception of me is always sort of couched in that definition right um you know well why is she single like you know what's wrong with her as opposed to it either being a choice or not even a choice just not making not finding that there was you know the person that I wanted to stay with permanently or that I've been in long-term relationships my whole life it's just that they all had a lifespan to them they all had an expiration date and I don't really see that as a reflection of my desirability or my ability in life or my capabilities but I do think that there's still a perception in society there's a book that just came out I'm spacing on the name of the author called spinster and it's brilliant because it's about her life choice to be single but she chose word that is you know really got a sort of pejorative definition um the spinster Bachelor right exactly bachelors like you know a hipster with like a bargain you know an electronic right an electronic bard that you know comes up when you push your buttons on as well exactly and like in a bond uh James Bond you know but there's no Jane bond our society now this is going full circle is that now being a single woman is so far ahead of where we are socio biologically that it kind of doesn't make sense yeah so the way the women and and one of the reasons that what not to wear and love less to run as a show become important is because women are emotionally invested in their appearance in a way that men just aren't and I mean I have said this before that you know I feel like a guy can be a troll but if he has a g5 it's like you know okay like a super hot girl there's definitely an element of process of elimination across both sexes yes I think that Man Repeller is it when I launched Man Repeller I think that it was sort of an epiphany for me because I was still single at the time and I was like oh my gosh this is giving me so much control I'm single because I like fashion and I'm not going to choose a man over fashion and so I win and then I got back together with my boyfriend who's now my and I was like oh man rappelling is a process of elimination because it allows the good ones to rise to the surface absolutely people think of fashion tapes like 1 out of 33 women even know about fashion tape what would one do with accessory tapes done well I find the dots most helpful for is actually keeping necklaces from going awry that's my favorite thing to use add-on for so anything that's um abundant or a statement necklace that where you can kind of put a row of dots can be very helpful so it doesn't move all day especially when you're on camera but that's just the fashion tape there are like so many things that you could be using that are quick fixes that are not just for television or red carpets they're for real life everyday shortcuts for people who are busy and I'm just concerned by the rocking on how are you feeling it's good accessory tape does but my favorite thing is this deodorant removing sponge yes now the great thing about this Bunge is that you can cut it up into little strips so you can make it put it in the travel so what I do is I take the sponge that's added very strategic and jewish like only very stitch it only a jewish woman would be like i'm gonna cut this up and multiply it yes and put it in every bag i own yeah what are these for fashion tape shaped this is what you do with different necklines so that they stay in place and what I love about this stuff there's also there are so many great things in here in that this is the style essentials like deluxe kit which of course what you would have with that PVC bag that you can use to tote around tampons after the fact that's a whole lot of tampon yeah I'm just gonna say so probably for super super plus regular and Jun that would be me right okay and like a maxi pad just to throw people off like what and these aren't the secrets these are the things you should have in your office in your home in your bag just so that you always like look and feel your best because to me part of looking good is that that actually will make you feel good and part of feeling good is that you know that you look good so confidence and certainty certitude is very important to say certitude I like that word more than certainty that's a really good one so if you're prepared which is my big thing that allows you to feel certain that you know what you're doing they don't know what you're putting together looks the right way feels the right way it's like having a good hair day you just you just feel better mm-hmm constant wind being blown into your hand and you still feel good about it yeah speaking of good hair day they'd want to say it did good hair days my name is Leandre I went to fitness class this morning
