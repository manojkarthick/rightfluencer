make chili yourself yes which which
means you put your chili hi ma'am I have a quick question for you do you
make chili at your house you know okay excuse me ma'am do you put chili in your
beans I mean yeah you do kinda you put in there that's I gotta say a question
are you in a big hurry right now I a little bit okay well you make chili
myself yes which which means you put in your chili there's a chip what's the difference
between a kidney bean in a chili bean hot chili these look like baked beans oh
really that sounds really good by the way I
haven't had a frito fire me forever yeah okay okay what are you making today
looks like you've got a lot of stuff going on there okay okay holy smokes all
right do you make chili at your house how do
you make it deep put beans in your chili first off some people okay good so
you're not the one with the weird all right so which means to you recommends
heard hot chili I don't even that very sure what a hot chili bean it yeah what
are you cooking today looks like you've got a lot of stuff going on stuff for
the week I gotta ask you um you're actually on camera right now I'm a
blogger and I cook healthy food and I wanted to know if I cover your groceries
today would you let me cook you like really delicious
yes to rice meal with chicken would you allow me to do that put before you oh
what's your name Becca alright hey guys I got one so yeah you're actually so there's a
camera there yeah so y'all this is Becca she's going to in
she's having a party tonight so this is actually a really good setup we're gonna
go and we're gonna make this fiesta rice right now and I'm gonna cover your
groceries and to worry about it okay all right let's go we're gonna go this way we're still making scratch because you
are a hooker we're gonna we're gonna use this one perfect alright guys so we are here in the
middle of Kroger we just surprised Becca and we're about to make this amazing
really easy tex-mex fiesta rice dish so Becca has a food allergy to chicken
which I've did not know that existed but hey and you're all special this is why
everybody's are all special right first step is to chop these into very small
pieces and we know that Becca can cook because when I was talking to her
earlier she was describing her chili dish actually I feel like I'm gonna
maybe like angle it and then post that's with me cooks recipe but just know it
came from her great and this is about a pound of turkey tenderloin that we're
cutting up so while she's doing that this skillet it's just not getting hot
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna add in a little bit of olive oil just
about a tablespoon of it scoop that right on in thank you
and the only thing we're gonna do here is we're just going to brown brown the
meat around the top and bottom of them all right this is perfect we're just
gonna dump that into there you got it this is they're really heavy yeah we're
doing a workouts and everything today this is when we're really gonna add in
the oil cuz we're gonna get cooking so we're gonna add in about two tablespoons
and this is gonna be about at least eight servings so remember that you know
when you're adding in oil and things like that think about how many servings
that you're going to be doing cuz it that's a huge factor in the calories
we're gonna toss in some green onions yep whole thing and then some garlic just going stir it up and what we're doing here is just gonna
caramelize the the red onion and the garlic equip down your onion at our do
you prefer white or red yeah we're gonna do about a tablespoon and a half of
chili powder and then let's do it two teaspoons of cumin yeah a little
stubborn too all right good and what I like about doing it this way
is it really helps to lock it in cook this down for about two minutes we're
gonna speed up the process here but I want you add in some rice now this is a
trick that some people like to use this is short grain and it's weird right
it's different yeah this is short grain brown rice so you can use brown rice
beans Jeff I love jasmine rice oh my god present the blob she's like I agree with
that you stir that up and when you saute the
rise I'm not sure if you do this to do you thoughts are yours yeah it really
helps to lock in the flavors because again we're trying to create our own
like enchilada style sauce but without adding in all the enchilada stuff the
ingredients for it all right perfect for that all of our flavors are locked in we're
gonna add in about a cup of this tomato sauce do you buy stuff with salt in it
or no yeah that's a great call out you want to fold in your turkey as well all
right and we're gonna bring that to a simmer and then if you don't have like a
topping or a cover for your cast iron skillet I like to just get two of them
and stack them do you do that and all people tried it it's actually really
buildable oh that's true she's like I'm fancy I
had my complete set but if you don't like me sometimes you just place it on
the world on top and let that cook so what I thought would go well with like
an enchilada rice would be what guacamole I think well we can tag-team
this so the first thing let's cut open these avocados and here's the tip I
learned - don't be that guy in the grocery store like me but you can chop
off the top of it and if it's white or green that I mean that's green on the
inside if it's not and put it back and walk away quickly we're just gonna make
a quick avvocato mash do you want to slice up these limes for us just slice
them in half so we can squeeze out the lime juice let's just get our forums
going and then how are you when it comes to
heat do you like a whole bunch of heat and spice medium okay how do you usually
chop yours yep and there's enough heat in here to add a little bit of kick and
this is for your guests anyway so they may not like a whole bunch we want to be
respectful of them just in case just in case we're gonna add in our heat now and
then if you want we could chop up an onion or no your are you good with just
the mash like this okay perfect cilantro okay I'm gonna put a little
business I love cilantro by the way well you know that there are people that
actually can't eat cilantro cause it tastes like soap did you know that so
she just saw the problem for you you don't pick up cilantro eat a whole
handful of it I mean come on people then we've got some sea salt and pepper
here I'm gonna put in some salt okay here's my secret ingredient that I'm
actually gonna publicly say for the first time
cumin I do like a teaspoon and that's it yeah that's perfect
that's great and then mash this sucker up and then season the taste with sea
salt and pepper and you're done with that beautiful this one actually has
chicken what it should look like last thing
I'm gonna open this packet so we've got some steamed veggies this is a bold
fiesta and this one actually has some seasoning in there I want to say let's
see this one has your eyes maybe better than mine paprika turmeric garlic powder
sis spices onion powder a lot in life anymore lime and just toss that in there
yep and toss it in the whole fiesta all
right so we're gonna stir this in we're gonna add in the rest of our our chicken
broth or you can do veggie stock if you're gonna make just a vegetarian
version so it's a really versatile and they've got these packed these little
chunks right here those are actually seasoning packs of this stuff we were
just talking about like the like the garlic powder and the turmeric and and
what I like about this type of stuff too is like this would be great with a salad
or its thick enough if you want to get like the little lettuce wrap the big
like little piece of lettuce and make them like little tacos so I'm gonna chop
up some cilantro make a little hole right here and we're gonna top it off
with our freshly made wok what do you think you're gonna put that
right there in the middle of it scoop it in there beautiful I'm gonna chop up some lunch
is for garnish purposes beautiful beautiful beautiful love it and then just some cracked
pepper in the middle to the back to get
everything in there hopefully that vegetables have cooked down because the
steam so you like that it's good alright I just don't want to miss out on
that so it's really good we taste enchilada at all you taste of tex-mex
I feel yeah yeah so is this something that you think that oh whoa the jalapeno
oh wow it doesn't mean see this is like a neat hot stuff like oh yeah it's
really mild yeah it takes the whole opinion so what I love about this dish
is that it's pretty straightforward it's literally just sauteing the rice and
then putting it into a pot and walking away so yeah it's quite simple so maybe
the people from your Bible study will like this stuff tonight you think so do
you think they will all right awesome all right guys you can go to fitment

the fit men cook kitchen today we are making one of my favorite
budget-friendly recipes of all time I especially love this after a nice hard
workout we are making tuna stuff red potatoes now what I love about this meal
besides the fact that it keeps some money in my pocket
it's just how versatile these things are these darn tasty stuffed potatoes are so
good you could even enjoy them as hearty snacks in between meals if you want to
forego the hummus and celery but also these are great at parties and great a
gift to get us at your house the Greek yogurt in this recipe helps to boost the
protein content and also it helps to add some creaminess to the mix but if you
want to take some of it out you can and you can sub in some light Mayo or even
some horseradish for a nice little spicy tangy flavor now in the event you may
have some leftover filling don't toss that away the filling yard
I'm telling you is absolutely delicious and you can eat it cold even over a
salad I've been in many times before but just don't waste that feeling all right
guys if you are ready to roll up your sleeves for a very tasty budget-friendly
meal prep then let's get started poke a few holes in some red potatoes
then bake for 45 to 50 minutes at 400 once baked allow them to cool and cut
off the top scoop out the inside to create a bowl and set aside repeat with
the remaining potatoes mash up the potato flesh then add Greek
yogurt Dijon garlic dill and chives mix it up well before adding in some cheddar
and Drain tuna add a pinch of sea salt and pepper along with some olive oil
then mix it up add the filling to each potato then top them off with pepper and
a pinch of cheddar bake for another 15 to 20 minutes enjoy these bad boys with
some grilled veggies my favorite is to cook some garlicky grilled asparagus

bye guys 
what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen now you are going to love today's video because it's
all about a concept I like to call tasty peel delicious food that powers our
fitness goals and I got the idea because I recently returned from a trip to
Salzburg Austria and I was there with red bull meeting with several other
athletes competing in the ex outs which literally is the world's toughest
adventure race it's roughly a 12 day race over seven countries 1200
kilometres these athletes they are running they're hiking they're
paragliding they're pushing their bodies to the absolute max so supplies to say
they are burning and insane amount of calories per day and I met with two of
the athletes and they talked about being on a fat adaptive diet and at the risk
of oversimplifying it's based on the premise and the proven studies that fat
is a better source of longer-term energy for aerobic exercise with carbohydrates
the energy that it provides tends to be used that much faster and you end up
hitting a wall or feeling fatigued perhaps you have felt that before so
having a fad adaptive diet a diet that is much more higher in fat would make a
lot of sense for endurance athletes or people that have going to workout if
this sounds a lot like keto it is pretty similar even with that adaptive diet you
can still add in some carbohydrates either before or after the competition
or after training session because you do want to give your muscles some energy to
be able to work with so it is very similar to keto except for the strategic
addition of carbohydrates either before or after the competition or the training
session now bringing this full circle there are some applications for the
everyday person perhaps you are one of the hundreds of people who have emailed
me to say that you cannot eat several times a day that your job or your work
environment is not conducive for that and that you need a meal or foods that
you can eat that will provide lasting energy over a longer period of time
until you can get to your next meal or perhaps you're that person out there
that is trying to gain weight and you have got to increase your caloric intake
but you want to do that but also still maintain a fairly lean
a fat adaptive that could be a viable option for you and it is largely
individual based because it is based on performance and how you feel and the
progress towards your goals so today I want to share with you all a high energy
a high fat meal we are making my enduring tax there are few meals out
there that are as versatile as breakfast hash because you can easily tweak the
quantity of the ingredients in order to scale the recipe so whether you're
eating for endurance for weight loss or weight gain my easy breakfast hash can
meet your needs this meals can literally go from 800
plus calories for the endurance athlete scaled all the way down to about 400
calories per serving for the average Joe and Jane now I'm going to walk you
through today's recipe I'm going to discuss each ingredient and why we're
using it so that way you can get a better feel of how you can tweak this
recipe to meet your specific need now if you are ready to roll up your sleeve and
make them tasty fuel then let's get started
first we're going to prep the bedroom we're going to start by chopping up a
red bell pepper since we're not adding any seasonings and herbs bell pepper has
a lot of flavor plus it's rich in potassium which helps
muscle function and regulating blood pressure
next chop-busting law zucchini zucchini is a good source of vitamin C which
helps build immunity since intense exercise and training tends to wear on
the body chop the ends up butternut squash and slice into ring then cut off
the outer layer of the skin and chop it into small chunks I'm adding butternut
squash as a hearty and filling low-carb alternative to potato enough to provide
muscle energy while still remaining a fat focus meal lastly we're chopping up
one chicken sausage which will provide protein flavor and some fat Nick's at
avocado or olive oil to a cast-iron skillet toss in the butternut squash
cook it until it for about eight minutes into the outside of it turns brown and
begins to soften then toss in zucchini and cook for about two minutes before
tossing in the red bell pepper and chicken sausage
cook everything together for five minutes didn't make two holes in the
skillet for eggs which will add protein and boost of fat content crack in the
egg and allow it to cook until the clear part has turned white lastly add a ripe
avocado to boost the fat content and to make the dish creamy and easier to eat
when mixed together garnish with cilantro sea salt and pepper as you can
see you can easily tweak the amount of each ingredient to complement your need
so this is a very easy meal guys that you can whip up in 15 to 20 minutes each
morning if you carve out the time for a filling once told me you would either
find the time to do it or you will find and excuse what the choice is always
yours the ratio breakdown for this meal is about 60% fat 20% protein in 20%
carbohydrates which is a common ratio breakdown or a high fat meal thanks dad

I want to leave you with this thought a lot of us are into accounting our
calories and being really scientific about it just remember that not all fats
and calories are created equal eating a pint of your favorite ice cream
it may have similar calories with that will necessarily translate into
performance and endurance so remember to fuel your body with real food and
nutritious food reading alright y'all I want to thank y'all for watching until
next time keep it healthy but of course never ever bored Oh bye 
we're going to go exploring. Yah, da
ist gut! here is part 2 of my adventure in Salzburg Austria from
sampling local cuisine to shopping the city market and exploring more the
beautiful countryside I try to stretch my three days as much as possible it's
hard to leave no stone unturned such a short time when everything your eye
catches seemingly tells a story like you're watching a 4k television
it's just that picturesque nonetheless here's my college try this my friend is
my love footage g'day mate bigger than a lot of you would be able to forget there
are no kangaroos no kangaroos guys wrong please tell me why the mannequins here
in Austria they're like mad dick tell me that these
ain't big just oh my god the guy's looking at I swear I'm not a perv forget
her there's be good for you here oh you got to push the button do that that's what we're going it's
beautiful castle one of the things I loved about downtown Salzburg is that
around every corner there was a new discovery a new square with small cafes
steps leading to nowhere crowded alleys lying with stores and a
Mozart chocolate shop on every corner it was like the city within a city within
another city we just made it to the top of the castle it's about 65 degrees
it's just now beginning to fit tell me why you're robbed here all peaceful and
all of a sudden there's a monsoon to take and I'm wearing a white shirt hey
that's okay the third cup right trying to find the correct ground right now I'm
gonna butcher books term draw get crushed to the ground he said we've
arrived this is it son bro oh what a nice Twinkie place storing bra was the site of my first
taste of Austrian cuisine we had cured beef gelatin with Syrian pumpkin seed
oil overall very delicious new flavor yet the texture was gritty and
unfamiliar Wienerschnitzel to my surprise was not
exhausted rather flavorful lightly fried filled it paired well with the parts of
potatoes we finished the entrees the signature beef goulash with pork sausage
for dessert we had Salzburger no-fee stick it into the eye but actually very
light to take women whenever they want to cook we're doing this you'll always
go for stuff like spaghetti always always you know I what a little doing
this one over you need time to clean your house make yourself updated on with
Emmett build it again you put the pot on the world to do your makeup you come
back you drain it to make this hot yeah okay on you I'd say huh yes I see that
see the armor you have a lot to remove a condom when you're working on your new
editing you're a girl just like any man anything at the turn-on right there
music hello allo and gutentag right is that one
oh that's a new one service as well yeah oh okay
so where we going right now okay then okay so here's a random fact about me
my ideal vacation getaway is not a beach it would be similar to the peaceful fuso
countryside there's a calmness here that really appeals to me here I got talking
about the gladiator why everybody know when they talk it
actually sounds really officious and everything sounds like it was coffee
without strong me so morning y'all pretty sure you're you're in the western
hemisphere you're probably getting me up right now just want to know how do you
like to have your morning coffee like that you know basic black picturesque very sweet and the crust is actually
really buttery but it's not that's like nice elegant it really survives sweet
but it's very subtle an overpowering today's lunch times food adventure in
the place where off the lake yes I'm country so I made a mini
sandwich here that leti recommended so like Wow now for the main course
Wow look at that just beautiful become flaky why am i rendered this
beautifully cooked it was melt in your mouth savory flavor
dude almost like chicken look at that outfit
stop setup by air skill that's cool so we're downtown Salzburg and we're
going to go exploring this is a supermarket see how you agree to right
away with the fresh produce thing I love about and European markets that they're
sort ministry to look out like why this is the regular grocery store and usually
one in the state they have the first you want to get this but look at this
assortment of Jesus oh is the ones that they have come on so run let's see I
think they may have it is if they're right it is the eighth one can we be
skillet two slices will it them disappear thank you
most of them what do you think we did like is it uh is it salty a
little coffee don't really know how to discern but it almost kind of melting in
my signature of it really doesn't and walking I walk and walk and walk as
a Texan I Drive everywhere but one of my big takeaway from this trip would be
importance of appreciating fitness and the small thing something as basic as
walking to the store can add much more value to our journey than an intense
stare master cardio session nice to see this question today this is where we
were the other day when it was with you raining and we come back building full
of people get a glass in the face I can see we're getting outside very nice
lunchtime sprayer got it this way people is a deception behind me on the street
is one of the main markets in Salzburg it's only open on Fridays and Saturdays
so we actually happen to be in town for it I'm going to go exploring and with
the hat you're supposed to have a lot of organic products a lot of real artisan
crafts homemade jewelry other things like that so I want to do a little taste
of Salzburg here we go the Austrian snaps worth delicious not overly sweet
like syrup mozart shuffle ITAT every stand balls of
marzipan coated and praline creams dipped and bittersweet chocolate I had
an amazing find of handmade spoon made from apricot ruin this gel is Mozart
solo so yeah the Terminator is by far not the most famous Austrian I love
g-shock but I've been meaning to graduate in to broaden my ground I've
never had a middle one or two German brand the real chocolate store here
chocolate from the original maker of the Mozart Effect this is one of the
truffles on the track in is Penelope White's office I love this new performer
that looks like tattooed oh my god it's like he's flying today's lunchtime adventure is at bro
cafe like a little man is sharp it's right
here straight game but not penises pineapple
sauce with a french fry that's grubs ready chips it's challenging to say
goodbye or even see you later to a place filled with so much beauty
but therein lies one of the biggest lessons I learned from this trip to
appreciate the beauty I already have around me I spent long moments gazing at
rolling hills and ornate architecture and savoring every bite of food wishing
it was my normal we often placed a higher value on things that are forward
to it while this coming what we have so I may not be an elite actually quite yet
or maybe never but I can eat and train like one and be inspired by their
courage I may not have rolling hills outside my window but the view of the
sunset is inspiring the grass is green on my side of a fence - and that's what
exploration teaches us that there's more to life so we can expect dream and work
for more you you 
what's going on guys and welcome back to the fit minute kitchen today's cookie recipe is a delicious one we are making a quick and easy tickets in Anchorage and if you're not familiar with the dish it is from Thailand now growing up in Texas I ate a whole lot of soul food and Mexican food when I went off to college I landed my palate had my first bite it is delicious and guess what I had the power to prove it but the whole experience taught me a whole lot about the importance of branching out beyond my boards and making my diet interesting and the same can be said about a healthy diet but the more that you branch out and try different foods and the more you put your own healthy spin on some comfort food favorites the more exciting your journey will be check this recipe out spread fill it with coconut oil and toss in chopped chicken breast sear the outside of the chicken for about five minutes and put it into a separate Bowl no worries if the chicken is not completely cooked using the same skillet add coconut oil and allow it to melt if needed then add red onions to caramelize the onions for about two minutes then add red curry paste peanut butter human and fish sauce stir everything together for about one or two minutes then add coconut milk coconut sugar and ginger stir it up and cook until smooth bring it to a simmer then add chopped broccoli carrot and bell pepper finally toss in the chicken cover and cook everything together for 15 to 20 minutes he has a taste with sea salt and pepper and garnish with mint cilantro and fresh lime boom smash that like button then head over to fit Minkus calm to get the full recipe and remember to download the fit native apps on iPhone and Android some more easy healthy practical music 
what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen well we are wrapping up 2017 and I know that many of
us when it gets to this time of year we're in that phase it's just like I
said I'll just start at the top of the year again
just throw the whole diet away and I'll start brand new January first and I
empathize with that a lot because I do find myself having that same feeling but
it also got me thinking that sometimes you just don't have to do that all you
need to do is just kind of reset and do a makeover so the other day I was
sitting here thinking about enchiladas if you've never had them before they are
super saucy it's some meat or some savory protein wrapped up and some sauce
wrapped in some flour tortillas it's covered with cheese and sauce it's
decadent it's great but it is very high on the calories and it is not skimp on
flavor so it got me thinking about another way that you can challenge
yourself is to take those foods that you really really love and then remake them
in a much more calorie conscious way it's a great way to help you to improve
your kitchen confidence in your kitchen competency but also to help you curb
those cravings whenever you're having them so today I'm gonna show you all a
delicious and easy way to make over some enchiladas we are making low carb
chicken enchiladas accompanied by a Spanish inspired cauliflower rice if
you're wanting to make this recipe a little bit more keto friendly you can
swap out the chicken breasts for chicken thighs you could even incorporate some
mashed avocado or some guacamole once the meal is finish and you can go just a
little bit lighter on some of that enchilada sauce I guarantee it's not
gonna compromise the flavor at all it's actually gonna boost it a whole but
alright if you are ready to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty because
there will be some elbow work required today because it's easy but it is very
intricate then let's get started first add a little olive oil garlic red onion
and a pinch of turmeric and two you cook everything together for about
three minutes until fragrant then at chicken chorizo and mix everything
together for three more minutes to make the hole in the skillet to add raw
cauliflower all right mix it up then make another small hole for tomato paste
and chicken or veggie broth mix it up then add fresh cilantro a pinch of sea
salt and pepper then remove it from the heat garnish with more cilantro and fresh
lime juice next bring a pot of water to a boil then add chicken breasts cook for
about 12 to 15 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink let the
chicken breasts cool then pull them apart then we're going to make thin
slices of zucchini using a mandolin about the thickness of a penny for best
results you want to Pat the slices dry using a paper towel because zucchini
holds a lot of water add olive oil garlic and red onion to a skillet and
saute for three minutes then add chili powder and oregano cook for an
additional two minutes before adding the chicken breast mix it up then stir in
red or green enchilada sauce now let's bring it all together overlap four
pieces of zucchini then add a serving of the enchilada
chicken sauce roll it up then place it in a baking dish add the remaining sauce
then top it off with your choice of cheese I'm using a Mexican inspired
cheese blend of Monterey cheddar and Asadero bake in the oven for 15 minutes
at 350 or until the cheese melts boom enjoy with Spanish inspired cauliflower
rice with chorizo smash that like button then head over to

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen as you can see I don't have anything sauteing or
boiling or steaming right now in the background it's just me and you I do
have some infants going because I cook mad garlic and onion and got the whole
place to know and like Thanksgiving morning up in here one of the really
cool things about this place that I'm in and writing this book is that I feel
like I'm in a really creative place and my publisher bless her heart she is
challenging me more and more to consolidate my ideas just for this book
and to save some of the other stuff for other books and other projects and it's
a challenge because aside from all the recipes I also want to share a little
bit about my journey and how I've been able to navigate this healthy lifestyle
now for what almost five years going so all that to say I've been writing a
whole lot and when I feel something I'm going to write it down but today's video
is actually inspired by a recent experience that I had when I was in the
gym and it's about being and a diet rut about being in your own diet depression
and I call it a diet depression because that's what it feels like whenever
you're in that rut it's debilitating you are disenchanted you're not motivated to
try new foods and you hit a brick wall and you feel that you can't move past it
a young guy came up to me he said hey I've lost some weight I've got at least
16 more pounds to go and I had to lose this weight because I really want to try
out for the Marines I was trying to share some ideas with him and they got
me thinking that it's less about him hitting this weight plateau
he was really asking a question about how can I get motivated again rather
than write this stuff down and share it later I wanted to share it now so with
that being said I want to share with you all five things that I did to dig myself
out of my own diet depression my own diet rut the first thing I did to dig
myself out of a diet rut is I had to get understanding meaning get perspective
about what's going on in my life I had to become a lot more self aware of
the external factors that oftentimes influence the choices that we make is
their emotional drama at work is an emotional drama at home with you and the
kids or you and wifey what are those things that are happening right now in
your life that are influencing your decision not to get too personal but at
the very beginning of this year I went through a breakup and it was really
disappointing cause it was something that I really enjoyed and I thought it
was going to last but it didn't last and at the time I was working out I had a
strict diet and I was doing all that and so when that breakup happened I slowly
began to back away from that and I didn't really realize I was dissatisfied
with where I was and so I was projecting that on to everything else
I began to become dissatisfied with my workout I became dissatisfied with my
diet and so incrementally I started to make these different decisions that that
move me farther away from my fitness goals and from my diet goals and I had
to confront the truth that a lot of things that were happening with me
emotionally we're also influencing my dietary decision so you've got to make
up your mind and you've got to get perspective about what's going on in
your life it don't even have to be that deep it could be you are working more
hours at work you've just moved to a brand new city and you don't know the
area very well give perspective about what's going on and once you get
perspective and you can begin to deal with those underlying issues the second
thing I did is this idea I like to call a dropping bread crumb go back to what
you were doing when you first started your diet when you were feeling happy
about healthy eating when you were meal prepping I asked myself the same
question and I and I wrote it down and one of my first diet was these are some
of the foods I was eating I was having a v8 and a salad a Lean Cuisine some
turkey hotdogs chicken breast brown rice and salad and fruits as as dessert and
please don't write me yes I know the lot of that service process but hey it's
what I was doing and just the memory of this it got me smiling
they got me fun because I remember how I felt I felt so accomplished I felt so
OnPoint and even though I wouldn't buy some of these foods right now
immediately it gave me some ideas about what I could do be doing right now if I
wanted to add some variety to my diet and don't take my word for it you can
look at some of the professional athletes you watch them oftentimes when
they're going through some of their loads what they'll do is they will go
back to their old high school coach or there are all that middle school coaches
they'll go back to their parents who are coaching them for four and work with
this why is that important when they were working with them they were in love
with their sports they were loving it and they felt it and they want to get
back to that so that's what you have to do here with your diet go back to what
you were doing before go back to your old routines it could ignite that fire
that will get you back on the road to eating well again the third thing I did
to get out of the diet rut was I changed my environment and I changed up my
routine in order to get variety in my life one thing that I love to do is I
love to shop around at different supermarkets
I live in downtown Dallas but I will go all the way at like 20 30 miles out some
time to go to a different work store and people will see me they said hey I don't
know you the two lived over here I don't but there is a lot of value in
changing up your environment different supermarkets and different areas they
will offer different products and different foods and it's in those
product offerings that allows you to get new variety and new ideas into your own
diet and the reality is if you don't switch up your environment you're always
going to have what you have and it's funny how you will go to different
stores searching for a shoe a brand new t-shirt a dress why won't you do that
when it comes to your diet and this is especially true for ethnic cuisine many
cities have different pockets so here in Dallas you can go to a Japanese food
store Indian Market a Mexican essential American market and all these different
places provide you with different products so that you can enrich your own
diet and lastly on this topic of changing your environment getting
variety eat out don't be so concerned about
being super healthy that you are zip locking your entire life new experiences
eating out and enjoying the military pole really helps us to socialize and it
brings us together and if you can't afford to well you can also eat end but
have seemed nice so one night you're going to make a great Mexican dish
another night and Italian night whatever it is whether you eat out or stay in you
can make it work for you the fourth thing I did to get myself out
of the diet rut is I had food challenges on fit men cook calm I post monthly food
calendars that has a food challenge really every single week and I did this
because I wanted to mirror what I was doing in my own personal lives each week
I would challenge myself to try a brand new food and I look forward to trying
something new every single week so when we try out a brand new vegetable and I
would go into the internet do a search for healthy recipes with that vegetable
and then go and make it and other days I would say all right I'm going to try out
a brand new complex carbohydrate because I'm tired of just eating quinoa rice and
sweet potato expand my horizon and all those things led to my kitchen
competency my confidence in the kitchen and it allowed me to be able to
understand how to pair foods together so that way I can get variety and have a
really enriched diet often times we have anxiety about eating out or just foods
in general because we lack the knowledge so having these food challenges in place
allows you to experiment with new food and lastly one of the final things I did
to get myself out of a diet rut is I never stopped learning one of my
favorite scriptures is the concept that we all have heard before and it's
reaping and sowing whatever you sow you will reap in other religions it's Karma
when the philosophy doing good and the universe is going to get back to you but
whatever concept you believe in understand this whenever you nourish
your body with healthy foods your body responds positively so whenever you are
able to nourish your mind about new diets and trends and foods you're able
to take those things and apply them to your own life as needed in the way that
you can sustain and that you can manage that makes sense for you never get to a
place where you that you just know it all whenever you
get to that point that's when you stop growing so be yourself new ideas and new
perspectives this is particularly true if you are in the health and wellness
industry but you're on the service side so you are a trainer you are a motivator
you are a nutritionist you are a coach you are somebody that people have deemed
as a resource you are a cookie dog meaning people see you and they see
cookies and they reach their hand in they take it out and they eat it
very rarely do people put cookies back into the jar and so what happens to you
then you yourself are emptied out and you don't haven't enough substance for
you to dig yourself out of your own diet right so if you find yourself as the
only resource for everyone around you then still help people but you've got to
find yourself another place where people can pour into you where you aren't the
smartest person in the room where you're feeling challenged and that way you can
have a sufficient supply of cookies for all those hungry people that you are
empowering and helping out everybody finds themselves at a place where
they're not feeling as motivated but the difference between those people and
everybody else is how they respond how are you going to respond to your own
diet it's time to get up from the couch stop feeling sorry for yourself
stop lamenting those five pounds of to loss that you already gained back last
weekend it's time to get over it understand your surroundings drop
breadcrumbs and go back to those basics change your environment your routine and
get variety have some healthy food challenges and number five never stop
learning well that's it for today's video I hope that you all enjoyed it to
some degree we have all experienced that that place where we're not feeling as
enthusiastic about this healthy journey so understand that your circumstances
right now are not uncommon you want that special you're special but you aren't
that special and what's going to separate you from everybody else is how
you respond to this you can continue to wallow in the diet rut like I did for
years or you can take your diet by the ring and guide yourself
out of this and once you do it this one time you're going to be able to do this
every single time I guarantee I don't worry about this anymore
because I know how to find my way back to that impassioned place where I'm
excited about my diet I'm excited about healthy living if you like videos like
this I invite you to hit that like button below but more so than that I
want you to take just a couple seconds and if you've ever been in a diet rut I
want you to share your experience below in the comment section and also share
how you got out of that diet rut and it's through these ideas through the
sharing of all of these ideas that our community is going to continue growing
and thriving again I want to thank y'all for watching until next time I want to
try to keep it healthy but of course never ever boring Oh bye 
well some awesome that is really good and that makes me really happy you know I was super nervous I think I was more nervous about this launch than the actual pit main cook one before him because it's just you just never really know and now because social media has changed so much the way that we engage on social has changed even even myself I don't really go and engage pages and pages a lot but I will just read and consume the content so I just had no idea if we're gonna look at for naught I loved it when I had it in my hand so I knew that people once they downloaded it they would actually like it but I just had to get to that first step first but um yeah y'all had an amazing response to it so thank you all very much yeah a lot of nice pause there I can stare and you can read them yeah some very nice positive comments here from people so I yeah that's what I see okay awesome I can't see the comments but under so I'm gonna ask you to read some of those and coffee black by name if I could see your comments right now then I would say something to you but I appreciate the love we're gonna go ahead and get started right now so what we wanted to do was just have a quick hang out with you all to answer your questions about meal prep the new app and everything in between relating to cooking food in both because we realize that it's a it's a trending topic that we've been talking about for years as you can following the channel but right now it's a really relevant topic the first thing that I want to start out with though I wanted to get the app questions out of the way so we can kind of get into some of the meat meat you bones if there are tons of questions out there about it but as I'm talking if you have a question just go ahead and write it down or put it into the chat window and then Andres will feed them to me also if you have questions about the app go ahead and jot those down too because he's gonna be addressing some of those the first topic that I wanted to talk about is the Android I hope my Android users are out there if you've got an Android shout out something there like in the comment section but I want to say first off to the Android community thank you all for for your support of the fitnah community as we you know dive into app development so I got a lot of questions about when is the app going to come to Android when it's metal prep for that and the reality is guys this is strictly a numbers games and it's got to be financially viable for us to be able to I said a couple months ago whenever we launched the Android app on with with the regular ethicacy app it did very very well and I said to preface that is that a lot of people within the industry said don't build an app for Android because you won't see the return I'm not going to name the brand buy main but a really big brand a huge chef brand said don't do it you won't see the return we did it anyway because it's really important to us that everyone around the world can experience the awesomeness of the fit min could app because on base can build a really awesome app but here's the reality we are now what is that like five months in that we launched in March so what is that March well you guys I had trouble counting that I swear dude hey hey June July so about four to five months in already and hundreds of thousands of downloads we haven't been broken even in stark contrast to the iPhone app which you know we were able to break even very quickly the thing about app development is that you know the money that the app kits that we get from the app and the revenue from it that a significant portion goes back into development because we got tons of requests from around the world so we're really trying to quickly implement those in fact when we lost on Android we had a really positive response from an analyst team from from Google Play and the analyst said you know what we should feature this app and they passed it on to get featured and the people that were going to feature they had they came back to us within one day and said hey you know what could you make a couple changes to it we don't like this we don't like that blah blah blah we said to the app let's go ahead and do it and we did those chains a couple thousand dollars by the way not complaining and then we sent it back to them at the changes and they said well you know what just think there's too much white space here you change this around blah blah blah and it was just this crazy thing because we had already had five star reviews and now tens of thousands of downloads and so we weren't featured on them because we're like hey we run back away from this because it sounds like you are designing our app more so in doing it in such a way that really doesn't line up with the positive feedback reality is a lot of people are downloading the Android app free but they're not downloading the premium version and when you download the premium version that money goes back into development so we can continue to make improvements we're always going to push the push new recipes but we want to add new features so people in Android if you have the Android app and get the free version consider upgrading to the premium version and we can use that data to inform how well this new mill prep Pro app will perform on Android once we move there because we would love to but again it's just gotta make financial sense and right now the numbers are against us for months and hundreds of thousands of downloads and we haven't broken even yet under this is that pretty accurate err yeah I mean I'd love nothing more for them for us to be able to take on a full-time Android developer to just start building all these features that have come to the to the iPhone app but unless you know unless people are prepared to upgrade then there's just no way to do that you know we've not even made back the money from the first version so it's very difficult to say okay you know what let's spend like an extra ten twenty thirty thousand dollars or whatever the cost will be to kind of build all of these extra features but you know when we haven't yet seen that kind of movement but at the same time you know it's amazing to have the Android app out there and it you know it's really really great to see like all those amazing reviews of the Android version as well if people are really excited and like we you know yeah we've been waiting to bring it to Android for so long selves as well like this is a huge moment to kind of publish the Android version and pretty much with no hiccups at all I don't think like we've had you know I I don't think I've seen any comments like oh this is crashing or anything like that so I think people are really really really happy with the Android edition which is amazing yeah yeah yeah so people on Android consider upgrading to help us out with the development costs and and we can use that data to inform how quickly we can do something with the milk Pro app to get it onto the Android platform because it is a priority but again the data have to make sense so really appreciate you understanding that and there's a couple of nice people I'm sorry this is nice people here jumping in the comments talking about yeah like not having understood the complexities previously kind of thing and talking about maybe us doing like a Kickstarter or something like that so that's really nice to hear from people that they kind of understand what we're what we're kind of getting at here I know that sometimes maybe some of the big companies make it look like oh yeah we're just kind of you know an app it's quick our fingers and it will magically appear and there's a couple of nice people here posting comments that they've just upgraded so which usually we appreciate thank you that's I'm talking about the immediate pepper feedback thank you it actually means a whole lot when we do stuff like that so all right with that I actually want to move on with the conversation that's pretty tent that's pretty related and that's what the meal prep Pro app launch did amazingly will very very well it's surpassed probably about three times the amount of momentum from the from the first launch right on iPhone if you look at the total number of people that actually engaged in downloads the app which is great so thank you all for doing that I think I'm so proud of this app that's very sexy app first off it looks and feels good in your hand and so on today and his team did an amazing job it was one year in the making I hope that you all spent some time looking at the documentary that we posted and also reading the blog on the website because it kind of goes into the background of what we had to do for this new app the reason why it looks the way it is the fuels away it is because it genuinely did come from you all you all save this ethnic from by by by giving us quality feedback so spend some time and look at that I want Andres so even though the app was great it was fantastic we had a couple of hiccups and these were all positive things like I people were messages and that was because we had reached the capacity of the number of users that we could add in a given period and so we were looking at capacity issues no store additions and other things like that so these are really good things that have have you know I don't want Andres to kind of walk through we have already submitted an update that you know the error messages that you are perceiving that very soon from the App Store but I guess if you want to walk through some things that we're doing for version 1.01 yeah definitely so we really you know we've really pushed it right up to the deadline we were sort of you know finishing off all of these features and you know it was a real it was really quite a mad to three months in the run-up to the launch so we didn't have quite as much time as we would have loved to have had to kind of got it in front of some more people and kind of spotted some of these things but as soon as some of these queries have been coming back and we've been trying to answer them within you know a couple of hours to make sure that everybody knows we're listening and yeah we've sort of version one point not one is currently waiting for Apple to approve it so as soon as they approve it you'll see some of the most kind of crucial things that a couple of people identified we've already solved those so we've already kind of ticked those off and you know there's a few things for the Spanish users a couple of things for people that were noticing some odd kind of ingredients and things like that so all of those kind of things we've solved we had a really interesting problem list they were trying to selves with some people when they first signed up they beginning some odd error messages and we're kind of messaging the Google support team because that shouldn't be happening so we're really sort of as fast as possible trying to get these new versions out for everybody because obviously the sooner we can get through these kind of key issues the sooner we can start focusing on some of the bigger things that people have been telling us about absolutely can you talk a little bit about one thing that I really want to stress was the the meals in how and how we're gonna be mixing it up because I think there was a little bit of confusion that probably could have gone into more depth on the video and how the in cook app differs a little bit from the difference from from milk back pro but basically the concern is are there gonna be new recipes attitude is that and the answer is yes but I went on the frequency a bit yeah definitely so if myself and Kevin we've been talking about this a fair bit and we definitely want to have like we want to set a set a date in the calendar and say you know what like at the start of every month or on the first meal prep Sunday of every month you will see new recipes in your prep Pro so we're just sort of figuring out exactly how to do that right now and we definitely want to sort of have a constant stream of new recipes and what we've heard from people is that they really want a lot of extra breakfast to choose from and a lot of extra snacks to choose from so those are two areas that we're really going to focus on and really sort of expand on you know you've got to remember that two years ago the fit Maine cook app launched with a hundred recipes and it now has over 300 recipes so we're sort of expecting a similar thing with meal prep Pro where you know every month at the same date will just add a whole bunch of new recipes of people will make sure that those are kind of very clear inside the app so that you can always see oh cool these are the new ones for me to add to my plan and to try out kind of thing right right and and the thing just just really quickly the Alexa T of the meal prep Pro is a little bit more so than fit main cook which is by design so fit me and cook you I literally just me like in the kitchen I'm experimenting my tossing stuff out there that I think could be good in summer those recipes may end up bro the meal prep Provost these are designed from a macronutrient standpoint so as we design the recipes we are looking at the macronutrient breakdown so that way they can complement the meal plan so this will in this next easier for us first off to be able to to be able to build well to able to like allow you all to build your own meal plans but it does it it's just not as easy dishes just to grab that you grabbing like a recipe from you know from me and then putting into the app so we're actually being very thoughtful about the way that the recipes are actually added in there and just so you know to just two quick caveat just so you know what it goes on behind the scenes or let's say that we have to first calculate all the stuff we're gonna get them certified by a nutritionist to make sure that they are okay from a macronutrient breakdown standpoint make sure that the numbers and the data makes sense when you look at the overall meal plan some of the micronutrients after that we've got a filament and then we also have a translator and they have to translate this to Spanish and then once all that stuff is collected then we have to take that and then submit that to Apple there's the Apple review too so it's not just as simple as just pushing out recipes whenever we want to those things I have to build the Apple to make sure that there's quality yes so we're we're sort of going through that process right now so we're sort of investigating that right now for for keto so right now we're sort of in the early stages of doing all the research making sure that you know if we do add keto that we've got the right sort of tips in there about the diet and things like that so we don't really want to just said yeah I'm vegan so yeah so you know and and so we'll go away we'll start it's finding the recipes we've got to create all the different calorie levels we've got to sort of make sure that these recipes are meal prep and pour their simple then we've got to sort of write them down film them take any pictures for any additional recipes so that's this ton of work that goes into to meal prep Pro which is why it's so different to fit and cook and you know a lot of everything that we built with with fitmin cook was the result of feedback from the fit men cook app and how people wanted us to kind of take the fit men cook app and go to the next level with meal prep so that we can really sort of make it something incredibly simple to to follow and that's what's introduced a ton of extra complexity on our end but that then makes it for the user incredibly simple to follow obviously where those are the updates from the version 1.01 yeah I think so yeah we've yeah so that should be out in the next day or two depending on when Apple just tick it off kind of thing okay and then one other thing that we are looking at guys is that is that there was some concern and this was actually it was looking back at this in hindsight and exit kind of made perfect sense but allowing people to use the app without putting in the credit card information first the people that actually trust trust the process and thrust this there were you know that it's legit thank you for doing that but there are some users who are concerned about putting in their information prior you know and then prior to being able to like use the app so we are trying to figure out the functionality around that so if there's a way that we can allow like a test trial or maybe like a generic you know I only want to speak on it because I don't want to promise something that we can't deliver but just know that we heard that concern and at the top of our list so that we're not trying to take your money and scam people you know be worried if you see me posting some pictures on Instagram in front of a Lamborghini with some shaker cups and my ass out you worry big we are hard at work behind the theme to answering your questions okay yes are there any questions that have come out and by the way when he was talking I was thinking somebody on Twitter because they had just downloaded the app so for Android so EJ pal appreciate your broker doing that and you know an upgrade about the apps about you can get me talked about so far before I go over a sort of quickfire wands Mitch Woodside here saying they've she's downloaded here all the recipes the same for everybody every week no everybody gets a sort of different plan with the app generates for you there have been a few people that have asked about they want to be able to print off the shopping list some people I don't even own a printer anymore but people want to be able to print off the shopping list that's something that will definitely add a few people asking about Kito again so we kind of covered that briefly there but it's definitely kind of really high up in our priority list so if somebody asking there about swapping some of the meals from the fit maker cap into meal prep probes we kind of covered that briefly just to say that you know a lot of the the fit men cookout meals are not suitable for meal prep Pro because they're a different macro breakdown or you know perhaps they don't take some of the other kind of quite strict boxes that we have for for meal prep Pro but if there's a specific recipe that you'd love to see come to meal prep pros well like make sure you send us a message and we'll see whether we can adapt that somehow to bring it to meal prep Pro as well but unfortunately it's not as simple as saying hey just grab this recipe and just shove it in meal prep Pro unfortunately somebody else asking that they do repeated breakfast and lunch for simplicity I think a few people want the ability David Cantor there who's been posting some very nice comments so a few people want the ability to basically you know only meal prep Monday to Friday and not prep on the weekend you know we've we've sort of seen a ton of variation here on what people want to do and we're looking to add some features in that area as well so that you could just save a plan and then just repeat it next week if you want to so if you find like you know if the the turkey bacon breakfast is your thing and you just want to eat that all the time then we're looking for a way that we can just sort of always have that in place there for you so you don't have to kind of constantly make that change so yeah ton of great questions I can keep going unless you want to keep here on the rest this is one from Twitter from Brian Seattle he said that you wanted to the app to be a little bit more flexible is there a way to plan less than a week yeah definitely so right now what you could do is you could change your Saturday and Sunday to be per market as eating out so then the app won't give you any recipes for the weekend but we're looking for sort of a more advanced way of doing that but for now that's one way to make sure that the app is only giving you content from Monday to Friday because I know a lot of people like to kind of go off on the weekend and do their own thing a few people asked about it be on iPad and it is already on iPad so if you're not seeing it on iPad then you need to be on the latest version of iOS and then you know it's definitely on iPad already okay my computer went to sleep I think if something happened I got kicked off for a second so I miss your answer but I hope that Brian from Seattle got that okay are there any other questions about the app because I wanted to go over in just a couple of things in Mill Creek because I wanted to keep it right at 30 minutes and tips and things that I got via email I want to address yeah so a few people have asking sort of about the difference about with with the fam and cook up and the milk Pro app it's a good question I think as soon as somebody tries the meal grow up they'll kind of immediately get a sense of everything that's very very different there I think the way that we're trying to keep it simple to describe to people is basically picture the fit men cook up it's like you know amazing healthy recipes and picture the meal prep Pro app as more about the meal plants and more about meal prep and then I think you'll sort of start to understand some of the difference but definitely give the give the meal prep Pro app a try and I think you're very sort of quickly see you see it is quite a significantly different app right some people are talking about want one other thing that people are talking of is this idea of ingredient substitutions and a lot of people have very specific dietary requirements some people are not eating eggs cheese lactose is a very popular one so we really really want to bring this to both the fit men cookout and to the meal prep Pro app so it's something that we want to do it the right way so we don't want to hide from somebody that's got you know a lactose intolerance a whole bunch of the recipes what we would rather do is be able to show them those recipes but modified versions of those recipes that they can sort of change change up so we're trying to do it in a really really smart way but yes or if anybody out there with a dietary requirement or preference you know I'm getting a lot of comments from gluten-free celiac and so forth those things are absolutely crucial and we can't wait to bring it to both fit men cook and to meal prep Pro and I think you guys are going to be really impressed because I don't think anybody is going to do it quite as well as what we've kind of got in mind here yeah that says it's such a great call out because we get tons of tons of questions about that and even upon my own family we've got a couple of people you know well that food allergies and so I've been really thinking about how to do that same thing on on the pitman cook calm and so those questions we are actually actively working on right now and and Andres is right if I'm dressed as that then y'all gotta know that that you know what we're gonna come up with is gonna be much better then anything ever out there hey and we've got about five or so minutes left but can I touch on a couple of y'all's question the top and you know me and Andres just shout out some because I can't see the comments right now so just shout out something that you know someone could almost say something but um the first thing is that I get questions on like doing the whole milk prep process is this safe for me to go ahead and do and I think it's actually and it's a weird question but I also think it's a very smart question meal prep is very safe for you to do the thing that I would advise even if you get the meal prep Pro app is that the meal prep Pro app is designed for you to be very successful because it it structures everything but if you've never done healthy eating before then what I suggest is this start out with like one meal or just tunas at the max maybe breakfast and your lunch and just prep that and then get your confidence up because the thing that I started look the most and what I talk to people what I hear from people the most is that you will start really strong and then you will just hit like this clip and then just drop off because you lose your momentum and so what did the thing that you have to do is you want to build incremental success of that way you keep on going up so start very small prep one or two meals at the max and do that for a month or four weeks and see how you feel and then gradually get into it more and more the second thing you know it comes to meal prep the biggest question I've been receiving is about the storage even when you make the meals inside this app or just in general you want to think about storing stuff in the fridge for one or two days anything else that you're not going to eat within those two days I will just go ahead and freeze now there are different limits for that so well not limits but there are different freshness standards for those so technically meat like chicken and on beef can last fresh in the fridge for up to five days maybe fish seafood at the two or three days but I just say you know to heck with it all and just freeze the meal so after you build your meals if you're not gonna eat it within two days just put it in the freezer and the most important thing that you have to remember to do each night if you're going to eat a meal that's frozen is to put it into the fridge because if you don't you're gonna have to end up defrosting it in the microwave at work or something and that's not ideal you're gonna overcook the food it's going to become dry and that leads back to problem number one which you saying that I hate meal prep I can't do it anymore now defrost in the fridge and then reheat your food that way and that and that will lock in the most amount of freshness now this is not related to - no prep Pro app but what it also say is this if you have trouble they into the mode of cooking like individual meals what I like to do because since I'm cooking all the time I don't like to go for like big things like casseroles and other stuff like that that that's probably ideal for milk reps so what I'll do is I'll prep a big thing of like brown rice and quinoa and mix it up together I'll put in some like onions and cilantro with that all right and then I'll prep just some chicken breast and chop it up then I'll prep some beef or some fish and I'll have these little individually prepped items so that way each day I can build whatever meal I want I'll have some frozen veggies in the fridge and I can and one day I'll have broccoli the next day I had some sunlight green beans but that will allow you to kind of mix and match a lot more and there's nothing wrong with condiments so long as you don't have a lot more condiment than you do the actual meal but that will allow you to have a lot of variety and to trick your taste buds into thinking that you're eating something different each day so you can make just a bland thing of just like brown rice but one day you're gonna chop up some cucumber and some and some celery and some cilantro and put some feta cheese in there maybe two and some like you know let me it sounds good then it sounds really good right it's peace out and then that's on those two days we'll head out to the rice take that rice and you may put some cranberries in there or some almonds or something else and so you can keep on designing and changing up your diet each day without having to do this entire meal prep that forces you to eat just this casserole and just this so you can check out the you know sit and cook app which is both on the iPhone and Android and you can get some individual meal meal prep items for those things we all question sorry okay yeah good yeah we had a question there from Erica asking about are the ingredients for you and your partner added to the ingredients list or should I double it so the the new meal prep Pro app will actually work for two people so in your ingredients list you'll be seeing the amount they're listed for two people so if you've chosen to add a partner and while we're on the sort of topic of partners think we really want to do is we really want to feature you know couples that are using the new meal prep Pro and I getting fit together because we think that this is like a really sort of great unique thing and a really great way for for people to reach their their fitness goals is to work together so you know send any stories or any pictures like that in and we'd love to and and what we're gonna do is is we actually we quietly launched the new Pitman cook comm we're still making changes to it but I haven't announced it because I don't want the site to crash or anything like that just because we've got we're still working some things out with it but we're gonna begin to curate a lot of those stories that you all send us in your pictures and we want to put up a page where it's like cooking with Bay getting healthy with Bay and have your pictures and your stories about cooking stuff together with your partner there as well as share those out on social media I don't think we we've we've set an actual hashtag yet have we we need to set a hashtag so that way we can find the stories but right now this just hashtag fit men cook but we're gonna update that very soon but if you're cooking with your partner I want you take a photo together and in write us your story or just the photo in general so we can share that stuff out because you have no idea how motivating it is to see people like you doing it's like real people getting these real results it's so motivating for people around the world and my last thing is is this actually that's a great segue is when you're talking about cooking with your partner I get a lot of emails from from women or the come up to me and talk to me about trying to get their husband or their partner into cooking healthy with them and one thing that I find that women like to do is they like to say all right well let's clip together and they'll give them in like the salad or a side dish and I know I don't want to be like patriarchy or you know like macho but I find that I just think inside of every man regardless is that like we have like this intense desire to cook because in the past were hunters and gatherers for the family so give give the mail if you're trying to encourage him to cook healthy with you include him in that process so don't just relegate you-know-what and women to don't don't don't relegate their partner that you're trying to to get into help cooking into a very small portion of it don't give them the garden salad give them you know the lasagna with you and so they make one part of it and you make the other part but you're actually significantly doing it together there is a sense of accomplishment that that that comes along with it whenever you whenever you cook something that actually it's gonna add value to the diet so do that for that person definitely in this somebody is saying that they've they're about to close 26 years together so congratulating yo Yolanda Yolanda congratulations 26 years did that is amazing especially in the Facebook world where you can update your status at the drop of a little click so congrats those are goals right there yeah so yeah so really really thrilled that people are loving the cooking with your partner feature somebody was suggesting David is suggesting hashtag I don't fit my cook cooking with BAE as the as the hash tag cooking with BAE that's what we're gonna do you David appreciate you so everybody listening David from where where's he from to say it doesn't say what David's from though we're gonna say cooking with BAE and for people that don't know because you know that everyone knows what BAE is its BAE not be a Y like babies know it's cooking with BAE and they is before anyone else so it is your hardness your it sure can be that it's your cardio it'sit's it's your tool ever you know so yeah cooking with BAE you heard it first here on our on our little live session from David a couple of people asking if we're gonna post up this session afterwards maybe we could share the link somewhere this session right here oh it's not recorded yeah no it is recorded so we can set we can share them in quickly okay yeah I think it's gonna stream directly to the YouTube page right it should do publish there it should you okay if and will it's not will place that link on on Twitter or something absolutely you know I'm Facebook as well I'll see if I can also embed it on the fitmin cook concur we've got a really cool video feature there too that we can show but yeah yeah I'm so excited about this new journey that we're on so I'll put it out there this is the first this was the big thing like on my plate for the summer now it's gonna be like like tunnel vision to get done with the book the book is the recipes are finalized now we're just writing them up I've got to get them tested so I think pre-orders are gonna be open in the fall and I tell you what if you love the meal prep for app you're gonna love this book we really put a lot of effort and thought into this book and yeah I'm I'm very proud of what's to come so hey and guess what that book you can get on Android in the iPhone not that one Pacific well and on the windows or tuning in on drinks thank you for staying up late over there and burning on tape tell your family thank you thanks for allowing us to do that alright guys tweet us your questions also if you have any type of support issues at all be sure that you go through the app and you submit those questions because there's a support team in place and they are responding to all those questions very quickly as quickly as possible all right I appreciate y'all until next time I'm trying to keep it healthy but of course never ever born ooh 
we're going to go exploring. Yah, da
ist gut! here is part 2 of my adventure in Salzburg Austria from
sampling local cuisine to shopping the city market and exploring more the
beautiful countryside I try to stretch my three days as much as possible it's
hard to leave no stone unturned such a short time when everything your eye
catches seemingly tells a story like you're watching a 4k television
it's just that picturesque nonetheless here's my college try this my friend is
my love footage g'day mate bigger than a lot of you would be able to forget there
are no kangaroos no kangaroos guys wrong please tell me why the mannequins here
in Austria they're like mad dick tell me that these
ain't big just oh my god the guy's looking at I swear I'm not a perv forget
her there's be good for you here oh you got to push the button do that that's what we're going it's
beautiful castle one of the things I loved about downtown Salzburg is that
around every corner there was a new discovery a new square with small cafes
steps leading to nowhere crowded alleys lying with stores and a
Mozart chocolate shop on every corner it was like the city within a city within
another city we just made it to the top of the castle it's about 65 degrees
it's just now beginning to fit tell me why you're robbed here all peaceful and
all of a sudden there's a monsoon to take and I'm wearing a white shirt hey
that's okay the third cup right trying to find the correct ground right now I'm
gonna butcher books term draw get crushed to the ground he said we've
arrived this is it son bro oh what a nice Twinkie place storing bra was the site of my first
taste of Austrian cuisine we had cured beef gelatin with Syrian pumpkin seed
oil overall very delicious new flavor yet the texture was gritty and
unfamiliar Wienerschnitzel to my surprise was not
exhausted rather flavorful lightly fried filled it paired well with the parts of
potatoes we finished the entrees the signature beef goulash with pork sausage
for dessert we had Salzburger no-fee stick it into the eye but actually very
light to take women whenever they want to cook we're doing this you'll always
go for stuff like spaghetti always always you know I what a little doing
this one over you need time to clean your house make yourself updated on with
Emmett build it again you put the pot on the world to do your makeup you come
back you drain it to make this hot yeah okay on you I'd say huh yes I see that
see the armor you have a lot to remove a condom when you're working on your new
editing you're a girl just like any man anything at the turn-on right there
music hello allo and gutentag right is that one
oh that's a new one service as well yeah oh okay
so where we going right now okay then okay so here's a random fact about me
my ideal vacation getaway is not a beach it would be similar to the peaceful fuso
countryside there's a calmness here that really appeals to me here I got talking
about the gladiator why everybody know when they talk it
actually sounds really officious and everything sounds like it was coffee
without strong me so morning y'all pretty sure you're you're in the western
hemisphere you're probably getting me up right now just want to know how do you
like to have your morning coffee like that you know basic black picturesque very sweet and the crust is actually
really buttery but it's not that's like nice elegant it really survives sweet
but it's very subtle an overpowering today's lunch times food adventure in
the place where off the lake yes I'm country so I made a mini
sandwich here that leti recommended so like Wow now for the main course
Wow look at that just beautiful become flaky why am i rendered this
beautifully cooked it was melt in your mouth savory flavor
dude almost like chicken look at that outfit
stop setup by air skill that's cool so we're downtown Salzburg and we're
going to go exploring this is a supermarket see how you agree to right
away with the fresh produce thing I love about and European markets that they're
sort ministry to look out like why this is the regular grocery store and usually
one in the state they have the first you want to get this but look at this
assortment of Jesus oh is the ones that they have come on so run let's see I
think they may have it is if they're right it is the eighth one can we be
skillet two slices will it them disappear thank you
most of them what do you think we did like is it uh is it salty a
little coffee don't really know how to discern but it almost kind of melting in
my signature of it really doesn't and walking I walk and walk and walk as
a Texan I Drive everywhere but one of my big takeaway from this trip would be
importance of appreciating fitness and the small thing something as basic as
walking to the store can add much more value to our journey than an intense
stare master cardio session nice to see this question today this is where we
were the other day when it was with you raining and we come back building full
of people get a glass in the face I can see we're getting outside very nice
lunchtime sprayer got it this way people is a deception behind me on the street
is one of the main markets in Salzburg it's only open on Fridays and Saturdays
so we actually happen to be in town for it I'm going to go exploring and with
the hat you're supposed to have a lot of organic products a lot of real artisan
crafts homemade jewelry other things like that so I want to do a little taste
of Salzburg here we go the Austrian snaps worth delicious not overly sweet
like syrup mozart shuffle ITAT every stand balls of
marzipan coated and praline creams dipped and bittersweet chocolate I had
an amazing find of handmade spoon made from apricot ruin this gel is Mozart
solo so yeah the Terminator is by far not the most famous Austrian I love
g-shock but I've been meaning to graduate in to broaden my ground I've
never had a middle one or two German brand the real chocolate store here
chocolate from the original maker of the Mozart Effect this is one of the
truffles on the track in is Penelope White's office I love this new performer
that looks like tattooed oh my god it's like he's flying today's lunchtime adventure is at bro
cafe like a little man is sharp it's right
here straight game but not penises pineapple
sauce with a french fry that's grubs ready chips it's challenging to say
goodbye or even see you later to a place filled with so much beauty
but therein lies one of the biggest lessons I learned from this trip to
appreciate the beauty I already have around me I spent long moments gazing at
rolling hills and ornate architecture and savoring every bite of food wishing
it was my normal we often placed a higher value on things that are forward
to it while this coming what we have so I may not be an elite actually quite yet
or maybe never but I can eat and train like one and be inspired by their
courage I may not have rolling hills outside my window but the view of the
sunset is inspiring the grass is green on my side of a fence - and that's what
exploration teaches us that there's more to life so we can expect dream and work
for more you you 
what's going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen now my favorite season is finally upon us it is
the fall because it signifies the kickoff of football season specifically
college football there is nothing more than I enjoy then making a hearty brunch
on a Saturday morning maybe inviting some friends over and
just binge watching college football and yes I am talking about those mighty
Texas Longhorns now let me do a quick caveat that we've
had a long long long long road and we even have a longer road to go ahead of
us but I'm glad they were semi back on track but anyway back to the video that
also signifies that school is back in session so today's video is going out to
all the college kids out there and also the people that don't have a lot of time
in the kitchen but they do want to have a delicious meal without breaking the
bank we're making a Tater Tot breakfast
casserole and it is amazing now grab a pin so you can find out what you need
along with the budget breakdown you need some red onion spinach
bell pepper Ling ground turkey reduced fat cheddar and eggs and lastly you're
going to need to select which type of tater top now you can get some
vegetative tots that are made from cauliflower for a lower carb alternative
these are a little bit under $4.00 my favorite are sweet potato tots they're
my favorite complex carbohydrate or lastly you can get the regular tater
tots now these are simple carbohydrates made from a white potato but they tend
to be the cheapest at under $2 so the choice is always going to be yours
select the best ones that's going to push you further to your fitness goals
again without breaking the bank and a little bit of simple carbs things I've
heard so no worry about that all right if

started spray a nonstick skillet with olive oil
and saute red onion and bell pepper for about three to five minutes until the
onion is brown and translucent toss in the lean ground turkey and chop it up
and cook it in the skillet add in garlic powder onion powder oregano and a little
sage if you have it you can also use Italian seasoning then let's beat some eggs and egg whites
together in a bowl now you determine how lean you want each serving so feel free
to use whole eggs or egg whites add some chopped spinach to a baking tin or
casserole dish and then add in a small serving of the cooked turkey pour in
your serving size of egg or egg white then top it off with your choice of
tater top I'll be using sweet potato and cauliflower top it off with reduced fat
cheddar then bake for 25 minutes at for 20 or until the egg is completely cooked boom garnish and enjoy smash that like button

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen today's video is going to be pretty fun because it is
December it's Christmas my favorite time of year it's all about gift-giving I
know they say tis better to give than to receive but we all know nothing beats
getting a really nice holiday Christmas gift so with that in mind today I'll be
sharing with you all my top 10 favorite Christmas wish list kitchen gadgets for
2017 these are products that I had Muse here in my own kitchen I've tested them
out and I loved them for some of y'all you may seem a little bit uneasy about
spending so much money on a kitchen gadget think of these as investments in
your health and wellness or the Wellness of a significant other all right guys
let's get started coming in at number 10 is a venturi wine aerator now I'm not
going to spend too much time going over the benefits of red wine for this video
but it has widely been touted as a suitable drink for those following a
healthy balanced diet I was a bit skeptical before about this because I
thought it was a gimmick but it really does help the wine it tastes better it
helps to release the flavor and it helps to soften the wine this is particularly
important for people like me who have a bitter taste in sative 'ti and you find
red wine just a little bit too acidic a little bit too bitter what you do is you
set your area over your glass of wine and then you pour the wine into it and
it aerates the wine you hear that sound and it is a night and day difference so get
this for the wine enthusiasts I found this for twenty-two dollars off of
Amazon and if you click the link below it'll take you right there coming in at
number nine is the Eco lunch box three-in-one stainless steel containers
now I love these I've had these for a for a few years now these are brand-new
for this video I get a lot of emails from people who only can take cold
lunches because they can't heat up their food these are a wonderful practical
options for you I like them because they are durable and this is my favorite one
this is the one that I have it helps you to organize your food so down here you
have a place for your food this tray sits on top of it so you can cover this
area and if you want to have another entree you can or you can split this
between like another snack option and you have two container right here or
this could be some salad dressing this is another option this is a circular
option or the round option I like this one too this one has a little bit more
real estate for for some meals so you've got this bottom tray and then this one
goes on top of it it's the same size and then this one is slightly smaller this
is a holiday wishlist item because these are $30 each now that is pretty
expensive but they are worth it you can follow the link below to Amazon coming
in and number eight is the paderno spiralizer so if there is one thing that
you need to get started in this healthy fitness journey it is going to be a
spiralizer i actually have the old one and the old one was not a counter space
saver they have redesigned it so that way it
is compact and also once you clean it and put everything back together there
is no excuse for you to you know to lose anything because it's all right here you
unlock it first so that this part comes out this is the back part of it and when
you take off the top this is where you get the wheel to turn it so you flip
this part up and this is where your blades are but if you want other blades
you see right here this little drawer you flip it open and there are different
blade you could have a spiralizer top this
part alone you know lock it in place easy this part slides through right here
and then you just click on the back of it snaps right on you'll put in your
little veggie here and then you just turn this newer design is only 25
dollars and you can get this right now on Amazon by clicking the link below all
right coming in at number seven guys is the Kitchen Aid cold Brewer machine now
I know this is number seven but this is likely one of my favorite gadgets or
gimmicks of 2017 it's not just for coffee so if you know anything about
cold roof what you'll do is you will put in your coffee grinds in here you will
put in some water and then you'll let this soak for about 24 hours the thing
that I love about this one is that this is a very fine mesh and this thing just
sits on top of your counter top and you use it as a spigot so you just turn it
off and on here is some of my favorite tea probably gonna put in about five
tablespoons of this and then I'm gonna just pour in some water let me make sure
this is turned off and I would just let this seat it is
some of the most concentrated tea ever so what you'll do is you'll just put out
just a little bit into a glass and then add some water to it when I bought it it
was a hundred dollars now if you click the link below you can get it only for
$65 off of Amazon coming in at number six is the Breville smoking gun now I
know that I said the last ones on my favorites but this has also been one of
my favorite tools this is great for the person who wants to have smoky flavor
food but they can't afford a smoking grill or they have an apartment and they
can't have a grill in there in their house you can smoke this about anything
like this you can smoke your meat you can smoke your vegetables you could even
smoke ice cream one of my favorites is to even smoke my cold whiskey because
yes I am a cold whisky drinker at times in moderation guys but this is great so
let me show you how it works now it comes with these little wood chips right
here but you can also buy off of Amazon other cartons of it so you can pretty
much flavor it the way that you want to this is the holding area for the wood
chips what did you do is you pop you pop it in here you hear it click you're
gonna add in some wood chips so I'm gonna light them on fire
light it on fire just a little bit okay and it's gonna start to smoke and then
I'm going to turn it on you see that see that and what you'll do is you will put
your food into a bag or cover it with with with a bowl this is not hot either
it's just it's just the actual wood chip it's important to that it's not hot
because again you could even smoke ice cream with this thing you could smoke
ice cream guys or yogurt you can get this now off at Amazon for only $100 it
is anime can get an amazing investment this is
the Breville smoking gun check it out coming in at number 5 is the lek crew
set and I'm probably butchering them in I don't speak French is a liquid set
nonstick skillet and this is one of the top of the line now the thing I'm gonna
just start out with saying is that these are not cheap but what I can say about
these nonstick skillet is that they actually last over time some of your
Gnostic skillets within the course of a couple months they they don't seem as
nonstick anymore your food begins to stick just a little bit good thing about
this brand is that they have a lifetime warranty so if something goes wrong with
it you could send it back in I had a friend whose husband now is really into
cooking and she wanted to eat healthier but he uses a lot of oil a lot of grease
so I suggested to her to get him the skillet because it's so nonstick that
once you add in just a little bit of oil you're gonna actually see yourself
frying your food on accident so he can actually see that hey you know what I
should probably use a little less oil there are a lot of sizes out there this
is the 12-inch this is a deep stir-fry slash frying pan I suggest this larger
one just because it's a lot more more versatile this one is gonna run you
around 160 I know it is a huge price to pay for a skillet but I can tell you
that it is worth it you can click the link below and get this right now off of
Amazon coming in at number 4 is the art premium carbonator now anyone that knows
me knows that I drink soda water or mineral water on a daily basis I like
the feeling of having soda but not all the sugar and then bloat that could come
with it this is one of the best ones out there the other one is by KitchenAid
what I like about this one though is it is a counter space saver I've seen a lot
of reports where some of the cheaper ones break down much faster and for
something that is such a novelty item I would suggest going the cheap route with
with something like this it comes with this water bottle right here and it's
got this stainless steel bottom right here and this actually helps it to stay
cooler fill the water up to this line right here and you place your CEO to
filter inside of this long tube and then you're going to give it a quick do it
now this is enough for most people I love drinking topo Chico and I like to
belch immediately after having a sip so I like to crank mine up all the way
until it's like no more it'll tell me there we go just like that I'm not gonna
belt right now for y'all but it's just that simple the downsides of this one is
that it does not already come with the co2 filter so you've got to buy that
separately that's about between 35 and 50 dollars
you can get that off the Amazon but this machine right now is at the top of the
threshold it's at $200 and you can click the link below right now to get it
coming in at number three is the vitamix ascent 3500 I love this machine there is
a lot that I could say about Vitamix in about quality blenders but what I will
say about this one is top of the line what I love about this newer model is
that they have a digital display and they have these preset functions and
it's very smooth to touch so a common complaint that I get from people that
actually purchase blenders or or they're trying to make smoothies they say the
elevate doesn't taste right oftentimes it's because your your blender is not
strong enough to really liquefy and meld the flavors together you will never have
to worry about that whenever you have a Vitamix you only have to buy this one
time so once you buy this this blender is probably gonna outlive you I'm
serious your your kids may be burying you before they bury this blender and if
something goes wrong with it you can send it in to Vitamix and they can fix
it or they will replace it get a lot of questions from people asking should they
buy a juicer or should they buy a blender it's really gonna come down to a
personal preference what you're gonna use the most the blender is gonna be
much more versatile this is not only just for smoothie the systemic sauces
this is to make cake batter it's that you can use this as a food processor so
the same thing that you would do with the food processor you can actually do
with your Vitamix you can get to this Vitamix blender for
$550 right now off of Amazon trust that you are making a great investment in
your health and wellness with this blender this would be an amazing gift
for your household coming in at number two is the insta pot duo this is an 8
quart seven in one machine and I honestly can't picture my kitchen
without my insta pot because it does everything this is a slow cooker it's a
pressure cooker I have sauteed my vegetables in here you
can cook eggs at different consistencies so this is not just a slow cooker for
you to make soups in this is a multifunctional cooking machine what I
like about this newer model is this digital display so to click it right
here and you can easily sort through I love the beeping sound because it lets
me know where I am in the process another thing that I really love about
all the instant pots is this you hear that sound it lets you know when it's
open and closed so that way you can always ensure that the lid is on there
tightly and firmly I also love that it's a smart machine so it's not going to
continue to cook after the cooking cycle you've even select for it to continue to
warm the food or just to shut completely off after the cooking cycles they come
in different sizes this is the 8 quart but you can get by on the 6 quart it
just depends on your needs and how much food you're going to be cooking if
you've got a larger family I would probably opt for the 8 quart this duo is
only a hundred and thirty-five dollars and you can click the link below on
Amazon to get it but I just saw that for some reason it's on backorder it's not
available right now but the older model is cheaper it's only $100 and it does
the exact same thing there's no difference is this doesn't have this
digital display here in the front of it you need this in your house this is part
of the healthy eating starter kit and last but certainly not least my top
holiday Christmas wishlist gift item is got to be the philips vive collection
airfryer i love this machine and i've loved this machine all this
it really helped to change my perspective about what healthy eating
actually could be because it gave me something that I saw that have to give
up fried food I want you how to check out my actual review of this machine on
YouTube it's one of the highest rated reviews for an air fryer so go and check
that out and you can learn all about this incredible machine now the cool
thing is that when I bought this earlier this year it was a little bit more
expensive but because of technology it's now cheaper you can get this machine for
only a hundred and thirty dollars right now off of Amazon so click the link
below and get this for somebody this holiday season they will love you alright guys that wraps up today's video
for my top 10 favourite Christmas holiday wishlist gift items it's a
mouthful but I hope that you all enjoyed the video and I hope that there were a
couple items on here that you can see yourself investing in for somebody or
even just for yourself if anything this holiday season I want you all to enjoy
it with friends and family it has been a great year it's in a tremendous year and
I think y'all for rockin with me and the fit Maine cook community there is a lot
more in store in 2018 with my new cookbook coming out and so many other
cool products that I just cannot wait to unveil to you all so I look forward to
growing with you all and creating more amazing content in the new year and from
my kitchen to your kitchen I want y'all to keep it healthy but of course never
ever fully enjoy 
what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen now you are going to love today's video because it's
all about a concept I like to call tasty peel delicious food that powers our
fitness goals and I got the idea because I recently returned from a trip to
Salzburg Austria and I was there with red bull meeting with several other
athletes competing in the ex outs which literally is the world's toughest
adventure race it's roughly a 12 day race over seven countries 1200
kilometres these athletes they are running they're hiking they're
paragliding they're pushing their bodies to the absolute max so supplies to say
they are burning and insane amount of calories per day and I met with two of
the athletes and they talked about being on a fat adaptive diet and at the risk
of oversimplifying it's based on the premise and the proven studies that fat
is a better source of longer-term energy for aerobic exercise with carbohydrates
the energy that it provides tends to be used that much faster and you end up
hitting a wall or feeling fatigued perhaps you have felt that before so
having a fad adaptive diet a diet that is much more higher in fat would make a
lot of sense for endurance athletes or people that have going to workout if
this sounds a lot like keto it is pretty similar even with that adaptive diet you
can still add in some carbohydrates either before or after the competition
or after training session because you do want to give your muscles some energy to
be able to work with so it is very similar to keto except for the strategic
addition of carbohydrates either before or after the competition or the training
session now bringing this full circle there are some applications for the
everyday person perhaps you are one of the hundreds of people who have emailed
me to say that you cannot eat several times a day that your job or your work
environment is not conducive for that and that you need a meal or foods that
you can eat that will provide lasting energy over a longer period of time
until you can get to your next meal or perhaps you're that person out there
that is trying to gain weight and you have got to increase your caloric intake
but you want to do that but also still maintain a fairly lean
a fat adaptive that could be a viable option for you and it is largely
individual based because it is based on performance and how you feel and the
progress towards your goals so today I want to share with you all a high energy
a high fat meal we are making my enduring tax there are few meals out
there that are as versatile as breakfast hash because you can easily tweak the
quantity of the ingredients in order to scale the recipe so whether you're
eating for endurance for weight loss or weight gain my easy breakfast hash can
meet your needs this meals can literally go from 800
plus calories for the endurance athlete scaled all the way down to about 400
calories per serving for the average Joe and Jane now I'm going to walk you
through today's recipe I'm going to discuss each ingredient and why we're
using it so that way you can get a better feel of how you can tweak this
recipe to meet your specific need now if you are ready to roll up your sleeve and
make them tasty fuel then let's get started
first we're going to prep the bedroom we're going to start by chopping up a
red bell pepper since we're not adding any seasonings and herbs bell pepper has
a lot of flavor plus it's rich in potassium which helps
muscle function and regulating blood pressure
next chop-busting law zucchini zucchini is a good source of vitamin C which
helps build immunity since intense exercise and training tends to wear on
the body chop the ends up butternut squash and slice into ring then cut off
the outer layer of the skin and chop it into small chunks I'm adding butternut
squash as a hearty and filling low-carb alternative to potato enough to provide
muscle energy while still remaining a fat focus meal lastly we're chopping up
one chicken sausage which will provide protein flavor and some fat Nick's at
avocado or olive oil to a cast-iron skillet toss in the butternut squash
cook it until it for about eight minutes into the outside of it turns brown and
begins to soften then toss in zucchini and cook for about two minutes before
tossing in the red bell pepper and chicken sausage
cook everything together for five minutes didn't make two holes in the
skillet for eggs which will add protein and boost of fat content crack in the
egg and allow it to cook until the clear part has turned white lastly add a ripe
avocado to boost the fat content and to make the dish creamy and easier to eat
when mixed together garnish with cilantro sea salt and pepper as you can
see you can easily tweak the amount of each ingredient to complement your need
so this is a very easy meal guys that you can whip up in 15 to 20 minutes each
morning if you carve out the time for a filling once told me you would either
find the time to do it or you will find and excuse what the choice is always
yours the ratio breakdown for this meal is about 60% fat 20% protein in 20%
carbohydrates which is a common ratio breakdown or a high fat meal thanks dad
for watching today's video if you like recipe videos like these
with the walkthrough and recipes that you can easily scale then I want you to
smash that like button and also let me know below in the comment section lastly
I want to leave you with this thought a lot of us are into accounting our
calories and being really scientific about it just remember that not all fats
and calories are created equal eating a pint of your favorite ice cream
it may have similar calories with that will necessarily translate into
performance and endurance so remember to fuel your body with real food and
nutritious food reading alright y'all I want to thank y'all for watching until
next time keep it healthy but of course never ever bored Oh bye 
What is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen well you know what they say when it stuns out the
grill Adele hello something like that or at least that's what we say here in
Texas because grilling is a year-round thing for us but I realize it's not the
case around the US and also in other parts of the world so today I am
officially kicking off grilling season in the pit minke of kitchen I got this
amazing surf and turf recipe that is essentially tail food you will become a
neighborhood hero if you make this dish at your next barbecue bacon wrapped
scallops with an abundantly green AC salad when most people think about salad
at a barbecue you think about potato salad or macaroni salad and those are
filled with a lot of saturated fat and simple carbs but we tend to forget about
leafy green stones the summertime is a really great time for you to incorporate
some more fresh vegetables from your local farmers markets and pair them with
natural flavors from the fruits that are sold there as well so today I'm going to
show you this that I'm going to take some of the popular leafy greens that
are abundant here in Texas and then show you how to make a really easy salad
dressing to complement set these are all ingredients that are native to my Texan
Lac and I can get here in Texas so the purpose of this video is not only to
show you a recipe but also to get the wheels in your head turning about ways
that you can incorporate the seeds and all soups and vegetables in your area to
make them relevant for you in your diet today's recipe is a little bit higher in
fat because of some of the ingredients that we're using plus the vinaigrette
that we're going to make but we're going to offset that by keeping the recipe
overall relative and low in carbohydrates all right here's a recipe
breakdown now Texas is cattle country we are known for beef so today I'm going to
be using beef bacon which is something that's relatively easy to get here in
Texas and another parsley clip but no worry if you can't get deep bacon you
can absolutely use turkey bacon or pork bacon giant scallops are not always
readily available in your section so if you're not able to find the beautiful
giant scalp that I'm you can carry video then you can try giant prawns or
you can chop up chicken breasts into the size of a Dell of course they would be
surf and turf it would just be you know chicken wrapped in and make it for our
abundantly green cells we're going to be using asparagus and frozen peas but
aside from that baby arugula is hopping here in sexy hmm
I love this stuff kind of really pungent paste and it's peppery and full of
flavor so it's really bringing to life anything that is paired with and down
without a doubt one of my favorite green vegetables of all time is must resent
now this is a really soft buttery lettuce it looks like four-leaf clovers
now this generally grows in cooler climates so right now from the
springtime to be very beginning part of the summertime is a sweet spot for us in
seconds to give it a sort of Texas prize is our ruby red grapefruit up TSK you
see it literally tastes like candy I get a lot of people that say okay I don't
like grapefruits everyone that presented to try a ruby red grapefruit absolutely
loves it and we're going to use this to make our vinaigrette for exactly one
last thing before we get started the topic of skewers now I like these wooden
slats yours like this because whenever you pierce it the food doesn't turn also
remember to soak your wooden skewers for about fifteen to thirty minutes prior to
use it empty because you don't want to catch on fire because that burnt flavor
can also impact the overall taste of your wheel and you don't want that so
all right John anxious to hop into today's recipe so if
you are ready to roll up your sleeves get your hands dirty come outside so
wait a little bit up under the Sun and from the heat of the grill then let's
get started first we're going to prep the summer salad by bringing water to a
boil then we're going to toss in Ross very good and some frozen peas boil for
six to eight minutes then immediately place the veggies in ice cold water to
stop it from cooking and to preserve the vibrant green color
for the dressing we're going to add olive oil Dijon werster shyest off
apple cider vinegar and juice from a Texas pink grapefruit mix it up and set
it aside now let's take it back outside you decide which bacon there's a beef
bacon which we'll need to fold in half or you can use regular pork bacon or
turkey bacon choice is yours take a giant Gallus and wrap a slice to the
folded beef bacon around it now puncture it using a soap flat wooden skewer
repeat and remember a flat wooden skewer prevents the food from twisting on the
kabob for the rub we're going to make a paste
using a little olive oil local freaka and coconut sugar mix it
together and lightly brush the outside of each wrap Geller place the kabobs on
a hot grill set at about 375 degrees and cook them for about eight minutes after

what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen today we are getting our hands really dirty down and
busy in the kitchen cooking up some seafood that's right we are talking
about how to cook seafood in bulk for meal prep
I think the norm for everyone out there is just to season up your fish put it
onto a pan and stick it in the oven and when you're done don't get me wrong
there are tons of ways out there to cook sea food for meal prep but when we're
talking about cooking things in bulk we are trying to get in and out of the
kitchen as quickly as possible so because seafood is one of those
things that I feel like people I have generally mastered or got their own
rhythm down I'm going to spend the bulk of today's video answering some
frequently asked questions when it comes to seafood plus of course you know I'm
going to share some of my favorite ways to cook seafood in bulk for prep all
right we got a lot of stuff to cover today so let's roll up our sleeves okay
I roll up our sleeves at demands like dibs so let's roll up our sleeves and
let's get started before we happen to today's video when it comes to seafood I
want to make three quick points number one buy fresh seafood over frozen
seafood whenever possible back in the day when I first started out on my
journey I will go to Walmart and I would buy the eleven dollar blue box of frozen
tilapia what I began to notice was that with the frozen fish it began to break
apart much easier and there wasn't a lot of flavor to it
so with my own personal preference to buy fresh over frozen whenever possible
we don't really think about this but fish goes bad pretty quickly and because
of that is often offered at a discount at our supermarkets whenever you buy it
fresh if you're not eating seafood that week and you still see it on sale and
it's fresh I would recommend just going ahead and buying it anyway and then
freezing it and that way you have your own fresh frozen seafood that you can
enjoy whenever you're ready frozen foods in particular proteins tend to hold a
lot of water so once you defrost the fish you're going to want to lay out
some paper towels and place the fish on the paper towel and let a lot of that
water come out of it so again whenever possible buy fresh fish but if you can't
frozen as a viable option but just follow those steps number two deals with
storage cooked fish or cooked seafood can remain
fresh in the fridge for about three days now it's my own personal preference not
to allow anything any cooked seafood over two days in my fridge because I'm
very sensitive to smells and so I just think it kind of smells funny
so anything that I'm not going to eat within two days I'm only too free
the third point I want to make is about wild fish versus farm twist now this is
a huge debate right now within the healthy eating community now
scientifically there is no easy answer to this so I just can't tell you yes or
no because I think there are pros and cons on both sides and it genuinely does
come down to a personal preference nutritionally whenever you're looking at
the wild versus a farmed fish they are pretty much equivalent because of the
advancement of the feeds if they've been able to give the farmed fish so since
they're both to say nutritionally it really comes down to a personal
preference with things that you have to consider such as the environmental
impact how the fish are harvested food safety and also just a bottom line which
is your cause a big question I get is if farmed fish safe and this question
arrived because of the study that works that I think was back in 2004 early 2000
whereby they showed that farmed fish had a statistically significantly higher
number of contaminants than the wild caught fish however whenever you dive
into that statistic what you'll find is that even though they were higher in
contaminants the number of contaminants in the farmed fish was still lower than
the amount being to be dangerous for human consumption so technically the
fish is still deemed safe to eat when it comes to the topic of environmental
impact many people have concerns about the way that wild caught fish are
harvested there are oftentimes large machines that will disrupt the
surrounding ecosystem and and pollute the surrounding environment and so that
is a huge concern for many people this is not a blanket statement to say that
all wild caught fish are harvested in unsustainable ways and that are
negatively impacting the environment but it is a concern for many
and of course the bottom line here is cause oftentimes farm fish is offered at
much cheaper prices than the wild caught fish and so many people are forced to
make that decision based off of their budget and let me tell you there's
nothing wrong with that now I want to deal with some of the most common types
of fish for meal prep the fatty fish like salmon versus the white fish the
lean fish like cod orange roughy and tilapia first up is salmon this is a
beautiful wild cut piece of salmon right here omega-3 fatty acids is probably one
of the main reasons why people like to eat pre fruit particularly salmon
because salmon is really rich in it while salmon gets the omega-3 fatty
acids from feeding off the algae and the plankton whereas the farm-raised salmon
get it from the feed or many other feeds they are developing them now with a
little bit less fish meal and much more fish oil in order to make sure that have
enough of the omega-3 fatty acids in them so what you'll find is that on
average the farm-raised fish are fattier but the wild caught salmon have more
iron calcium and potassium now with that stuff out of the way let's
get down to cooking the salmon I always hear from people that salmon is too
fishy I ate salmon this is the reason why don't overcook your sin did you know
that the longer you cook salmon that this year is become the fat content and
the salmon allows it to tolerate a lot more heat without drying out so now I
cook it at about 420 degrees for no more than 15 minutes and it's perfect I will
say that that frozen packaged sandwich is a little bit fishy er on average in
my experience medium-rare is the best we want nice pink moist opaque center and
can you eat the skin off of salmon is the personal preference I personally
love to eat the skin off the salmon especially whenever I cook it in a
skillet and get it nice and crispy but many people don't like to eat it because
of the contaminant if salmon are swimming around and contaminated water
or they're feeding off of things that are contaminated then the toxins built
up in the skin and then that of that salmon now what you can do
with the Effie you bake it just slice off the skin and it'd be just fine
marinating is probably the best way to get rid of any fishy flavor from any
fish particularly the oily fish like salmon so here are two of my favorite
ways for salmon meal prep for the first salmon recipe we're going to make an
easy marinade with fresh orange juice or lemon or lime low-sodium soy si Racha
for a little heat and some ginger stir it all up then pour it in a zip plastic
bag then add the salmon filet close it tight and marinate for at least 30
minutes or overnight to lock in the flavor for the other fillet we're going
to add olive oil smoked paprika cumin and pepper rub in the seasonings and
cook it immediately add the police to a baking sheet with parchment paper or
foil to prevent sticking add orange slices a little pepper and the remaining
sauce to the marinated fillet bake for 10 to 12 minutes at 420 a red pepper to
the rubbed fillet and garnish with cilantro and lemons and to the orange
marinated fillet garnish with fresh mint to boost those flavors next up is white
fish I got some kada in this hand and some orange roughy in this one
cod is among the lightest tasting and one of the most affordable fish out
there when it comes to buying seafood in bowls for meal prep but orange roughy is
also an amazing viable option but oftentimes people have an adverse
reaction to using orange roughy like myself orange roughy is a very buttery
and very waxy type of fish is called an escolar at the risk of oversimplifying
this and TMI oftentimes our bodies can't digest the fat and waxes in escolar so
what we'll do is we will extract the fat and then we will excrete it so basically
I'm talking about anal leakage so I was eating orange roughy for about two weeks
straight when I went to the gym on this particular day I was sweating more so
than usual from the waist down fast-forward to that night
and then wait going to bed and then waking up in the morning time there was
a huge stain where my butt was that looked like vegetable oil let me tell
you what this was not it's not the best thing for a relationship but it's also a
good test to see if you're in the legend ship with the right person this is a
very common sight a second reaction for people whenever they eat escolar when it
comes to cooking white fish or lean fish it doesn't take that long because it's
super lean so I like to cook it on lower temperatures at around 400 and for the
same amount of time about 15 minutes or so definitely no more than 20 minutes
because I don't want to dry out fish often times I like to spray it with a
little bit of olive oil and then add in my spices and herbs to it so that way it
remains moist and flaky during the baking process now here are a few ways I
like to prepare white fish I love marinating with Greek yogurt
because it helps secure moistness especially to lean proteins that tend to
be dry plus it's an extra boost of protein add Greek yogurt to a plastic
bag then add garlic fresh dill lemon and pepper
add the fillets to cure the bag with no air and gently mash and mix it together
marinate for at least 30 minutes add the police to a baking sheet or baking rack
then bake for 12 to 15 minutes at 400 garnished with pepper dill and lemon
with orange roughy with one egg in a bowl then select your favorite nut I'll
be using pecans because they're much easier to crush up use a mallet or spoon
and mash the pecans of defeats add a dash of panko cumin and garlic mix it
together dips our fish in the a in the nipa con mixture place the fillet on a
baking sheet or baking rack and bake for 15 minutes at 400 garnish with parsley and lemon that's it

are you in a big hurry right now I a little bit okay well you make chili
myself yes which which means you put in your chili there's a chip what's the difference
between a kidney bean in a chili bean hot chili these look like baked beans oh
really that sounds really good by the way I
haven't had a frito fire me forever yeah okay okay what are you making today
looks like you've got a lot of stuff going on there okay okay holy smokes all
right do you make chili at your house how do
you make it deep put beans in your chili first off some people okay good so
you're not the one with the weird all right so which means to you recommends
heard hot chili I don't even that very sure what a hot chili bean it yeah what
are you cooking today looks like you've got a lot of stuff going on stuff for
the week I gotta ask you um you're actually on camera right now I'm a
blogger and I cook healthy food and I wanted to know if I cover your groceries
today would you let me cook you like really delicious
yes to rice meal with chicken would you allow me to do that put before you oh
what's your name Becca alright hey guys I got one so yeah you're actually so there's a
camera there yeah so y'all this is Becca she's going to in
she's having a party tonight so this is actually a really good setup we're gonna
go and we're gonna make this fiesta rice right now and I'm gonna cover your
groceries and to worry about it okay all right let's go we're gonna go this way we're still making scratch because you
are a hooker we're gonna we're gonna use this one perfect alright guys so we are here in the
middle of Kroger we just surprised Becca and we're about to make this amazing
really easy tex-mex fiesta rice dish so Becca has a food allergy to chicken
which I've did not know that existed but hey and you're all special this is why
everybody's are all special right first step is to chop these into very small
pieces and we know that Becca can cook because when I was talking to her
earlier she was describing her chili dish actually I feel like I'm gonna
maybe like angle it and then post that's with me cooks recipe but just know it
came from her great and this is about a pound of turkey tenderloin that we're
cutting up so while she's doing that this skillet it's just not getting hot
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna add in a little bit of olive oil just
about a tablespoon of it scoop that right on in thank you
and the only thing we're gonna do here is we're just going to brown brown the
meat around the top and bottom of them all right this is perfect we're just
gonna dump that into there you got it this is they're really heavy yeah we're
doing a workouts and everything today this is when we're really gonna add in
the oil cuz we're gonna get cooking so we're gonna add in about two tablespoons
and this is gonna be about at least eight servings so remember that you know
when you're adding in oil and things like that think about how many servings
that you're going to be doing cuz it that's a huge factor in the calories
we're gonna toss in some green onions yep whole thing and then some garlic just going stir it up and what we're doing here is just gonna
caramelize the the red onion and the garlic equip down your onion at our do
you prefer white or red yeah we're gonna do about a tablespoon and a half of
chili powder and then let's do it two teaspoons of cumin yeah a little
stubborn too all right good and what I like about doing it this way
is it really helps to lock it in cook this down for about two minutes we're
gonna speed up the process here but I want you add in some rice now this is a
trick that some people like to use this is short grain and it's weird right
it's different yeah this is short grain brown rice so you can use brown rice
beans Jeff I love jasmine rice oh my god present the blob she's like I agree with
that you stir that up and when you saute the
rise I'm not sure if you do this to do you thoughts are yours yeah it really
helps to lock in the flavors because again we're trying to create our own
like enchilada style sauce but without adding in all the enchilada stuff the
ingredients for it all right perfect for that all of our flavors are locked in we're
gonna add in about a cup of this tomato sauce do you buy stuff with salt in it
or no yeah that's a great call out you want to fold in your turkey as well all
right and we're gonna bring that to a simmer and then if you don't have like a
topping or a cover for your cast iron skillet I like to just get two of them
and stack them do you do that and all people tried it it's actually really
buildable oh that's true she's like I'm fancy I
had my complete set but if you don't like me sometimes you just place it on
the world on top and let that cook so what I thought would go well with like
an enchilada rice would be what guacamole I think well we can tag-team
this so the first thing let's cut open these avocados and here's the tip I
learned - don't be that guy in the grocery store like me but you can chop
off the top of it and if it's white or green that I mean that's green on the
inside if it's not and put it back and walk away quickly we're just gonna make
a quick avvocato mash do you want to slice up these limes for us just slice
them in half so we can squeeze out the lime juice let's just get our forums
going and then how are you when it comes to
heat do you like a whole bunch of heat and spice medium okay how do you usually
chop yours yep and there's enough heat in here to add a little bit of kick and
this is for your guests anyway so they may not like a whole bunch we want to be
respectful of them just in case just in case we're gonna add in our heat now and
then if you want we could chop up an onion or no your are you good with just
the mash like this okay perfect cilantro okay I'm gonna put a little
business I love cilantro by the way well you know that there are people that
actually can't eat cilantro cause it tastes like soap did you know that so
she just saw the problem for you you don't pick up cilantro eat a whole
handful of it I mean come on people then we've got some sea salt and pepper
here I'm gonna put in some salt okay here's my secret ingredient that I'm
actually gonna publicly say for the first time
cumin I do like a teaspoon and that's it yeah that's perfect
that's great and then mash this sucker up and then season the taste with sea
salt and pepper and you're done with that beautiful this one actually has
chicken what it should look like last thing
I'm gonna open this packet so we've got some steamed veggies this is a bold
fiesta and this one actually has some seasoning in there I want to say let's
see this one has your eyes maybe better than mine paprika turmeric garlic powder
sis spices onion powder a lot in life anymore lime and just toss that in there
yep and toss it in the whole fiesta all
right so we're gonna stir this in we're gonna add in the rest of our our chicken
broth or you can do veggie stock if you're gonna make just a vegetarian
version so it's a really versatile and they've got these packed these little
chunks right here those are actually seasoning packs of this stuff we were
just talking about like the like the garlic powder and the turmeric and and
what I like about this type of stuff too is like this would be great with a salad
or its thick enough if you want to get like the little lettuce wrap the big
like little piece of lettuce and make them like little tacos so I'm gonna chop
up some cilantro make a little hole right here and we're gonna top it off
with our freshly made wok what do you think you're gonna put that
right there in the middle of it scoop it in there beautiful I'm gonna chop up some lunch
is for garnish purposes beautiful beautiful beautiful love it and then just some cracked
pepper in the middle to the back to get
everything in there hopefully that vegetables have cooked down because the
steam so you like that it's good alright I just don't want to miss out on
that so it's really good we taste enchilada at all you taste of tex-mex
I feel yeah yeah so is this something that you think that oh whoa the jalapeno
oh wow it doesn't mean see this is like a neat hot stuff like oh yeah it's
really mild yeah it takes the whole opinion so what I love about this dish
is that it's pretty straightforward it's literally just sauteing the rice and
then putting it into a pot and walking away so yeah it's quite simple so maybe

we're going to go exploring. Yah, da
ist gut! here is part 2 of my adventure in Salzburg Austria from
sampling local cuisine to shopping the city market and exploring more the
beautiful countryside I try to stretch my three days as much as possible it's
hard to leave no stone unturned such a short time when everything your eye
catches seemingly tells a story like you're watching a 4k television
it's just that picturesque nonetheless here's my college try this my friend is
my love footage g'day mate bigger than a lot of you would be able to forget there
are no kangaroos no kangaroos guys wrong please tell me why the mannequins here
in Austria they're like mad dick tell me that these
ain't big just oh my god the guy's looking at I swear I'm not a perv forget
her there's be good for you here oh you got to push the button do that that's what we're going it's
beautiful castle one of the things I loved about downtown Salzburg is that
around every corner there was a new discovery a new square with small cafes
steps leading to nowhere crowded alleys lying with stores and a
Mozart chocolate shop on every corner it was like the city within a city within
another city we just made it to the top of the castle it's about 65 degrees
it's just now beginning to fit tell me why you're robbed here all peaceful and
all of a sudden there's a monsoon to take and I'm wearing a white shirt hey
that's okay the third cup right trying to find the correct ground right now I'm
gonna butcher books term draw get crushed to the ground he said we've
arrived this is it son bro oh what a nice Twinkie place storing bra was the site of my first
taste of Austrian cuisine we had cured beef gelatin with Syrian pumpkin seed
oil overall very delicious new flavor yet the texture was gritty and
unfamiliar Wienerschnitzel to my surprise was not
exhausted rather flavorful lightly fried filled it paired well with the parts of
potatoes we finished the entrees the signature beef goulash with pork sausage
for dessert we had Salzburger no-fee stick it into the eye but actually very
light to take women whenever they want to cook we're doing this you'll always
go for stuff like spaghetti always always you know I what a little doing
this one over you need time to clean your house make yourself updated on with
Emmett build it again you put the pot on the world to do your makeup you come
back you drain it to make this hot yeah okay on you I'd say huh yes I see that
see the armor you have a lot to remove a condom when you're working on your new
editing you're a girl just like any man anything at the turn-on right there
music hello allo and gutentag right is that one
oh that's a new one service as well yeah oh okay
so where we going right now okay then okay so here's a random fact about me
my ideal vacation getaway is not a beach it would be similar to the peaceful fuso
countryside there's a calmness here that really appeals to me here I got talking
about the gladiator why everybody know when they talk it
actually sounds really officious and everything sounds like it was coffee
without strong me so morning y'all pretty sure you're you're in the western
hemisphere you're probably getting me up right now just want to know how do you
like to have your morning coffee like that you know basic black picturesque very sweet and the crust is actually
really buttery but it's not that's like nice elegant it really survives sweet
but it's very subtle an overpowering today's lunch times food adventure in
the place where off the lake yes I'm country so I made a mini
sandwich here that leti recommended so like Wow now for the main course
Wow look at that just beautiful become flaky why am i rendered this
beautifully cooked it was melt in your mouth savory flavor
dude almost like chicken look at that outfit
stop setup by air skill that's cool so we're downtown Salzburg and we're
going to go exploring this is a supermarket see how you agree to right
away with the fresh produce thing I love about and European markets that they're
sort ministry to look out like why this is the regular grocery store and usually
one in the state they have the first you want to get this but look at this
assortment of Jesus oh is the ones that they have come on so run let's see I
think they may have it is if they're right it is the eighth one can we be
skillet two slices will it them disappear thank you
most of them what do you think we did like is it uh is it salty a
little coffee don't really know how to discern but it almost kind of melting in
my signature of it really doesn't and walking I walk and walk and walk as
a Texan I Drive everywhere but one of my big takeaway from this trip would be
importance of appreciating fitness and the small thing something as basic as
walking to the store can add much more value to our journey than an intense
stare master cardio session nice to see this question today this is where we
were the other day when it was with you raining and we come back building full
of people get a glass in the face I can see we're getting outside very nice
lunchtime sprayer got it this way people is a deception behind me on the street
is one of the main markets in Salzburg it's only open on Fridays and Saturdays
so we actually happen to be in town for it I'm going to go exploring and with
the hat you're supposed to have a lot of organic products a lot of real artisan
crafts homemade jewelry other things like that so I want to do a little taste
of Salzburg here we go the Austrian snaps worth delicious not overly sweet
like syrup mozart shuffle ITAT every stand balls of
marzipan coated and praline creams dipped and bittersweet chocolate I had
an amazing find of handmade spoon made from apricot ruin this gel is Mozart
solo so yeah the Terminator is by far not the most famous Austrian I love
g-shock but I've been meaning to graduate in to broaden my ground I've
never had a middle one or two German brand the real chocolate store here
chocolate from the original maker of the Mozart Effect this is one of the
truffles on the track in is Penelope White's office I love this new performer
that looks like tattooed oh my god it's like he's flying today's lunchtime adventure is at bro
cafe like a little man is sharp it's right
here straight game but not penises pineapple
sauce with a french fry that's grubs ready chips it's challenging to say
goodbye or even see you later to a place filled with so much beauty
but therein lies one of the biggest lessons I learned from this trip to
appreciate the beauty I already have around me I spent long moments gazing at
rolling hills and ornate architecture and savoring every bite of food wishing
it was my normal we often placed a higher value on things that are forward
to it while this coming what we have so I may not be an elite actually quite yet
or maybe never but I can eat and train like one and be inspired by their
courage I may not have rolling hills outside my window but the view of the
sunset is inspiring the grass is green on my side of a fence - and that's what
exploration teaches us that there's more to life so we can expect dream and work
for more you you 
what's up guys and welcome back to this
bit means good kitchen so in honor of Heart Health Month here in the u.s. I am
kicking off a five part series called hittin TVs giving active every single
day is part of a healthy and balanced lifestyle so we're going to be doing
just that now to make this a little bit more fun I thought it'd be cool that we
challenge ourselves to do some of these workouts that my favorite Instagram of
my favorite youtubers put out there so today we are kicking off with just a
train challenge if you're not following this guy Instagram you've gotta do it he
is a whole lot of energy and he has to be because he's a personal trainer for

enjoyable with your friends so I got my homie here John and he's gonna be doing
it along with me each circuit is about five minutes long so we're gonna do
these movement for about 50 seconds and then rest for 10 seconds alright maybe
that five times the entire challenge knows to do this three times so that you
are burning and getting sweaty and getting active for 15 minutes each day
after this we're going to head into the kitchen to make a smoothie but first we
gotta get our sweat up alright job if you are ready let's get started and just

dreams popsicle smoothies first we're going to start out with some freshly

outcome it's happening on that he's really Laden about how much weight
you're doing about your form but also how much is really pushing yourself

maximum fighting says no more unless you're pushing yourself you're going to
get your stamina your endurance up so you can last a whole lot longer but if
you just just terrain appreciation homie go and follow this guy you are not I
guarantee you 
what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fitment code kitchen and welcome to the fall or maybe we're in that
transition month but whatever fall we'll be here very soon now fall was one of my
favorite times of year and if you spit any summer in Texas and you would
understand why as a Texan we are ready to get rid of this intense heat but also
because of the food one of my favorite fall foods is squash
now while I like to eat squash plain and raw you know I may spiralize it or put
it into a salad or something I enjoy it most when it is mixed into a recipe now
one of my favorite types of squash because there are many out there is
butternut because it's versatility it can be used in very sweet dishes for
desserts or even some savory dishes in fact last year one of my favorite uses
of butternut squash was to make a big bowl of chili con queso people had no
idea that they were eating the cheese and over half the cheese was actually
better nut squash so it's a pretty dope recipe if you missed it go to fitmin
cook calm and just type in the big bowl queso and you should find it so today
I'm going to show you just that ingenuity by making a delicious creamy
butternut chicken and rice dish now I am technically not in my full bulking mode
just yet so I'm gonna be using cauliflower rice but you could feel free
to use whichever rice fits your diet right now and your goals we're gonna
pair that dish with roasted Brussels sprouts with a hint of maple it is
essentially all of the flavors that make you think of the fall check it out first
we're gonna slice in Brussels sprouts in half this is a personal preference
because I do not like big chunks of Brussels sprouts but this also helps you
to better ration out the portions coat them with olive oil balsamic vinegar and
maple syrup or agave gently fold them in the sauce then line a baking sheet with
parchment and spread out the Brussels sprouts
roast in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the edges are brown and crispy
allow them to slightly cool and get sticky from the maple next we're going to chop the top and
bottom off a butternut squash then cut the remainder into pieces stop off the
skin then cut it into chunks bring some water to a boil and add a steamer basket
add the chunks of butternut squash and cover and steam for roughly 15 minutes
or until the squash can be easily pierced with a fork allow the chunks to
cool then add them to a food processor pour in veggie stock rosemary and sage
bolts blend until smooth adding tablespoons of veggie stock if
needed spray a nonstick skillet with olive oil heat set it on medium heat
toss in the raw chicken breast pieces and cook for about 10 minutes ensuring
it is fully cooked and brown on the outer edges set it aside and using the
same skillet at olive oil garlic bread onion and red bell pepper carmelize for
3 to 5 minutes before adding in cinnamon this brings the flavors together to fill
a lot more like fall next add in the butternut squash puree and coconut milk
stir it up then add a pinch of sea salt and pepper to make this extra creamy I
like to add goat cheese because it's a viable substitute for cream cheese or
even heavy cream stir in the cooked chicken breast and then some frozen peas boom now build your meals I'll be using
lightly steamed cauliflower pearls instead of rice to reduce the amount of
carbs but feel free to use jasmine or brown rice to make this dish hearty earn

out my objective discover how elite athletes fuel and
power their bodies and prepare their minds to tackle challenges on land and
in the a and yes of course I sample local cuisine and discover a
brand new culture here's part one in my adventure yep we went from torrential rain - now
stunning beautiful I forget that like Austria and is there
really all about efficient living and stuff so I'm like where's the closet
here's the bed that's dope everything is so compact and then you put your clothes
back here did it show if you do that that's where we're going it's beautiful
castle like in Game of Thrones I think we're getting close because here we can
take a trolley oh we can walk through the way I'm going
to see how long the walk is let's go check out this view Salzburg is postcard
beautiful it the picturesque European city surrounded by rolling hills and
mountains that are kissed by clouds even with a slight overcast and sporadic rain
showers it's easily one of the most beautiful cities I've ever seen then I
rank your own now starving like Marvin you're accustomed to eat no no I love
the food trucks here's the end look oh I like that one a
giant hot dog wrapped in bacon with cheese on it you know give it oh the
Chiaki Kasai hot dog the Hoff oh yeah everywhere it's me everywhere this is it

cultural thing oh wow look at that and settle stuff because it so well is
dating here in Salford disabled person now we were headed out to say I'm not
here with my friends from Red Bull where the most incredible rates I've ever
heard of called the exam would you type paraglide climb survive two weeks over
eleven hundred kilometers these assets have been training for over one year

oh god please check out this Here I am at the highest checklist for the Prolog
race I drove the athletes height and they would fare glide down if the
weather was better looking out over all this beauty it made me wonder if the
athlete in the moments when they feel like giving up they draw energy and
inspiration from their surroundings we just spent about 20 minutes driving up
this mountain and tell me why the athletes that were down there I've
already made I can't help but admire just the drive
in the will of the human spirit it's motivating see how to push them their
body to the next level go in the same way the athletes go I was watching to go
down like squatting a little bit and back on the heel it's all quad this is
base camp but these are all the RV's of the different athletes and basically
this is their home for the next two weeks inside of these cars I'm here
right now guys with Gavin he looks super young he's super fit he's actually 45
years old he just got with a pro law so how was that today was kind of brutal
cuz I'm pretty fast up yeah and fine on the flat so I was fine getting up to the
turn point but they they cancelled the flying on the way up so it means we
couldn't fly down we had to walk back down and for me it's very much a walk
and walk slow dude I don't have much cartilage in my knees so I take it
pretty slow going down I do a lot of mobility stuff so a lot of rollin now I
mean actually a lot of balls and bands and diet food we explain I mean would
you eat this morning I go in a pretty heavy fat and protein diet and I'm
pretty my body's pretty fat adaptive mantle after all the months of training
so I know what we shoot for and we still need carbs and sugar and fuel for like
to keep from bonding and you know when you really need it but this morning I
had tunnel avvocato for eggs quite a bit of bacon a little bit of bread and and
then a lot of coffee did you carve up after today for all I did a bit actually
a big thing offer sausage they were after here in
Austria so topography it really depends on where we are in the race and and what
we're about to do now I don't want to do too much of a gun arm but you know
nighttime is when really wouldn't before the next day to giving calories yes what
do you tell yourself in those moments where you're with your body is saying
okay no more what do you tell yourself in your mind to get to get yourself past
how can you do this race is on this being the middleman sometimes it's just
pure pain and we just got to park that somewhere else I mean what we're doing
very widely it can be terrifying and really scary and you can get me some
really bad situation and but if you got that player clear they patrol being at
Earth you've got to just be able to compartmentalize and personal oxide and
pain all right that's just attitude I loved what I said he said being good at
suffering and I think so many times we try to take up the shortcut no shortcuts
me and there's only one way to get there thank you for talking to me with
interstates angustia mortuary now with a program back to the campus morning Basecamp
not at all Canton under but somebody cook them
something over here hey what's going on Roman how you doing are you are you man
yeah very good good yes I see I heard the talk to live inside here come on
we're sure this is a creep dishes food we're Tom's apartment here Thomas of you
this is really peaceful um yeah okay and then if we go inside here my god using
the bathroom is kind of stores my glider and partes
yeah you get quite a bit of space and there's a little bit in a really tight
on come on please George we're the freighter look at that
fridge eh that's not your fridge this is not just a race just like getting your
body ready to run a marathon it's like strategy you gotta know things
about a give your I mean you know they gave you a bigger life at the west
exactly there's the meteorology there's flying
the glider which of course requires really good muscle coordination it's
making this equipment a part of your body you know and same with the glider
you know the more in tune with the glider you are the more just starts to
feel like a part of you psychologically being able to stay calm and deal with
stresses and fear you know a big part of its been like me learn to relax and have
8 9 10 hour flying days in strong conditions and so energy at the end of
the day not feeling not feel pooped you know I mean the race is what 1,300
kilometers yeah how do you know where to go you know looking at Google Earth
looking at these different open-source trail maps things like that really nice
thing about a pair of ours we can range in a really small place I feel like I'm
back in like high school or college right I got you no no it was good
because I'm sitting here like amazing like wow this is this is not what you
know like people think it is it's much more the training goes well
beyond the gym it extends to the classroom as well and when you are tired
and your legs are burning what do you tell yourself to keep going you know
I've done some ultramarathon student it's kind of the same say it's
relentless forward progress do you have time this morning to to cook something
with me yeah absolutely all right we got some cabbage here I forget what this one
was I think no this was that we had this is the wild boar ham this is the deer so
we're cutting up masculine cabbage we definitely breathe here remember we're
trying to boost the fat we're thinking this may be kind of lean just because of
how red it is you'll see too many except marbleization right here plus it's wild
game but this one should be kind of fatty to that diet and Emil that's much
more higher in fat I am protein and I don't eat a lot of sauerkraut I think
I've had two maybe once in my life because it's got a is it like a vinegar
that's a little bit but that's mild okay it's not so it's not so vinegary and
then why is it important I'm with the long term thing it's just going to make
it less likely then I pick up some sort of little stomach bug right you might
adjust the system good biotics than it can handle
and populating it with the right biotics are going to make it less likely that a
little bit of water I eat I drink is going to give me gastro stuffer or the
wrong food or someone not washing their hands or something we made a typical breakfast meal with
not so typical breakfast foods wild boar jerky meat goat brie raw broccoli
cabbage avocado mild sauerkraut near jerky olive oil and cranberries no
spices or seasoning just ingredients I'd never consider praying together but I
was learning another lesson how to make tasty fuel you've got the probiotics
with the sauerkraut I think that healthy fats with the olive oil a bus that sets
from the meat and the cheese there we go look we'll go char movement the duck
okay oh it tastes like a salad dressing on it
it's not that's the thing it from the dark round yeah right right that's it so everyone is out here is swimming
right now and it's actually about 65 70 degrees it's sunny at this moment but
usually I would not get in water when it's this cold outside but it's Austria
I never thought my wellness journey would allow me to meet some of the most
elite athletes in the world and bring me to one of the most picturesque places
I've ever seen I'm learning that Plews is more than just something to be
enjoyed and provide nourishment it steals it makes this move it powers us
where we can stretch the limits of our human potential to achieve amazing
things and that's what wellness is a journey and we should give our bodies a
good fuel that will help us endure the other toughest adventure race of all
life

butter okay knowing that we're making a nut butter and banana protein smoothie
here's what you're gonna need we need a 1 ripe banana toss it in just like
Popeye you're gonna need some spinach we're gonna sneak this into the recipe
the great thing about spinach is that it packs tons of nutrients but not too much
flavor so you can sneak this in really easily into your smoothie
next you're gonna add in your choice of nut butter I'm gonna be using some
almond butter so this is some vanilla whey protein powder but feel free to use
some collagen peptides or our vegan plant-based protein lastly you need some
water or some almond milk I'm gonna be using some unsweetened almond milk of
mine if you don't want to add ice then just freeze your banana overnight and
use that instead and that will go to work and we have a delicious peanut butter
bomb smoothie this is awesome sneak that green in there giving your
daily dose of raw vegetables such an easy and tasty way to go ahead and do it

what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men kitchen in an effort for us all to keep our diets
fresh this summer and to get us to consume a lot more raw veggies and fruit
I am kicking off a five-day smoothie challenge just know that each base
recipe has only four ingredients so there is no excuse for you not to
participate now I've done these challenges before on Instagram and
Facebook but this is my first time actually bringing it to the YouTube
community which actually makes a whole lot of sense now that I think about it
because I can explain the challenges I can walk through them and I can also
answer frequently asked questions like this one hey kev this is a juice cleanse
this juice fasts brah oh hey I can barely make it a five-hour flight across
the country let alone of four weeks of just drinking some juice so no this is
not that at all this is one smoothie each day for five days a total of five
different smoothies now if you're one of those persons out there and you're
already enjoying smoothies and juices every single day then you are ahead of
the curve but I still invite you to take this challenge because you may learn
something new and also you can inspire somebody else now here's how this
challenge works each day on social media on Instagram or Facebook I'm going to
post a new smoothie recipe you're going to take that recipe you're going to
create it you're going to take a picture of it you're going to post it and you're
going to tag it hash tag SMC smoothie and then say what you liked about it or
say what you're going to change about it for the future you have no idea that
people that you will inspire by doing it okay like here's what you're going to
need to succeed this week this is our grocery list you're going to need finish
kale lettuce beets carrots bananas oranges apples protein powder cottage
cheese almond milk Greek yogurt avocado frozen strawberries pineapple frozen
blueberries oatmeal dates or agave turmeric ginger matcha green tea powder
raw cashews and cinnamon remember that you can get this entire grocery
this from fit Minkus calm so even though I'm listing in that right here on fit
men cook calm you can get the exact quantity so you're not buying the entire
produce section when it comes to buying frozen fruit versus fresh fruit
I actually prefer to buy the frozen fruit because it doesn't emit the need
to Elm to add ice to your smoothies Plus fruits like avocado and banana when they
are blooming from a frozen state they tend to have an ice cream like texture
so they make your smoothies that much colder and also creamier to reiterate
each base smoothie recipe has only four ingredients with optional add-ons to
help to boost the flavor or to boost the nutrient content something like a
protein powder in order to boost the protein content these are single serving
recipes and it makes about 16 ounces on average but keep in mind that some of
the ingredients tend to be a lot more voluminous when they have women together
so you can enjoy those over two servings and you should feel free to enjoy these
smoothies as snacks as we're in between meals or even post-workout treat but I
reiterate this is not a juice cleanse reduce fat you should be eating actually
doing this challenge finally the most important thing that you will need for
this challenge is a quality blender one common complaint that I get from people
when about making smoothies is that they can never get it blended well enough
they've got chunks of individual ingredients included you could have a
sliver blender that can barely chop up celery my mom taught me a long time ago
that while cheap is expedient and efficient it can also be very expensive
and you'll end up paying more in the long run I'll be using the Vitamix is
sent to 3500 I've used tons of Vitamix products here on my page which you've
probably seen and I really enjoy the brand they have top-notch quality
service it's pretty much hassle free which is important because this is an
investment into your health and you want something that's going to last you
throughout your wellness journey so if you are ready to roll up your sleeves
and get your later people start doing advanced and it's pretty dated it's
pretty dated right I'm gonna do a good dad yeah okay
you see you are ready to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty guys
then let's get started first up is a golden yellow smoothie
it's very creamy because we al auto and pretty yellow because of the
turmeric and the carrot but in the end it turns out to be a surprisingly cool
yet spicy smoothie check it out add about six ounces of water then one large
carrot half an avocado one small red apple and a half medium peeled cucumber
then an optional one inch piece of ginger and a one-inch piece of turmeric
top it off with ice then pop the top gradually increase the speed until it's
at the max then blend until smooth next we've got an off pink smoothie
lettuce in a smoothie absolutely you see lettuce provides a
lot of moisture doesn't have a very strong flavor and it's pretty easy to
blend check it out first we're going to add one cup of almond milk 1/2 cup of
chopped lettuce one banana and five frozen strawberries then boost the
protein with an optional scoop of unflavored or vanilla whey protein
powder gradually increase the speed until it's at the max send blend until
smooth next we got a hipster green smoothie it doesn't get any more basic
than adding spinach to a smoothie so we're going to jazz it up by adding in
some cottage cheese to boost the casein protein which is going to feed your body
and your muscles throughout the day check it out
add one cup of 2% cottage cheese 2 cups of raw spinach one banana and a half cup
of fresh pineapple add an optional teaspoon of matcha green tea powder top
it off with ice then pop the top then blend until smooth next we got a very
red smoothie now I've come to appreciate beats and recipes besides the
nutritional value of them I also like the fact that they provide a lot of
sweetness which basically eliminates the need to add in processed sugar and for
those out there who don't like kale because it has two hearts of the flavor
pairing it with the beets and the citrus helps to mask that flavor but to also
get the nutritional benefits of the kale check it out add about 8 ounces of water
2 cups of shredded kale one mandarin orange one beat and 1/2 a cup of frozen
blueberries then add an optional 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon top it off with ice and
blend until smooth lastly we got a sweet and salty smoothie
this is my favorite smoothie for this entire theory it's a delicious new
replacement smoothie for breakfast for lunch and in between meal or even a
post-workout Cashion's have a very light and sweet flavor and when they're
blended together they tend to be much creamier than most nuts
especially when they're soaked now I recommend adding in the option on one
date here because it's going to help to boost the flavor of it but you've never
experimented with base before and recipes then try it out just one time
one date goes a long way it's a very energizing ingredient especially for
those who train really hard or work in hard conditions check it out add one cup
of 2% Greek yogurt one banana 1/3 cup of raw cashews and two tablespoons of raw
oatmeal then select either one date or half a tablespoon of agave add ice you
can pop the top and blend until smooth add some coarse sea salt to the rim of a
blast then pour in the drink enjoy and thank me later that is it for today's
video remember to check out fitmin cook com to get the recipes the grocery list
essentially anything that I covered in today's video you can get right now from
trip Minkus calm and remember to follow the challenge next week on the pit mix
of social media channels you can follow me on Instagram on Facebook and Twitter
it's at fit men cooking all those properties and remember to tag your
smoothie pics hashtag FMC's movies so we can all follow your progress now
challenges like these are much more enjoyable when you have a friend so tag
you're fit homie share this video with them and challenge them to do this with
you alright job until next time I want you
to keep it healthy but of course never ever boring boom let's get blending bye 
what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen so we are on day three of our hitting smoothie
challenge in honor of Heart Month here in the u.s. we're challenging ourselves
to get active for at least 15 minutes each day and get ourselves to some good
sweat and also in doing a heart-healthy smoothie so today's workout is gonna be
inspired by another person that I really admire out there in social media
his real thing was around the job probably know him as mi-8 Fitness Mia
Fitness he is straight out of Miami and let me tell you this dude is a beast he
does a lot of bodybuilding workouts but he does these amazing track workouts
where he's focused on the ABS and also the quad
so today's workout is going to be inspired by him now as a reminder
reach-around is five minutes we're going to do the exercise for 50 seconds and
then rest for 10 seconds in between but take all the time that you need to
recuperate just in case after the entire round you're going to rest for one whole
minute and then do the whole thing again the challenge is to do this at least 3
times so that you can be active for 15 minutes today alright job let's get
started yeah like you back all right today we are making a decadent
chocolate mint protein smoothie again these are very simple ingredients that
pack a whole lot of flavor so here's what you're gonna need
avocado avocado is gonna be our heart-healthy star for this smoothie
next we're gonna use some cacao I think I love about cacao is that it's rich in
fiber of magnesium and it's packed with antioxidant but make sure that you get
actual real cacao or at least 60% dark chocolate powder next we're going to be
using some protein powder now this is vanilla whey protein powder because
that's all I have but if you have some chocolate protein powder you can use
that you can also use collagen peptides or some vegan plant-based proteins and
now we're gonna add in the mint so you're gonna toss in some fresh mint
leaves about 2 or 3 now you can use some water but I'm gonna be using some
unsweetened almond milk instead now the avocado is gonna make it really
nice and creamy the cacao is gonna give us that nice dark chocolate flavor and
then the vanilla whey protein is going to actually give us a boost of protein
now it also is gonna serve to help to sweeten this smoothie because cacao can
be very very bitter if you're looking for something sweeter then you can add
in some stevia in the raw or toss in a date and there's good at work creamy dark chocolate mint smoothie look
at that look how rich and creamy that is that is a little piece of avocado at
work oh this is good you're gonna live at this movie let me know how to hit and
smoothie challenge is going and let me know how you enjoyed this smoothie
because you will love it alright y'all Cheers I think the hardest part for me is just
like make into balance because like you're doing it it looks really easy but
when you actually start doing it you're gonna activate everything it's not the
reason why I like to is he doesn't lot of leg stuff but whatever you work your
legs and work your core a lot yeah because I've gotta keep it really tight
I keep that cord again maintain balance right I can't believe we're sweating
this much and my abs are burning we get to technically to epic than my abs are
burning yeah it's that this is why even when you
do the squats here's to engage your core the entire selphie may be wrong I know 
what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen we're on day five of the Hitmen sweden challenge
where we are challenging ourselves to get active for at least 15 minutes each
day and also enjoy a heart healthy smoothie right after our workout now
today's video is also inspired by someone that I truly admire in social
media and that is Miss Jeanette you may know her as the Hollywood trainer she
trains up everybody that you can think of them you can think of a movie star
she's probably work with them she even works with King Serena curry king Serena
Williams if you don't talk about the you know the tennis pro that King Serena now
getting tortured and not getting tortured but working out is so much more
enjoyable whenever you have a friend so I'm gonna let you touch here with me
today to do this to do this insane workout as a reminder this entire
workout is 15 minutes so we're going to do three rounds of five-minute rounds
each round consists of five exercises each exercise is 50 seconds with a 10
second rest in between and then a one minute rest after the entire round so
we're going to be right at about 15 minutes yes Oh are you a mess here we go good thanks Oh
again try this two more times alright let's go to the kitchen
alright it is smoothie time I'm gonna give you a hint at what we're making
today if you like me you got that it's a hint okay we're making a pina colada
protein smoothie here's what you're gonna need for it sneak in a little bit
of spinach it's really easy to incorporate into smoothie recipes next
we're gonna add in our heart healthy star today is gonna be wrong we use half
a banana some pineapple because what is the Pina Colada without pineapple one
thing that I really love about pineapple two is that it has this property in it
called bromelain which really is an anti-inflammatory and
it's great for recovery after a workout next you're gonna need some protein
powder I'll be using a vanilla whey protein powder but no worries you can
use a collagen peptide or even a vegan plant-based protein and some coconut
these are unsweetened coconut flakes next you're gonna pour in some almond
milk or some water this is unsweetened almond milk it's
only about thirty calories per cup so I'm not concerned about adding this into
my smoothie top it off with some ice pop the top and get to work protein pina colada smoothie it's a
brilliant green color hmm just like a party but like I'm on South Beach right
now so make this smoothie take a picture of it

Oh 
what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit min could kitchen today's video is actually inspired by a recent
interview that I had about meal prep so we're well into the interview and then
she asked me well Kevin what do you do on a weekly basis because you're always
cooking my steak you know that's a good question I really just kind of keep it
simple and I'll just make it make a big batch of chicken a big batch of quinoa
and then just mix and match no big deal it's you're like well what does that
mean how do you mix and match just two ingredients I said oh no so let's say
that for part of the week I want to have Moroccan so I'll just add in some
chickpeas some almonds and some raisins or something like that and then later on
I want to have tex-mex so I add in some people to gallo some corn black beans
some avocado and then it's just basically taking the base ingredients of
chicken in the quinoa but I'm tricking my taste buds into thinking that I'm
having something different just by adding in a few ingredients here and
there but she's like that's a really cool idea
can I see a video on that mmm she got me because I realized that I don't have a
video showing one of my staple lunch box ideas so today's video is just that I'm
gonna be showing you all how to take some lettuce some ground meat and
tomatoes and basically transforming it three different ways in fact there's no
cooking at all except for the ground meat now one thing that I do want to
stress here is that you need to get a very lean meat because all three of
these meals are gonna be served cold and you do not want to be eating some cold
patty ground meat because it tastes really gritty it ends up looking like
real orange and stuff because all the fat has congealed on it it's not hot you
probably have to heat up your entire meal I'll be using a very lean bison but
you can use lean turkey you can lose you can use a chicken breast it's up to you
all right doc if you are ready to roll up your sleeves for this lunchbox trio
then let's get started spray a nonstick skillet with olive oil and add onion
then tossing your choice of lean ground meat I'm using Bisons
sprinkle in some garlic and smoked paprika and continue to cook it up next
chop up some green lettuce then dice some roma tomatoes to your meal
container add the lettuce then meat in tomatoes then add black beans fresh
avocado and a little cheddar topped and jalapeno for some heat and a small bit
of Greek yogurt add a pinch of sea salt and pepper now when you want to change
great cucumber over Greek yogurt then add garlic fresh dill a pinch of sea
salt and pepper and fresh lemon mix it up and refrigerate overnight for maximum
flavor add it to your meal container along with wheat pita chips or free pita
bread and if you like add black and kalamata olives when you want to change
from that mix chickpeas bell pepper cucumber thyme oregano olive oil and red
onion if you can stand the bite mix it up then add a pinch of sea salt and
pepper along with feta cheese add it to your meal container and pair
with your favorite low-calorie vinaigrette boom now wave goodbye the lunchtime

Oh bye 
what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen for today's quick recipe we are firing up the slow
cooker because it is that time of year again to make this incredible coconut
curry dish this dish is very easy to customize and make your own to
complement your budget and also your diet now one of the key ingredients that
I'll be using in this dish to thicken up the sauce and to give it some texture
and flavor is going to be peanut butter but if you're allergic to peanuts or if
you want to try something else you can easily swap that out for almond butter
and also cashew butter I'll be using chicken in this dish but if you want to
go to the plant base route you can do that too I recommend using some saut√©ed
eggplant or sauteed tofu just remember to toss those in at the very end of the
dish don't toss those in at the very beginning as I'm gonna do with this
chicken all right guys check it out add coconut oil garlic
ginger and red onions saute for 2 minutes then add red curry paste cook
for another 2 minutes add light coconut milk peanut butter fish sauce broth soy
sauce and coconut sugar mix it up then add carrots and chicken breasts cook on
high for 4 hours after about 3 hours you're gonna pop the top and add bell
peppers give it a stir and cook for the remaining time spray a nonstick skillet
with olive oil then toss some garlic and green onion add cauliflower pearls with
a splash of veggie stock and cook for 3 to 5 minutes until soft boom garnishes coconut curry with fresh
cilantro lime juice and red pepper flakes enjoy this dish with raw purple

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen you know thinking about my fitness journey
early on I used to get really overwhelmed and bogged down when it came
to meal prep because I'd be looking for complete dishes like a casserole or
maybe even a stir-fry because what stir-fry you know that you're gonna have
to eat it with rice or quinoa and it was just much easier to think of meal prep
when I had a full complete meal but then I shift my focus to the side dish
because I begin to think well even if I were to bake an entire tray of chicken
breasts I could save the meal with a not so boring side so today I'm going to
show you four more meal prep sides that you can incorporate into your weekly
rotations to take your meals to the next level and in some cases these side
dishes can also double as a main dish you never know it just depends on your
diet admittedly this topic is fresh in my mind because I realized after
shooting this video this past weekend after watching the Longhorns lose again
- oh you but anyway I realized that I had just finished up writing the side
section of the cookbook so this is top of mind for me as well now these won't
be in the cookbook but they're pretty dope - all right guys so grab your
notepad grab your iPad or your Android tablet see Android I got love for y'all
alright and let's get started first we're making a light squash primavera
with the fall upon us I wanted to show how we can incorporate seasonal produce
like the winter squash into our diet because it's so amazing and you don't
get it year-round now this is a pasta dish but it's also for your meal prep so
as you're thinking about customizing it y'all don't think about adding in things
that are really calorie dense because you're gonna walk around feeling full
and bloated all day long so as you think about customizing this think about
things like your favorite herb or your favorite seasonal vegetables that you
can toss in to really make this dish pop check it out first
slice the squash down the middle and scoop out the seeds spray it with a
little olive oil roast for 40 minutes at 400 bring a pot of water to a boil and
add wheat pasta cook it until it's done remove the skin from the squash then
chop it into pieces spray a skillet with olive oil then add zucchini and bell
pepper and if you like toss and mince garlic as well add it to the wheat pasta
along with the squash some pasta water and fresh lemon juice sprinkle in
parmesan sea salt and pepper then fold everything together garnish with fresh
parsley again make this dish your own but just keep it light and I think the
fresh lemon helps out with that too remember that you want to be satisfied
but you don't want to feel bloated so rely less on the cheese and rely on
more on incorporating vegetables to make the dish much more hearty next we are
putting a full spin on some potato salad with this horse potato salad I got this
idea after having a salad with roasted potatoes and with a creamy horseradish
dressing and the flavors came together in an unexpected but really good way so
I was like hey let's turn this into a meal prep dish here it is
it's a boiling water we're going to add some red potatoes simmer for 20 minutes
until they're soft add the potatoes to a bowl and mash them using a fork or
masher add horseradish olive oil mayo or light mayo red onion and green bell for
some crunch mix it up then toss in chopped arugula season to taste with sea
salt pepper and dried chives as far as swaps are concerned you can swap out the
Mayo for Greek yogurt it's gonna give it a protein boost but you may need to add
in about 1 or 2 tablespoons of olive oil just so those taters don't dry out next
up we're making a turkey shaved Brussels sprout salad it's funny because growing
up I hated Brussels sprouts you couldn't put any amount of cheese or butter on
them to get me to eat them I just hated them so it's funny now in my adult life
I'm trying them again for the first time for the first time and I'm actually
enjoying them and here's one of my favorite ways to enjoy them raw check it
out spray a skillet with olive oil then toss in real turkey bacon from leg meat
cook until it's crispy relax Brussels sprouts using a mandolin
or sharp knife then mix olive oil mayo or light Mayo with Dijon and apple cider
vinegar pour it over the Brussels sprouts and mix everything together add
in the turkey bacon and finally goat cheese crumble season
to taste with sea salt and pepper remember you can customize this salad
using your own vinaigrette so think about a lemon and caper vinaigrette or
even a sesame ginger and the really cool thing about goat cheese is that it pairs
nicely with almost anything lastly here it is a hearty farro salad
now this is a complete meal by itself so you can actually eat it as a main dish
but of course it functions well as a side dish if you can't find farro or
have a gluten allergy then you can easily swap out the farro for brown rice
check it out cook up some farro then add kalamata olives cherry tomatoes diced
cucumber and chopped parsley mix together then add lemon juice pepper and
feta cheese garnish and enjoy and remember guys to use the kalamata olives
with the oil you can find those generally in grocery stores that have an
olive bar but you don't want to use the canned ones so oil is really going to
help to boost the macro nutrient density of the meal but also help to bring all
those flavors together alright guys that is it for today's video I appreciate
y'all watching and for hanging out with me here in the kitchen it's always a
good time I cannot wait to see how you all just customized these recipes and

hello Hank the kid okay German hey Joe recently my Friend Red Bull invited me
to Salzburg Austria for the kickoff of the world's toughest adventure rate to X
out my objective discover how elite athletes fuel and
power their bodies and prepare their minds to tackle challenges on land and
in the a and yes of course I sample local cuisine and discover a
brand new culture here's part one in my adventure yep we went from torrential rain - now
stunning beautiful I forget that like Austria and is there
really all about efficient living and stuff so I'm like where's the closet
here's the bed that's dope everything is so compact and then you put your clothes
back here did it show if you do that that's where we're going it's beautiful
castle like in Game of Thrones I think we're getting close because here we can
take a trolley oh we can walk through the way I'm going
to see how long the walk is let's go check out this view Salzburg is postcard
beautiful it the picturesque European city surrounded by rolling hills and
mountains that are kissed by clouds even with a slight overcast and sporadic rain
showers it's easily one of the most beautiful cities I've ever seen then I
rank your own now starving like Marvin you're accustomed to eat no no I love
the food trucks here's the end look oh I like that one a
giant hot dog wrapped in bacon with cheese on it you know give it oh the
Chiaki Kasai hot dog the Hoff oh yeah everywhere it's me everywhere this is it
this point I've wrapped in bacon bro okay I'm kidding seriously
I'm only trying this because he said it was Austrian so is that like a mr.
cultural thing oh wow look at that and settle stuff because it so well is
dating here in Salford disabled person now we were headed out to say I'm not
here with my friends from Red Bull where the most incredible rates I've ever
heard of called the exam would you type paraglide climb survive two weeks over
eleven hundred kilometers these assets have been training for over one year
just for this moment to make exhale history most people who train pretty
hard it's around maybe three thousand calories a McPherson these athletes are
eating up to 7,000 8,000 calories per day the most elite athletes in the
entire world and we're going to go and talk to them right now usual was about a 45-minute drive which
allowed me to see more the countryside as you can see no filter was needed I'm here with Richard he is the social
media manager for the Excel Keynes and he was just telling me about the crazy
racial it starts over here right yeah it's right over here behind us it raced
along this path and then they they basically they disappear through a
tunnel and then they run to the top of the hill for horn which unfortunately
you can't see from here yeah it's like a solid ten kilometer run this is actually
a Leatherman prologue which is a introductory race this is a warm-up this
is the warmup I think being in Salzburg and now being here at this part the
temperature just dropped it I'm guessing because we're surrounded by all these
mountains you can see Pig Tourette's isn't it the water well see how cold it
is Oh actually you know what it's pretty warm it's not that it's not that cold I
was going to be like ice cold like mountain water Plex it's pretty fresh
and here are the athletes representing the Stars and Stripes Jesse Williams
Gavin McClure and Ricky Mitchell I Lee we're driving right now communication
stuff but you can see some of that because right now trying to get through and it's cat
literally just cow jumped in front of the road like the counters get up there
like it was a bitch ma'am Cap'n I'm out of bread just being
in the car just sitting here and I'm out of breath right now
literally I can't really breathe there's a wall right
oh god please check out this Here I am at the highest checklist for the Prolog
race I drove the athletes height and they would fare glide down if the
weather was better looking out over all this beauty it made me wonder if the
athlete in the moments when they feel like giving up they draw energy and
inspiration from their surroundings we just spent about 20 minutes driving up
this mountain and tell me why the athletes that were down there I've
already made I can't help but admire just the drive
in the will of the human spirit it's motivating see how to push them their
body to the next level go in the same way the athletes go I was watching to go
down like squatting a little bit and back on the heel it's all quad this is
base camp but these are all the RV's of the different athletes and basically
this is their home for the next two weeks inside of these cars I'm here
right now guys with Gavin he looks super young he's super fit he's actually 45
years old he just got with a pro law so how was that today was kind of brutal
cuz I'm pretty fast up yeah and fine on the flat so I was fine getting up to the
turn point but they they cancelled the flying on the way up so it means we
couldn't fly down we had to walk back down and for me it's very much a walk
and walk slow dude I don't have much cartilage in my knees so I take it
pretty slow going down I do a lot of mobility stuff so a lot of rollin now I
mean actually a lot of balls and bands and diet food we explain I mean would
you eat this morning I go in a pretty heavy fat and protein diet and I'm
pretty my body's pretty fat adaptive mantle after all the months of training
so I know what we shoot for and we still need carbs and sugar and fuel for like
to keep from bonding and you know when you really need it but this morning I
had tunnel avvocato for eggs quite a bit of bacon a little bit of bread and and
then a lot of coffee did you carve up after today for all I did a bit actually
a big thing offer sausage they were after here in
Austria so topography it really depends on where we are in the race and and what
we're about to do now I don't want to do too much of a gun arm but you know
nighttime is when really wouldn't before the next day to giving calories yes what
do you tell yourself in those moments where you're with your body is saying
okay no more what do you tell yourself in your mind to get to get yourself past
how can you do this race is on this being the middleman sometimes it's just
pure pain and we just got to park that somewhere else I mean what we're doing
very widely it can be terrifying and really scary and you can get me some
really bad situation and but if you got that player clear they patrol being at
Earth you've got to just be able to compartmentalize and personal oxide and
pain all right that's just attitude I loved what I said he said being good at
suffering and I think so many times we try to take up the shortcut no shortcuts
me and there's only one way to get there thank you for talking to me with
interstates angustia mortuary now with a program back to the campus morning Basecamp
not at all Canton under but somebody cook them
something over here hey what's going on Roman how you doing are you are you man
yeah very good good yes I see I heard the talk to live inside here come on
we're sure this is a creep dishes food we're Tom's apartment here Thomas of you
this is really peaceful um yeah okay and then if we go inside here my god using
the bathroom is kind of stores my glider and partes
yeah you get quite a bit of space and there's a little bit in a really tight
on come on please George we're the freighter look at that
fridge eh that's not your fridge this is not just a race just like getting your
body ready to run a marathon it's like strategy you gotta know things
about a give your I mean you know they gave you a bigger life at the west
exactly there's the meteorology there's flying
the glider which of course requires really good muscle coordination it's
making this equipment a part of your body you know and same with the glider
you know the more in tune with the glider you are the more just starts to
feel like a part of you psychologically being able to stay calm and deal with
stresses and fear you know a big part of its been like me learn to relax and have
8 9 10 hour flying days in strong conditions and so energy at the end of
the day not feeling not feel pooped you know I mean the race is what 1,300
kilometers yeah how do you know where to go you know looking at Google Earth
looking at these different open-source trail maps things like that really nice
thing about a pair of ours we can range in a really small place I feel like I'm
back in like high school or college right I got you no no it was good
because I'm sitting here like amazing like wow this is this is not what you
know like people think it is it's much more the training goes well
beyond the gym it extends to the classroom as well and when you are tired
and your legs are burning what do you tell yourself to keep going you know
I've done some ultramarathon student it's kind of the same say it's
relentless forward progress do you have time this morning to to cook something
with me yeah absolutely all right we got some cabbage here I forget what this one
was I think no this was that we had this is the wild boar ham this is the deer so
we're cutting up masculine cabbage we definitely breathe here remember we're
trying to boost the fat we're thinking this may be kind of lean just because of
how red it is you'll see too many except marbleization right here plus it's wild
game but this one should be kind of fatty to that diet and Emil that's much
more higher in fat I am protein and I don't eat a lot of sauerkraut I think
I've had two maybe once in my life because it's got a is it like a vinegar
that's a little bit but that's mild okay it's not so it's not so vinegary and
then why is it important I'm with the long term thing it's just going to make
it less likely then I pick up some sort of little stomach bug right you might
adjust the system good biotics than it can handle
and populating it with the right biotics are going to make it less likely that a
little bit of water I eat I drink is going to give me gastro stuffer or the
wrong food or someone not washing their hands or something we made a typical breakfast meal with
not so typical breakfast foods wild boar jerky meat goat brie raw broccoli
cabbage avocado mild sauerkraut near jerky olive oil and cranberries no
spices or seasoning just ingredients I'd never consider praying together but I
was learning another lesson how to make tasty fuel you've got the probiotics
with the sauerkraut I think that healthy fats with the olive oil a bus that sets
from the meat and the cheese there we go look we'll go char movement the duck
okay oh it tastes like a salad dressing on it
it's not that's the thing it from the dark round yeah right right that's it so everyone is out here is swimming
right now and it's actually about 65 70 degrees it's sunny at this moment but
usually I would not get in water when it's this cold outside but it's Austria
I never thought my wellness journey would allow me to meet some of the most
elite athletes in the world and bring me to one of the most picturesque places
I've ever seen I'm learning that Plews is more than just something to be
enjoyed and provide nourishment it steals it makes this move it powers us
where we can stretch the limits of our human potential to achieve amazing
things and that's what wellness is a journey and we should give our bodies a
good fuel that will help us endure the other toughest adventure race of all
life 
what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen today we are getting our hands really dirty down and
busy in the kitchen cooking up some seafood that's right we are talking
about how to cook seafood in bulk for meal prep
I think the norm for everyone out there is just to season up your fish put it
onto a pan and stick it in the oven and when you're done don't get me wrong
there are tons of ways out there to cook sea food for meal prep but when we're
talking about cooking things in bulk we are trying to get in and out of the
kitchen as quickly as possible so because seafood is one of those
things that I feel like people I have generally mastered or got their own
rhythm down I'm going to spend the bulk of today's video answering some
frequently asked questions when it comes to seafood plus of course you know I'm
going to share some of my favorite ways to cook seafood in bulk for prep all
right we got a lot of stuff to cover today so let's roll up our sleeves okay
I roll up our sleeves at demands like dibs so let's roll up our sleeves and
let's get started before we happen to today's video when it comes to seafood I
want to make three quick points number one buy fresh seafood over frozen
seafood whenever possible back in the day when I first started out on my
journey I will go to Walmart and I would buy the eleven dollar blue box of frozen
tilapia what I began to notice was that with the frozen fish it began to break
apart much easier and there wasn't a lot of flavor to it
so with my own personal preference to buy fresh over frozen whenever possible
we don't really think about this but fish goes bad pretty quickly and because
of that is often offered at a discount at our supermarkets whenever you buy it
fresh if you're not eating seafood that week and you still see it on sale and
it's fresh I would recommend just going ahead and buying it anyway and then
freezing it and that way you have your own fresh frozen seafood that you can
enjoy whenever you're ready frozen foods in particular proteins tend to hold a
lot of water so once you defrost the fish you're going to want to lay out
some paper towels and place the fish on the paper towel and let a lot of that
water come out of it so again whenever possible buy fresh fish but if you can't
frozen as a viable option but just follow those steps number two deals with
storage cooked fish or cooked seafood can remain
fresh in the fridge for about three days now it's my own personal preference not
to allow anything any cooked seafood over two days in my fridge because I'm
very sensitive to smells and so I just think it kind of smells funny
so anything that I'm not going to eat within two days I'm only too free
the third point I want to make is about wild fish versus farm twist now this is
a huge debate right now within the healthy eating community now
scientifically there is no easy answer to this so I just can't tell you yes or
no because I think there are pros and cons on both sides and it genuinely does
come down to a personal preference nutritionally whenever you're looking at
the wild versus a farmed fish they are pretty much equivalent because of the
advancement of the feeds if they've been able to give the farmed fish so since
they're both to say nutritionally it really comes down to a personal
preference with things that you have to consider such as the environmental
impact how the fish are harvested food safety and also just a bottom line which
is your cause a big question I get is if farmed fish safe and this question
arrived because of the study that works that I think was back in 2004 early 2000
whereby they showed that farmed fish had a statistically significantly higher
number of contaminants than the wild caught fish however whenever you dive
into that statistic what you'll find is that even though they were higher in
contaminants the number of contaminants in the farmed fish was still lower than
the amount being to be dangerous for human consumption so technically the
fish is still deemed safe to eat when it comes to the topic of environmental
impact many people have concerns about the way that wild caught fish are
harvested there are oftentimes large machines that will disrupt the
surrounding ecosystem and and pollute the surrounding environment and so that
is a huge concern for many people this is not a blanket statement to say that
all wild caught fish are harvested in unsustainable ways and that are
negatively impacting the environment but it is a concern for many
and of course the bottom line here is cause oftentimes farm fish is offered at
much cheaper prices than the wild caught fish and so many people are forced to
make that decision based off of their budget and let me tell you there's
nothing wrong with that now I want to deal with some of the most common types
of fish for meal prep the fatty fish like salmon versus the white fish the
lean fish like cod orange roughy and tilapia first up is salmon this is a
beautiful wild cut piece of salmon right here omega-3 fatty acids is probably one
of the main reasons why people like to eat pre fruit particularly salmon
because salmon is really rich in it while salmon gets the omega-3 fatty
acids from feeding off the algae and the plankton whereas the farm-raised salmon
get it from the feed or many other feeds they are developing them now with a
little bit less fish meal and much more fish oil in order to make sure that have
enough of the omega-3 fatty acids in them so what you'll find is that on
average the farm-raised fish are fattier but the wild caught salmon have more
iron calcium and potassium now with that stuff out of the way let's
get down to cooking the salmon I always hear from people that salmon is too
fishy I ate salmon this is the reason why don't overcook your sin did you know
that the longer you cook salmon that this year is become the fat content and
the salmon allows it to tolerate a lot more heat without drying out so now I
cook it at about 420 degrees for no more than 15 minutes and it's perfect I will
say that that frozen packaged sandwich is a little bit fishy er on average in
my experience medium-rare is the best we want nice pink moist opaque center and
can you eat the skin off of salmon is the personal preference I personally
love to eat the skin off the salmon especially whenever I cook it in a
skillet and get it nice and crispy but many people don't like to eat it because
of the contaminant if salmon are swimming around and contaminated water
or they're feeding off of things that are contaminated then the toxins built
up in the skin and then that of that salmon now what you can do
with the Effie you bake it just slice off the skin and it'd be just fine
marinating is probably the best way to get rid of any fishy flavor from any
fish particularly the oily fish like salmon so here are two of my favorite
ways for salmon meal prep for the first salmon recipe we're going to make an
easy marinade with fresh orange juice or lemon or lime low-sodium soy si Racha
for a little heat and some ginger stir it all up then pour it in a zip plastic
bag then add the salmon filet close it tight and marinate for at least 30
minutes or overnight to lock in the flavor for the other fillet we're going
to add olive oil smoked paprika cumin and pepper rub in the seasonings and
cook it immediately add the police to a baking sheet with parchment paper or
foil to prevent sticking add orange slices a little pepper and the remaining
sauce to the marinated fillet bake for 10 to 12 minutes at 420 a red pepper to
the rubbed fillet and garnish with cilantro and lemons and to the orange
marinated fillet garnish with fresh mint to boost those flavors next up is white
fish I got some kada in this hand and some orange roughy in this one
cod is among the lightest tasting and one of the most affordable fish out
there when it comes to buying seafood in bowls for meal prep but orange roughy is
also an amazing viable option but oftentimes people have an adverse
reaction to using orange roughy like myself orange roughy is a very buttery
and very waxy type of fish is called an escolar at the risk of oversimplifying
this and TMI oftentimes our bodies can't digest the fat and waxes in escolar so
what we'll do is we will extract the fat and then we will excrete it so basically
I'm talking about anal leakage so I was eating orange roughy for about two weeks
straight when I went to the gym on this particular day I was sweating more so
than usual from the waist down fast-forward to that night
and then wait going to bed and then waking up in the morning time there was
a huge stain where my butt was that looked like vegetable oil let me tell
you what this was not it's not the best thing for a relationship but it's also a
good test to see if you're in the legend ship with the right person this is a
very common sight a second reaction for people whenever they eat escolar when it
comes to cooking white fish or lean fish it doesn't take that long because it's
super lean so I like to cook it on lower temperatures at around 400 and for the
same amount of time about 15 minutes or so definitely no more than 20 minutes
because I don't want to dry out fish often times I like to spray it with a
little bit of olive oil and then add in my spices and herbs to it so that way it
remains moist and flaky during the baking process now here are a few ways I
like to prepare white fish I love marinating with Greek yogurt
because it helps secure moistness especially to lean proteins that tend to
be dry plus it's an extra boost of protein add Greek yogurt to a plastic
bag then add garlic fresh dill lemon and pepper
add the fillets to cure the bag with no air and gently mash and mix it together
marinate for at least 30 minutes add the police to a baking sheet or baking rack
then bake for 12 to 15 minutes at 400 garnished with pepper dill and lemon
with orange roughy with one egg in a bowl then select your favorite nut I'll
be using pecans because they're much easier to crush up use a mallet or spoon
and mash the pecans of defeats add a dash of panko cumin and garlic mix it
together dips our fish in the a in the nipa con mixture place the fillet on a
baking sheet or baking rack and bake for 15 minutes at 400 garnish with parsley and lemon that's it
for today's video I hope that you all enjoyed it and I hope that I answered
some of your questions when it comes to cooking seafood in bulk if you like
videos like this I want you to smash that like button below and I also want
you to take this a few seconds out to share your favorite way to prep white
fish I cannot tell you how helpful comment sections are people like to
search the comments and they look for suggestions like yours they look for
user of you if you think about it that's one of the main reasons why we love some
of these online channels like Amazon so much because of the customer reviews so
I want you all just to take a few seconds out to share your meal prep tips
when it comes to prepping seafood interval so that way we can all learn
and grow together alright y'all when I thank y'all for watching
until next time keep it healthy but of course never ever boy Oh bye 
what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen if you like me sometimes you can get carried away with
this whole meal prep thing and you end up making way too much food now for me
it was always about the vegetables I'd either by way too many vegetables and
tell myself I was gonna eat them or I would make a pan of roasted veggies and
I would be tired of eating them by the middle of the week that by that time the
weekend came around I would toss those bad boys out yes as fit men cook I can't
admit that I did toss away trays of food at the end of the weekend and you really
can't judge me coz happy isle watching this video I'm probably doing the same
thing but today you are in luck we are all in luck because I got wise about not
wasting food but also about being creative in the kitchen in very
practical and budget efficient ways so today I'm gonna share with you all three
of my favorite ways to eat roasted vegetables to make sure that there is no
food waste by the end of the week now this is the same mix-and-match concept
as before whereby you're gonna make one big long tray one big tray of food and
then just mix and match the roasted vegetables in different recipes each of
the recipes is very very simple to make with minimal ingredients alright guys if
you are ready to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty then let's get
started in a large bowl mix up your favorite veggies I'm using eggplant
squash zucchini butternut squash and red onion add some garlic pinch of sea salt
pepper and olive oil mix it up then dump it on a baking tray and if necessary use
two trays roast for about 30 minutes at 420 well--that's roasting spray a
nonstick skillet and add some lean ground meat I'm using lean beef add some
thyme and sage chop it up while it cooks about 7-8 minutes add some roasted
veggies then pouring a favorite marinara cook
for another three to five minutes then serve garnished with parmesan and
parsley when you want to change cook some jasmine rice and vegetable broth
then add olive oil cilantro pine nuts and some lemon zest mix it up well and
then add in roasted vegetables mix it up one last time you can eat this by itself
or add your choice of protein I especially like this rice with a little
bit of soy sauce now when you want another change beat eggs with fennel
seeds thyme and a pinch of sea salt and pepper add a dollop of Greek yogurt and beat
the eggs one more time spray a cast-iron skillet with olive oil then add some
roasted veggies pour in the eggs and add a touch of Parmesan bake for about 25
minutes at 4:20 what the Texas loan stuff ricotta without some Syrah check
all right child that is it for today's video I hope that y'all enjoyed it and I
hope that you will join me in taking the place to eliminate vegetable food waste
in your diet and household I want you out of comment below with your favorite
recipe of the three that I shared or share one of your favorite ways to eat
roasted veggies it just can't be something like adding a whole bunch of
cheese or drowning it in sauce and I'm really just talking about myself but if
you have a separate idea from those definitely share below so we can
eliminate food waste and all of our diets also if you like this video I'd
like you to do one big Serena slam mmm on that like button below alright y'all
thank y'all for watching of course until next time keep it healthy but never ever
boring boo bye y'all

what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit min cook kitchen well so as you can see I'm not in my usual kitchen
I'm actually down the street but I'm still here in beautiful sunny very hot
Dallas Texas and I am making this video because guys I'm so excited that today
is the day today we are making meal prep history first before make the
announcement gotta bring somebody up here under this all the way from across
the pond from the UK coming in hey Andre okay go ahead okay yeah so basically
we've been getting a ton of feedback on the thin bank account people love it but
they want more sort of personalized meal plans that are very sort of focused on
their individual calories and macros so we spent the past six months building
this brand new out thinker it in secret working very hard to keep it a secret
but uh but yet now it's coming together and we are so so excited because we've
managed to get a bunch of features in here but yeah we weren't sure we were
going to be able to do and it was a ton of like back and forward and this
project kept changing and everything right but it's great when it you see it
come together beautiful in fact I want to show you a quick video demo of what
people are going to see when they open up this brand new 6e app check it out what is going on y'all so I've been
listening to your feedback and one of the main pain points that I've heard is

solution and today we are announcing meal prep Pro that is right meal prep

iPad and the Apple watch as they're pretty dope be alright I know just wait
till you actually get it into your hands and start playing around with it you're
going to fall in love with the app as you can see behind I want to just show
you how what we've been working with you do not want to be here two days ago we
had food slinging everywhere we've got this amazing film crew here and this is
the way that we usually do it all most of my food shoots we actually had a
really big discussion about what the logo and look and feel of the app should
be and so one major point for us was how do we explain what meal prep Pro is how
do we also combine the elements of the fitmin cooks feeling and branding that
people tend to like to into one thing so this is what we came up with so this is
the first logo and so you put them together and the peas right here so we
ended up kind of tweaking the logo just a little bit so that way that this part
could give a little more more evidence until we came up with there yeah we had
a couple of other really good ideas well this is a container one so you guys M
the container and then that this one has a peel on there so you stack up your
meal prep in so meal prep Pro we got the fit man Chris logo plus the containers
cut it off and sit in this because of the logo of the race like number two I
like number one and I think we both thought this one maybe was a little bit
too yeah bit too masculine kind of thing and what makes yeah be the ideal app
what makes an app worth investing in yeah so first of all we were thinking of
sort of combining more the fitness aspect together with the meal plans and
we were sort of really excited and we started building that and we were like
oh people are going to love this people are gonna love this and then we realized
that we hadn't actually asked anybody I'm actually asked the filmmakers
audience whether this is what they wanted 80% said like we really just want
like a meal prep app and 20% set of workout app combined with meals so we
were really sort of going in the wrong direction until we spoke to the sitting
then click audience and yeah the the sort of
talking to the audience has made the full difference since the reason we've
introduced all of these features over the past two years so yeah the feedback
we get off people is just incredible and it completely informs everything that we
do I think that maybe we got the idea because a lot of people in comments
they'll say show your workouts and do something like this and oftentimes I
find that it's the really vocal minority that can really shape your perspective
of things that's pretty big so I want to now talk a little bit about the
methodology around building out some of the recipes because what we wanted to do
is make sure that we had the fit men cook apps that she's been doing
tremendously well I think that if all goes well we could maybe hit a million
downloads combined with our iPhone app plus the Android app because Android is
still doing very well all right yeah yeah the Android apps
done great at I'd like hundreds of thousands of downloads already and all
like hundred five-star reviews and stuff but all the my participants would have
like just keep adding stuff right that's yeah one of course what about people
that have the Windows Phone good okay we can say that I think one of the main
things though is that we wanted to make sure that it doesn't really compete with
what we already have with the fit men cook apps so how are the recipe is going
to be a little bit different so we got this wonderful recipe writer owner she's
from the UK I know that you do these amazing recipes because you're a great
chef how do you take like five star restaurant style meals and then make
them real probable well it's like as you said it's actually really tricky because
you start off with his recipe and by nature I just got really excited by my
god right listen I chose it right and then next thing you know right I think
we need to strip this back and right it's really like taking over ideas and
just like funneling them down into what do people actually have at home in their
kitchen and what do they what's just really convenient for them to like know
every using of that once it's your everything in one pan and
the opening window they want to be in and out of the kitchen reading playfully
so the 30 minute and then like matching it up with the macros as well as been a
huge oh my goodness so so let me tell you all this this recipe app this is not
just your typical recipe app every single recipe right now is in the app is
is going with a 40 30 30 breakdown so 40% protein 34 sick grams of 30% carbs
and 30% fat so what were some of the challenges as we're going through so
because I remember going back and forth we're like well we can't add in the
almonds if we got to have the olive oil like if you take one of the earlier you
I like to sprinkle everything on that like oh yeah we can obsess amici's and
sprinkle on there and you look for no we can't do that because you can't add them
as gardez because then we have to actually put in a recipe so one of my
favorite ones it's not up here and I think we took it out was the babo D so
this one kills me because I perfect like I said it's a kind of a Curry's grand
beast and with some raisins and almonds I guess it's a gorgeous dish is that
like you know turmeric babies like some beautiful citations and a cantar berry
and then you thought there's like egg and mittens it's like transcript press
on top so it almost looks like it's cheese but it's like high protein like
really good pretty good value food and then then you kind of look at the list
at the end you're going to see distillation we got 15 ingredients we're
gonna spend time in the kitchen doing yeah what was your favorite one that we
did exactly and it's one that came out of our over and back after the first
evening and are you talking about yeah the five ingredient 5 ingredient turkey
meatballs just is it so simple so easy to make and this is why it's so
important I like collaborate she was really good in like bringing in a lot of
the different type flavors and we just had leftover meatballs and we were
thinking I mean like that so for turkey meat seller signal let's just make some
meatballs you know me I'm kind of you know just simple and we're like well
let's maybe you some of the green curry paste what I tell you guys this is one
of the most difficult dishes that you'll ever make it was one of my favorite
thing and it was only five ingredients and literally came from us like going
back and forth above a different fifty-four an hour and we said we just
do these and then when we're filming we you know we actually saw the ingredients
were like this is five ingredients is that we're all women so we're all
winning and you're going to win to make this dish alright guys so wrapping up
here I want to just talk about three things that I'm really excited about
with this brand-new app first thing is that you can actually tweak your macros
inside of it and this one you don't have to stick to the forty thirty thirty
break down the second thing that I really love is the way that we present
the the recipes now one thing that we heard a lot was just that wouldn't if
you're watching the videos on YouTube and you're watching them inside the app
you've got a quick you've got to keep pausing it that's not a really good
process flow whenever you're looking at recipes so in this one we actually take
a full video and we're splicing it up so you get to swipe through the recipe so
with step one there is a little bit of a snippet of a video there and you're
going to swipe left and it's just a much more natural intuitive way to think
about cooking you don't have to wait through my long intros anymore because I
hear you come about my long intro and lastly cooking with your pork is there
an app out there that actually allows you to cook the same food split in
different portions and divvy it out this app actually does that this is why it's
been such a huge undertaking while we're so proud of it
thank you all for continuing to support this journey this app is just another
great milestone that we get to share together I want you all to go right now
into blood the Apple Store and download the app because this app is free tonight
is now to set up everything and get going be you have a free seven-day
subscription just like Netflix without the chilling part though but it's free
for seven days and after that you're going to be required to upgrade and I
know for the people out there will really struggle with no prepping and we
really want to achieve their wellness goals and get their entire family it's
their partner into eating much better I know you will love the address
only worse please monthly investment I want you off but tell me below what just
think in the comment section on today come say bye to everybody all right when
I say apply in your cheeky way yeah thanks very much Scott thanks very much
guys I'm going to say by the bridge way now thank you bye everyone
until next time keep it healthy but of course never ever boring
ooh bye guys 
what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen now you are going to love today's video because it's
all about a concept I like to call tasty peel delicious food that powers our
fitness goals and I got the idea because I recently returned from a trip to
Salzburg Austria and I was there with red bull meeting with several other
athletes competing in the ex outs which literally is the world's toughest
adventure race it's roughly a 12 day race over seven countries 1200
kilometres these athletes they are running they're hiking they're
paragliding they're pushing their bodies to the absolute max so supplies to say
they are burning and insane amount of calories per day and I met with two of
the athletes and they talked about being on a fat adaptive diet and at the risk
of oversimplifying it's based on the premise and the proven studies that fat
is a better source of longer-term energy for aerobic exercise with carbohydrates
the energy that it provides tends to be used that much faster and you end up
hitting a wall or feeling fatigued perhaps you have felt that before so
having a fad adaptive diet a diet that is much more higher in fat would make a
lot of sense for endurance athletes or people that have going to workout if
this sounds a lot like keto it is pretty similar even with that adaptive diet you
can still add in some carbohydrates either before or after the competition
or after training session because you do want to give your muscles some energy to
be able to work with so it is very similar to keto except for the strategic
addition of carbohydrates either before or after the competition or the training
session now bringing this full circle there are some applications for the
everyday person perhaps you are one of the hundreds of people who have emailed
me to say that you cannot eat several times a day that your job or your work
environment is not conducive for that and that you need a meal or foods that
you can eat that will provide lasting energy over a longer period of time
until you can get to your next meal or perhaps you're that person out there
that is trying to gain weight and you have got to increase your caloric intake
but you want to do that but also still maintain a fairly lean
a fat adaptive that could be a viable option for you and it is largely
individual based because it is based on performance and how you feel and the
progress towards your goals so today I want to share with you all a high energy
a high fat meal we are making my enduring tax there are few meals out
there that are as versatile as breakfast hash because you can easily tweak the
quantity of the ingredients in order to scale the recipe so whether you're
eating for endurance for weight loss or weight gain my easy breakfast hash can
meet your needs this meals can literally go from 800
plus calories for the endurance athlete scaled all the way down to about 400
calories per serving for the average Joe and Jane now I'm going to walk you
through today's recipe I'm going to discuss each ingredient and why we're
using it so that way you can get a better feel of how you can tweak this
recipe to meet your specific need now if you are ready to roll up your sleeve and
make them tasty fuel then let's get started
first we're going to prep the bedroom we're going to start by chopping up a
red bell pepper since we're not adding any seasonings and herbs bell pepper has
a lot of flavor plus it's rich in potassium which helps
muscle function and regulating blood pressure
next chop-busting law zucchini zucchini is a good source of vitamin C which
helps build immunity since intense exercise and training tends to wear on
the body chop the ends up butternut squash and slice into ring then cut off
the outer layer of the skin and chop it into small chunks I'm adding butternut
squash as a hearty and filling low-carb alternative to potato enough to provide
muscle energy while still remaining a fat focus meal lastly we're chopping up
one chicken sausage which will provide protein flavor and some fat Nick's at
avocado or olive oil to a cast-iron skillet toss in the butternut squash
cook it until it for about eight minutes into the outside of it turns brown and
begins to soften then toss in zucchini and cook for about two minutes before
tossing in the red bell pepper and chicken sausage
cook everything together for five minutes didn't make two holes in the
skillet for eggs which will add protein and boost of fat content crack in the
egg and allow it to cook until the clear part has turned white lastly add a ripe
avocado to boost the fat content and to make the dish creamy and easier to eat
when mixed together garnish with cilantro sea salt and pepper as you can
see you can easily tweak the amount of each ingredient to complement your need
so this is a very easy meal guys that you can whip up in 15 to 20 minutes each
morning if you carve out the time for a filling once told me you would either
find the time to do it or you will find and excuse what the choice is always
yours the ratio breakdown for this meal is about 60% fat 20% protein in 20%
carbohydrates which is a common ratio breakdown or a high fat meal thanks dad
for watching today's video if you like recipe videos like these
with the walkthrough and recipes that you can easily scale then I want you to
smash that like button and also let me know below in the comment section lastly
I want to leave you with this thought a lot of us are into accounting our
calories and being really scientific about it just remember that not all fats
and calories are created equal eating a pint of your favorite ice cream
it may have similar calories with that will necessarily translate into
performance and endurance so remember to fuel your body with real food and
nutritious food reading alright y'all I want to thank y'all for watching until
next time keep it healthy but of course never ever bored Oh bye 
what up y'all and welcome back to the
fit men cook kitchen today's quickie recipe we are taking chicken and rice to
the next level by making a Moroccan inspired chicken and rice dish the thing
that I love about Moroccan food is the combination of sweet and savory it's not
uncommon to have a slow-cooked lamb just bathing in its own savory broth but
you've also gotten apricot you've got almonds you even have honey and so it's
a combination of all these different flavors that just bring the dish to life
with every single bite and that's what we're going to replicate today apologies
to all my Moroccan peeps out there yo I got mad love and respect for the culture
and the recipes but we're going to streamline the recipe today and make it
much more practical and accessible to everyone around the world by using some
very common spices and seasonings that hopefully you all have right now in your
pantry we're going to combine the nutty flavors of cumin
with the pungent peppery flavors of paprika
that sounds good and then we're going to offset all that with the sweet and
spiciness of allspice oh and that I mentioned about there with
some chickpeas too yeah buddy let's get started spray a skillet with
olive oil then add chunks of chicken breast let's cook until the outside is no
longer pink about six to eight minutes set the chicken aside and put the
skillet back on the heat add olive oil and dice right on you we're going to
cook the red onion for about three minutes then add basmati rice chickpeas
cumin paprika allspice and cayenne bloom everything together ensuring that the
rice and the chickpeas are covered in oil and seasoning pour in the chicken
stock and bring it to a boil we're going to toss in raisins to offset the
spiciness and then add the cooked chicken breast if desired sprinkle in
some cinnamon or add cinnamon sticks cover and cook for 18 to 20 minutes
until the rice has completely cooked season to taste with pea salt and pepper
and garnished with fresh parsley boom remember to check out fit men cook dot com to

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen man I guess it's been about two or three weeks but
if you have been following me in social media then you know that I have been
basically tucked away here in my condo finishing up my book and about two weeks
ago last Friday I was able to turn in the actual manuscript for the book so
yes the recipe list is finally complete the chapters are somewhat complete we're
still editing that right now but the bulk of it in the meat of the book has
finally been turned in and then for the past two weeks I've been here in Dallas
filming the actual cookbook and I can't wait to make another video to kind of
just walk you all through this process shout out to all the authors out there
especially all the cookbook authors I had no idea of what it takes to actually
put a cookbook together so now that the manuscript is turned in the fun part
really begins so the editing the layout the cover shoot and other stuff so
everything is finally coming together that's this the main thing so thank
y'all for all of your support your positivity thank you for being patient
with me my youtube family because I have not had that much time to be able to
film for YouTube but I have been sharing content on Instagram and Facebook place
discharged it to my head and not my heart I think that you all will be very
pleased with the final product it's something that has not been done before
and I'm really trying to push the needle and a brand new way to show people that
healthy eating and healthy living is much more than people have come to
realize so again thank y'all so much for your continued support
now with the fall upon us I have learned through my many years of food blogging
now that the enthusiasm for healthy eating tends to hit a major decline
tends to begin a major decline beginning in October all the way through December
and there are many reasons for that people are traveling you know it is the
season of decadent food and quite often times people find themselves with less
time to do cooking so with that in mind I wanted to share three quickie easy
meals that you can make if you are a lazy AF if that means lazy and fit guys
all you have to do is put all the ingredients in some foil wrap it up and
throw it on the grill like I'm gonna do or you can toss it into your oven it's
just that simple we've got a chicken meal we've got a vegan meal with better
seafood meal but all three of these are completely customizable so that you can
complement your diet all right check it out just some chicken thighs at five
spice blend and a little pepper rub on the seasonings and set them aside to a
bowl add zucchini squash chickpeas olive oil garlic cumin and smoked paprika mix
it up and add a pinch of sea salt and pepper for the vegan meal we're gonna
add purple potatoes butternut squash bell pepper frozen edamame olive oil
garlic thyme and oregano mix it up and add a pinch of sea salt and pepper for
the pasta you can use shirataki noodles or cooked whole wheat noodles chopped
asparagus and marinara and this recipe works best with thick pasta sauce now
let's bring it all together with the chicken meal add two sheets of foil and
then the veggies and then serving the chicken thighs add a pinch of pepper
then fold it up to make it airtight then cook for 25 to 30 minutes on the grill
put the vegan meal at two sheets of foil then the ER veggies fold it up to make
it airtight then cook for 40 to 45 minutes on the grill set at 3:30 for the
pasta add two sheets of foil and then the pasta mix and a few pieces of shrimp
mix the shrimp in with the pasta then fold it up to make it airtight then cook
for 20 to 25 minutes on the grill set at 3:30 when the chicken is halfway through
cooking flip it over and place it over the heat so it Sears place the chicken
on a plate then open it up and let the steam out add some mint then season to
taste with sea salt and pepper place the vegan meal on a plate let the
steam out then add fresh thyme if desired
then sea salt and balsamic glaze place the pasta on a plate let the steam out
then gently pull the pasta apart add pepper and fresh parsley or basil check out fit men cook com2 get the full

what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen one thing I love about the fall and wintertime is
that it is soup season now growing up I telling y'all I could eat my mom's
chicken noodle soup for days on in and then don't let it be one of those
special soul food Sundays where my dad makes cornbread I will chop up the
cornbread and then pour the soup on top of it oh my god just thinking about it
just takes me back now it wasn't until college though technically that I met
the true food or the true soup love of my life and that is fuck and fuzz this
delicious savory broth with vermicelli noodles it's a big old bowl of soup and
it's got vegetables and meat tossed into it and all that to say this recipe today
is not fun but you can still be excited because it is inspired today I'm gonna
show you how to make a delicious shrimp in a neat ball soup now what I love
about this recipe is that first off you can take the shrimp meatballs I'm gonna
show you how to make and incorporate them into other dishes so if you want to
put a little bit of a seafood spin on your favorite marinara pasta dish you
can do that also it is packed with tons of vegetables so you can make this your
own just make sure that you have three colors all right y'all check it out first add chopped green onion to a food
processor and blend until finely diced then we're gonna add some peeled raw
shrimp and a little bit of garlic and then pulse blend until we have a chunky
mince now remember do not pulverize there should be visible chunks add the
shrimp mince to a bowl then mix in some cilantro
since shrimp is lean it tends to be sticky so spray your hands with some
olive oil before handling weigh out your desired meatball portion then roll it up
and place it in a mini muffin pan bake for 10 minutes at 400 set a skillet on
medium heat and add olive oil and 1 diced shallot cook for 2 to 3 minutes
until it's brown and translucent pour in low-sodium chicken broth and some water
bring it to a boil and add coconut sugar fish oil sesame oil a cinnamon stick and
if you have it some cardamom finish it off with a pinch of sea salt and pepper
reduce the heat then cover and simmer for 20 minutes while that cooks set a
griddle on medium heat and spray with olive oil add baby bok choy halves and
cook until sere now let's bring it all together add some brown rice noodles or
shirataki noodles shredded cabbage a few carrot sticks and our savory broth add
the big shrimp meatballs some grilled baby bok choy red jalapeno
for some heat fresh cilantro top it all off with fresh lime boom smash that like

what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men kitchen in an effort for us all to keep our diets
fresh this summer and to get us to consume a lot more raw veggies and fruit
I am kicking off a five-day smoothie challenge just know that each base
recipe has only four ingredients so there is no excuse for you not to
participate now I've done these challenges before on Instagram and
Facebook but this is my first time actually bringing it to the YouTube
community which actually makes a whole lot of sense now that I think about it
because I can explain the challenges I can walk through them and I can also
answer frequently asked questions like this one hey kev this is a juice cleanse
this juice fasts brah oh hey I can barely make it a five-hour flight across
the country let alone of four weeks of just drinking some juice so no this is
not that at all this is one smoothie each day for five days a total of five
different smoothies now if you're one of those persons out there and you're
already enjoying smoothies and juices every single day then you are ahead of
the curve but I still invite you to take this challenge because you may learn
something new and also you can inspire somebody else now here's how this
challenge works each day on social media on Instagram or Facebook I'm going to
post a new smoothie recipe you're going to take that recipe you're going to
create it you're going to take a picture of it you're going to post it and you're
going to tag it hash tag SMC smoothie and then say what you liked about it or
say what you're going to change about it for the future you have no idea that
people that you will inspire by doing it okay like here's what you're going to
need to succeed this week this is our grocery list you're going to need finish
kale lettuce beets carrots bananas oranges apples protein powder cottage
cheese almond milk Greek yogurt avocado frozen strawberries pineapple frozen
blueberries oatmeal dates or agave turmeric ginger matcha green tea powder
raw cashews and cinnamon remember that you can get this entire grocery
this from fit Minkus calm so even though I'm listing in that right here on fit
men cook calm you can get the exact quantity so you're not buying the entire
produce section when it comes to buying frozen fruit versus fresh fruit
I actually prefer to buy the frozen fruit because it doesn't emit the need
to Elm to add ice to your smoothies Plus fruits like avocado and banana when they
are blooming from a frozen state they tend to have an ice cream like texture
so they make your smoothies that much colder and also creamier to reiterate
each base smoothie recipe has only four ingredients with optional add-ons to
help to boost the flavor or to boost the nutrient content something like a
protein powder in order to boost the protein content these are single serving
recipes and it makes about 16 ounces on average but keep in mind that some of
the ingredients tend to be a lot more voluminous when they have women together
so you can enjoy those over two servings and you should feel free to enjoy these
smoothies as snacks as we're in between meals or even post-workout treat but I
reiterate this is not a juice cleanse reduce fat you should be eating actually
doing this challenge finally the most important thing that you will need for
this challenge is a quality blender one common complaint that I get from people
when about making smoothies is that they can never get it blended well enough
they've got chunks of individual ingredients included you could have a
sliver blender that can barely chop up celery my mom taught me a long time ago
that while cheap is expedient and efficient it can also be very expensive
and you'll end up paying more in the long run I'll be using the Vitamix is
sent to 3500 I've used tons of Vitamix products here on my page which you've
probably seen and I really enjoy the brand they have top-notch quality
service it's pretty much hassle free which is important because this is an
investment into your health and you want something that's going to last you
throughout your wellness journey so if you are ready to roll up your sleeves
and get your later people start doing advanced and it's pretty dated it's
pretty dated right I'm gonna do a good dad yeah okay
you see you are ready to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty guys
then let's get started first up is a golden yellow smoothie
it's very creamy because we al auto and pretty yellow because of the
turmeric and the carrot but in the end it turns out to be a surprisingly cool
yet spicy smoothie check it out add about six ounces of water then one large
carrot half an avocado one small red apple and a half medium peeled cucumber
then an optional one inch piece of ginger and a one-inch piece of turmeric
top it off with ice then pop the top gradually increase the speed until it's
at the max then blend until smooth next we've got an off pink smoothie
lettuce in a smoothie absolutely you see lettuce provides a
lot of moisture doesn't have a very strong flavor and it's pretty easy to
blend check it out first we're going to add one cup of almond milk 1/2 cup of
chopped lettuce one banana and five frozen strawberries then boost the
protein with an optional scoop of unflavored or vanilla whey protein
powder gradually increase the speed until it's at the max send blend until
smooth next we got a hipster green smoothie it doesn't get any more basic
than adding spinach to a smoothie so we're going to jazz it up by adding in
some cottage cheese to boost the casein protein which is going to feed your body
and your muscles throughout the day check it out
add one cup of 2% cottage cheese 2 cups of raw spinach one banana and a half cup
of fresh pineapple add an optional teaspoon of matcha green tea powder top
it off with ice then pop the top then blend until smooth next we got a very
red smoothie now I've come to appreciate beats and recipes besides the
nutritional value of them I also like the fact that they provide a lot of
sweetness which basically eliminates the need to add in processed sugar and for
those out there who don't like kale because it has two hearts of the flavor
pairing it with the beets and the citrus helps to mask that flavor but to also
get the nutritional benefits of the kale check it out add about 8 ounces of water
2 cups of shredded kale one mandarin orange one beat and 1/2 a cup of frozen
blueberries then add an optional 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon top it off with ice and
blend until smooth lastly we got a sweet and salty smoothie
this is my favorite smoothie for this entire theory it's a delicious new
replacement smoothie for breakfast for lunch and in between meal or even a
post-workout Cashion's have a very light and sweet flavor and when they're
blended together they tend to be much creamier than most nuts
especially when they're soaked now I recommend adding in the option on one
date here because it's going to help to boost the flavor of it but you've never
experimented with base before and recipes then try it out just one time
one date goes a long way it's a very energizing ingredient especially for
those who train really hard or work in hard conditions check it out add one cup
of 2% Greek yogurt one banana 1/3 cup of raw cashews and two tablespoons of raw
oatmeal then select either one date or half a tablespoon of agave add ice you
can pop the top and blend until smooth add some coarse sea salt to the rim of a
blast then pour in the drink enjoy and thank me later that is it for today's

well some awesome that is really good and that makes me really happy you know I was super nervous I think I was more nervous about this launch than the actual pit main cook one before him because it's just you just never really know and now because social media has changed so much the way that we engage on social has changed even even myself I don't really go and engage pages and pages a lot but I will just read and consume the content so I just had no idea if we're gonna look at for naught I loved it when I had it in my hand so I knew that people once they downloaded it they would actually like it but I just had to get to that first step first but um yeah y'all had an amazing response to it so thank you all very much yeah a lot of nice pause there I can stare and you can read them yeah some very nice positive comments here from people so I yeah that's what I see okay awesome I can't see the comments but under so I'm gonna ask you to read some of those and coffee black by name if I could see your comments right now then I would say something to you but I appreciate the love we're gonna go ahead and get started right now so what we wanted to do was just have a quick hang out with you all to answer your questions about meal prep the new app and everything in between relating to cooking food in both because we realize that it's a it's a trending topic that we've been talking about for years as you can following the channel but right now it's a really relevant topic the first thing that I want to start out with though I wanted to get the app questions out of the way so we can kind of get into some of the meat meat you bones if there are tons of questions out there about it but as I'm talking if you have a question just go ahead and write it down or put it into the chat window and then Andres will feed them to me also if you have questions about the app go ahead and jot those down too because he's gonna be addressing some of those the first topic that I wanted to talk about is the Android I hope my Android users are out there if you've got an Android shout out something there like in the comment section but I want to say first off to the Android community thank you all for for your support of the fitnah community as we you know dive into app development so I got a lot of questions about when is the app going to come to Android when it's metal prep for that and the reality is guys this is strictly a numbers games and it's got to be financially viable for us to be able to I said a couple months ago whenever we launched the Android app on with with the regular ethicacy app it did very very well and I said to preface that is that a lot of people within the industry said don't build an app for Android because you won't see the return I'm not going to name the brand buy main but a really big brand a huge chef brand said don't do it you won't see the return we did it anyway because it's really important to us that everyone around the world can experience the awesomeness of the fit min could app because on base can build a really awesome app but here's the reality we are now what is that like five months in that we launched in March so what is that March well you guys I had trouble counting that I swear dude hey hey June July so about four to five months in already and hundreds of thousands of downloads we haven't been broken even in stark contrast to the iPhone app which you know we were able to break even very quickly the thing about app development is that you know the money that the app kits that we get from the app and the revenue from it that a significant portion goes back into development because we got tons of requests from around the world so we're really trying to quickly implement those in fact when we lost on Android we had a really positive response from an analyst team from from Google Play and the analyst said you know what we should feature this app and they passed it on to get featured and the people that were going to feature they had they came back to us within one day and said hey you know what could you make a couple changes to it we don't like this we don't like that blah blah blah we said to the app let's go ahead and do it and we did those chains a couple thousand dollars by the way not complaining and then we sent it back to them at the changes and they said well you know what just think there's too much white space here you change this around blah blah blah and it was just this crazy thing because we had already had five star reviews and now tens of thousands of downloads and so we weren't featured on them because we're like hey we run back away from this because it sounds like you are designing our app more so in doing it in such a way that really doesn't line up with the positive feedback reality is a lot of people are downloading the Android app free but they're not downloading the premium version and when you download the premium version that money goes back into development so we can continue to make improvements we're always going to push the push new recipes but we want to add new features so people in Android if you have the Android app and get the free version consider upgrading to the premium version and we can use that data to inform how well this new mill prep Pro app will perform on Android once we move there because we would love to but again it's just gotta make financial sense and right now the numbers are against us for months and hundreds of thousands of downloads and we haven't broken even yet under this is that pretty accurate err yeah I mean I'd love nothing more for them for us to be able to take on a full-time Android developer to just start building all these features that have come to the to the iPhone app but unless you know unless people are prepared to upgrade then there's just no way to do that you know we've not even made back the money from the first version so it's very difficult to say okay you know what let's spend like an extra ten twenty thirty thousand dollars or whatever the cost will be to kind of build all of these extra features but you know when we haven't yet seen that kind of movement but at the same time you know it's amazing to have the Android app out there and it you know it's really really great to see like all those amazing reviews of the Android version as well if people are really excited and like we you know yeah we've been waiting to bring it to Android for so long selves as well like this is a huge moment to kind of publish the Android version and pretty much with no hiccups at all I don't think like we've had you know I I don't think I've seen any comments like oh this is crashing or anything like that so I think people are really really really happy with the Android edition which is amazing yeah yeah yeah so people on Android consider upgrading to help us out with the development costs and and we can use that data to inform how quickly we can do something with the milk Pro app to get it onto the Android platform because it is a priority but again the data have to make sense so really appreciate you understanding that and there's a couple of nice people I'm sorry this is nice people here jumping in the comments talking about yeah like not having understood the complexities previously kind of thing and talking about maybe us doing like a Kickstarter or something like that so that's really nice to hear from people that they kind of understand what we're what we're kind of getting at here I know that sometimes maybe some of the big companies make it look like oh yeah we're just kind of you know an app it's quick our fingers and it will magically appear and there's a couple of nice people here posting comments that they've just upgraded so which usually we appreciate thank you that's I'm talking about the immediate pepper feedback thank you it actually means a whole lot when we do stuff like that so all right with that I actually want to move on with the conversation that's pretty tent that's pretty related and that's what the meal prep Pro app launch did amazingly will very very well it's surpassed probably about three times the amount of momentum from the from the first launch right on iPhone if you look at the total number of people that actually engaged in downloads the app which is great so thank you all for doing that I think I'm so proud of this app that's very sexy app first off it looks and feels good in your hand and so on today and his team did an amazing job it was one year in the making I hope that you all spent some time looking at the documentary that we posted and also reading the blog on the website because it kind of goes into the background of what we had to do for this new app the reason why it looks the way it is the fuels away it is because it genuinely did come from you all you all save this ethnic from by by by giving us quality feedback so spend some time and look at that I want Andres so even though the app was great it was fantastic we had a couple of hiccups and these were all positive things like I people were messages and that was because we had reached the capacity of the number of users that we could add in a given period and so we were looking at capacity issues no store additions and other things like that so these are really good things that have have you know I don't want Andres to kind of walk through we have already submitted an update that you know the error messages that you are perceiving that very soon from the App Store but I guess if you want to walk through some things that we're doing for version 1.01 yeah definitely so we really you know we've really pushed it right up to the deadline we were sort of you know finishing off all of these features and you know it was a real it was really quite a mad to three months in the run-up to the launch so we didn't have quite as much time as we would have loved to have had to kind of got it in front of some more people and kind of spotted some of these things but as soon as some of these queries have been coming back and we've been trying to answer them within you know a couple of hours to make sure that everybody knows we're listening and yeah we've sort of version one point not one is currently waiting for Apple to approve it so as soon as they approve it you'll see some of the most kind of crucial things that a couple of people identified we've already solved those so we've already kind of ticked those off and you know there's a few things for the Spanish users a couple of things for people that were noticing some odd kind of ingredients and things like that so all of those kind of things we've solved we had a really interesting problem list they were trying to selves with some people when they first signed up they beginning some odd error messages and we're kind of messaging the Google support team because that shouldn't be happening so we're really sort of as fast as possible trying to get these new versions out for everybody because obviously the sooner we can get through these kind of key issues the sooner we can start focusing on some of the bigger things that people have been telling us about absolutely can you talk a little bit about one thing that I really want to stress was the the meals in how and how we're gonna be mixing it up because I think there was a little bit of confusion that probably could have gone into more depth on the video and how the in cook app differs a little bit from the difference from from milk back pro but basically the concern is are there gonna be new recipes attitude is that and the answer is yes but I went on the frequency a bit yeah definitely so if myself and Kevin we've been talking about this a fair bit and we definitely want to have like we want to set a set a date in the calendar and say you know what like at the start of every month or on the first meal prep Sunday of every month you will see new recipes in your prep Pro so we're just sort of figuring out exactly how to do that right now and we definitely want to sort of have a constant stream of new recipes and what we've heard from people is that they really want a lot of extra breakfast to choose from and a lot of extra snacks to choose from so those are two areas that we're really going to focus on and really sort of expand on you know you've got to remember that two years ago the fit Maine cook app launched with a hundred recipes and it now has over 300 recipes so we're sort of expecting a similar thing with meal prep Pro where you know every month at the same date will just add a whole bunch of new recipes of people will make sure that those are kind of very clear inside the app so that you can always see oh cool these are the new ones for me to add to my plan and to try out kind of thing right right and and the thing just just really quickly the Alexa T of the meal prep Pro is a little bit more so than fit main cook which is by design so fit me and cook you I literally just me like in the kitchen I'm experimenting my tossing stuff out there that I think could be good in summer those recipes may end up bro the meal prep Provost these are designed from a macronutrient standpoint so as we design the recipes we are looking at the macronutrient breakdown so that way they can complement the meal plan so this will in this next easier for us first off to be able to to be able to build well to able to like allow you all to build your own meal plans but it does it it's just not as easy dishes just to grab that you grabbing like a recipe from you know from me and then putting into the app so we're actually being very thoughtful about the way that the recipes are actually added in there and just so you know to just two quick caveat just so you know what it goes on behind the scenes or let's say that we have to first calculate all the stuff we're gonna get them certified by a nutritionist to make sure that they are okay from a macronutrient breakdown standpoint make sure that the numbers and the data makes sense when you look at the overall meal plan some of the micronutrients after that we've got a filament and then we also have a translator and they have to translate this to Spanish and then once all that stuff is collected then we have to take that and then submit that to Apple there's the Apple review too so it's not just as simple as just pushing out recipes whenever we want to those things I have to build the Apple to make sure that there's quality yes so we're we're sort of going through that process right now so we're sort of investigating that right now for for keto so right now we're sort of in the early stages of doing all the research making sure that you know if we do add keto that we've got the right sort of tips in there about the diet and things like that so we don't really want to just said yeah I'm vegan so yeah so you know and and so we'll go away we'll start it's finding the recipes we've got to create all the different calorie levels we've got to sort of make sure that these recipes are meal prep and pour their simple then we've got to sort of write them down film them take any pictures for any additional recipes so that's this ton of work that goes into to meal prep Pro which is why it's so different to fit and cook and you know a lot of everything that we built with with fitmin cook was the result of feedback from the fit men cook app and how people wanted us to kind of take the fit men cook app and go to the next level with meal prep so that we can really sort of make it something incredibly simple to to follow and that's what's introduced a ton of extra complexity on our end but that then makes it for the user incredibly simple to follow obviously where those are the updates from the version 1.01 yeah I think so yeah we've yeah so that should be out in the next day or two depending on when Apple just tick it off kind of thing okay and then one other thing that we are looking at guys is that is that there was some concern and this was actually it was looking back at this in hindsight and exit kind of made perfect sense but allowing people to use the app without putting in the credit card information first the people that actually trust trust the process and thrust this there were you know that it's legit thank you for doing that but there are some users who are concerned about putting in their information prior you know and then prior to being able to like use the app so we are trying to figure out the functionality around that so if there's a way that we can allow like a test trial or maybe like a generic you know I only want to speak on it because I don't want to promise something that we can't deliver but just know that we heard that concern and at the top of our list so that we're not trying to take your money and scam people you know be worried if you see me posting some pictures on Instagram in front of a Lamborghini with some shaker cups and my ass out you worry big we are hard at work behind the theme to answering your questions okay yes are there any questions that have come out and by the way when he was talking I was thinking somebody on Twitter because they had just downloaded the app so for Android so EJ pal appreciate your broker doing that and you know an upgrade about the apps about you can get me talked about so far before I go over a sort of quickfire wands Mitch Woodside here saying they've she's downloaded here all the recipes the same for everybody every week no everybody gets a sort of different plan with the app generates for you there have been a few people that have asked about they want to be able to print off the shopping list some people I don't even own a printer anymore but people want to be able to print off the shopping list that's something that will definitely add a few people asking about Kito again so we kind of covered that briefly there but it's definitely kind of really high up in our priority list so if somebody asking there about swapping some of the meals from the fit maker cap into meal prep probes we kind of covered that briefly just to say that you know a lot of the the fit men cookout meals are not suitable for meal prep Pro because they're a different macro breakdown or you know perhaps they don't take some of the other kind of quite strict boxes that we have for for meal prep Pro but if there's a specific recipe that you'd love to see come to meal prep pros well like make sure you send us a message and we'll see whether we can adapt that somehow to bring it to meal prep Pro as well but unfortunately it's not as simple as saying hey just grab this recipe and just shove it in meal prep Pro unfortunately somebody else asking that they do repeated breakfast and lunch for simplicity I think a few people want the ability David Cantor there who's been posting some very nice comments so a few people want the ability to basically you know only meal prep Monday to Friday and not prep on the weekend you know we've we've sort of seen a ton of variation here on what people want to do and we're looking to add some features in that area as well so that you could just save a plan and then just repeat it next week if you want to so if you find like you know if the the turkey bacon breakfast is your thing and you just want to eat that all the time then we're looking for a way that we can just sort of always have that in place there for you so you don't have to kind of constantly make that change so yeah ton of great questions I can keep going unless you want to keep here on the rest this is one from Twitter from Brian Seattle he said that you wanted to the app to be a little bit more flexible is there a way to plan less than a week yeah definitely so right now what you could do is you could change your Saturday and Sunday to be per market as eating out so then the app won't give you any recipes for the weekend but we're looking for sort of a more advanced way of doing that but for now that's one way to make sure that the app is only giving you content from Monday to Friday because I know a lot of people like to kind of go off on the weekend and do their own thing a few people asked about it be on iPad and it is already on iPad so if you're not seeing it on iPad then you need to be on the latest version of iOS and then you know it's definitely on iPad already okay my computer went to sleep I think if something happened I got kicked off for a second so I miss your answer but I hope that Brian from Seattle got that okay are there any other questions about the app because I wanted to go over in just a couple of things in Mill Creek because I wanted to keep it right at 30 minutes and tips and things that I got via email I want to address yeah so a few people have asking sort of about the difference about with with the fam and cook up and the milk Pro app it's a good question I think as soon as somebody tries the meal grow up they'll kind of immediately get a sense of everything that's very very different there I think the way that we're trying to keep it simple to describe to people is basically picture the fit men cook up it's like you know amazing healthy recipes and picture the meal prep Pro app as more about the meal plants and more about meal prep and then I think you'll sort of start to understand some of the difference but definitely give the give the meal prep Pro app a try and I think you're very sort of quickly see you see it is quite a significantly different app right some people are talking about want one other thing that people are talking of is this idea of ingredient substitutions and a lot of people have very specific dietary requirements some people are not eating eggs cheese lactose is a very popular one so we really really want to bring this to both the fit men cookout and to the meal prep Pro app so it's something that we want to do it the right way so we don't want to hide from somebody that's got you know a lactose intolerance a whole bunch of the recipes what we would rather do is be able to show them those recipes but modified versions of those recipes that they can sort of change change up so we're trying to do it in a really really smart way but yes or if anybody out there with a dietary requirement or preference you know I'm getting a lot of comments from gluten-free celiac and so forth those things are absolutely crucial and we can't wait to bring it to both fit men cook and to meal prep Pro and I think you guys are going to be really impressed because I don't think anybody is going to do it quite as well as what we've kind of got in mind here yeah that says it's such a great call out because we get tons of tons of questions about that and even upon my own family we've got a couple of people you know well that food allergies and so I've been really thinking about how to do that same thing on on the pitman cook calm and so those questions we are actually actively working on right now and and Andres is right if I'm dressed as that then y'all gotta know that that you know what we're gonna come up with is gonna be much better then anything ever out there hey and we've got about five or so minutes left but can I touch on a couple of y'all's question the top and you know me and Andres just shout out some because I can't see the comments right now so just shout out something that you know someone could almost say something but um the first thing is that I get questions on like doing the whole milk prep process is this safe for me to go ahead and do and I think it's actually and it's a weird question but I also think it's a very smart question meal prep is very safe for you to do the thing that I would advise even if you get the meal prep Pro app is that the meal prep Pro app is designed for you to be very successful because it it structures everything but if you've never done healthy eating before then what I suggest is this start out with like one meal or just tunas at the max maybe breakfast and your lunch and just prep that and then get your confidence up because the thing that I started look the most and what I talk to people what I hear from people the most is that you will start really strong and then you will just hit like this clip and then just drop off because you lose your momentum and so what did the thing that you have to do is you want to build incremental success of that way you keep on going up so start very small prep one or two meals at the max and do that for a month or four weeks and see how you feel and then gradually get into it more and more the second thing you know it comes to meal prep the biggest question I've been receiving is about the storage even when you make the meals inside this app or just in general you want to think about storing stuff in the fridge for one or two days anything else that you're not going to eat within those two days I will just go ahead and freeze now there are different limits for that so well not limits but there are different freshness standards for those so technically meat like chicken and on beef can last fresh in the fridge for up to five days maybe fish seafood at the two or three days but I just say you know to heck with it all and just freeze the meal so after you build your meals if you're not gonna eat it within two days just put it in the freezer and the most important thing that you have to remember to do each night if you're going to eat a meal that's frozen is to put it into the fridge because if you don't you're gonna have to end up defrosting it in the microwave at work or something and that's not ideal you're gonna overcook the food it's going to become dry and that leads back to problem number one which you saying that I hate meal prep I can't do it anymore now defrost in the fridge and then reheat your food that way and that and that will lock in the most amount of freshness now this is not related to - no prep Pro app but what it also say is this if you have trouble they into the mode of cooking like individual meals what I like to do because since I'm cooking all the time I don't like to go for like big things like casseroles and other stuff like that that that's probably ideal for milk reps so what I'll do is I'll prep a big thing of like brown rice and quinoa and mix it up together I'll put in some like onions and cilantro with that all right and then I'll prep just some chicken breast and chop it up then I'll prep some beef or some fish and I'll have these little individually prepped items so that way each day I can build whatever meal I want I'll have some frozen veggies in the fridge and I can and one day I'll have broccoli the next day I had some sunlight green beans but that will allow you to kind of mix and match a lot more and there's nothing wrong with condiments so long as you don't have a lot more condiment than you do the actual meal but that will allow you to have a lot of variety and to trick your taste buds into thinking that you're eating something different each day so you can make just a bland thing of just like brown rice but one day you're gonna chop up some cucumber and some and some celery and some cilantro and put some feta cheese in there maybe two and some like you know let me it sounds good then it sounds really good right it's peace out and then that's on those two days we'll head out to the rice take that rice and you may put some cranberries in there or some almonds or something else and so you can keep on designing and changing up your diet each day without having to do this entire meal prep that forces you to eat just this casserole and just this so you can check out the you know sit and cook app which is both on the iPhone and Android and you can get some individual meal meal prep items for those things we all question sorry okay yeah good yeah we had a question there from Erica asking about are the ingredients for you and your partner added to the ingredients list or should I double it so the the new meal prep Pro app will actually work for two people so in your ingredients list you'll be seeing the amount they're listed for two people so if you've chosen to add a partner and while we're on the sort of topic of partners think we really want to do is we really want to feature you know couples that are using the new meal prep Pro and I getting fit together because we think that this is like a really sort of great unique thing and a really great way for for people to reach their their fitness goals is to work together so you know send any stories or any pictures like that in and we'd love to and and what we're gonna do is is we actually we quietly launched the new Pitman cook comm we're still making changes to it but I haven't announced it because I don't want the site to crash or anything like that just because we've got we're still working some things out with it but we're gonna begin to curate a lot of those stories that you all send us in your pictures and we want to put up a page where it's like cooking with Bay getting healthy with Bay and have your pictures and your stories about cooking stuff together with your partner there as well as share those out on social media I don't think we we've we've set an actual hashtag yet have we we need to set a hashtag so that way we can find the stories but right now this just hashtag fit men cook but we're gonna update that very soon but if you're cooking with your partner I want you take a photo together and in write us your story or just the photo in general so we can share that stuff out because you have no idea how motivating it is to see people like you doing it's like real people getting these real results it's so motivating for people around the world and my last thing is is this actually that's a great segue is when you're talking about cooking with your partner I get a lot of emails from from women or the come up to me and talk to me about trying to get their husband or their partner into cooking healthy with them and one thing that I find that women like to do is they like to say all right well let's clip together and they'll give them in like the salad or a side dish and I know I don't want to be like patriarchy or you know like macho but I find that I just think inside of every man regardless is that like we have like this intense desire to cook because in the past were hunters and gatherers for the family so give give the mail if you're trying to encourage him to cook healthy with you include him in that process so don't just relegate you-know-what and women to don't don't don't relegate their partner that you're trying to to get into help cooking into a very small portion of it don't give them the garden salad give them you know the lasagna with you and so they make one part of it and you make the other part but you're actually significantly doing it together there is a sense of accomplishment that that that comes along with it whenever you whenever you cook something that actually it's gonna add value to the diet so do that for that person definitely in this somebody is saying that they've they're about to close 26 years together so congratulating yo Yolanda Yolanda congratulations 26 years did that is amazing especially in the Facebook world where you can update your status at the drop of a little click so congrats those are goals right there yeah so yeah so really really thrilled that people are loving the cooking

this particular recipe is that whenever you're making the cauliflower rice you
want to squeeze out all that moisture because you want your feelings to be as
creamy as possible this recipe is super easy it's just like magic

what is going on guys and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen today's quickie recipe is a personal favorite
and it is a soul food favorite as well we are making up a delicious cajun low-carb
goodie right dish now existing flavor from two things I
believe the first one is Creole season Creole seasoning is a very spicy salty
type of rub made up of paprika and cayenne and oregano and other herbs now
I recognize that some of y'all are not able to walk into your local grocery
store and pick up Creole seasonings so we're going to try to recreate that
seasoning today for this recipe and the second way that it's distinct flavor is
from the meat now it's not uncommon to find variations with sausage with ground
meat but the most common factor in goodie rice has to be the chopped liver
if you've had liver by itself it has a very harsh flavor very gamy taste but
when you cook it with the dirty right and you chop it up and it's mixed in
with the broth and the Creole seasoning it really comes together and brings this
kiss to life so what we are going to be using is
ground beef to make the recipe low carb and a little bit more keto friendly
we're going to be swapping out these white rice and using cauliflower rice
since 30 rice is very spicy and very savory we're going to pair it with
carrots because carrots are naturally sweet but of course you are going to
boost the flavor just a little bit by adding a little bit of cinnamon and
sugar free maple syrup all right we're going to get the hands dirty
I hope so let's get started first slice colorful characters down the middle and
place them in a bowl add avocado oil sugar free maple syrup cinnamon sea salt
and pepper and thyme mix them up then place them on a baking sheet with
parchment paper or foil roast for 10 to 12 minutes at 450 then add the remaining
syrup and a pinch of sea salt and pepper set them aside to cool spray a pot with
olive oil then add garlic and meat shop and cook the meat until it's almost no
longer pink about five minutes then add bell pepper celery and red onions
stir it up then toss an onion powder thyme oregano paprika and cayenne mixed
in the seasonings then add Worcestershire and beef or veggie stock
bring to a light simmer and add a pinch of sea salt and pepper then add bay
leaves and sage cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes on low heat now while that's
cooking add cauliflower florets to a food processor then pulse blend to
create right add the rice to the meat mixture and fold everything together if
needed add a bit more stock than cover and cook for about 10 minutes boom smash that like button then head

what's up guys and welcome back to the
fit men cook kitchen today's recipe is a meal prep recipe but it is also a
comfort food makeover and a nod to the fall we are making a delicious chicken
tetrazzini be me okay I wasn't gonna say anything but now I have to because
I'm laughing in this show this goes to show you all how much like maybe he's
trash TV that I watched so do you remember a few years ago on the Maury
Povich Show which is a show here in the u.s. it's a talk show there was a lady
who was complaining that her best friend was stealing her husband or her
boyfriend and she was luring him in with her homemade chicken Tetrazzini recipe
do you remember that you think over with chicken I don't know what she do with
the chicken Tetrazzini but I love it Dominika cook but I know she seducing my
man with a chicken Tetrazzini you gotta do internet search and find the entire
clip because it's pretty funny but the tick away is this if you're ever having
trouble trying to wifey someone or trying to hook someone then just make
them chicken Tetrazzini because it worked for her and probably work for you
too this recipe is low-carb we're gonna be
swapping out the noodles and replacing it with spaghetti squash which is a nod
to the fall we're also gonna be taking out the milk and the flour that's used
to make the creamy base and we're placing that with coconut cream it's
gonna be very delicious you're going to love it and I can't wait to see how you
are going to tweak it for your diet check it out oh yeah if you're not
already guys I want to invite you all to follow me on Facebook and Instagram at
fit man cook I'm sharing daily meals and other healthy living content that I
don't get to share here on YouTube plus I want y'all to be a part of my official
countdown to my cookbook all right guys check it out first we're gonna cut a
spaghetti squash into range doing it this way creates longer noodles
remove the inside and place them on a baking sheet spray the pieces with olive
oil then sprinkle sea salt and pepper bake for 45 minutes at
when they're done we're gonna set a bowl on a food scale and add the spaghetti
gently push it out and pull it apart now you can more easily calculate your
macros for the recipe next buy our rotisserie chicken from
your local grocery store then remove the skin from the meat weigh the chicken
then pull it apart with forks to a nonstick skillet we're gonna add olive
oil garlic and chopped leeks cook for three minutes until they're soft then
add rosemary and thyme squeeze in a little lemon and pour in some chicken
broth then add the coconut cream and season to taste with sea salt and pepper next we're going to fold in the chicken
and remove the skillet from the heat add the spaghetti then gently fold
everything together and allow it to cool and thicken garnish with parsley next
select your bakeware you can use a small foil tin a baking dish or Hamitic jars
if you use the jars be sure to get a size that corresponds with your serving
size these range from 7 ounces all the way up to 21 ounces I like these because
you can easily remove the metal rings and reheat in the microwave spoon out
your portion in the jar and top with Parmesan and panko or wheat
bread crumbs bake for 25 minutes at 400 boom fist bump that like button then

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fitment code kitchen and welcome to the fall or maybe we're in that
transition month but whatever fall we'll be here very soon now fall was one of my
favorite times of year and if you spit any summer in Texas and you would
understand why as a Texan we are ready to get rid of this intense heat but also
because of the food one of my favorite fall foods is squash
now while I like to eat squash plain and raw you know I may spiralize it or put
it into a salad or something I enjoy it most when it is mixed into a recipe now
one of my favorite types of squash because there are many out there is
butternut because it's versatility it can be used in very sweet dishes for
desserts or even some savory dishes in fact last year one of my favorite uses
of butternut squash was to make a big bowl of chili con queso people had no
idea that they were eating the cheese and over half the cheese was actually
better nut squash so it's a pretty dope recipe if you missed it go to fitmin
cook calm and just type in the big bowl queso and you should find it so today
I'm going to show you just that ingenuity by making a delicious creamy
butternut chicken and rice dish now I am technically not in my full bulking mode
just yet so I'm gonna be using cauliflower rice but you could feel free
to use whichever rice fits your diet right now and your goals we're gonna
pair that dish with roasted Brussels sprouts with a hint of maple it is
essentially all of the flavors that make you think of the fall check it out first
we're gonna slice in Brussels sprouts in half this is a personal preference
because I do not like big chunks of Brussels sprouts but this also helps you
to better ration out the portions coat them with olive oil balsamic vinegar and
maple syrup or agave gently fold them in the sauce then line a baking sheet with
parchment and spread out the Brussels sprouts
roast in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the edges are brown and crispy
allow them to slightly cool and get sticky from the maple next we're going to chop the top and
bottom off a butternut squash then cut the remainder into pieces stop off the
skin then cut it into chunks bring some water to a boil and add a steamer basket
add the chunks of butternut squash and cover and steam for roughly 15 minutes
or until the squash can be easily pierced with a fork allow the chunks to
cool then add them to a food processor pour in veggie stock rosemary and sage
bolts blend until smooth adding tablespoons of veggie stock if
needed spray a nonstick skillet with olive oil heat set it on medium heat
toss in the raw chicken breast pieces and cook for about 10 minutes ensuring
it is fully cooked and brown on the outer edges set it aside and using the
same skillet at olive oil garlic bread onion and red bell pepper carmelize for
3 to 5 minutes before adding in cinnamon this brings the flavors together to fill
a lot more like fall next add in the butternut squash puree and coconut milk
stir it up then add a pinch of sea salt and pepper to make this extra creamy I
like to add goat cheese because it's a viable substitute for cream cheese or
even heavy cream stir in the cooked chicken breast and then some frozen peas boom now build your meals I'll be using
lightly steamed cauliflower pearls instead of rice to reduce the amount of
carbs but feel free to use jasmine or brown rice to make this dish hearty earn

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the pit main cook kitchen today's video is all about grain bowls now grain bowls
are arguably one of my favorite meals if you're not familiar with them basically
it's just a large bowl full of grains vegetables proteins and a sauce now
these are generally higher calorie bowls so they tend to pack quite a punch in
terms of giving you long lasting energy for the day now I love these bowls
because they're really easy to prepare and to customize with your own favorite
food now here's a quick Anna to comb this in grad school I was learning to
cook for myself and I invited a friend over to study I asked her as I hate he
wants some food I just cooked she's like nah no thank you I don't want one of
your man bowls and I say well what's a man bowl she said you know how you men
do you just put all your food into one bowl and then just mix it up together so
first off that's pretty accurate but secondly men are getting the last laugh
because come 2018 man bowls are these grain bowls are all the craze right now
I know a lot of people believe that healthier meals are much more lower
calorie that they're really small meals but that's not always the case for
instance a fast-food burger meal could have the same amount of colors as a
grain bowl but it's just a matter of where those calories come from healthy
food and clean ingredients are processed much more efficiently by our bodies so
after you eat a big bowl of something like this you're not left with that
feeling of being heavy imploded contrarily you're actually feeling a lot
more energized which makes this a great option for people who are following a
really active lifestyle and need more energy for work or for their work out
all that to say don't be afraid to make green balls your own and remember to
adjust them to meet your energy and caloric needs so today I'm gonna show
you my favorite base grain bowl recipe and then I'm gonna show you three ways
to customize it with a vegan chickpea version a chicken version and then a
barbecue seminole version so that you could enjoy a variety throughout the
entire week now lastly one thing that really makes a great grain bowl is the
sauce so today I'm gonna show you how to make it really super easy sauce with a
special ingredient and that is nutritional
if you have not had this yet you need to go out and get it and add this to your
pantry this is a must-have this is packed with b12 fiber and also protein
in fact I believe like 2 tablespoons of this is 4 grams of protein so it's great
to complete protein to so it's great if you're needing just to add some
seasoning to your food what do you want to add some protein to now the best
thing about personal use is that it has a great TV flavor so today this is going
to serve as the base cheesy texture and cheesy flavor for our special green Bowl
sauce all right so if you are ready to roll up your sleeves and get your hands
a little dirty then let's get started bring water to a boil then toss in
Brussels sprouts boil for 3 to 5 minutes then plunge them in an ice bath so
they'll stop cooking place them on the towel to pat them dry then add them to a
bowl with butternut squash and red onion add olive oil and a pinch of sea salt
and pepper mix it up then add them to a baking sheet bake for 20 minutes at 420 and cook farro to a bowl and add in the
grilled vegetables then fold everything together now let's make the sauce add
garlic tahini or peanut butter lemon nutritional yeast fresh basil fresh
cilantro and cumin as it blends pour in some water to your desired thickness
season to taste with sea salt and pepper now for the vegan grain bowl spray a
skillet with avocado oil and add in chickpeas chili powder and cumin saute
for 5 to 6 minutes add some chives now let's bring it all together add the
veggie and grain mix then the chickpeas then the sauce avocado to balance out
the chili powder and sesame seed garnish when you want to change seasoned chicken
breasts with my casing rub from fit man cook calm then spray a nonstick skillet
with avocado oil add the chicken breast and cook on both sides for six to eight
minutes apiece actually the meal prep container and
garnish with radish for added crunch when you want to change from that spray
salmon with avocado oil then add garlic powder onion powder
sea salt pepper and lemon zest rub it on then bake for 8 minutes at 4:21 a
barbecue sauce to each fillet then brush it on bake for an additional 2 to 4
minutes add the plate to your meal prep container then add a sprinkle of pumpkin
seeds or your favorite seeds for a heart-healthy crunch and just like that

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen well you know that February is all about Heart Month
and this week we are kicking off the week of love now with today's recipe
video I wanted to have a little bit of fun so I challenged myself to think
about a food that I would create for date night and create a meal with that
food that could also be used for a really great meal prep so I thought
about it and that food has got to be salmon so today's video is called salmon
is for lovers for several reasons the first thing is that salmon is full of
omega-3 fatty acids so you're gonna get a good boost of energy to help you to be
dynamic throughout the day now secondly people always ask me especially guys
always ask me what they should cook on date night and ladies back me up here
because it's not officially proven but I have never been able to go wrong with
salmon I think over 90 percent of women actually don't mind salmon every time I
make it I get tons of compliments and it just in date night is always a success
with salmon it's really hard to mess up because of its fatty nature you can just
get by it with some sea salt sand pepper and maybe a spice and the fatty nature
and flaky nature of salmon really helps to bring all those flavors together and
also as you're cooking it you can tell if you're overcooking salmon because
it'll begin to turn white so it's the perfect thing to make on date night
because you don't want too many slip-ups now the other reason why salmon is for
lovers it goes back to my first point is that it's really high in omega-3 fatty
acids those fatty acids also help in the in in the libido Department it helps you
to get your groove on because they really do help out the production of
testosterone and estrogen inside the body so you can get it on and poppin and
lasts a little bit longer for your date night I'm just giving y'all the details of why
salmon is for lovers for today's video we're gonna have a lot of fun we're
gonna be making a spicy chili salmon with a cream dill sauce put that all
over a beautifully baked spaghetti squash this recipe is as tasty as it is
simplistic now grab a pin you can find out what you need you'll need some wild
caught salmon spaghetti squash coconut milk or heavy cream spinach mushrooms
onion garlic fresh dill and lemon a couple quick notes now I like to add in
the lemon because I'll be using the coconut milk and a little bit of that
lemon zest helps to offset the strong coconut flavors you're also going to
need some garnish now in the past I've used some edible flowers but if you've
ever bitten into an edible flower sometimes depending on the type of
flower you get it can be pretty bitter so my go-to for plate garnish
it's got to be microgreens alright y'all if you are ready to roll up your sleeves
and get your hands dirty and let's get started first let's prep the squash to
make it easier to cut place it in the microwave for two to three minutes to
slightly soft and then slice it down the middle carve out the inside
then place the halves on a baking sheet we're gonna spray with a little bit of
oil and add a pinch of sea salt and pepper bake the halves face down for
about 40 minutes at 400 spray a nonstick skillet with oil then we're gonna add
onion and garlic so I'll take for a minute or two then add chopped mushrooms
if desired followed by a little lemon zest stir it up then add light coconut
milk and dill add a pinch of sea salt and pepper then toss and raw spinach
wilt the spinach into the sauce and only if desired
you can mix in a little air root starch to thicken it up just a bit continue
stirring and remove the skillet from the heat to allow to thicken season salmon
with chili powder cracked pepper and lemon zest I like to lightly spray the
salmon with a little bit of olive oil then rubbing the seasonings spray in
Nasik skillet with olive oil then add the fillets top side down see it for two
to three minutes then flip them over and cook with the remaining time until your
desired about 8 to 12 minutes base the salmon
with the cooking juices then remove the skin and flake the flesh with the fork
now let's bring it all together add the baked spaghetti squash and pull up the
spaghetti using a fork add the cream dill sauce then place the beautiful
flake salmon on top finally garnish with microgreens great for a
calorie-conscious date night and even better for meal prep alright job that is
it for today's video I hope that y'all really enjoyed it now the best thing
about this meal again is that it's great for date night it's bail proof but it
also makes a really great weekly or daily meal prep now before you log off

February fit man cook challenge calendar with daily challenges next week we are
kicking off our hit and smoothies challenge where we're going to be
sweating it out but also making some smoothies every single day of the week
so be sure that you get that from fit men cook calm alright job thank y'all
for watching until next time keep it healthy but of course never ever boring
ooh bye 
what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men kitchen in an effort for us all to keep our diets
fresh this summer and to get us to consume a lot more raw veggies and fruit
I am kicking off a five-day smoothie challenge just know that each base
recipe has only four ingredients so there is no excuse for you not to
participate now I've done these challenges before on Instagram and
Facebook but this is my first time actually bringing it to the YouTube
community which actually makes a whole lot of sense now that I think about it
because I can explain the challenges I can walk through them and I can also
answer frequently asked questions like this one hey kev this is a juice cleanse
this juice fasts brah oh hey I can barely make it a five-hour flight across
the country let alone of four weeks of just drinking some juice so no this is
not that at all this is one smoothie each day for five days a total of five
different smoothies now if you're one of those persons out there and you're
already enjoying smoothies and juices every single day then you are ahead of
the curve but I still invite you to take this challenge because you may learn
something new and also you can inspire somebody else now here's how this
challenge works each day on social media on Instagram or Facebook I'm going to
post a new smoothie recipe you're going to take that recipe you're going to
create it you're going to take a picture of it you're going to post it and you're
going to tag it hash tag SMC smoothie and then say what you liked about it or
say what you're going to change about it for the future you have no idea that
people that you will inspire by doing it okay like here's what you're going to
need to succeed this week this is our grocery list you're going to need finish
kale lettuce beets carrots bananas oranges apples protein powder cottage
cheese almond milk Greek yogurt avocado frozen strawberries pineapple frozen
blueberries oatmeal dates or agave turmeric ginger matcha green tea powder
raw cashews and cinnamon remember that you can get this entire grocery
this from fit Minkus calm so even though I'm listing in that right here on fit
men cook calm you can get the exact quantity so you're not buying the entire
produce section when it comes to buying frozen fruit versus fresh fruit
I actually prefer to buy the frozen fruit because it doesn't emit the need
to Elm to add ice to your smoothies Plus fruits like avocado and banana when they
are blooming from a frozen state they tend to have an ice cream like texture
so they make your smoothies that much colder and also creamier to reiterate
each base smoothie recipe has only four ingredients with optional add-ons to
help to boost the flavor or to boost the nutrient content something like a
protein powder in order to boost the protein content these are single serving
recipes and it makes about 16 ounces on average but keep in mind that some of
the ingredients tend to be a lot more voluminous when they have women together
so you can enjoy those over two servings and you should feel free to enjoy these
smoothies as snacks as we're in between meals or even post-workout treat but I
reiterate this is not a juice cleanse reduce fat you should be eating actually
doing this challenge finally the most important thing that you will need for
this challenge is a quality blender one common complaint that I get from people
when about making smoothies is that they can never get it blended well enough
they've got chunks of individual ingredients included you could have a
sliver blender that can barely chop up celery my mom taught me a long time ago
that while cheap is expedient and efficient it can also be very expensive
and you'll end up paying more in the long run I'll be using the Vitamix is
sent to 3500 I've used tons of Vitamix products here on my page which you've
probably seen and I really enjoy the brand they have top-notch quality
service it's pretty much hassle free which is important because this is an
investment into your health and you want something that's going to last you
throughout your wellness journey so if you are ready to roll up your sleeves
and get your later people start doing advanced and it's pretty dated it's
pretty dated right I'm gonna do a good dad yeah okay
you see you are ready to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty guys
then let's get started first up is a golden yellow smoothie
it's very creamy because we al auto and pretty yellow because of the
turmeric and the carrot but in the end it turns out to be a surprisingly cool
yet spicy smoothie check it out add about six ounces of water then one large
carrot half an avocado one small red apple and a half medium peeled cucumber
then an optional one inch piece of ginger and a one-inch piece of turmeric
top it off with ice then pop the top gradually increase the speed until it's
at the max then blend until smooth next we've got an off pink smoothie
lettuce in a smoothie absolutely you see lettuce provides a
lot of moisture doesn't have a very strong flavor and it's pretty easy to
blend check it out first we're going to add one cup of almond milk 1/2 cup of
chopped lettuce one banana and five frozen strawberries then boost the
protein with an optional scoop of unflavored or vanilla whey protein
powder gradually increase the speed until it's at the max send blend until
smooth next we got a hipster green smoothie it doesn't get any more basic
than adding spinach to a smoothie so we're going to jazz it up by adding in
some cottage cheese to boost the casein protein which is going to feed your body
and your muscles throughout the day check it out
add one cup of 2% cottage cheese 2 cups of raw spinach one banana and a half cup
of fresh pineapple add an optional teaspoon of matcha green tea powder top
it off with ice then pop the top then blend until smooth next we got a very
red smoothie now I've come to appreciate beats and recipes besides the
nutritional value of them I also like the fact that they provide a lot of
sweetness which basically eliminates the need to add in processed sugar and for
those out there who don't like kale because it has two hearts of the flavor
pairing it with the beets and the citrus helps to mask that flavor but to also
get the nutritional benefits of the kale check it out add about 8 ounces of water
2 cups of shredded kale one mandarin orange one beat and 1/2 a cup of frozen
blueberries then add an optional 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon top it off with ice and
blend until smooth lastly we got a sweet and salty smoothie
this is my favorite smoothie for this entire theory it's a delicious new
replacement smoothie for breakfast for lunch and in between meal or even a
post-workout Cashion's have a very light and sweet flavor and when they're
blended together they tend to be much creamier than most nuts
especially when they're soaked now I recommend adding in the option on one
date here because it's going to help to boost the flavor of it but you've never
experimented with base before and recipes then try it out just one time
one date goes a long way it's a very energizing ingredient especially for
those who train really hard or work in hard conditions check it out add one cup
of 2% Greek yogurt one banana 1/3 cup of raw cashews and two tablespoons of raw
oatmeal then select either one date or half a tablespoon of agave add ice you
can pop the top and blend until smooth add some coarse sea salt to the rim of a
blast then pour in the drink enjoy and thank me later that is it for today's

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen today's quickie recipe is a delicious restaurant style
orange chicken meal prep now a few months back I did a review on an
airfryer and if you've never tried out some chicken tenders or chicken nuggets
or even just fried chicken instead of an air fryer then this is their recipe to
try out they come out super crispy and succulent and white on the inside but no
worries if you don't have an air fryer just yet
you can bake these chicken nuggets like the way that I'm gonna show in today's
video also if you're go and plant base all you got to do with swap out the
chicken for some tofu and swap out the egg white or some spicy mustard we're
gonna pair the orange chicken with some brown rice and some steamed broccoli
rest assured you are going to love this one check it out first let's chop the
chicken breasts into nugget sized chunks beat some egg whites until they're
somewhat frothy then toss the chicken chunks in wheat flour then the egg white and then the panko
crumbs repeat and place the chunks on a baking sheet or baking rack and bake for
15 minutes at 4:29 let's make the sauce squeeze a few oranges then add in
coconut sugar or stevia in the raw low-sodium soy sauce rice vinegar garlic
and ginger if desired add some heat with a little bit of Si Racha stir it up then
pour it in a nonstick skillet bring it to a light simmer then mix arrowroot
starts with water and add it to the skillet immediately stir and reduce the
heat to allow the sauce to thicken pour the sauce over the big chicken
chunks then toss everything together boom complete the dish with a little green
onion and sesame seeds for garnish carry the meal prep with brown rice and
steamed broccoli smash that like button then head over to fit Ming sitcom for
the full recipe and download the fit man cook apps on iPhone and Android for more
easy healthy practical meals 
what is going on guys and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen today's quickie recipe is a personal favorite
and it is a soul food favorite as well we are making up a delicious cajun low-carb
goodie right dish now existing flavor from two things I
believe the first one is Creole season Creole seasoning is a very spicy salty
type of rub made up of paprika and cayenne and oregano and other herbs now
I recognize that some of y'all are not able to walk into your local grocery
store and pick up Creole seasonings so we're going to try to recreate that
seasoning today for this recipe and the second way that it's distinct flavor is
from the meat now it's not uncommon to find variations with sausage with ground
meat but the most common factor in goodie rice has to be the chopped liver
if you've had liver by itself it has a very harsh flavor very gamy taste but
when you cook it with the dirty right and you chop it up and it's mixed in
with the broth and the Creole seasoning it really comes together and brings this
kiss to life so what we are going to be using is
ground beef to make the recipe low carb and a little bit more keto friendly
we're going to be swapping out these white rice and using cauliflower rice
since 30 rice is very spicy and very savory we're going to pair it with
carrots because carrots are naturally sweet but of course you are going to
boost the flavor just a little bit by adding a little bit of cinnamon and
sugar free maple syrup all right we're going to get the hands dirty
I hope so let's get started first slice colorful characters down the middle and
place them in a bowl add avocado oil sugar free maple syrup cinnamon sea salt
and pepper and thyme mix them up then place them on a baking sheet with
parchment paper or foil roast for 10 to 12 minutes at 450 then add the remaining
syrup and a pinch of sea salt and pepper set them aside to cool spray a pot with
olive oil then add garlic and meat shop and cook the meat until it's almost no
longer pink about five minutes then add bell pepper celery and red onions
stir it up then toss an onion powder thyme oregano paprika and cayenne mixed
in the seasonings then add Worcestershire and beef or veggie stock
bring to a light simmer and add a pinch of sea salt and pepper then add bay
leaves and sage cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes on low heat now while that's
cooking add cauliflower florets to a food processor then pulse blend to
create right add the rice to the meat mixture and fold everything together if
needed add a bit more stock than cover and cook for about 10 minutes boom smash that like button then head
over to fit many cooks calm for the full recipe and macros and remember to
download the fit men cook app on iPhone and Android for more easy healthy
practical meals you 
what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fitment code kitchen and welcome to the fall or maybe we're in that
transition month but whatever fall we'll be here very soon now fall was one of my
favorite times of year and if you spit any summer in Texas and you would
understand why as a Texan we are ready to get rid of this intense heat but also
because of the food one of my favorite fall foods is squash
now while I like to eat squash plain and raw you know I may spiralize it or put
it into a salad or something I enjoy it most when it is mixed into a recipe now
one of my favorite types of squash because there are many out there is
butternut because it's versatility it can be used in very sweet dishes for
desserts or even some savory dishes in fact last year one of my favorite uses
of butternut squash was to make a big bowl of chili con queso people had no
idea that they were eating the cheese and over half the cheese was actually
better nut squash so it's a pretty dope recipe if you missed it go to fitmin
cook calm and just type in the big bowl queso and you should find it so today
I'm going to show you just that ingenuity by making a delicious creamy
butternut chicken and rice dish now I am technically not in my full bulking mode
just yet so I'm gonna be using cauliflower rice but you could feel free
to use whichever rice fits your diet right now and your goals we're gonna
pair that dish with roasted Brussels sprouts with a hint of maple it is
essentially all of the flavors that make you think of the fall check it out first
we're gonna slice in Brussels sprouts in half this is a personal preference
because I do not like big chunks of Brussels sprouts but this also helps you
to better ration out the portions coat them with olive oil balsamic vinegar and
maple syrup or agave gently fold them in the sauce then line a baking sheet with
parchment and spread out the Brussels sprouts
roast in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the edges are brown and crispy
allow them to slightly cool and get sticky from the maple next we're going to chop the top and
bottom off a butternut squash then cut the remainder into pieces stop off the
skin then cut it into chunks bring some water to a boil and add a steamer basket
add the chunks of butternut squash and cover and steam for roughly 15 minutes
or until the squash can be easily pierced with a fork allow the chunks to
cool then add them to a food processor pour in veggie stock rosemary and sage
bolts blend until smooth adding tablespoons of veggie stock if
needed spray a nonstick skillet with olive oil heat set it on medium heat
toss in the raw chicken breast pieces and cook for about 10 minutes ensuring
it is fully cooked and brown on the outer edges set it aside and using the
same skillet at olive oil garlic bread onion and red bell pepper carmelize for
3 to 5 minutes before adding in cinnamon this brings the flavors together to fill
a lot more like fall next add in the butternut squash puree and coconut milk
stir it up then add a pinch of sea salt and pepper to make this extra creamy I
like to add goat cheese because it's a viable substitute for cream cheese or
even heavy cream stir in the cooked chicken breast and then some frozen peas boom now build your meals I'll be using
lightly steamed cauliflower pearls instead of rice to reduce the amount of
carbs but feel free to use jasmine or brown rice to make this dish hearty earn

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen as you can see I don't have anything sauteing or
boiling or steaming right now in the background it's just me and you I do
have some infants going because I cook mad garlic and onion and got the whole
place to know and like Thanksgiving morning up in here one of the really
cool things about this place that I'm in and writing this book is that I feel
like I'm in a really creative place and my publisher bless her heart she is
challenging me more and more to consolidate my ideas just for this book
and to save some of the other stuff for other books and other projects and it's
a challenge because aside from all the recipes I also want to share a little
bit about my journey and how I've been able to navigate this healthy lifestyle
now for what almost five years going so all that to say I've been writing a
whole lot and when I feel something I'm going to write it down but today's video
is actually inspired by a recent experience that I had when I was in the
gym and it's about being and a diet rut about being in your own diet depression
and I call it a diet depression because that's what it feels like whenever
you're in that rut it's debilitating you are disenchanted you're not motivated to
try new foods and you hit a brick wall and you feel that you can't move past it
a young guy came up to me he said hey I've lost some weight I've got at least
16 more pounds to go and I had to lose this weight because I really want to try
out for the Marines I was trying to share some ideas with him and they got
me thinking that it's less about him hitting this weight plateau
he was really asking a question about how can I get motivated again rather
than write this stuff down and share it later I wanted to share it now so with
that being said I want to share with you all five things that I did to dig myself
out of my own diet depression my own diet rut the first thing I did to dig
myself out of a diet rut is I had to get understanding meaning get perspective
about what's going on in my life I had to become a lot more self aware of
the external factors that oftentimes influence the choices that we make is
their emotional drama at work is an emotional drama at home with you and the
kids or you and wifey what are those things that are happening right now in
your life that are influencing your decision not to get too personal but at
the very beginning of this year I went through a breakup and it was really
disappointing cause it was something that I really enjoyed and I thought it
was going to last but it didn't last and at the time I was working out I had a
strict diet and I was doing all that and so when that breakup happened I slowly
began to back away from that and I didn't really realize I was dissatisfied
with where I was and so I was projecting that on to everything else
I began to become dissatisfied with my workout I became dissatisfied with my
diet and so incrementally I started to make these different decisions that that
move me farther away from my fitness goals and from my diet goals and I had
to confront the truth that a lot of things that were happening with me
emotionally we're also influencing my dietary decision so you've got to make
up your mind and you've got to get perspective about what's going on in
your life it don't even have to be that deep it could be you are working more
hours at work you've just moved to a brand new city and you don't know the
area very well give perspective about what's going on and once you get
perspective and you can begin to deal with those underlying issues the second
thing I did is this idea I like to call a dropping bread crumb go back to what
you were doing when you first started your diet when you were feeling happy
about healthy eating when you were meal prepping I asked myself the same
question and I and I wrote it down and one of my first diet was these are some
of the foods I was eating I was having a v8 and a salad a Lean Cuisine some
turkey hotdogs chicken breast brown rice and salad and fruits as as dessert and
please don't write me yes I know the lot of that service process but hey it's
what I was doing and just the memory of this it got me smiling
they got me fun because I remember how I felt I felt so accomplished I felt so
OnPoint and even though I wouldn't buy some of these foods right now
immediately it gave me some ideas about what I could do be doing right now if I
wanted to add some variety to my diet and don't take my word for it you can
look at some of the professional athletes you watch them oftentimes when
they're going through some of their loads what they'll do is they will go
back to their old high school coach or there are all that middle school coaches
they'll go back to their parents who are coaching them for four and work with
this why is that important when they were working with them they were in love
with their sports they were loving it and they felt it and they want to get
back to that so that's what you have to do here with your diet go back to what
you were doing before go back to your old routines it could ignite that fire
that will get you back on the road to eating well again the third thing I did
to get out of the diet rut was I changed my environment and I changed up my
routine in order to get variety in my life one thing that I love to do is I
love to shop around at different supermarkets
I live in downtown Dallas but I will go all the way at like 20 30 miles out some
time to go to a different work store and people will see me they said hey I don't
know you the two lived over here I don't but there is a lot of value in
changing up your environment different supermarkets and different areas they
will offer different products and different foods and it's in those
product offerings that allows you to get new variety and new ideas into your own
diet and the reality is if you don't switch up your environment you're always
going to have what you have and it's funny how you will go to different
stores searching for a shoe a brand new t-shirt a dress why won't you do that
when it comes to your diet and this is especially true for ethnic cuisine many
cities have different pockets so here in Dallas you can go to a Japanese food
store Indian Market a Mexican essential American market and all these different
places provide you with different products so that you can enrich your own
diet and lastly on this topic of changing your environment getting
variety eat out don't be so concerned about
being super healthy that you are zip locking your entire life new experiences
eating out and enjoying the military pole really helps us to socialize and it
brings us together and if you can't afford to well you can also eat end but
have seemed nice so one night you're going to make a great Mexican dish
another night and Italian night whatever it is whether you eat out or stay in you
can make it work for you the fourth thing I did to get myself out
of the diet rut is I had food challenges on fit men cook calm I post monthly food
calendars that has a food challenge really every single week and I did this
because I wanted to mirror what I was doing in my own personal lives each week
I would challenge myself to try a brand new food and I look forward to trying
something new every single week so when we try out a brand new vegetable and I
would go into the internet do a search for healthy recipes with that vegetable
and then go and make it and other days I would say all right I'm going to try out
a brand new complex carbohydrate because I'm tired of just eating quinoa rice and
sweet potato expand my horizon and all those things led to my kitchen
competency my confidence in the kitchen and it allowed me to be able to
understand how to pair foods together so that way I can get variety and have a
really enriched diet often times we have anxiety about eating out or just foods
in general because we lack the knowledge so having these food challenges in place
allows you to experiment with new food and lastly one of the final things I did
to get myself out of a diet rut is I never stopped learning one of my
favorite scriptures is the concept that we all have heard before and it's
reaping and sowing whatever you sow you will reap in other religions it's Karma
when the philosophy doing good and the universe is going to get back to you but
whatever concept you believe in understand this whenever you nourish
your body with healthy foods your body responds positively so whenever you are
able to nourish your mind about new diets and trends and foods you're able
to take those things and apply them to your own life as needed in the way that
you can sustain and that you can manage that makes sense for you never get to a
place where you that you just know it all whenever you
get to that point that's when you stop growing so be yourself new ideas and new
perspectives this is particularly true if you are in the health and wellness
industry but you're on the service side so you are a trainer you are a motivator
you are a nutritionist you are a coach you are somebody that people have deemed
as a resource you are a cookie dog meaning people see you and they see
cookies and they reach their hand in they take it out and they eat it
very rarely do people put cookies back into the jar and so what happens to you
then you yourself are emptied out and you don't haven't enough substance for
you to dig yourself out of your own diet right so if you find yourself as the
only resource for everyone around you then still help people but you've got to
find yourself another place where people can pour into you where you aren't the
smartest person in the room where you're feeling challenged and that way you can
have a sufficient supply of cookies for all those hungry people that you are
empowering and helping out everybody finds themselves at a place where
they're not feeling as motivated but the difference between those people and
everybody else is how they respond how are you going to respond to your own
diet it's time to get up from the couch stop feeling sorry for yourself
stop lamenting those five pounds of to loss that you already gained back last
weekend it's time to get over it understand your surroundings drop
breadcrumbs and go back to those basics change your environment your routine and
get variety have some healthy food challenges and number five never stop
learning well that's it for today's video I hope that you all enjoyed it to
some degree we have all experienced that that place where we're not feeling as
enthusiastic about this healthy journey so understand that your circumstances
right now are not uncommon you want that special you're special but you aren't
that special and what's going to separate you from everybody else is how
you respond to this you can continue to wallow in the diet rut like I did for
years or you can take your diet by the ring and guide yourself
out of this and once you do it this one time you're going to be able to do this
every single time I guarantee I don't worry about this anymore
because I know how to find my way back to that impassioned place where I'm
excited about my diet I'm excited about healthy living if you like videos like
this I invite you to hit that like button below but more so than that I
want you to take just a couple seconds and if you've ever been in a diet rut I
want you to share your experience below in the comment section and also share
how you got out of that diet rut and it's through these ideas through the
sharing of all of these ideas that our community is going to continue growing
and thriving again I want to thank y'all for watching until next time I want to
try to keep it healthy but of course never ever boring Oh bye

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen today's quickie recipe is a delicious restaurant style
orange chicken meal prep now a few months back I did a review on an
airfryer and if you've never tried out some chicken tenders or chicken nuggets
or even just fried chicken instead of an air fryer then this is their recipe to
try out they come out super crispy and succulent and white on the inside but no
worries if you don't have an air fryer just yet
you can bake these chicken nuggets like the way that I'm gonna show in today's
video also if you're go and plant base all you got to do with swap out the
chicken for some tofu and swap out the egg white or some spicy mustard we're
gonna pair the orange chicken with some brown rice and some steamed broccoli
rest assured you are going to love this one check it out first let's chop the
chicken breasts into nugget sized chunks beat some egg whites until they're
somewhat frothy then toss the chicken chunks in wheat flour then the egg white and then the panko
crumbs repeat and place the chunks on a baking sheet or baking rack and bake for
15 minutes at 4:29 let's make the sauce squeeze a few oranges then add in
coconut sugar or stevia in the raw low-sodium soy sauce rice vinegar garlic
and ginger if desired add some heat with a little bit of Si Racha stir it up then
pour it in a nonstick skillet bring it to a light simmer then mix arrowroot
starts with water and add it to the skillet immediately stir and reduce the
heat to allow the sauce to thicken pour the sauce over the big chicken
chunks then toss everything together boom complete the dish with a little green
onion and sesame seeds for garnish carry the meal prep with brown rice and
steamed broccoli smash that like button then head over to fit Ming sitcom for

what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fitment code kitchen and welcome to the fall or maybe we're in that
transition month but whatever fall we'll be here very soon now fall was one of my
favorite times of year and if you spit any summer in Texas and you would
understand why as a Texan we are ready to get rid of this intense heat but also
because of the food one of my favorite fall foods is squash
now while I like to eat squash plain and raw you know I may spiralize it or put
it into a salad or something I enjoy it most when it is mixed into a recipe now
one of my favorite types of squash because there are many out there is
butternut because it's versatility it can be used in very sweet dishes for
desserts or even some savory dishes in fact last year one of my favorite uses
of butternut squash was to make a big bowl of chili con queso people had no
idea that they were eating the cheese and over half the cheese was actually
better nut squash so it's a pretty dope recipe if you missed it go to fitmin
cook calm and just type in the big bowl queso and you should find it so today
I'm going to show you just that ingenuity by making a delicious creamy
butternut chicken and rice dish now I am technically not in my full bulking mode
just yet so I'm gonna be using cauliflower rice but you could feel free
to use whichever rice fits your diet right now and your goals we're gonna
pair that dish with roasted Brussels sprouts with a hint of maple it is
essentially all of the flavors that make you think of the fall check it out first
we're gonna slice in Brussels sprouts in half this is a personal preference
because I do not like big chunks of Brussels sprouts but this also helps you
to better ration out the portions coat them with olive oil balsamic vinegar and
maple syrup or agave gently fold them in the sauce then line a baking sheet with
parchment and spread out the Brussels sprouts
roast in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the edges are brown and crispy
allow them to slightly cool and get sticky from the maple next we're going to chop the top and
bottom off a butternut squash then cut the remainder into pieces stop off the
skin then cut it into chunks bring some water to a boil and add a steamer basket
add the chunks of butternut squash and cover and steam for roughly 15 minutes
or until the squash can be easily pierced with a fork allow the chunks to
cool then add them to a food processor pour in veggie stock rosemary and sage
bolts blend until smooth adding tablespoons of veggie stock if
needed spray a nonstick skillet with olive oil heat set it on medium heat
toss in the raw chicken breast pieces and cook for about 10 minutes ensuring
it is fully cooked and brown on the outer edges set it aside and using the
same skillet at olive oil garlic bread onion and red bell pepper carmelize for
3 to 5 minutes before adding in cinnamon this brings the flavors together to fill
a lot more like fall next add in the butternut squash puree and coconut milk
stir it up then add a pinch of sea salt and pepper to make this extra creamy I
like to add goat cheese because it's a viable substitute for cream cheese or
even heavy cream stir in the cooked chicken breast and then some frozen peas boom now build your meals I'll be using
lightly steamed cauliflower pearls instead of rice to reduce the amount of
carbs but feel free to use jasmine or brown rice to make this dish hearty earn

remember to download the fit man cook app for iPhone and Android for more easy

come together beautiful in fact I want to show you a quick video demo of what
people are going to see when they open up this brand new 6e app check it out what is going on y'all so I've been

solution and today we are announcing meal prep Pro that is right meal prep

iPad and the Apple watch as they're pretty dope be alright I know just wait
till you actually get it into your hands and start playing around with it you're
going to fall in love with the app as you can see behind I want to just show
you how what we've been working with you do not want to be here two days ago we
had food slinging everywhere we've got this amazing film crew here and this is
the way that we usually do it all most of my food shoots we actually had a
really big discussion about what the logo and look and feel of the app should
be and so one major point for us was how do we explain what meal prep Pro is how
do we also combine the elements of the fitmin cooks feeling and branding that
people tend to like to into one thing so this is what we came up with so this is
the first logo and so you put them together and the peas right here so we
ended up kind of tweaking the logo just a little bit so that way that this part
could give a little more more evidence until we came up with there yeah we had
a couple of other really good ideas well this is a container one so you guys M
the container and then that this one has a peel on there so you stack up your
meal prep in so meal prep Pro we got the fit man Chris logo plus the containers
cut it off and sit in this because of the logo of the race like number two I
like number one and I think we both thought this one maybe was a little bit
too yeah bit too masculine kind of thing and what makes yeah be the ideal app
what makes an app worth investing in yeah so first of all we were thinking of
sort of combining more the fitness aspect together with the meal plans and
we were sort of really excited and we started building that and we were like
oh people are going to love this people are gonna love this and then we realized
that we hadn't actually asked anybody I'm actually asked the filmmakers
audience whether this is what they wanted 80% said like we really just want
like a meal prep app and 20% set of workout app combined with meals so we
were really sort of going in the wrong direction until we spoke to the sitting
then click audience and yeah the the sort of
talking to the audience has made the full difference since the reason we've
introduced all of these features over the past two years so yeah the feedback
we get off people is just incredible and it completely informs everything that we
do I think that maybe we got the idea because a lot of people in comments
they'll say show your workouts and do something like this and oftentimes I
find that it's the really vocal minority that can really shape your perspective
of things that's pretty big so I want to now talk a little bit about the
methodology around building out some of the recipes because what we wanted to do
is make sure that we had the fit men cook apps that she's been doing
tremendously well I think that if all goes well we could maybe hit a million
downloads combined with our iPhone app plus the Android app because Android is
still doing very well all right yeah yeah the Android apps
done great at I'd like hundreds of thousands of downloads already and all
like hundred five-star reviews and stuff but all the my participants would have
like just keep adding stuff right that's yeah one of course what about people
that have the Windows Phone good okay we can say that I think one of the main
things though is that we wanted to make sure that it doesn't really compete with
what we already have with the fit men cook apps so how are the recipe is going
to be a little bit different so we got this wonderful recipe writer owner she's
from the UK I know that you do these amazing recipes because you're a great
chef how do you take like five star restaurant style meals and then make
them real probable well it's like as you said it's actually really tricky because
you start off with his recipe and by nature I just got really excited by my
god right listen I chose it right and then next thing you know right I think
we need to strip this back and right it's really like taking over ideas and
just like funneling them down into what do people actually have at home in their
kitchen and what do they what's just really convenient for them to like know
every using of that once it's your everything in one pan and
the opening window they want to be in and out of the kitchen reading playfully
so the 30 minute and then like matching it up with the macros as well as been a
huge oh my goodness so so let me tell you all this this recipe app this is not
just your typical recipe app every single recipe right now is in the app is
is going with a 40 30 30 breakdown so 40% protein 34 sick grams of 30% carbs
and 30% fat so what were some of the challenges as we're going through so
because I remember going back and forth we're like well we can't add in the
almonds if we got to have the olive oil like if you take one of the earlier you
I like to sprinkle everything on that like oh yeah we can obsess amici's and
sprinkle on there and you look for no we can't do that because you can't add them
as gardez because then we have to actually put in a recipe so one of my
favorite ones it's not up here and I think we took it out was the babo D so
this one kills me because I perfect like I said it's a kind of a Curry's grand
beast and with some raisins and almonds I guess it's a gorgeous dish is that
like you know turmeric babies like some beautiful citations and a cantar berry
and then you thought there's like egg and mittens it's like transcript press
on top so it almost looks like it's cheese but it's like high protein like
really good pretty good value food and then then you kind of look at the list
at the end you're going to see distillation we got 15 ingredients we're
gonna spend time in the kitchen doing yeah what was your favorite one that we
did exactly and it's one that came out of our over and back after the first
evening and are you talking about yeah the five ingredient 5 ingredient turkey
meatballs just is it so simple so easy to make and this is why it's so
important I like collaborate she was really good in like bringing in a lot of
the different type flavors and we just had leftover meatballs and we were
thinking I mean like that so for turkey meat seller signal let's just make some
meatballs you know me I'm kind of you know just simple and we're like well
let's maybe you some of the green curry paste what I tell you guys this is one
of the most difficult dishes that you'll ever make it was one of my favorite
thing and it was only five ingredients and literally came from us like going
back and forth above a different fifty-four an hour and we said we just
do these and then when we're filming we you know we actually saw the ingredients
were like this is five ingredients is that we're all women so we're all
winning and you're going to win to make this dish alright guys so wrapping up
here I want to just talk about three things that I'm really excited about
with this brand-new app first thing is that you can actually tweak your macros
inside of it and this one you don't have to stick to the forty thirty thirty
break down the second thing that I really love is the way that we present
the the recipes now one thing that we heard a lot was just that wouldn't if
you're watching the videos on YouTube and you're watching them inside the app
you've got a quick you've got to keep pausing it that's not a really good
process flow whenever you're looking at recipes so in this one we actually take
a full video and we're splicing it up so you get to swipe through the recipe so
with step one there is a little bit of a snippet of a video there and you're
going to swipe left and it's just a much more natural intuitive way to think
about cooking you don't have to wait through my long intros anymore because I
hear you come about my long intro and lastly cooking with your pork is there
an app out there that actually allows you to cook the same food split in
different portions and divvy it out this app actually does that this is why it's
been such a huge undertaking while we're so proud of it

go and we're gonna make this fiesta rice right now and I'm gonna cover your
groceries and to worry about it okay all right let's go we're gonna go this way we're still making scratch because you
are a hooker we're gonna we're gonna use this one perfect alright guys so we are here in the
middle of Kroger we just surprised Becca and we're about to make this amazing
really easy tex-mex fiesta rice dish so Becca has a food allergy to chicken
which I've did not know that existed but hey and you're all special this is why
everybody's are all special right first step is to chop these into very small
pieces and we know that Becca can cook because when I was talking to her
earlier she was describing her chili dish actually I feel like I'm gonna
maybe like angle it and then post that's with me cooks recipe but just know it
came from her great and this is about a pound of turkey tenderloin that we're
cutting up so while she's doing that this skillet it's just not getting hot
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna add in a little bit of olive oil just
about a tablespoon of it scoop that right on in thank you
and the only thing we're gonna do here is we're just going to brown brown the
meat around the top and bottom of them all right this is perfect we're just
gonna dump that into there you got it this is they're really heavy yeah we're
doing a workouts and everything today this is when we're really gonna add in
the oil cuz we're gonna get cooking so we're gonna add in about two tablespoons
and this is gonna be about at least eight servings so remember that you know
when you're adding in oil and things like that think about how many servings
that you're going to be doing cuz it that's a huge factor in the calories
we're gonna toss in some green onions yep whole thing and then some garlic just going stir it up and what we're doing here is just gonna
caramelize the the red onion and the garlic equip down your onion at our do
you prefer white or red yeah we're gonna do about a tablespoon and a half of
chili powder and then let's do it two teaspoons of cumin yeah a little
stubborn too all right good and what I like about doing it this way
is it really helps to lock it in cook this down for about two minutes we're
gonna speed up the process here but I want you add in some rice now this is a
trick that some people like to use this is short grain and it's weird right
it's different yeah this is short grain brown rice so you can use brown rice
beans Jeff I love jasmine rice oh my god present the blob she's like I agree with
that you stir that up and when you saute the
rise I'm not sure if you do this to do you thoughts are yours yeah it really
helps to lock in the flavors because again we're trying to create our own
like enchilada style sauce but without adding in all the enchilada stuff the
ingredients for it all right perfect for that all of our flavors are locked in we're
gonna add in about a cup of this tomato sauce do you buy stuff with salt in it
or no yeah that's a great call out you want to fold in your turkey as well all
right and we're gonna bring that to a simmer and then if you don't have like a
topping or a cover for your cast iron skillet I like to just get two of them
and stack them do you do that and all people tried it it's actually really
buildable oh that's true she's like I'm fancy I
had my complete set but if you don't like me sometimes you just place it on
the world on top and let that cook so what I thought would go well with like
an enchilada rice would be what guacamole I think well we can tag-team
this so the first thing let's cut open these avocados and here's the tip I
learned - don't be that guy in the grocery store like me but you can chop
off the top of it and if it's white or green that I mean that's green on the
inside if it's not and put it back and walk away quickly we're just gonna make
a quick avvocato mash do you want to slice up these limes for us just slice
them in half so we can squeeze out the lime juice let's just get our forums
going and then how are you when it comes to
heat do you like a whole bunch of heat and spice medium okay how do you usually
chop yours yep and there's enough heat in here to add a little bit of kick and
this is for your guests anyway so they may not like a whole bunch we want to be
respectful of them just in case just in case we're gonna add in our heat now and
then if you want we could chop up an onion or no your are you good with just
the mash like this okay perfect cilantro okay I'm gonna put a little
business I love cilantro by the way well you know that there are people that
actually can't eat cilantro cause it tastes like soap did you know that so
she just saw the problem for you you don't pick up cilantro eat a whole
handful of it I mean come on people then we've got some sea salt and pepper
here I'm gonna put in some salt okay here's my secret ingredient that I'm
actually gonna publicly say for the first time
cumin I do like a teaspoon and that's it yeah that's perfect
that's great and then mash this sucker up and then season the taste with sea
salt and pepper and you're done with that beautiful this one actually has
chicken what it should look like last thing
I'm gonna open this packet so we've got some steamed veggies this is a bold
fiesta and this one actually has some seasoning in there I want to say let's
see this one has your eyes maybe better than mine paprika turmeric garlic powder
sis spices onion powder a lot in life anymore lime and just toss that in there
yep and toss it in the whole fiesta all
right so we're gonna stir this in we're gonna add in the rest of our our chicken
broth or you can do veggie stock if you're gonna make just a vegetarian
version so it's a really versatile and they've got these packed these little
chunks right here those are actually seasoning packs of this stuff we were
just talking about like the like the garlic powder and the turmeric and and
what I like about this type of stuff too is like this would be great with a salad
or its thick enough if you want to get like the little lettuce wrap the big
like little piece of lettuce and make them like little tacos so I'm gonna chop
up some cilantro make a little hole right here and we're gonna top it off
with our freshly made wok what do you think you're gonna put that
right there in the middle of it scoop it in there beautiful I'm gonna chop up some lunch
is for garnish purposes beautiful beautiful beautiful love it and then just some cracked
pepper in the middle to the back to get
everything in there hopefully that vegetables have cooked down because the
steam so you like that it's good alright I just don't want to miss out on
that so it's really good we taste enchilada at all you taste of tex-mex
I feel yeah yeah so is this something that you think that oh whoa the jalapeno
oh wow it doesn't mean see this is like a neat hot stuff like oh yeah it's
really mild yeah it takes the whole opinion so what I love about this dish
is that it's pretty straightforward it's literally just sauteing the rice and
then putting it into a pot and walking away so yeah it's quite simple so maybe
the people from your Bible study will like this stuff tonight you think so do
you think they will all right awesome all right guys you can go to fitment

good a second until next time keep it healthy guys but of course never ever Oh 
there it is is clicking what's going on
guys and welcome back to the fit men cook kitchen so today's video is
actually pretty fun my friends from Listerine sent me this really cool
little care package to celebrate how far I've come as a creator here it is so
because Listerine bold Refresh Punk there's a letter or something in here oh
that's clever the letters in here hey Kevin Congrats
on making it to your fourth year on YouTube at Listerine we're all about
celebrating the people that put themselves out there and take a chance
at changing the game you friend are a total inspiration appreciate that yeah
it's really nice so now that you've logged like a boss we'd love to see how
you take one of your very first videos to the next level by giving it a bold
refresh we know you're up for and ideas are probably already raking through your
head but here's some swag to get you started from your inaugural year of
course go forth and be bold that's what you do and it says BBQ sucks fire it up
meathead you demand anyone that knows me knows that I love kicks and funky sucks
oh these are pretty nice and dope ah and they sent me these now I understand
why and a timer I don't even have one of these you're gonna suck it'll do or
something and then a brush so when they pitched the idea to me I said you know
what would be really cool is if I go back and look at one of my very first
popular recipes in social media not just on YouTube but just in general and it
was BBQ chicken wrapped asparagus hey here we go well the answer is meal prep meal prep
is what you do whenever you cook all your meals on one day of the week and
you freeze them all and then you unfreeze them throughout the week as you
need them so today I'm going to show you a really easy way to make some barbecue
chicken wrapped asparagus grab a pin you can find out what you need today I'm
gonna be using this Rubbermaid Tupperware because it's BPA free and it
also has these two removable inside containers to help separate your food
okay so I got a deposit right there this first off I didn't know what zoom was so
I only had just this one DSLR camera with this lens and so I didn't know how
to focus and I remember having to put up a broomstick with a hat
focus it and then run around again to where it was and so it was right in my
face because hey if it's focused right in out that's all I have and I couldn't
watch myself either so I had to make sure that it was right I did not like
being in front of the camera at this point it was really uncomfortable for me
I I enjoyed it more and more but I remember at this time how embarrassed I
was I didn't know how to film myself cooking live I actually tried to film a
video live one it was so terrible that I just said you know what let's just take
off the sound and then just put in some really cool music so I did that and
people really liked the fact that the focus was always on the food so it was a
really accidental thing to actually happen and it's done it stuck today and
meal prep is still relevant it's really cool to watch this and think about where
I am now because I'm writing a book about meal
prep I'm actually pretty proud of myself with this so today we are going to be
making a bold raspberry chipotle BBQ sauce from scratch then we're gonna put
that onto some chicken wrap that around some asparagus and then toss it on the
grill yes this is an official barbecue recipe because we're gonna fire up the
grill today it is clucking let's get started guys
now the star of this barbecue sauce are these beautiful Texas sized raspberries
another taste of Texas is the Chipotle so we've got some chipotle peppers in
adobo sauce to run off the ingredients we've got some olive oil garlic red on
you we got some cumin this is werster Shire sauce some liquid smoke some
coconut sugar apple cider vinegar and this is air we've starch air we start is
gonna act as a thickener and then of course you'll need some chicken and some
beautiful asparagus all right guys first thing we're going to do to a hot
skillet we're gonna add in our olive oil and then add in some garlic now we do
want the skillet hot but you don't want the garlic to burn and then some red
onion and what we're doing here is just to flavor the oil we're also going to
caramelize the red onion alright so this is just about ready so what I'm gonna do
now is I'm gonna add in the human here and this is going to become very very
fragrant so I'm gonna bloom the spices right now
like cooking it with the onions and the garlic and the oil now we're gonna add
in the star of this dish our beautiful Texas sized raspberries
and you don't have to do too much here because the heat what's gonna happen to
him it's going to cause it in the soften and begin to explode let's add in some
liquid smoke Worcestershire apple cider vinegar
coconut sugar now here is the most important part this is adding in the
Chipotle Chipotle tis to be very spice I like to add in about three tablespoons
or so pick one of the chipotle peppers and just put it inside of the sauce all
right now for the final ingredient now you can tell from the texture of this
that it's already pretty thick this is gonna make it even thicker so this is
arrowroot starch we're gonna add about a tablespoon and stir it up immediately
and arrowroot starch is activated under heat so as soon as it touches something
that's hot then it begins to act as it agent I love the fact this raspberry
sauce has a lot of texture I've got the seeds from the raspberry alright so the
next thing we're gonna do is prep the chicken I'm gonna Pat them dry these are
pretty thick pieces of chicken breast so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna slice
them in half because they're easier to roll up and to wrap around the asparagus
lightly pound them a little bit to flatten them out then the final step
here is we're going to lightly season these with a little bit of pepper now
it's time to marinate our chicken breasts this is the step that I did not
do in the first video which is to marinate the chicken breasts so just add
it in a chicken breast a little chicken chunks my head to of the sauce that's
enough get out all over the air from the bag we're gonna marinate this in the
fridge you can make this overnight but at least do it for one hour so the
chicken has been marinating so we'll take one chicken breast at about three
or four pieces of asparagus I like to start at the at the big side because I
want the skinnier side to be able to flap over so we've got one final step
before these bad boys are ready to go on the grill it is completely optional but
it is recommended and that is since these are going to be on the grill we
want to cover the tips of the asparagus in foil so that way they won't burn
don't burn the tips these are officially grew already these can cook for about 15
minutes at a temperature of around 300 degrees so we're gonna cook them first
with a flap side down so that way they are sealed cook that for about eight
minutes then I'm gonna flip them over if we're going to baste them and cook them
for another eight minutes just make sure that
they are completely cooked all right that is it for today's video guys I hope
that you all enjoyed it I want to first thank my friends over at Listerine for
the idea to do a recipe refresh often times we have tunnel vision because we
are really focused on our goal and that's the only thing that we can see at
the moment and we don't take time oftentimes to stop and to celebrate the
incremental success along the way so whether that's putting up an old picture
of yourself and looking at that putting on some old clothes just whatever it is
I want you to do that make this recipe because you are going to love it
now until next time I want to thank you for watching keep it healthy but of
course what never ever boring boom bye 
what's going on guys and welcome back to
the fit men cook kitchen as you can see I don't have anything sauteing or
boiling or steaming right now in the background it's just me and you I do
have some infants going because I cook mad garlic and onion and got the whole
place to know and like Thanksgiving morning up in here one of the really
cool things about this place that I'm in and writing this book is that I feel
like I'm in a really creative place and my publisher bless her heart she is
challenging me more and more to consolidate my ideas just for this book
and to save some of the other stuff for other books and other projects and it's
a challenge because aside from all the recipes I also want to share a little
bit about my journey and how I've been able to navigate this healthy lifestyle
now for what almost five years going so all that to say I've been writing a
whole lot and when I feel something I'm going to write it down but today's video
is actually inspired by a recent experience that I had when I was in the
gym and it's about being and a diet rut about being in your own diet depression
and I call it a diet depression because that's what it feels like whenever
you're in that rut it's debilitating you are disenchanted you're not motivated to
try new foods and you hit a brick wall and you feel that you can't move past it
a young guy came up to me he said hey I've lost some weight I've got at least
16 more pounds to go and I had to lose this weight because I really want to try
out for the Marines I was trying to share some ideas with him and they got
me thinking that it's less about him hitting this weight plateau
he was really asking a question about how can I get motivated again rather
than write this stuff down and share it later I wanted to share it now so with
that being said I want to share with you all five things that I did to dig myself
out of my own diet depression my own diet rut the first thing I did to dig
myself out of a diet rut is I had to get understanding meaning get perspective
about what's going on in my life I had to become a lot more self aware of
the external factors that oftentimes influence the choices that we make is
their emotional drama at work is an emotional drama at home with you and the
kids or you and wifey what are those things that are happening right now in
your life that are influencing your decision not to get too personal but at
the very beginning of this year I went through a breakup and it was really
disappointing cause it was something that I really enjoyed and I thought it
was going to last but it didn't last and at the time I was working out I had a
strict diet and I was doing all that and so when that breakup happened I slowly
began to back away from that and I didn't really realize I was dissatisfied
with where I was and so I was projecting that on to everything else
I began to become dissatisfied with my workout I became dissatisfied with my
diet and so incrementally I started to make these different decisions that that
move me farther away from my fitness goals and from my diet goals and I had
to confront the truth that a lot of things that were happening with me
emotionally we're also influencing my dietary decision so you've got to make
up your mind and you've got to get perspective about what's going on in
your life it don't even have to be that deep it could be you are working more
hours at work you've just moved to a brand new city and you don't know the
area very well give perspective about what's going on and once you get
perspective and you can begin to deal with those underlying issues the second
thing I did is this idea I like to call a dropping bread crumb go back to what
you were doing when you first started your diet when you were feeling happy
about healthy eating when you were meal prepping I asked myself the same
question and I and I wrote it down and one of my first diet was these are some
of the foods I was eating I was having a v8 and a salad a Lean Cuisine some
turkey hotdogs chicken breast brown rice and salad and fruits as as dessert and
please don't write me yes I know the lot of that service process but hey it's
what I was doing and just the memory of this it got me smiling
they got me fun because I remember how I felt I felt so accomplished I felt so
OnPoint and even though I wouldn't buy some of these foods right now
immediately it gave me some ideas about what I could do be doing right now if I
wanted to add some variety to my diet and don't take my word for it you can
look at some of the professional athletes you watch them oftentimes when
they're going through some of their loads what they'll do is they will go
back to their old high school coach or there are all that middle school coaches
they'll go back to their parents who are coaching them for four and work with
this why is that important when they were working with them they were in love
with their sports they were loving it and they felt it and they want to get
back to that so that's what you have to do here with your diet go back to what
you were doing before go back to your old routines it could ignite that fire
that will get you back on the road to eating well again the third thing I did
to get out of the diet rut was I changed my environment and I changed up my
routine in order to get variety in my life one thing that I love to do is I
love to shop around at different supermarkets
I live in downtown Dallas but I will go all the way at like 20 30 miles out some
time to go to a different work store and people will see me they said hey I don't
know you the two lived over here I don't but there is a lot of value in
changing up your environment different supermarkets and different areas they
will offer different products and different foods and it's in those
product offerings that allows you to get new variety and new ideas into your own
diet and the reality is if you don't switch up your environment you're always
going to have what you have and it's funny how you will go to different
stores searching for a shoe a brand new t-shirt a dress why won't you do that
when it comes to your diet and this is especially true for ethnic cuisine many
cities have different pockets so here in Dallas you can go to a Japanese food
store Indian Market a Mexican essential American market and all these different
places provide you with different products so that you can enrich your own
diet and lastly on this topic of changing your environment getting
variety eat out don't be so concerned about
being super healthy that you are zip locking your entire life new experiences
eating out and enjoying the military pole really helps us to socialize and it
brings us together and if you can't afford to well you can also eat end but
have seemed nice so one night you're going to make a great Mexican dish
another night and Italian night whatever it is whether you eat out or stay in you
can make it work for you the fourth thing I did to get myself out
of the diet rut is I had food challenges on fit men cook calm I post monthly food
calendars that has a food challenge really every single week and I did this
because I wanted to mirror what I was doing in my own personal lives each week
I would challenge myself to try a brand new food and I look forward to trying
something new every single week so when we try out a brand new vegetable and I
would go into the internet do a search for healthy recipes with that vegetable
and then go and make it and other days I would say all right I'm going to try out
a brand new complex carbohydrate because I'm tired of just eating quinoa rice and
sweet potato expand my horizon and all those things led to my kitchen
competency my confidence in the kitchen and it allowed me to be able to
understand how to pair foods together so that way I can get variety and have a
really enriched diet often times we have anxiety about eating out or just foods
in general because we lack the knowledge so having these food challenges in place
allows you to experiment with new food and lastly one of the final things I did
to get myself out of a diet rut is I never stopped learning one of my
favorite scriptures is the concept that we all have heard before and it's
reaping and sowing whatever you sow you will reap in other religions it's Karma
when the philosophy doing good and the universe is going to get back to you but
whatever concept you believe in understand this whenever you nourish
your body with healthy foods your body responds positively so whenever you are
able to nourish your mind about new diets and trends and foods you're able
to take those things and apply them to your own life as needed in the way that
you can sustain and that you can manage that makes sense for you never get to a
place where you that you just know it all whenever you
get to that point that's when you stop growing so be yourself new ideas and new
perspectives this is particularly true if you are in the health and wellness
industry but you're on the service side so you are a trainer you are a motivator
you are a nutritionist you are a coach you are somebody that people have deemed
as a resource you are a cookie dog meaning people see you and they see
cookies and they reach their hand in they take it out and they eat it
very rarely do people put cookies back into the jar and so what happens to you
then you yourself are emptied out and you don't haven't enough substance for
you to dig yourself out of your own diet right so if you find yourself as the
only resource for everyone around you then still help people but you've got to
find yourself another place where people can pour into you where you aren't the
smartest person in the room where you're feeling challenged and that way you can
have a sufficient supply of cookies for all those hungry people that you are
empowering and helping out everybody finds themselves at a place where
they're not feeling as motivated but the difference between those people and
everybody else is how they respond how are you going to respond to your own
diet it's time to get up from the couch stop feeling sorry for yourself
stop lamenting those five pounds of to loss that you already gained back last
weekend it's time to get over it understand your surroundings drop
breadcrumbs and go back to those basics change your environment your routine and
get variety have some healthy food challenges and number five never stop
learning well that's it for today's video I hope that you all enjoyed it to
some degree we have all experienced that that place where we're not feeling as
enthusiastic about this healthy journey so understand that your circumstances
right now are not uncommon you want that special you're special but you aren't
that special and what's going to separate you from everybody else is how
you respond to this you can continue to wallow in the diet rut like I did for
years or you can take your diet by the ring and guide yourself
out of this and once you do it this one time you're going to be able to do this
every single time I guarantee I don't worry about this anymore
because I know how to find my way back to that impassioned place where I'm
excited about my diet I'm excited about healthy living if you like videos like
this I invite you to hit that like button below but more so than that I
want you to take just a couple seconds and if you've ever been in a diet rut I

what up y'all and welcome back to the
fit men cook kitchen today's quickie recipe we are taking chicken and rice to
the next level by making a Moroccan inspired chicken and rice dish the thing
that I love about Moroccan food is the combination of sweet and savory it's not
uncommon to have a slow-cooked lamb just bathing in its own savory broth but
you've also gotten apricot you've got almonds you even have honey and so it's
a combination of all these different flavors that just bring the dish to life
with every single bite and that's what we're going to replicate today apologies
to all my Moroccan peeps out there yo I got mad love and respect for the culture
and the recipes but we're going to streamline the recipe today and make it
much more practical and accessible to everyone around the world by using some
very common spices and seasonings that hopefully you all have right now in your
pantry we're going to combine the nutty flavors of cumin
with the pungent peppery flavors of paprika
that sounds good and then we're going to offset all that with the sweet and
spiciness of allspice oh and that I mentioned about there with
some chickpeas too yeah buddy let's get started spray a skillet with
olive oil then add chunks of chicken breast let's cook until the outside is no
longer pink about six to eight minutes set the chicken aside and put the
skillet back on the heat add olive oil and dice right on you we're going to
cook the red onion for about three minutes then add basmati rice chickpeas
cumin paprika allspice and cayenne bloom everything together ensuring that the
rice and the chickpeas are covered in oil and seasoning pour in the chicken
stock and bring it to a boil we're going to toss in raisins to offset the
spiciness and then add the cooked chicken breast if desired sprinkle in
some cinnamon or add cinnamon sticks cover and cook for 18 to 20 minutes
until the rice has completely cooked season to taste with pea salt and pepper
and garnished with fresh parsley boom remember to check out fit men cook dot com to

take a trolley oh we can walk through the way I'm going
to see how long the walk is let's go check out this view Salzburg is postcard
beautiful it the picturesque European city surrounded by rolling hills and
mountains that are kissed by clouds even with a slight overcast and sporadic rain
showers it's easily one of the most beautiful cities I've ever seen then I
rank your own now starving like Marvin you're accustomed to eat no no I love
the food trucks here's the end look oh I like that one a
giant hot dog wrapped in bacon with cheese on it you know give it oh the
Chiaki Kasai hot dog the Hoff oh yeah everywhere it's me everywhere this is it
this point I've wrapped in bacon bro okay I'm kidding seriously
I'm only trying this because he said it was Austrian so is that like a mr.
cultural thing oh wow look at that and settle stuff because it so well is
dating here in Salford disabled person now we were headed out to say I'm not
here with my friends from Red Bull where the most incredible rates I've ever
heard of called the exam would you type paraglide climb survive two weeks over
eleven hundred kilometers these assets have been training for over one year
just for this moment to make exhale history most people who train pretty
hard it's around maybe three thousand calories a McPherson these athletes are
eating up to 7,000 8,000 calories per day the most elite athletes in the
entire world and we're going to go and talk to them right now usual was about a 45-minute drive which
allowed me to see more the countryside as you can see no filter was needed I'm here with Richard he is the social
media manager for the Excel Keynes and he was just telling me about the crazy
racial it starts over here right yeah it's right over here behind us it raced
along this path and then they they basically they disappear through a
tunnel and then they run to the top of the hill for horn which unfortunately
you can't see from here yeah it's like a solid ten kilometer run this is actually
a Leatherman prologue which is a introductory race this is a warm-up this
is the warmup I think being in Salzburg and now being here at this part the
temperature just dropped it I'm guessing because we're surrounded by all these
mountains you can see Pig Tourette's isn't it the water well see how cold it
is Oh actually you know what it's pretty warm it's not that it's not that cold I
was going to be like ice cold like mountain water Plex it's pretty fresh
and here are the athletes representing the Stars and Stripes Jesse Williams
Gavin McClure and Ricky Mitchell I Lee we're driving right now communication
stuff but you can see some of that because right now trying to get through and it's cat
literally just cow jumped in front of the road like the counters get up there
like it was a bitch ma'am Cap'n I'm out of bread just being
in the car just sitting here and I'm out of breath right now
literally I can't really breathe there's a wall right
oh god please check out this Here I am at the highest checklist for the Prolog
race I drove the athletes height and they would fare glide down if the
weather was better looking out over all this beauty it made me wonder if the
athlete in the moments when they feel like giving up they draw energy and
inspiration from their surroundings we just spent about 20 minutes driving up
this mountain and tell me why the athletes that were down there I've
already made I can't help but admire just the drive
in the will of the human spirit it's motivating see how to push them their
body to the next level go in the same way the athletes go I was watching to go
down like squatting a little bit and back on the heel it's all quad this is
base camp but these are all the RV's of the different athletes and basically
this is their home for the next two weeks inside of these cars I'm here
right now guys with Gavin he looks super young he's super fit he's actually 45
years old he just got with a pro law so how was that today was kind of brutal
cuz I'm pretty fast up yeah and fine on the flat so I was fine getting up to the
turn point but they they cancelled the flying on the way up so it means we
couldn't fly down we had to walk back down and for me it's very much a walk
and walk slow dude I don't have much cartilage in my knees so I take it
pretty slow going down I do a lot of mobility stuff so a lot of rollin now I
mean actually a lot of balls and bands and diet food we explain I mean would
you eat this morning I go in a pretty heavy fat and protein diet and I'm
pretty my body's pretty fat adaptive mantle after all the months of training
so I know what we shoot for and we still need carbs and sugar and fuel for like
to keep from bonding and you know when you really need it but this morning I
had tunnel avvocato for eggs quite a bit of bacon a little bit of bread and and
then a lot of coffee did you carve up after today for all I did a bit actually
a big thing offer sausage they were after here in
Austria so topography it really depends on where we are in the race and and what
we're about to do now I don't want to do too much of a gun arm but you know
nighttime is when really wouldn't before the next day to giving calories yes what
do you tell yourself in those moments where you're with your body is saying
okay no more what do you tell yourself in your mind to get to get yourself past
how can you do this race is on this being the middleman sometimes it's just
pure pain and we just got to park that somewhere else I mean what we're doing
very widely it can be terrifying and really scary and you can get me some
really bad situation and but if you got that player clear they patrol being at
Earth you've got to just be able to compartmentalize and personal oxide and
pain all right that's just attitude I loved what I said he said being good at
suffering and I think so many times we try to take up the shortcut no shortcuts
me and there's only one way to get there thank you for talking to me with
interstates angustia mortuary now with a program back to the campus morning Basecamp
not at all Canton under but somebody cook them
something over here hey what's going on Roman how you doing are you are you man

the bathroom is kind of stores my glider and partes

on come on please George we're the freighter look at that
fridge eh that's not your fridge this is not just a race just like getting your
body ready to run a marathon it's like strategy you gotta know things
about a give your I mean you know they gave you a bigger life at the west
exactly there's the meteorology there's flying
the glider which of course requires really good muscle coordination it's
making this equipment a part of your body you know and same with the glider
you know the more in tune with the glider you are the more just starts to
feel like a part of you psychologically being able to stay calm and deal with
stresses and fear you know a big part of its been like me learn to relax and have
8 9 10 hour flying days in strong conditions and so energy at the end of
the day not feeling not feel pooped you know I mean the race is what 1,300
kilometers yeah how do you know where to go you know looking at Google Earth
looking at these different open-source trail maps things like that really nice
thing about a pair of ours we can range in a really small place I feel like I'm
back in like high school or college right I got you no no it was good
because I'm sitting here like amazing like wow this is this is not what you
know like people think it is it's much more the training goes well
beyond the gym it extends to the classroom as well and when you are tired
and your legs are burning what do you tell yourself to keep going you know
I've done some ultramarathon student it's kind of the same say it's
relentless forward progress do you have time this morning to to cook something
with me yeah absolutely all right we got some cabbage here I forget what this one
was I think no this was that we had this is the wild boar ham this is the deer so
we're cutting up masculine cabbage we definitely breathe here remember we're
trying to boost the fat we're thinking this may be kind of lean just because of
how red it is you'll see too many except marbleization right here plus it's wild
game but this one should be kind of fatty to that diet and Emil that's much
more higher in fat I am protein and I don't eat a lot of sauerkraut I think
I've had two maybe once in my life because it's got a is it like a vinegar
that's a little bit but that's mild okay it's not so it's not so vinegary and
then why is it important I'm with the long term thing it's just going to make
it less likely then I pick up some sort of little stomach bug right you might
adjust the system good biotics than it can handle
and populating it with the right biotics are going to make it less likely that a
little bit of water I eat I drink is going to give me gastro stuffer or the
wrong food or someone not washing their hands or something we made a typical breakfast meal with
not so typical breakfast foods wild boar jerky meat goat brie raw broccoli
cabbage avocado mild sauerkraut near jerky olive oil and cranberries no
spices or seasoning just ingredients I'd never consider praying together but I
was learning another lesson how to make tasty fuel you've got the probiotics
with the sauerkraut I think that healthy fats with the olive oil a bus that sets
from the meat and the cheese there we go look we'll go char movement the duck
okay oh it tastes like a salad dressing on it
it's not that's the thing it from the dark round yeah right right that's it so everyone is out here is swimming
right now and it's actually about 65 70 degrees it's sunny at this moment but
usually I would not get in water when it's this cold outside but it's Austria
I never thought my wellness journey would allow me to meet some of the most
elite athletes in the world and bring me to one of the most picturesque places
I've ever seen I'm learning that Plews is more than just something to be
enjoyed and provide nourishment it steals it makes this move it powers us
where we can stretch the limits of our human potential to achieve amazing
things and that's what wellness is a journey and we should give our bodies a
good fuel that will help us endure the other toughest adventure race of all
life

what's going on guys welcome back to the
pit man cook kitchen and also welcome to 2018 now if you're watching this video
at the top of the year then I already know that you are starting off your
wellness journey on the right foot because you recognize that food is the
most important part of your journey now me personally I like to have a soft
start to new year's goals meaning that I don't make every single change that I
want to make on day one I like to gradually and intentionally just ease
into it and build momentum and enthusiasm along the way because trust
that you will need confidence to sustain this for an entire year so with that in
mind we're gonna be cranking up the slow cooker because it's one of those items
that you don't really have to do too much to get something wonderful and
amazing IRA saw an article recently that the slow cooker or the insta pot was the
most popular holiday item this year so it makes sense to make a video on this
since almost everybody has one alright so in terms of recipes we've got our
bases covered we've got keto we've got vegan we even have some comfort food and
all the ingredients are very easy to find I've picked them all up in my local
Kroger so you should not have too much trouble finding them though there is one
particular item it's jackfruit is that may require you to branch out of your
comfort zone and your grocery store and find a place that actually sells it
it looks like artichoke and comes in a can one more twist of this video is that
I'm gonna be showing you all how to cook inside of your slow cooker first before
using the slow cooker function I show my mom this over the holiday and she called
me up because she was so tickled back she said that her black-eyed peas have
never tasted so good but no worries if your slow cooker does not allow you to
saute you can just cook those items in a separate skillet and then add them to
the slow cooker all right Joe if you are ready for some crazy delicious food then
let's get started first we're making a creamy cheesy chicken and broccoli rice
dish now that was a mouthful now that only is chicken rice and broccoli a
staple Fitness meal it's also one of the most beloved comfort food meals of all
time so today we are going to combine the two and do a comfort food makeover
something that's going to be delicious that's going to nourish your
body but also be very freezing for your power check it out at olive oil garlic
and onion saute in the slow cooker for three to five minutes until the onions
are caramelized add uncooked brown rice fresh rosemary and fresh thyme mix it
all up and ensure that every grain of rice is covered in the seasoning then
pouring some chicken broth followed by dice raw chicken breast stir it up and
pop the top cook on medium high heat for three to five hours when there's divide
an hour left of cooking stir it up and then add Greek yogurt and your choice of
Monterey Jack mozzarella or cheddar I'm using a cheese blend then place the raw
broccoli florets on top do not mix it up guys just let the surrounding steam
soften the florets cook with the remaining time pop the top and mix it up
season to taste with sea salt and pepper mmm next we're making Korean inspired
pull tacos now some of the best recipes I find our fusion recipes combining the
elements and flavors of different cuisines so today we're going to combine
the saltiness of bulgogi with the spiciness of tacos check it out oh yeah
I'm plot-twists you won't believe it's vegan spray the slow cooker with cooking
spray then add canned jackfruit red onion and garlic and grate an Asian pear
for your workout of the day pour in low sodium soy sauce mirin or cooking rice
wine sesame oil and honey mix it up then pop on the top and cook on medium high
for 4 hours when it has about 45 minutes left open it up and chop up the
jackfruit so it looks like shredded meat this will be your second work out of
this recipe mix a little air which starts with water then pour it and cook
for the remaining time garnished with sesame seeds and green
onions to make tacos to corn or wheat tortillas at the Dec fruit avocado mash
and pico de gallo you won't believe this is vegan enjoy Taco Tuesday every day
this week next we're making a low-carb chicken gumbo I tell you what we are
going to be cranking up the spice and flavor in our diet in a major way with
some Cajun cuisine now it's really hard to imagine gumbo without seafood and
technically it's really not gumbo but we're taking out the seafood to make
this more meal prep friendly but also budget-friendly because real gumbo is
expensive to make let me tell you and we're also boosting the fats just a
little bit to make it easier to follow if you're on a keto diet one of the most
distinguishing factors of gumbo is gonna be the spice and so I realized that a
lot of y'all are dispersed around the world so it may be hard for you to find
good old-fashioned Creole seasonings so if you can't find it no worries we're
gonna start out the video making a Cajun seasoning and the best thing about it is
you'll have some left over so you can use it on your chicken you could use it
on other meats or even your vegetables mixed garlic powder onion powder smoked
paprika cayenne oregano save time and sea salt and pepper
mix it up and set it aside at Olive Oyl and chops chicken thighs to a slow
cooker and saute for six to eight minutes until the thighs are cook remove
then toss in smoked turkey sausage cook for an additional three to five minutes
then remove add olive oil garlic red onion bell pepper celery and okra you
want to continuously stir so nothing sticks and also to brown the okra so
that it won't create a slimy gumbo about two to four minutes add a tablespoon ish
of your Cajun seasoning and mix together to bloom the spices your whole house
should smell like New Orleans add arrowroot starch and stir it up again slowly add the chicken broth while
continuing to stir folding the chicken and then the turkey sausage give it a
stir then toss in 2 bay leaves and bring it
to a simmer change the setting to slow cooker and cook on medium high for four
hours and then admire your handiwork delicious spicy low-carb gumbo enjoy
with raw or cooked cauliflower rice to keep it low carb yet satisfying next up
we're making homemade marinara and an eggplant parm now this recipe is all
about creating a fridge or pantry staple marinara is a wonderful item to have on
hand whenever you want to whip up a quick pasta dish or maybe even add it to
some struggle chicken that you have overcook and you need some sauce to go
ahead and choke it down it's a very versatile ingredient that you need to
have in your kitchen the one that we're gonna make today it will last in the
fridge for about a week but it's best to store it in the freezer so it can last
much much longer we're gonna pair this with a crispy baked eggplant for a
comfort food and makeover tree check it out
using the sauce a function add olive oil garlic and onion cook for about 2
minutes then toss some cherry tomatoes to provide a bit of sweet to the sauce
cover with the top for about 2 to 3 minutes remove it and immediately begin
to stir to prevent sticking use a fork or masher to gently crush the cherry
tomatoes then at oregano thyme sage tomato sauce and crushed Tomatoes some
red pepper flakes for some heat and optional capers mix it up then toss some
fresh basil leaves along with a pinch of sea salt and pepper pop on the top and
cook on low for 6 to 8 hours next slice up an eggplant then Pat the pieces dry

temperature add panko to a bowl and mix in dried chives and pepper now dip a
slice in oat flour then egg then the panko mix place it on a baking sheet or
rack then spray with a little bit of olive oil to help Brown

[Music] what's going on guys and welcome back to the fit min cook kitchen for today's quick ear esse P we are going to the island we're going to Jamaica Mon I know that was probably the worst accent ever but whatever y'all will forgive me because the recipe itself is eaten we are making my jerk chicken and plantain kabob I remember the first time that I had jerk chicken and I'm still trying to chase that first experience but let me tell you the rub that I was able to put together it's a close second but you wouldn't do it shout out also to Tammy Boyd on instagram because she is the inspiration behind this dish I asked my followers to send me something that you all want me to create and she came back with a jerk chicken recipe I thought this would be a great way to show you all how to make a delicious rub but also how to pair it with a delicious compliment like plantain check it out first thing we're gonna do is make the rub and allspice cinnamon time coconut sugar nutmeg cumin cayenne to taste ground cloves sea salt and pepper mix it up add chicken pieces to a sealable bags and add a little bit of olive oil then toss in about two tablespoons of your homemade jerk chicken rub boost the flavors with a teaspoon of smoked paprika seal the bag marinate for at least one hour [Music] now let's prep the kebab ingredients first thing make sure that your plantains are yellow and not green they can be a little bit black but not overly play chop the top and bottom off slice it down the middle feel it cut it into chunks about 8 pieces to a skewer you're gonna add red bell pepper green bell pepper plantain and marinated chicken repeat Bob you're gonna cook for about 15 minutes halfway through remember if plantain is drying out boom smash that like button then head over to fit man cooks calm to get the full recipe to download the fit man cook apps on iPhone and Android use for more easy healthy practical meal [Music] 
well some awesome that is really good and that makes me really happy you know I was super nervous I think I was more nervous about this launch than the actual pit main cook one before him because it's just you just never really know and now because social media has changed so much the way that we engage on social has changed even even myself I don't really go and engage pages and pages a lot but I will just read and consume the content so I just had no idea if we're gonna look at for naught I loved it when I had it in my hand so I knew that people once they downloaded it they would actually like it but I just had to get to that first step first but um yeah y'all had an amazing response to it so thank you all very much yeah a lot of nice pause there I can stare and you can read them yeah some very nice positive comments here from people so I yeah that's what I see okay awesome I can't see the comments but under so I'm gonna ask you to read some of those and coffee black by name if I could see your comments right now then I would say something to you but I appreciate the love we're gonna go ahead and get started right now so what we wanted to do was just have a quick hang out with you all to answer your questions about meal prep the new app and everything in between relating to cooking food in both because we realize that it's a it's a trending topic that we've been talking about for years as you can following the channel but right now it's a really relevant topic the first thing that I want to start out with though I wanted to get the app questions out of the way so we can kind of get into some of the meat meat you bones if there are tons of questions out there about it but as I'm talking if you have a question just go ahead and write it down or put it into the chat window and then Andres will feed them to me also if you have questions about the app go ahead and jot those down too because he's gonna be addressing some of those the first topic that I wanted to talk about is the Android I hope my Android users are out there if you've got an Android shout out something there like in the comment section but I want to say first off to the Android community thank you all for for your support of the fitnah community as we you know dive into app development so I got a lot of questions about when is the app going to come to Android when it's metal prep for that and the reality is guys this is strictly a numbers games and it's got to be financially viable for us to be able to I said a couple months ago whenever we launched the Android app on with with the regular ethicacy app it did very very well and I said to preface that is that a lot of people within the industry said don't build an app for Android because you won't see the return I'm not going to name the brand buy main but a really big brand a huge chef brand said don't do it you won't see the return we did it anyway because it's really important to us that everyone around the world can experience the awesomeness of the fit min could app because on base can build a really awesome app but here's the reality we are now what is that like five months in that we launched in March so what is that March well you guys I had trouble counting that I swear dude hey hey June July so about four to five months in already and hundreds of thousands of downloads we haven't been broken even in stark contrast to the iPhone app which you know we were able to break even very quickly the thing about app development is that you know the money that the app kits that we get from the app and the revenue from it that a significant portion goes back into development because we got tons of requests from around the world so we're really trying to quickly implement those in fact when we lost on Android we had a really positive response from an analyst team from from Google Play and the analyst said you know what we should feature this app and they passed it on to get featured and the people that were going to feature they had they came back to us within one day and said hey you know what could you make a couple changes to it we don't like this we don't like that blah blah blah we said to the app let's go ahead and do it and we did those chains a couple thousand dollars by the way not complaining and then we sent it back to them at the changes and they said well you know what just think there's too much white space here you change this around blah blah blah and it was just this crazy thing because we had already had five star reviews and now tens of thousands of downloads and so we weren't featured on them because we're like hey we run back away from this because it sounds like you are designing our app more so in doing it in such a way that really doesn't line up with the positive feedback reality is a lot of people are downloading the Android app free but they're not downloading the premium version and when you download the premium version that money goes back into development so we can continue to make improvements we're always going to push the push new recipes but we want to add new features so people in Android if you have the Android app and get the free version consider upgrading to the premium version and we can use that data to inform how well this new mill prep Pro app will perform on Android once we move there because we would love to but again it's just gotta make financial sense and right now the numbers are against us for months and hundreds of thousands of downloads and we haven't broken even yet under this is that pretty accurate err yeah I mean I'd love nothing more for them for us to be able to take on a full-time Android developer to just start building all these features that have come to the to the iPhone app but unless you know unless people are prepared to upgrade then there's just no way to do that you know we've not even made back the money from the first version so it's very difficult to say okay you know what let's spend like an extra ten twenty thirty thousand dollars or whatever the cost will be to kind of build all of these extra features but you know when we haven't yet seen that kind of movement but at the same time you know it's amazing to have the Android app out there and it you know it's really really great to see like all those amazing reviews of the Android version as well if people are really excited and like we you know yeah we've been waiting to bring it to Android for so long selves as well like this is a huge moment to kind of publish the Android version and pretty much with no hiccups at all I don't think like we've had you know I I don't think I've seen any comments like oh this is crashing or anything like that so I think people are really really really happy with the Android edition which is amazing yeah yeah yeah so people on Android consider upgrading to help us out with the development costs and and we can use that data to inform how quickly we can do something with the milk Pro app to get it onto the Android platform because it is a priority but again the data have to make sense so really appreciate you understanding that and there's a couple of nice people I'm sorry this is nice people here jumping in the comments talking about yeah like not having understood the complexities previously kind of thing and talking about maybe us doing like a Kickstarter or something like that so that's really nice to hear from people that they kind of understand what we're what we're kind of getting at here I know that sometimes maybe some of the big companies make it look like oh yeah we're just kind of you know an app it's quick our fingers and it will magically appear and there's a couple of nice people here posting comments that they've just upgraded so which usually we appreciate thank you that's I'm talking about the immediate pepper feedback thank you it actually means a whole lot when we do stuff like that so all right with that I actually want to move on with the conversation that's pretty tent that's pretty related and that's what the meal prep Pro app launch did amazingly will very very well it's surpassed probably about three times the amount of momentum from the from the first launch right on iPhone if you look at the total number of people that actually engaged in downloads the app which is great so thank you all for doing that I think I'm so proud of this app that's very sexy app first off it looks and feels good in your hand and so on today and his team did an amazing job it was one year in the making I hope that you all spent some time looking at the documentary that we posted and also reading the blog on the website because it kind of goes into the background of what we had to do for this new app the reason why it looks the way it is the fuels away it is because it genuinely did come from you all you all save this ethnic from by by by giving us quality feedback so spend some time and look at that I want Andres so even though the app was great it was fantastic we had a couple of hiccups and these were all positive things like I people were messages and that was because we had reached the capacity of the number of users that we could add in a given period and so we were looking at capacity issues no store additions and other things like that so these are really good things that have have you know I don't want Andres to kind of walk through we have already submitted an update that you know the error messages that you are perceiving that very soon from the App Store but I guess if you want to walk through some things that we're doing for version 1.01 yeah definitely so we really you know we've really pushed it right up to the deadline we were sort of you know finishing off all of these features and you know it was a real it was really quite a mad to three months in the run-up to the launch so we didn't have quite as much time as we would have loved to have had to kind of got it in front of some more people and kind of spotted some of these things but as soon as some of these queries have been coming back and we've been trying to answer them within you know a couple of hours to make sure that everybody knows we're listening and yeah we've sort of version one point not one is currently waiting for Apple to approve it so as soon as they approve it you'll see some of the most kind of crucial things that a couple of people identified we've already solved those so we've already kind of ticked those off and you know there's a few things for the Spanish users a couple of things for people that were noticing some odd kind of ingredients and things like that so all of those kind of things we've solved we had a really interesting problem list they were trying to selves with some people when they first signed up they beginning some odd error messages and we're kind of messaging the Google support team because that shouldn't be happening so we're really sort of as fast as possible trying to get these new versions out for everybody because obviously the sooner we can get through these kind of key issues the sooner we can start focusing on some of the bigger things that people have been telling us about absolutely can you talk a little bit about one thing that I really want to stress was the the meals in how and how we're gonna be mixing it up because I think there was a little bit of confusion that probably could have gone into more depth on the video and how the in cook app differs a little bit from the difference from from milk back pro but basically the concern is are there gonna be new recipes attitude is that and the answer is yes but I went on the frequency a bit yeah definitely so if myself and Kevin we've been talking about this a fair bit and we definitely want to have like we want to set a set a date in the calendar and say you know what like at the start of every month or on the first meal prep Sunday of every month you will see new recipes in your prep Pro so we're just sort of figuring out exactly how to do that right now and we definitely want to sort of have a constant stream of new recipes and what we've heard from people is that they really want a lot of extra breakfast to choose from and a lot of extra snacks to choose from so those are two areas that we're really going to focus on and really sort of expand on you know you've got to remember that two years ago the fit Maine cook app launched with a hundred recipes and it now has over 300 recipes so we're sort of expecting a similar thing with meal prep Pro where you know every month at the same date will just add a whole bunch of new recipes of people will make sure that those are kind of very clear inside the app so that you can always see oh cool these are the new ones for me to add to my plan and to try out kind of thing right right and and the thing just just really quickly the Alexa T of the meal prep Pro is a little bit more so than fit main cook which is by design so fit me and cook you I literally just me like in the kitchen I'm experimenting my tossing stuff out there that I think could be good in summer those recipes may end up bro the meal prep Provost these are designed from a macronutrient standpoint so as we design the recipes we are looking at the macronutrient breakdown so that way they can complement the meal plan so this will in this next easier for us first off to be able to to be able to build well to able to like allow you all to build your own meal plans but it does it it's just not as easy dishes just to grab that you grabbing like a recipe from you know from me and then putting into the app so we're actually being very thoughtful about the way that the recipes are actually added in there and just so you know to just two quick caveat just so you know what it goes on behind the scenes or let's say that we have to first calculate all the stuff we're gonna get them certified by a nutritionist to make sure that they are okay from a macronutrient breakdown standpoint make sure that the numbers and the data makes sense when you look at the overall meal plan some of the micronutrients after that we've got a filament and then we also have a translator and they have to translate this to Spanish and then once all that stuff is collected then we have to take that and then submit that to Apple there's the Apple review too so it's not just as simple as just pushing out recipes whenever we want to those things I have to build the Apple to make sure that there's quality yes so we're we're sort of going through that process right now so we're sort of investigating that right now for for keto so right now we're sort of in the early stages of doing all the research making sure that you know if we do add keto that we've got the right sort of tips in there about the diet and things like that so we don't really want to just said yeah I'm vegan so yeah so you know and and so we'll go away we'll start it's finding the recipes we've got to create all the different calorie levels we've got to sort of make sure that these recipes are meal prep and pour their simple then we've got to sort of write them down film them take any pictures for any additional recipes so that's this ton of work that goes into to meal prep Pro which is why it's so different to fit and cook and you know a lot of everything that we built with with fitmin cook was the result of feedback from the fit men cook app and how people wanted us to kind of take the fit men cook app and go to the next level with meal prep so that we can really sort of make it something incredibly simple to to follow and that's what's introduced a ton of extra complexity on our end but that then makes it for the user incredibly simple to follow obviously where those are the updates from the version 1.01 yeah I think so yeah we've yeah so that should be out in the next day or two depending on when Apple just tick it off kind of thing okay and then one other thing that we are looking at guys is that is that there was some concern and this was actually it was looking back at this in hindsight and exit kind of made perfect sense but allowing people to use the app without putting in the credit card information first the people that actually trust trust the process and thrust this there were you know that it's legit thank you for doing that but there are some users who are concerned about putting in their information prior you know and then prior to being able to like use the app so we are trying to figure out the functionality around that so if there's a way that we can allow like a test trial or maybe like a generic you know I only want to speak on it because I don't want to promise something that we can't deliver but just know that we heard that concern and at the top of our list so that we're not trying to take your money and scam people you know be worried if you see me posting some pictures on Instagram in front of a Lamborghini with some shaker cups and my ass out you worry big we are hard at work behind the theme to answering your questions okay yes are there any questions that have come out and by the way when he was talking I was thinking somebody on Twitter because they had just downloaded the app so for Android so EJ pal appreciate your broker doing that and you know an upgrade about the apps about you can get me talked about so far before I go over a sort of quickfire wands Mitch Woodside here saying they've she's downloaded here all the recipes the same for everybody every week no everybody gets a sort of different plan with the app generates for you there have been a few people that have asked about they want to be able to print off the shopping list some people I don't even own a printer anymore but people want to be able to print off the shopping list that's something that will definitely add a few people asking about Kito again so we kind of covered that briefly there but it's definitely kind of really high up in our priority list so if somebody asking there about swapping some of the meals from the fit maker cap into meal prep probes we kind of covered that briefly just to say that you know a lot of the the fit men cookout meals are not suitable for meal prep Pro because they're a different macro breakdown or you know perhaps they don't take some of the other kind of quite strict boxes that we have for for meal prep Pro but if there's a specific recipe that you'd love to see come to meal prep pros well like make sure you send us a message and we'll see whether we can adapt that somehow to bring it to meal prep Pro as well but unfortunately it's not as simple as saying hey just grab this recipe and just shove it in meal prep Pro unfortunately somebody else asking that they do repeated breakfast and lunch for simplicity I think a few people want the ability David Cantor there who's been posting some very nice comments so a few people want the ability to basically you know only meal prep Monday to Friday and not prep on the weekend you know we've we've sort of seen a ton of variation here on what people want to do and we're looking to add some features in that area as well so that you could just save a plan and then just repeat it next week if you want to so if you find like you know if the the turkey bacon breakfast is your thing and you just want to eat that all the time then we're looking for a way that we can just sort of always have that in place there for you so you don't have to kind of constantly make that change so yeah ton of great questions I can keep going unless you want to keep here on the rest this is one from Twitter from Brian Seattle he said that you wanted to the app to be a little bit more flexible is there a way to plan less than a week yeah definitely so right now what you could do is you could change your Saturday and Sunday to be per market as eating out so then the app won't give you any recipes for the weekend but we're looking for sort of a more advanced way of doing that but for now that's one way to make sure that the app is only giving you content from Monday to Friday because I know a lot of people like to kind of go off on the weekend and do their own thing a few people asked about it be on iPad and it is already on iPad so if you're not seeing it on iPad then you need to be on the latest version of iOS and then you know it's definitely on iPad already okay my computer went to sleep I think if something happened I got kicked off for a second so I miss your answer but I hope that Brian from Seattle got that okay are there any other questions about the app because I wanted to go over in just a couple of things in Mill Creek because I wanted to keep it right at 30 minutes and tips and things that I got via email I want to address yeah so a few people have asking sort of about the difference about with with the fam and cook up and the milk Pro app it's a good question I think as soon as somebody tries the meal grow up they'll kind of immediately get a sense of everything that's very very different there I think the way that we're trying to keep it simple to describe to people is basically picture the fit men cook up it's like you know amazing healthy recipes and picture the meal prep Pro app as more about the meal plants and more about meal prep and then I think you'll sort of start to understand some of the difference but definitely give the give the meal prep Pro app a try and I think you're very sort of quickly see you see it is quite a significantly different app right some people are talking about want one other thing that people are talking of is this idea of ingredient substitutions and a lot of people have very specific dietary requirements some people are not eating eggs cheese lactose is a very popular one so we really really want to bring this to both the fit men cookout and to the meal prep Pro app so it's something that we want to do it the right way so we don't want to hide from somebody that's got you know a lactose intolerance a whole bunch of the recipes what we would rather do is be able to show them those recipes but modified versions of those recipes that they can sort of change change up so we're trying to do it in a really really smart way but yes or if anybody out there with a dietary requirement or preference you know I'm getting a lot of comments from gluten-free celiac and so forth those things are absolutely crucial and we can't wait to bring it to both fit men cook and to meal prep Pro and I think you guys are going to be really impressed because I don't think anybody is going to do it quite as well as what we've kind of got in mind here yeah that says it's such a great call out because we get tons of tons of questions about that and even upon my own family we've got a couple of people you know well that food allergies and so I've been really thinking about how to do that same thing on on the pitman cook calm and so those questions we are actually actively working on right now and and Andres is right if I'm dressed as that then y'all gotta know that that you know what we're gonna come up with is gonna be much better then anything ever out there hey and we've got about five or so minutes left but can I touch on a couple of y'all's question the top and you know me and Andres just shout out some because I can't see the comments right now so just shout out something that you know someone could almost say something but um the first thing is that I get questions on like doing the whole milk prep process is this safe for me to go ahead and do and I think it's actually and it's a weird question but I also think it's a very smart question meal prep is very safe for you to do the thing that I would advise even if you get the meal prep Pro app is that the meal prep Pro app is designed for you to be very successful because it it structures everything but if you've never done healthy eating before then what I suggest is this start out with like one meal or just tunas at the max maybe breakfast and your lunch and just prep that and then get your confidence up because the thing that I started look the most and what I talk to people what I hear from people the most is that you will start really strong and then you will just hit like this clip and then just drop off because you lose your momentum and so what did the thing that you have to do is you want to build incremental success of that way you keep on going up so start very small prep one or two meals at the max and do that for a month or four weeks and see how you feel and then gradually get into it more and more the second thing you know it comes to meal prep the biggest question I've been receiving is about the storage even when you make the meals inside this app or just in general you want to think about storing stuff in the fridge for one or two days anything else that you're not going to eat within those two days I will just go ahead and freeze now there are different limits for that so well not limits but there are different freshness standards for those so technically meat like chicken and on beef can last fresh in the fridge for up to five days maybe fish seafood at the two or three days but I just say you know to heck with it all and just freeze the meal so after you build your meals if you're not gonna eat it within two days just put it in the freezer and the most important thing that you have to remember to do each night if you're going to eat a meal that's frozen is to put it into the fridge because if you don't you're gonna have to end up defrosting it in the microwave at work or something and that's not ideal you're gonna overcook the food it's going to become dry and that leads back to problem number one which you saying that I hate meal prep I can't do it anymore now defrost in the fridge and then reheat your food that way and that and that will lock in the most amount of freshness now this is not related to - no prep Pro app but what it also say is this if you have trouble they into the mode of cooking like individual meals what I like to do because since I'm cooking all the time I don't like to go for like big things like casseroles and other stuff like that that that's probably ideal for milk reps so what I'll do is I'll prep a big thing of like brown rice and quinoa and mix it up together I'll put in some like onions and cilantro with that all right and then I'll prep just some chicken breast and chop it up then I'll prep some beef or some fish and I'll have these little individually prepped items so that way each day I can build whatever meal I want I'll have some frozen veggies in the fridge and I can and one day I'll have broccoli the next day I had some sunlight green beans but that will allow you to kind of mix and match a lot more and there's nothing wrong with condiments so long as you don't have a lot more condiment than you do the actual meal but that will allow you to have a lot of variety and to trick your taste buds into thinking that you're eating something different each day so you can make just a bland thing of just like brown rice but one day you're gonna chop up some cucumber and some and some celery and some cilantro and put some feta cheese in there maybe two and some like you know let me it sounds good then it sounds really good right it's peace out and then that's on those two days we'll head out to the rice take that rice and you may put some cranberries in there or some almonds or something else and so you can keep on designing and changing up your diet each day without having to do this entire meal prep that forces you to eat just this casserole and just this so you can check out the you know sit and cook app which is both on the iPhone and Android and you can get some individual meal meal prep items for those things we all question sorry okay yeah good yeah we had a question there from Erica asking about are the ingredients for you and your partner added to the ingredients list or should I double it so the the new meal prep Pro app will actually work for two people so in your ingredients list you'll be seeing the amount they're listed for two people so if you've chosen to add a partner and while we're on the sort of topic of partners think we really want to do is we really want to feature you know couples that are using the new meal prep Pro and I getting fit together because we think that this is like a really sort of great unique thing and a really great way for for people to reach their their fitness goals is to work together so you know send any stories or any pictures like that in and we'd love to and and what we're gonna do is is we actually we quietly launched the new Pitman cook comm we're still making changes to it but I haven't announced it because I don't want the site to crash or anything like that just because we've got we're still working some things out with it but we're gonna begin to curate a lot of those stories that you all send us in your pictures and we want to put up a page where it's like cooking with Bay getting healthy with Bay and have your pictures and your stories about cooking stuff together with your partner there as well as share those out on social media I don't think we we've we've set an actual hashtag yet have we we need to set a hashtag so that way we can find the stories but right now this just hashtag fit men cook but we're gonna update that very soon but if you're cooking with your partner I want you take a photo together and in write us your story or just the photo in general so we can share that stuff out because you have no idea how motivating it is to see people like you doing it's like real people getting these real results it's so motivating for people around the world and my last thing is is this actually that's a great segue is when you're talking about cooking with your partner I get a lot of emails from from women or the come up to me and talk to me about trying to get their husband or their partner into cooking healthy with them and one thing that I find that women like to do is they like to say all right well let's clip together and they'll give them in like the salad or a side dish and I know I don't want to be like patriarchy or you know like macho but I find that I just think inside of every man regardless is that like we have like this intense desire to cook because in the past were hunters and gatherers for the family so give give the mail if you're trying to encourage him to cook healthy with you include him in that process so don't just relegate you-know-what and women to don't don't don't relegate their partner that you're trying to to get into help cooking into a very small portion of it don't give them the garden salad give them you know the lasagna with you and so they make one part of it and you make the other part but you're actually significantly doing it together there is a sense of accomplishment that that that comes along with it whenever you whenever you cook something that actually it's gonna add value to the diet so do that for that person definitely in this somebody is saying that they've they're about to close 26 years together so congratulating yo Yolanda Yolanda congratulations 26 years did that is amazing especially in the Facebook world where you can update your status at the drop of a little click so congrats those are goals right there yeah so yeah so really really thrilled that people are loving the cooking

what is going on y'all and welcome back
to the fit men cook kitchen today we are getting our hands really dirty down and
busy in the kitchen cooking up some seafood that's right we are talking
about how to cook seafood in bulk for meal prep
I think the norm for everyone out there is just to season up your fish put it
onto a pan and stick it in the oven and when you're done don't get me wrong
there are tons of ways out there to cook sea food for meal prep but when we're
talking about cooking things in bulk we are trying to get in and out of the
kitchen as quickly as possible so because seafood is one of those
things that I feel like people I have generally mastered or got their own
rhythm down I'm going to spend the bulk of today's video answering some
frequently asked questions when it comes to seafood plus of course you know I'm
going to share some of my favorite ways to cook seafood in bulk for prep all
right we got a lot of stuff to cover today so let's roll up our sleeves okay
I roll up our sleeves at demands like dibs so let's roll up our sleeves and
let's get started before we happen to today's video when it comes to seafood I
want to make three quick points number one buy fresh seafood over frozen
seafood whenever possible back in the day when I first started out on my
journey I will go to Walmart and I would buy the eleven dollar blue box of frozen
tilapia what I began to notice was that with the frozen fish it began to break
apart much easier and there wasn't a lot of flavor to it
so with my own personal preference to buy fresh over frozen whenever possible
we don't really think about this but fish goes bad pretty quickly and because
of that is often offered at a discount at our supermarkets whenever you buy it
fresh if you're not eating seafood that week and you still see it on sale and
it's fresh I would recommend just going ahead and buying it anyway and then
freezing it and that way you have your own fresh frozen seafood that you can
enjoy whenever you're ready frozen foods in particular proteins tend to hold a
lot of water so once you defrost the fish you're going to want to lay out
some paper towels and place the fish on the paper towel and let a lot of that
water come out of it so again whenever possible buy fresh fish but if you can't
frozen as a viable option but just follow those steps number two deals with
storage cooked fish or cooked seafood can remain
fresh in the fridge for about three days now it's my own personal preference not
to allow anything any cooked seafood over two days in my fridge because I'm
very sensitive to smells and so I just think it kind of smells funny
so anything that I'm not going to eat within two days I'm only too free
the third point I want to make is about wild fish versus farm twist now this is
a huge debate right now within the healthy eating community now
scientifically there is no easy answer to this so I just can't tell you yes or
no because I think there are pros and cons on both sides and it genuinely does
come down to a personal preference nutritionally whenever you're looking at
the wild versus a farmed fish they are pretty much equivalent because of the
advancement of the feeds if they've been able to give the farmed fish so since
they're both to say nutritionally it really comes down to a personal
preference with things that you have to consider such as the environmental
impact how the fish are harvested food safety and also just a bottom line which
is your cause a big question I get is if farmed fish safe and this question
arrived because of the study that works that I think was back in 2004 early 2000
whereby they showed that farmed fish had a statistically significantly higher
number of contaminants than the wild caught fish however whenever you dive
into that statistic what you'll find is that even though they were higher in
contaminants the number of contaminants in the farmed fish was still lower than
the amount being to be dangerous for human consumption so technically the
fish is still deemed safe to eat when it comes to the topic of environmental
impact many people have concerns about the way that wild caught fish are
harvested there are oftentimes large machines that will disrupt the
surrounding ecosystem and and pollute the surrounding environment and so that
is a huge concern for many people this is not a blanket statement to say that
all wild caught fish are harvested in unsustainable ways and that are
negatively impacting the environment but it is a concern for many
and of course the bottom line here is cause oftentimes farm fish is offered at
much cheaper prices than the wild caught fish and so many people are forced to
make that decision based off of their budget and let me tell you there's
nothing wrong with that now I want to deal with some of the most common types
of fish for meal prep the fatty fish like salmon versus the white fish the
lean fish like cod orange roughy and tilapia first up is salmon this is a
beautiful wild cut piece of salmon right here omega-3 fatty acids is probably one
of the main reasons why people like to eat pre fruit particularly salmon
because salmon is really rich in it while salmon gets the omega-3 fatty
acids from feeding off the algae and the plankton whereas the farm-raised salmon
get it from the feed or many other feeds they are developing them now with a
little bit less fish meal and much more fish oil in order to make sure that have
enough of the omega-3 fatty acids in them so what you'll find is that on
average the farm-raised fish are fattier but the wild caught salmon have more
iron calcium and potassium now with that stuff out of the way let's
get down to cooking the salmon I always hear from people that salmon is too
fishy I ate salmon this is the reason why don't overcook your sin did you know
that the longer you cook salmon that this year is become the fat content and
the salmon allows it to tolerate a lot more heat without drying out so now I
cook it at about 420 degrees for no more than 15 minutes and it's perfect I will
say that that frozen packaged sandwich is a little bit fishy er on average in
my experience medium-rare is the best we want nice pink moist opaque center and
can you eat the skin off of salmon is the personal preference I personally
love to eat the skin off the salmon especially whenever I cook it in a
skillet and get it nice and crispy but many people don't like to eat it because
of the contaminant if salmon are swimming around and contaminated water
or they're feeding off of things that are contaminated then the toxins built
up in the skin and then that of that salmon now what you can do
with the Effie you bake it just slice off the skin and it'd be just fine
marinating is probably the best way to get rid of any fishy flavor from any
fish particularly the oily fish like salmon so here are two of my favorite
ways for salmon meal prep for the first salmon recipe we're going to make an
easy marinade with fresh orange juice or lemon or lime low-sodium soy si Racha
for a little heat and some ginger stir it all up then pour it in a zip plastic
bag then add the salmon filet close it tight and marinate for at least 30
minutes or overnight to lock in the flavor for the other fillet we're going
to add olive oil smoked paprika cumin and pepper rub in the seasonings and
cook it immediately add the police to a baking sheet with parchment paper or
foil to prevent sticking add orange slices a little pepper and the remaining
sauce to the marinated fillet bake for 10 to 12 minutes at 420 a red pepper to
the rubbed fillet and garnish with cilantro and lemons and to the orange
marinated fillet garnish with fresh mint to boost those flavors next up is white
fish I got some kada in this hand and some orange roughy in this one
cod is among the lightest tasting and one of the most affordable fish out
there when it comes to buying seafood in bowls for meal prep but orange roughy is
also an amazing viable option but oftentimes people have an adverse
reaction to using orange roughy like myself orange roughy is a very buttery
and very waxy type of fish is called an escolar at the risk of oversimplifying
this and TMI oftentimes our bodies can't digest the fat and waxes in escolar so
what we'll do is we will extract the fat and then we will excrete it so basically
I'm talking about anal leakage so I was eating orange roughy for about two weeks
straight when I went to the gym on this particular day I was sweating more so
than usual from the waist down fast-forward to that night
and then wait going to bed and then waking up in the morning time there was
a huge stain where my butt was that looked like vegetable oil let me tell
you what this was not it's not the best thing for a relationship but it's also a
good test to see if you're in the legend ship with the right person this is a
very common sight a second reaction for people whenever they eat escolar when it
comes to cooking white fish or lean fish it doesn't take that long because it's
super lean so I like to cook it on lower temperatures at around 400 and for the
same amount of time about 15 minutes or so definitely no more than 20 minutes
because I don't want to dry out fish often times I like to spray it with a
little bit of olive oil and then add in my spices and herbs to it so that way it
remains moist and flaky during the baking process now here are a few ways I
like to prepare white fish I love marinating with Greek yogurt
because it helps secure moistness especially to lean proteins that tend to
be dry plus it's an extra boost of protein add Greek yogurt to a plastic
bag then add garlic fresh dill lemon and pepper
add the fillets to cure the bag with no air and gently mash and mix it together
marinate for at least 30 minutes add the police to a baking sheet or baking rack
then bake for 12 to 15 minutes at 400 garnished with pepper dill and lemon
with orange roughy with one egg in a bowl then select your favorite nut I'll
be using pecans because they're much easier to crush up use a mallet or spoon
and mash the pecans of defeats add a dash of panko cumin and garlic mix it
together dips our fish in the a in the nipa con mixture place the fillet on a
baking sheet or baking rack and bake for 15 minutes at 400 garnish with parsley and lemon that's it
for today's video I hope that you all enjoyed it and I hope that I answered
some of your questions when it comes to cooking seafood in bulk if you like
videos like this I want you to smash that like button below and I also want
you to take this a few seconds out to share your favorite way to prep white
fish I cannot tell you how helpful comment sections are people like to
search the comments and they look for suggestions like yours they look for
user of you if you think about it that's one of the main reasons why we love some
of these online channels like Amazon so much because of the customer reviews so
I want you all just to take a few seconds out to share your meal prep tips
when it comes to prepping seafood interval so that way we can all learn
and grow together alright y'all when I thank y'all for watching
until next time keep it healthy but of course never ever boy Oh bye 
what up y'all and welcome back to the
fit men cook kitchen today's quickie recipe we are taking chicken and rice to
the next level by making a Moroccan inspired chicken and rice dish the thing
that I love about Moroccan food is the combination of sweet and savory it's not
uncommon to have a slow-cooked lamb just bathing in its own savory broth but
you've also gotten apricot you've got almonds you even have honey and so it's
a combination of all these different flavors that just bring the dish to life
with every single bite and that's what we're going to replicate today apologies
to all my Moroccan peeps out there yo I got mad love and respect for the culture
and the recipes but we're going to streamline the recipe today and make it
much more practical and accessible to everyone around the world by using some
very common spices and seasonings that hopefully you all have right now in your
pantry we're going to combine the nutty flavors of cumin
with the pungent peppery flavors of paprika
that sounds good and then we're going to offset all that with the sweet and
spiciness of allspice oh and that I mentioned about there with
some chickpeas too yeah buddy let's get started spray a skillet with
olive oil then add chunks of chicken breast let's cook until the outside is no
longer pink about six to eight minutes set the chicken aside and put the
skillet back on the heat add olive oil and dice right on you we're going to
cook the red onion for about three minutes then add basmati rice chickpeas
cumin paprika allspice and cayenne bloom everything together ensuring that the
rice and the chickpeas are covered in oil and seasoning pour in the chicken
stock and bring it to a boil we're going to toss in raisins to offset the
spiciness and then add the cooked chicken breast if desired sprinkle in
some cinnamon or add cinnamon sticks cover and cook for 18 to 20 minutes
until the rice has completely cooked season to taste with pea salt and pepper
and garnished with fresh parsley boom remember to check out fit men cook dot com to
