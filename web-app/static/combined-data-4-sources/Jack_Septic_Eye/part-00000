I've a load of time in that Faster melting would be good though There you go all the way All the way   Ok you are a room that definitely has These are just straight-up prawn suit fragments, and you know it's to the left of me? Power Cell charger fragment. There are 20 parts to the prawn suit!? Yes! Okay, okay, this is a very very important wreck. I need to write this one down Wait why are some two of 20 and other one was one of 4? Good idea Okay, I'm heading out cuz only a 30 seconds of oxygen left, and I I like to head out now Rather than be like I'll head out later. You know it'll be fine cuz fine call or later comes and then not fine That's what that's what ends up happening Jesus Pam down fella eat a Snickers William Okay when you take spore in this place quite quick quite quickie Dickie So how're you guys doing good? I'm now I'm doing fine Let some food earlier feeling good feeling great feeling happy. You know why cause the metal attitude man, goes a long way? What are you? Swim charge Vince those are pretty handy Okay, okay, okay, can I open up the big door? How are some chairs right when I already have that now okay come on come on Yes another entrance, this is what I wanted you In here and then no, what are you doing to me you go out there now? I have to play smart So if I have to leave and get to the ship, that's gonna save me At least I can get back here and figure out where I'm going This can you know Why didn't you Sign comes fire suppression system whoa I Don't think I ever had one of those did I I? Remember ooh nice Nutrient blocks very very handy. Oh, there's more over here stasis, rifle. I think I already got you. Oh No, I didn't I got one of them nice Okay was you I already got stuck. Okay. Oh shit my oxygen. Oh shit Oh shit no no no no no no no Those guys were having a bad time I am a 25% in this thing That is not good god Janus Christ You're a voracious eating machine aren't you Oh big big veiny boy? What a D to the ich bag okay, I'm here I'm ready to be saved oh Boy what are you doing there? Sir okay Okay, maybe he's just the docking procedure. Maybe he's here to help okay Do I look good turn okay? Do I look like someone who wants to be saved I? think so Okay, I'm ready okay. Hey take me in people give give me that good lovin. Give me that good save Survivor we see you man. I don't know how you held out down there We broke an atmosphere and we're descending towards the landing site where What do you mean your can identify it I'm over here There oh, yeah, everybody wait we're down here we're trapped It's coming from the building change course set thrusters before Well fuck You guys are so coming to get me right. I was just a decoy Nice oh no, oh no you get back here, no, you killed my friends I Mean we weren't friends yet, but we were about to be best friends You killed him I want answers Okay, I think that's alien speaker four go fuck yourself I am lucky that I got that Ruby when I did I Can't even remember now where I got it, but I remember looking at it and thinking yeah, I'm probably gonna need that Because it's gonna come in handy because now I have a Power Cell charger very very vital oh Thank god that okay that power cell has a hundred charger. Do I have any spare batteries? No, I didn't I did get copper or though to make more batteries to fill up that so Sally I need to change the the Power Cell that's in Sally now Do that here Boom now I can charge this one so Powered Power Cell charger and battery charger are two of the most important things to get starting off at least to me because Anything that mitigates the need to actually farm resources is really good so now that I have this I don't have to go out searching for all the materials needed to make a Power Cell anymore I could just pump them all in here and then bring the back out and now Afterwards I can dismantle this and I can put it inside the Cyclops whenever I make one of those and I had a great system Going at one point because I had a base in one of the areas that had its own power supply from Thermal, and then I had a firm inside that so I had never-ending power I had a water filtration system in it, so I had never-ending water I had never ending food on the Cyclops, then I had my battery charger and my power cell charger So I never ever needed to get anything for the Cyclops. I would just have it all in there They had a farm in my Cyclops at one point as well So everything was self-sustaining everything was just there, and I never the Cyclops was like my mobile base And I never ever had to look for anything ever again. I just lined the walls with lockers I had enough space to do whatever the hell I wanted so that's that's the goal again, but After I make a few batteries. We are heading to the Aurora. I do need to get back there I then you that's what I'm gonna get on my pron suit Materials and be able to build that because that's also a vital piece of Machinery That I need and I still need to be able to get a moon pool because they do have Pretty sure I have the blueprint for On a modification station or the vehicle upgrade console, this is something that I I need to put into my Moon pool whenever I get it because that's where your vehicles actually have to go up and lodge itself And then you're able to add all these different things to it put a water filtration system Aerogel I needed something that was near the Aurora to make aerogel I remember that last time Fire reactor I can actually almost make you right now But I don't need a bioreactor bioreactor is just using compost to make energy basically you can pass all your your foods and your organics and everything but I Don't need to because I have a solar panel on it. Okay have one more copper, or I just need one more shroom I Think we're stocked up stocked up geared up and ready to go. I know what you're thinking put Jack What about your water and food? They're topped up my health is topped up I have one two three four five waters ready to go I have three nutrient blocks and a cooked boomerang cook boomerangs gonna go first might not be able to eat him She may go off. I do need to dump some stuff though There's a good thing you spotted that was good thing that you call that I didn't see that myself so Oh shite Okay well, maybe get rid of the flares. I don't know if I'm ever gonna need flares Right we're gonna dump you all up in here. I can put one thing in craft wrap Definitely not gonna need the craft wrap probably not gonna need the rebreather either the Reaper Reaper either But let's see if I can actually put anything inside Henry Oh, I can Nice ok so we've all the space that we need I have a full Radiation suit on we're going to need that to get to the Aurora I also have full charge and all my equipment laser cutters full habitat builders not because I don't need that power and this is full The repair tool and my scanner doesn't actually need power Sally is also completely charged and completely fault We are ready. Okay. We are ready for the Aurora. There's nothing that can stand in our way That's going to stop us from being ready our positive Mental attitude is going to get us through this the only thing that's going to stop us is if a big old Reaper bitch starts to grab my face and wants to make out I'm not into that I really need to be brought to dinner first So I'm just gonna say no politely and hope that they respect my boundaries hairy fees I Don't think I need anything else to actually get into the Aurora it's been a long time since I've been here remember last time I came into the Aurora if You've watched the original series the last time I went into the Aurora it all Absolutely broke it Was completely broken I could not get in when I got in but I couldn't get out because the floor started to disappear Whole half of the Aurora disappeared floors walls everything I had to get into it I had to save and then I had to leave and Lots of stuff okay, I can't remember where the Reapers are there's one in the front, and there's one at the side Here one there's one around here somewhere. Oh, there is okay. We can avoid him by just going over here Oh Yeah, shame shame about that whole alien ecosystem. Yeah, you know stupid trying to kill me since I got here But yeah, we'll be nice women I Need a fire extinguisher That was the other thing. I needed probably also should have brought like a propulsion cannon Stasis rifles for these shitheads don't get me also probably should have brought a med kit Okay, so So you ate my teammates my crew my buddy buddies Let me put a bunch of bastards. That's all you guys are oh? Man I think there's not even segments that I can get past without the fire extinguisher Oh Fire extinguisher, baby, okay good I'm gonna need to I Do remember you need to to get through or maybe I just needed to to actually get every single little thing Okay Install that circuit box with that repulsion cannon and you'll punch a hole in the cargo bay damn it drone. I said propulsion not repulsion recalibrate sensors Sensors aren't the problem. I tweaked the program. It's like you know it doesn't like being told what to do But it really helped me do my job if you'd bring me what I asked for Safer maybe so but it's all that's stopping me from being so bored I take a spacewalk in my skivvies Hmm, let's go well I forgot I need a propulsion cannon as well because some areas that have like big blocks or big big Cargo things So here we are finally in open space we cross the galaxy to install a phase gate to send ships to mine resources to build more expensive ships to install fancier phase gates Yeah, so all terrorists thing was to spread their influence around the galaxy are we trying to exhaust the galaxy or just ourselves? use birthday weeks 40 weeks for Credit cells hairspray me not enough Here was this thing The old terror launches the Aurora phase gate announced for the Ariadne armed Altera launches the Aurora the furthest reaches of inhabited space are due to expand as Altair a-kor Launches a newly constructed capital ship carrying a phase gate bound for the Ariadne arm The Aurora will travel from a space stock on the edge of the Altair space making hundreds of consecutive phase gate jumps through nine different trans government authorities and arrive, it's hard to read when everything's shaken an arrive on the far side of the Ariadne armed in three months time from there the Command crew will pilot the ship beyond the final phase game arriving in the next solar system approximately 18 months later They're the elite team of engineers we'll begin a six-month construction project and the new phase game a Multi-trillion credit investment and the absence of existing infrastructure in the region the vessel is equipped with advanced thermal and nuclear power facilities all Terracor currently operates nine percent of all phase gates in the galaxy if the Aurora's mission is successful all Terra will have outmaneuvered a cabal of Mongolian corporations Operating a range of outposts and mines in the region mmm so the only reason the aurora was being sent out was to just make phase gates in areas and then they could expand further and go further and make more of them in mine different areas and just Get more materials for their company and all that kind of shit. You know boring stuff I Would like that poster please yes, thank you A command chair sure we're here and we're not really under any time constraints right now, so we might as well do that You are a fire. That's not worth wasting my fire extinguisher on All right, let's do a self scan just for the sake of it self scan complete Bacterial infection in your system is progressing detecting skin irritation and immune system response yup required to identify bacterial strain Yep, yep and this Was that that sounded weird this is where I need their propulsion cannon that I totally prepared earlier and didn't just Go back and make in a jump cut two seconds ago. Oh, happy day. Well one way or another I'm just glad we have it. I'm just I'm just glad we have it get out of it Okay, bacon progress So yeah, I went back and just made a propulsion cannon in between edits. Whatever. What are you gonna do sue me? Oh is this the the thing that I need or can I? weigh technically Technologies, okay, I need Aurora survivors codes and clues here. We go to six seven nine okay, man the frame rates. I could hear two six seven nine What Oh shit Cargo bay code one four five four More thing god, I thought I thought it was suck oh Yeah Here's the business right here. Okay, get that scanner out cuz we're about to start going to work We're about to scan up a storm, we're about to scan everything Oh Cyclops engine fragment I have that Cyclops whole fragments that's what we need psychotherapy sigh cuts all fragments Trans government profile on terror core Thanks, Susie one of the larger suppliers of spacefaring technologies and consumer electronics in the Federation the official supplier and the tsf consistently ranked Amongst the galaxy's best employers began life by Baba Although most trans groves can trace their roots back to earth Altera Literally meaning by earth is the only one brazen enough to take its name During the expansion all terrorists supplied arms to all sites acquiring and housing a vast colonists workforce and making the transition from manufacturer to corporate state Altera's threat to cease trade was one of the turning points in the Conflict bringing bringing about the end of the hostilities and the signing of the charter Free enterprise within all terrorists space is encouraged, but competition is tight and all goods exported offworld must be Altera branded Profitable businesses are bought out by the state owners ascending to the board of directors well-known Altera technologies like the Cyclops submersible originated with such private enterprises despite Superficial similarities to national governments the corporation's lawyers have have a blob of lava blasts And all this stuff expands upon the story, but I'm also on the clock here with supplies like food and shit So that's all stuff that I read later. I want I just want ok. Well that solves some of my food problem. Here's another thing fragment engine fragment I Want to keep progressing I want to keep getting stuff. I want to keep going forward I don't want to keep bugging the stuff down by just reading It's all stuff we can do at a later date Okay down here. We do have to use our repair tool. Eventually to start plugging up the holes from her the radiation was Let's need to be careful because all those little shits Are going around oh crap? Oh crap? Oh crap? Oh crap? Oh crap equip equipped? equip fuck's sake Are you doing to me, man, you're gonna get me killed Hey water yeah pick up the shit He stops breaking down here it's not working for me work with me game. Not against me another med kit I need Nutrient foods, that's all good. I prepared for that. That's the stuff I have That laser through that door at the dive room seemeth Bay what's down here? Battery Okay, this is one that I can open those little shits, so there's no tentacle bitches. Those are ones. I have to avoid I Need to take my night phone. I need a bigger hot pair I need more stuff to be able to go into my hot pair, please Boom Keep your eyes peeled okay, med kit, thank you, okay, I'm back and back to my surplus You video Mon man, I can't read that shit right now I'm on the clock here. What do you point to see a door? It's like no? What's something tickets busy splash over there? Okay, don't get lost Getting lost would be very bad keep an eye on where you are the prawn Bay yes I would like to get to the prawn babe. Please I heard they have nice seafood in their Use repair tool yeah, okay, I'm gonna put this in for number five cuz I don't need my seed lied right now I Love this one I love that it just like magically reverses time on it almost Yes This the shit me want This the shit meet me get afraid quench all the fucking fires of Hades, I guess Bran sued fragment, this is the good shit. This is why we got in here yeah You can I scan you from here yes That's a good boy Sure guys realize you have liquid fire on the roof It's kind of weird this should be the last prawn suit fragment Your, baby Fuck yes Acquired New blueprint awkward I think there was a section here before that I broke Not shocking. I have broken most of the game at this point This is using up a lot of power to do this as well, so I need to be careful. Okay come out Then you come out then One by one they piss me off for real well Okay, just climb just climb I don't have to waste energy on you. You don't need it. Oh God don't get stuck whatever you do There you go attaboy. You're a good big lad Living quarters, yeah This was the area so when I play the game first I came here all of the walls were all gone here But all the stuff that was in the rooms was all fine, so I was like okay How do I fix this so I had to save my game I feel like go in a bit save my game Reload the game when I reloaded all of this was here, but all of that was gone And then I couldn't get it back so I completely broke the game, so thankfully everything works Well now okay, you're giving me a lot of nutrient blocks and water. I feel like I should probably just Do that Nice okay good good good. What's in here a med kit? Okay? We're doing well The only other thing I need now is more fire extinguishers hopefully Most of this I can just avoid avoid the noise Hey today's space parable ooch Okay, this is literally just a menu. I'm not reading that I do need my keep cam Kitty poster and my fire extinguisher Keep Calm Kitty poster was an absolute most I was not going anywhere without that. That's a good menu It's mean anything in the corners that I need I mean I might as well just scan these when I'm here who knows later on I might want to make my My base look all nice with my cosmetics with the vending machine Break open the vending machine and seal all the food that's in it those are good snacks Those aren't very usable I think I could actually go with them very very nicely Okay So far this is going good pick up carry all no. I just want to open it can I open it I? Don't need it. Oh wait wait wait wait wait wasn't this a thing hold on Pick up carry all Okay nevermind. I thought it was a thing that I could shove stuff into ah somebody left their loved one Open storage there we go can I open the storage and you know? Open storage empty. That's the thing you can put stuff into it here So these are actually really useful because you can do that Way Bank is not empty cannot pick off What I thought that that was the point of them that you filled them up And then you put them in your inventory and they took up less space, but held a lot of items It's a bunch of boohockey. Oh, this is the one this is the one now, I needed this code for um Wait is it two six seven nine? Nope nevermind Okay got away from it Captain's Quarters. This is it Boo boo boo don't you go you got a tiny little Aurora miniature? That's adorable let me keep that oh you bet you bet your ass. I am Aurora poster yes Captain's Log You're exploring a quite alien backwater where the ship you arrived here in implodes It must be the arachnid kidney poachers quick. What will you do? Farm alien plants is apparently what they did that's just what Craig McGill would do after Foraging for some hours you have collected a number of potentially flammable Foodstuffs, which will you sustain yourself with adstar, Wallach, please? I'll this star wall eggs are nutritious the lifecycle of these vast space fearing creature is much too slow to Sustain a farm and besides their mother is extremely angry with you accept your fate Craig McGill knows there is no reasoning with a mother scorned you are not so much torn apart as swallowed whole and Disintegrated the atoms that you thought were you are gradually redistributed in service of the star walls continued survival Would you like to know more? Well, I thought there was gonna be an actual Captain's Log and not a fucking fanfiction Whoo that's a rocket The Neptune rocket there we go, baby Neptune escape rocket like a blueprint for time capsules this blueprint set was developed at Altera Headquarters specifically to get you off for five or six B and back to the nearest phase game it takes into account local gravity Astronomical data, and available resources and is piloted by AI it may be adapted to employ whatever power source is at the port Power source is available But it will require a lot of it it consists of five independently constructible elements launch platform Floating platform provides a solid base from which to launch the rocket gun tree provides structural support Stage one primary thrusters for reaching atmosphere escape velocity Stage two fuel reserve in stage three cockpit features one-person life support short range communications adaptable power supply orbital shielding on board time capsule Onboard AI will not launch if local threats are detected the use of alien materials to power the craft may increase its range in unpredictable ways so What happened was well what happened was? Me just give me scanner the ship that tried to save me the Sun beam came down put the planets in quarantine because as a Cure has not been found So what ended up happening was they shut them down because they don't need anybody else coming to the planet You're going to go say think that hmm maybe there's the ones that actually shut down the Aurora that we were going through space we got too close to this planet so the Aurora was shut down because they're like hey, we're in a quarantine We can't risk anybody getting here getting infected And then leaving the planet so they they shoot anything coming in and going out to stop the quarantine from spreading so my mission is to find a potential cure if I find the cure I can turn off the system in that alien base It was in last time where it stabbed my arm, and took my blood glucose and ketone levels and then We're sound and then I can build my Neptune rocket and then visa V we can get off the planet So that's our mission. That's that's our goal of the whole game right now This is it the drive room Like I love to dive room earlier No stupid, okay. I need to repair this area. This is where all that radiation is leaking from Cyclops enter engine efficiency Hmm okay, I'm gonna drink a water soy free up some space cuz this goes in my Cyclops and makes it run better so as long as I'm smart about this, and I keep my knife out and then start taking some med kits I Should be okay This room is full of little shit bags. Just everywhere. They're laying all over the place Okay nine more breaches most of which are under water, so Let's get to it keep moving keep moving how did it hurt it hurt to plate a moving target? I? See you Got him haha get rekt little shitbag oh Oh, oh don't like them even little shits They're fucking everywhere oh god I Just saw like fucking seven of them. Oh oh I got the heebies Didn't want them the jeebies were enough before Okay, just go to Scott Scott Scott Scott. Okay. He didn't do enough. He didn't really do much damage to me. It's just they're freaky The only reason they don't like them because they scare me okay There's only four after this one. Oh I see one Nice nice nice and then after these are Secured then we be able to go anywhere with the rebreather. I won't need my Yes, I do I won't need my radiation suit anymore Which is a big win for me last one last one last one? I saw this is the one I started Ning got scared boom Extinction event avoided wait would that actually happen Wait could you actually create an extinction event in the game? That'll be pretty cool Not for me boy. I Didn't know that that was actually a possibility, but it actually have counted down or something then after that Anything over here, man. I came all the way over here for nothing All right, that's the main thing that I wanted to get done inside the the Aurora The bronze suit and this and you can get some seamoth fragments and stuff, but all the other shit, that's in here I have and I don't need anymore Hey, is there anything else I can scan You can scan the breach Fuck off me get note Waters back don't go in the water and kill you okay? I'm gonna Drink water because I just got a seemeth Depth module mark 1. I don't even have to make it Oh Excellent Cool I hope there's nothing else in the Aurora that I'm missing I Got a thing for the Cyclops, but I still need to find all the Cyclops parts I think I know where to find them I think they're actually outside the Aurora because I found one out there as I was going around these places So what I what I was saying is that I needed to make the vehicle upgrade Bay because I wanted to put a Upgrade module into the seamoth so I could dive deeper with it and go to different places But now I actually just found one so I don't need to do that ah excellent. I'm so happy This is gonna be good that was it that was a good mission. It was good mission um Kind of on my way out should I've searched more I don't know I coulda just wanna leave them scared well too late now I am out ebuy bitches all hi fella boom have fun in the cosmos bitch I Don't need any of your sass and you are in fact. I'm not even taking the proper route out I'm taking the backdoor, baby. All right here. We go seamoth access upgrades and then Where's the seamoth ethereal yes now we can go to 300 meters in Sally She's not limited anymore. She's a big girl. She's ready to do the business. Okay. Well. I'm gonna leave this episode here That was a long one at least for me. That was a long session, but we got a lot of great stuff done I'm so happy that we got into the Aurora now in this episode. We are making Leaps and bounds of progress right now We are we're accelerating very very fast through this mainly because I know what I'm doing and I'm a smart cookie and I Know kind of know where the parts are and I know what bits and pieces. I need to progress Next because I have a lot of elements for the the Cyclops already. I have the full engine blueprint I have one part of the whole and I want part of the bridge, and I think that's all I need um It's somewhere down here Okay, yeah, so Cyclops. I just need one So I need two more hold blueprints and one or two more bridge blueprints And I think they're back that way in the mushroom forest at least some person right that's where I found them already So we're going to explore that next time and hopefully we get Maria back Or we'll have her in the next episode as well, but I'm just very glad that we got through their oaths with you Oh, we saw our Sun beam Go down, but I'm very very happy that we got a Power Cell God, sorry No I'm very happy that we got a Power Cell charger going as well I might start expanding my base a small bit and putting in some extra stuff and trying to get a water filtration System going so I don't have to worry about that anymore But I usually because this is this space isn't staying. I'm not keeping this base I'm gonna take apart this and move it somewhere else, and I usually like to move it over in that direction because over here is where Some of the later game stuff is gonna start happening, so god. Sorry stop walking into my ship. I'm gonna have to Build my base over there later on but I might just make two bases. It's not that hard to make this stuff It just needs a lot of titanium. Oh anyway Thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face like a boss and high fives all round. Woopsh! Woopsh! Well thank you guys and I'll see all you dudes IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!! God, sometimes they're just going to like analysis mode, but and Forget to like talk properly, but I'm having so much fun doing this 
*Whapoosh* Top of the morning to ya laddies! My name is Jacksepticeye and welcome back to pain, misery, agony, my destruction. Also known by everybody else on the planet as Cuphead. So, last time I got some upgrades, we defeated the big candy lady-- that BIIIIIG asshole-- She SUCKED! Well, all of them suck. They're all terrible, but *chuckles* she sucked the most, even though she probably shouldn't have because she wasn't that hard. And that's my problem with this game, is that the bosses, they're not that hard, but can I do it? Nooooooo! So, we're moving on. I got some upgrades. I now have the horseshoe thing. Oh look at you, all cute. "You can't catch me unless you take a shortcut." "That's what some punk kids did last week!" "It's the only way they could have beaten me to the rides!" "Say, maybe you could show me where the shortcut is around here...?" Is-- Is this it? Oh, the shop's right here. Okay. Cool! Is that a balloon tree? I don't know what's going on. This is a big-ass area. Oh, are you Mausoleum 2? Ooh! "So you have spoken with Quadratus, the watery being across the isle?" "That is something few others can claim." D-Did I? Did I--I don't think I did. Oh, I know who's in there. I-I see that tail! I know what boss that is. Yeah, so now we have the roundabout shot. Jumbo rebound. Somebody said that the pea shooter, the regular ol' clicky-click that I have, is actually really good, you just have to land your shots. And that the spread shot is only good for dealing with a lot of little enemies. If you want to actually kill bosses with it, you have to get very close, and then it's not worth it. Mausoleum 2. The last one I did of these was just ghosts. All I had to do is bounce off their heads, and then I got a super shot. *in-game announcer:* Good day for a swell battle! Now, go! *Jack:* Is this the same thing again? Okay, I gotta be better about this though, because it seems like they're gonna start coming pretty fast! Haha!! The fucking double booper! That's why they call me Boopy Doop-- Don'tcha know? Ha, die ghosts. I'mma kill you, see? So now we have this thing, That there's a lot of dams-- Whoa, holy fuck! Okay, don't shoot, 'cause that's confusing me. *sings along with soundtrack* Music's fuckin' awesome! Oh, shit. HA! TAKE THAT! Aw, fuck. This is gonna get confusing! Can we be over yet? Uh-oh. Ah, shhhhhit-balls, man! *laughs* What is happening? No more. No more. Let that be the end of it! YES! Oh, shit, I ran into my chair. *laughs* Fuck you, chair! Get out of here, this is MY victory! "I knew if I rooted around here I could find something special for you!" "But I didn't know I'd get trapped again!" "Thanks for saving me a second time." "Take this Magical Super Art and I'll see if I can find you another!" Okay, do we- do we have a second super now? "You unlocked a new super!" Sweet, what is it? So, "Super Art 1 - Energy Beam. A devastating attack spills from your head. Horizontal only (ground or air)." "Invincibility. Cross the astral plane to become invulnerable for a short time." Ooh, that's really good. Especially for some bosses, that would be really fucking good, but now it's a case of: Do I sacrifice power to be able to come invincible and then do regular attacks? Is-- Will that-- Is that enough to offset the amount of damage I'd be doing normally? Very curious. I'm like that guy right now. 
'Hmm, I wonder.' Okay, I'm--I'm basically just stalling right now, so I don't have to fight any more bosses, so-- What's next? 'Aviary Action! Wally Warbles.' Okay, maybe not yet. Maybe I should go back and fight Beppi? And I don't know what this one is. Haven't tried this one. 'Pyramid Peril. Djimmi The Great.' Okay, let's try Djimmi The Great. Let's see how good this horseshoe is. Whoaaaaaaaaaa! Oh, this is a fucking plane one? Ah, shit. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh! Stop it! Stop it! I fuckin' hate this. I hate this. I'm already almost dead. Uh, what? Oh! Fuck you! "You really didn't stack up." Okay. I got past the first round. Oh, it's showin' a little Cuphead, kind of dead. Fuck these cats! Ha-ha-ha! Okay, give me this one. Nice! One less to worry about on screen at least! That-That's just bullshit! It just comes off-screen! How am I supposed to deal with that garbage? Okay, is it the middle one that--? Is it this? Okay. Okay. Okay! *laughs humorlessly* Why? I don't get it! I don't--I don't--I don't get it! What am I supposed to be doing?? Oh, one of you is killable! The face is killable! Ahhh, okay! I literally had nowhere to go! There was no gap. Ah, well, there was a tiny one, but-- It's not fair! Okay, okay, okay. This phase I think I have down by now, as long as I remember that he sends out that thing. 'Cause that was what was killing me in the Hilda Berg phase, I kept forgetting that she sent out the laugh. Agh! Okay. Hit faces! Here we go. *mocks in-game laugh* Fuck you! Son of a bitch! Oh! Take it easy, Jack! Okay. Well, I've one hit, but we're further than we've ever been. Ah, he's back. What- wh- why? What- what the fuck you doing? What is this? Oh, Jesus! Stop it! Oh, fuck, fuck--ahh! Hit him! Hit him! Fuck him up! Can we--Can we stop this? Can--Oh, thank God! *blows raspberry* That's the sound m-my airplane's making right now. I don't get it! I don't get it! I don't get it! I don't like it! I don't like it! Pinocchio, go away! *yelps* Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck--Come on! This is horse shit! Not a fan of this one! Don't like it! Don't like it.
I feel like I just got lucky for that whole section. D-- D-- That's new! What--Why? Why?! That's such asshole design! I was finally getting used to it! An' now you're throwing something completely new at me? Why?? I was nice! Okay, they keep just fuckin' spawning. If the faces could be on the bottom every time that would be fuckin' mucho grande! It's the fact that I can still hit those poles as well, as I'm going through. I'm not being as precise as I could be. Now it's something different!! Hi! Gettin' to Pinocchio again, this time with two hits! That's a good sign. It's good. It's very- it's very nice. I like it. There's just a lot of shit to dodge that I fuckin' hate! 'Kay, it's all about movin'. It's all about staying moving! Da--fuck! Let's do this! BOOM, bitch! How you like them apples, huh? Yeah, get lost! Oh, Jesus, now he's giant! I don't know, I don't know what I'm doing. What's- What's killable? Oh, what the fuck? *sighs* 'Kay. I hate this. I hate this! How far did I get? NO-HO! NO! NO-HO-HO-HO-HO! *shrieks* LOOK AT THAT! Oh, you big sack of spuds! Oh, wait, I've lobby bombs! I forgot that I got something new for this! Ah, Christ. Do these do more damage? Oh, my God. Yeah, they do! I have lobby bombs! I forgot about that. The dude gave me new ones. Okay, I don't know if it'll actually help me for this one. Agh! Shit, that was stupid. Shouldn't have taken a hit there. "That beating was for free -- no strings attached!" *laughter turns into crying* I wanna go home! Okay! Going into the last section with all of my health! Wait, I need to do this. Need to get rid of this fuck as fast as I can. Come on! Come on--Yes! I did it without gettin' hit at all! Perfect run! Ha-- How? How? How? *cackles* Oh, that's a perfect fuckin' score right there! *whooping* Oh, my God! Couldn't beat it a bunch of times, couldn't even get through the first phase without taking hits, and then all of a sudden you do it perfectly! *imitates in-game singing:* Cuphead! Oh, take that Djimmi, you great cock. All right, let's go fight Beppi the Bitch. Okay, I have my horseshoe thing for this. I don't know how that-- How that's really gonna help me, but-- Agh! Okay, I need--I need some practice. I need to remember my dodge, my--not having my dodge last time was the thing that was kind of fuckin' me up. Ah, shit! 'Cause I kept forgetting that I had a dodge, and then I wasn't using my dodge and shit like that, so-- 'Kay, just fire a bunch of this shit all over the screen. Nice! Nice, nice, nice, nice. Fuck you! COCK! That's only the second phase! *in-game announcer:* Good day for a swell battle! *Jack:* Good day for--fuck off. Okay, it's this fucking train that annoys me more than anything. I never know how to deal with it. Especially with all these fucking dogs comin' all over the place. I just-- I don't know. I never know! Horseshoe helps a lot, though. 'Cause there's just stuff flying on screen all the time now, which I am a mighty big fan of. What did I hit? *groans* I can't--I can't with this fuckin' train. I can't! 'Cause it changes the whole environment-- It changes how the whole fight plays out! Fuck him up. Fuck him up. Oh, the dodge! That dodge is so nice! I love my dodge, okay? If I can time out the train properly, it's really nice. Man-- I can do it! I can do it! I'm feelin' it! Feelin' good about it. Just need to stay on top of things. Just need to stay on top of things-- 'Stay on top of things' does not mean gettin' hit! Okay, what is this? What is this? I haven't seen this phase before. Uh. Fuck, now I'm really worried. What is happening? Oh God--Can I stand on them? Okay, I can stand on them. That's good. And I'm constantly hitting at the same time. That's also very good. Fuck you! No! Oh, I got halfway towards the end! I can do it! It is possible! It's possible to do great things! This first phase, I fuckin' annihilate him every time now. I just destroy him! Which is very good! It's this section that I take stupid damage in. Man, this section is just-- This section is the worst! I'm dead. Oh, God, how did I avoid that? I didn't. That section--By far my most hated section. Because it's really hard to judge where you're going, especially with the ground moving all over the place. Okay, going into the last section, still with two hits left. It's--It's definitely doable! I got this. I got this. Oh, God, what now? Oh, God! Oh, get fucked, game! GET FUCKED! Come on! Come on! D--Oh, no! No! NO! NO!! NO!!! A'ight, bitch, let's fuckin' do this. I see the game you're playing. I pick up what you're puttin' down. Fuck. Fuck! Aw, shit. Aw, shit. YES!! Ohhh, take that, Beppi, ya bitch! *strained laughter* Ohh, Mama! Oh! *cackles* Oh, that makes me feel good! *laughs* A B! That's not too bad! Two minutes, Jesus. God bless that horseshoe attack! God bless it! My Jesus. Beppi the clown, down for the count. What else've we got over in this direction? Oh, that was just that guy. Wait, how many times have I actually died now? Let me know 118 times. That's a lot of deathers. That--That a lot of the die-dies. Oh, we actually got a normal level here. Oh, God. What are you saying? "Well, hey there, fellas! Come to watch my little show, have you?" "They say juggling is a bit like parrying." "Though at first but-" Oh! "Tough at first, but soon you can string them together swimmingly!" "I'm hoping to get to four someday." "Four in a row... yeah. That would be something, wouldn't it?" Sure would, my friend. Oh, let's try the level. "Funhouse Frazzle." Uh, what? Uh, what?? Oh, I don't like /this./ Oh, Jesus! Fuck! Don't like this at all. Jesus Christ! Am I safe? That c- Ahhhhh, that fuckin' delay! What bullshit! The delay between when you actually hit the thing and then when you go upside down. Oh, my God, I didn't even make it--You know what? You know what? I've had enough. For today. It's been a nice little hour of trying this. Just gonna take it easy, appreciate my health, take a break. *chuckles* But anyway-- Thank you guys so much for Cuphead-ing with me this time. If you LIKED it-- PUNCH that like button in the face, LIKE A BOSS! And-- High-fives all 'round-- *WAPOOSH* *WAPOOSH* Thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes-- in the next video!! * "I'm Everywhere" by Technoaxe" * Getting better. Not great, but better!

Surprisingly, NASA said that we all only have 60 seconds left to live. Before the earth is destroyed What did I just say? I only have 60 seconds more to live damn it? I just became a news anchor today. It took me 20 years to get this position Whatever, I don't care about my whole career of live broadcasting anymore Okay fuck life YAAAAAAAAAY! My home oh Man the world is already over for me if this is the house I'm living in What? Is that true that Earth is going to be destroyed? I can't believe it What should I do for the rest of my life with only 60 freakin seconds left? Is it okay to do anything that I want to do even if it is illegal Nani, what about planting an apple tree damn it? They don't even have enough time to think about it.

What is this exactly heaven is this it? You're done. Please wake up. Ah Where is this it was all a virtual reality You just had a personality diagnostic test which involved virtual reality programming so far huh virtual reality So the earth has not been destroyed you lied to me doctor That's right our latest technology is just like the movie matrix remember that hip new happenin movie It allows you to experience a virtual life in a short time by analyzing, but sorry Analyzing analyzing is home. We study stuff inside your ass It helps us to know the person's true character. Well actually I should also tell you that Your family also watches the screen together Oh? God my family uh watch me kiss everybody mom my girlfriend ji-hyun Okay am I five years old nephew, are you all watching me? Son why did you kiss those men?

I support you mom has got that one That's the matter what I went around kissing mom I also kissed some dogs they have a problem with that I just had a good time. I destroyed the case as much as I possibly could so You were gay it must have been difficult trying to hide it you should have told me earlier then I would not have wasted my time on you by I'm not not gay. Not straight. I'm not I was there, but I had nothing to do with sexual orientation Cataclysm was above me. I just had to kiss as many things as I saw a kid. I kissed dogs This is no one claiming that I'm into dogs I'll go it's so great. Is it so great kissing guys. I'm curious. Oh God. He multiplied That's my mitosis. Nephew is this how it work like this bow Lick lick lick lick lick lick lick mother record hey all set to put me tell you in the mouths of kindergarten boys tomorrow Can we can we can we cut it?

Give me that baseball buddy fuck everybody Yeah, yeah making fun of me when I was a kid huh Oh? Fine oh no. Oh geez I'm sorry well not really cuz this is what I want This is how the world ends I? Can't be sad and the meteor can't kill me if I've killed everything else first Kill the military man, man you guys go no quick I'm just shooting lemons at them. That's all it is You've got a nuclear receiver What oh Sweet oh sweet Jesus Oh When I was nice ah You see, that's how you'd survive Being killed by a giant meteor coming down to destroy the earth you destroy it first humanity's doing a good job of that on their own already so ah Well, what did you think family? You guys you guys good son I think it was a good idea to take this personality that test They agree wouldn't it be a good idea to isolate him from our society. I'm sure saying He's the type of person to afflict people around him when he's going through hardship. He's moving about to kill every human being that's crazy Since I'm gonna die anyway in the future. Did you think it right to die all together? My god this nephew has a great outlook um the things that I do know Later knife oh, I will make die with me just like you all go Okay before you start going around hurling dynamite anything who gave the baby dynamite He's fine Who gave the baby the dynamite? Yet, maybe you should learn to speak proper full sentences first before you go around swinging that around I Did Co suicide ending to the ending list? Fair enough you know sometimes I think to myself Just how scary it would be if a meteor was actually going to come down and kill us all I mean if you only had 60 seconds to live But then I also think Wife can't be that bad when you're listening to a sick song like that Everybody you'd perk up if just play that song when everyone's getting ready to die See this is great music For this one I'm just going to hang around and do nothing can I go back inside my house? Oh? I want to go back indoors. I don't like this Just gonna hide out into finance for these 60 seconds Is all I'm doing I don't care me you're gonna come kill me who gives a shit, it's just this Times up everybody time to die all together boom wiped out just like a death stare I Think I used my last 60 seconds. Well I Contemplated. I went over in my head where I was like To just be alive thinking about the birds and the trees and Also, thinking about meatballs and pizza. This is a good life. Let's do my family thing. Hey fam. How's it going? Did you all watch me that's my son? What I'm so proud of you. I would have been very disappointed if you hadn't turned harm to others I Was so relieved my darling look at my tiny arms come give me a tiny armed hug Just because my head is way too big for my body and one swift breeze would break my own neck. That's okay Hahaha. Give me a hug I think it is better to do nothing in that situation said the boring-ass If I were you I would have stayed put and know nothing to harm others to just what I'd expect from my boyfriend Taking the personality test. It's a good idea Mommy my nephew got nothing to say today my nephew got no like Existential wit he ain't got no prolific Prophecy thoughts to give out to me today Oh Boring Damon let's see what else I can do in 60 seconds there must be some other shit in this game that I can do Whoa?

*WHAPOOOSH* Top of the Mornin' To Ya Laddies My name is Jacksepticeye, and Welcome back to Cuphead, the world's slowest moving, most arduous game that has ever existed. Wait, what is this? "Perilous Piers" Oh, yeah, I couldn't do that one could I-
 Hi turtle friend! ( he's making friends) "You boys think your situation is a multi-color mess, don't you?" "Well, what if I told you there was a way to see it in shades of gray?" "A way that only a pacifist platformer would be able to perceive?" "Would you violent little mugs believe me if I told you that?" "I wonder." Yeah so there's a pacifist run that you can do in this game, and I don't think it works on bosses I think it's more the run and gun levels so when you go through it You can like dodge all the enemies that are in it. Just get to the end of level I'm not sure fully though. ouhh who are you? "Cala Maria - High Seas Hi-jinx!" I've seen this one. That's a plain one because she's the mermaid lady, right? Can I not go down in there? ( apparently not) Ahh, ballsarooney. ( good one jackaboy)....*looks very confused* I got a coin! I went around clicking 'A' on everything just to see if I could open up a thing That is a fork dude down there Man, I don't know what I'm doing, except I'm stalling because I don't want to have to fight these fuckers Because the next one is the bumbleBeE ( He knows what hell is) There's some fuckin SWEET jazz that's going on. *imitates jazzmusic* Oh, I like that the bumblebee's level is actually vertical in appearance. I forgot what weapons I have equipped *contemplates life* What do I have equipped? Okay, I have "The lobber". Lobber's good, lobber's great. What does that do? What does that do? What is-WHAT IS THAT? Oh Jesus. Okay, okay Aahh, fuck! *SCREAMS* Okay, we'll use this as- as a learning round You know, we won't defeat him just yet We'll just learn what he's all about this time. ( tell yourself that) Wait, I thought I was fighting the bumblebee lady? Who are you? Okay one down. That's fine. I can do the rest, NO PROBLEM....( you cant) Okay, she's comin' down over there What's up? oh god, oh god OHHHH GOD.. OHHH SPINNY TRIANGLE WOOOOH!! Oh jesus, is that gonna kill me? AHH yes it is. How far did I get? OH, LOOK! I almost got to the end! Ha ha. "Hey sugar, this honey is off limits. Now scram!" *imitates game*  (you okay jack?) That's that's how I sound when I'm playing Cup head all the time. *Imitates game*
Oy oy oy *laughs*
He's cool 'kay, wait for it Ah, shit! *laughs* Go away chair (#chairlivesmatter) I was too busy looking at the thing and waiting for when that was gonna fire that I forgot to like pay attention to him....mhm ok Okay, not so bad. oy oy oy. God, it's hard to hit him Where am I? Okay, I'm all the way up here *chuckles* Oh god I can't even fuckin see wh-- AH SHIT! Oh, no! I took damage when I wasn't supposed to! *says "Uh oh" repetedly with different intonation* Okay, this is all going fucking terribly bad for me Okay there we go, there we go. That's what I needed. Don't hit me don't hit me don't hit me please. Where are you coming down? Oh hi What the fuck? What's happening? Oh Jesus, oh god. I don't like this! What?? That was different! MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Not a fan of that Okay, I might need to change my weapon 'cause the lobber is great, the lobber is fanTASTIC for 
this fight, But it's not really good it on its own. I kinda- I kiNDA NEED MORE GOING ON PLEEEEEASE! Okay, that was good. That was a good round. I like 
that one. Right, what's happening? What are you doing this time? Are you doing the head thing again? Okay no, you're doing this And this was very hard because you have spinny triangles that do a lot of dam-dams Wait, the triangles themselves don't actually hit me Ahhh, that's much easier *laughs* Oh, what is this? This is new Ah, shit shit, stop! I don't like new things! *same tho* Why you do this me N OWWWWWWWWWW? Okay I'm fine, 'm fine. Kill her. Kill her. okay. I can actually- ow fuck! Wait, does that hit me? *yells* JUMPED INTO IT! Okay, this is bothersome. There's a lot going on. It's not too bad yet though. A lot of it is very repetitive, so it's just a case of... Getting decent at it. Like that. I don't even know what this! It's fucking freaking me out. OH God, don't fall off! What are you doing now? (Honeybottoms are you okay) I- I'd-. What the...? WAIT FOR IT  What the fuck? I don't know what's happening She's a plane and she's firing hands at me Ah shit, I didn't know she was that close. Oh god. Oh, no. That was the last one! OH! Oh no! *sad Jackaboi is sad* "Dominate and bombinate, that's how I bee." Awwh. I want to be the person who comes up with those lines( "fuck,fuck,fuck") You know what? This isn't that bad It's only been a few attempts, and I've already gotten to the last phase so... Oh god. Oh god. I forgot that that's what that did. Oh, no, I forgot that- I keep fucking forgetting that I can jump down. I hate this game. I don't really though, I fucking love it but... my god, does it love to tast(e)- test my patience. *Frencais Jacques* He's dead. I love it when things die! NOT MEE! *AnGeRy JaCkAbOi* You know what? you know what? you know what? *takes off jacket*  *heavy breathing* It's getting fucking warm in here. *Jack plz you're already hot enough ;)* It's time to- hold on hold on. The fan is on, it's ready to do it! Woo, let's fucking go buddy boy. I had nowhere to go. I couldn't jump up to the 
next platform. Oh can I parry them? Ooooooohh Oh my god, I can parry them. I didn't know that. oh Jesus, I can't even see them half the- Come on! I didn't even fucking know there was a platform up there. WHAT IS THIS? (it's Cuphead) Why are you able to stand on platforms that you 
can't see?? This is dumb! 'kay, she's doing the plane thing I thought I'd at least get a fucking chance. Okay, don't take stupid hits jack You can survive all of this. It's not even that hard Just stop being a fucking fruit roll-up  
*childhood intensifies* I'm gonna change up my shots a small bit. I want to see if... if my my regular horseshoes are actually gonna be of any use in the later phases. The lobber is great for this one, Because he lands in that perfect trajectory -whoa... to just be able to spam him in the face. And not only is the lobber GREAT for hitting him, it's does a shit ton of damage. Which in some scenarios is even better. Okay, okay, bring it on! Bring it on you fucking bee! Okay, if we're just going to be doing regular damage then I might as well be doing the most that I can. Oh god, there's no fucking platforms Ahhh, I fucking dodged too far What?! It's not even on the fucking screen anymore, and I'm 
still getting hit by it Uughhhh... just- just fucking end me. Just end me! *yelling* What're you doing- What're you looking through your fucking pages for? You looking through the yellow pages, trying to find a doctor 'cause I'm fucking you up? I thought so. Okay, I need to- Oh jesus, what the fuck is that? Oh, please hit, please hit, please hit. I'm gonna die, I'm gonna fucking die! *scream of frustration* Don't land IN THE SOUP! *various noises of frustration* Please please please please. Every time! It's always the same. I get into a fight, I do well for a couple of rounds, and I think 'oh it's not gonna be that bad' And then 'What was everyone complaining about?' and then, half hour later, and I still haven't done it The only thing that's pissing me off about this fight is the platforms. Not- not landing on- Ow... Not landing on the platforms, that's not so bad. It's the platforms that render above where the character is ah shit, I'm not fucking paying attention now So I can jump up and land on platforms, and then the enemy balls and everything can go up into areas that I can't even see as a player. There's a point where hard based on skill ends, and just being obnoxious starts. And now I'm just getting annoyed 'cause I've gotten so close to the end like four times now, and I still can't do it. Come on! No. No. No. Don't you fucking dare. Don't you dare. Don't you dare. YES!! OOOOOHH (guys i don't think she's okay this time) OOH!! THE FUCKING WORST! I hated that. I hated every fucking minute of that! *woops* wait that only tooK YOU UNDER TWO MINUTES Oh Yeah! Oh fuck That was the worst fight. All the other fights- wait for it *triumphantly*
Cuphead! The other fights, I get kind of frustrated with 'cause I get bad at it, and I keep dying from my own stupidity And it's not that the game had been unfair, there's a couple of little shitty moments in some of the bosses here and there. That one, was just garbage! That was just shit from start to finish, but we're past it and I never have to do it again "That Wolfgang, always taking ten notes to express two notes' worth of music." "He has no conception of what I mean by 'less is more'." Know you agree with me go convinced that in a tin ear clock. He won't listen to me anymore but Doctor calls robot don't care joy. Okay? Oh Cool it's a plain one Where do I hit you okay? No, Jesus. No. What the fuck. What's up? What the fuck? Oh? My god. There's so much going on This is fucking this is horrible I Can't even shoot through the beam oh god. Oh god. Oh, god sup sup sup sup sup sup sup Jesus Christ This is hard okay, he's a hole in his chest. That's good For me hitting warm him I don't fucking know I was gonna do this cuz I don't know what's happening Oh God are we hit next we're hit next what's the next bang bang? Lately laser head Oh God magnets magnets oh, I can't touch him her present yet What I Didn't even get past phase one. I didn't even move What What the fuck is this This is this is torture Come on you fuck There's no point. I'm not a hope of finishing. Okay, so fuck I should bait the laser, right She bait the laser to firing down each time like That Fighting all sorts of shit Here we go ah stop it. There's too much shit on screen I'm just a little boy, let me alone For sake for fuck's sake Well, then that's it is this a trick Are you just shitting me with this? I don't know what's happening This is a joke is it pooped okay, and destroyed all three things. I never hurts to hit Fuck me, please use a laser anymore Cuz some of these a nice big cake Is that booked am I seeing a buged game right now Objective complete targets crap is I I'm not moving at all Hey his hurt sir I forgot a head little lovey bombs dude Could've been using this all the time, okay, what's next is that seriously just phase one This there's no fucking way game has to be booked I Don't know what's happening, dude Am I am I am.

So Ludwig's been filling your mugs with his less-is-more dribbling Keep talking to that fool and so nothing will sound right to you. Don't say I didn't warn you Okay, mister, but who are you? Oh? All that's left now we're running good levels, and then there's two other Things actually you know what we should try a running gun level for now right I'll at least try it and see what happens. Oh, I didn't change my weapons Oh Wow that's interesting oh the dancin fire Oh God Oh God whoa Just just get me through just get me through so I'm trying to blow me off bitch Could you die you will never best a bluff Persevere a peak or curve a cliff. Just give up now, okay? I'm not gonna give up now, but I'm going to change my weapons. I think I'll just go with my rigs Just shoot some peas on the rigs, you know I mean dog.

I know I can parry them, but I keep fucking missing it Okay, bye, I don't know who those guys were no Jesus mr.. Tumnus get out of here Okay, I just killed the door. I'm very happy about that very happy about the things that are dying in front of me right now I'm going I'm going. I don't give a fuck Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay?

Yep dumbass Here we go there we go there we go Okay This was the bullshit I May even able to do anything to him oh God oh god. Oh god. Oh god I? Don't want the coin. I don't care.

Good e goody gumdrops. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good now I should have enough coins should have enough coins to be able to get a new shot Nice because a lot of bosses, that's who are you? Werner Berman or Verner vermin Marine Corps I Don't know who you are. Let's be honest fellows. Shall we there's a class of grade-a people, and then there is well Everyone else at the moment you seem like Everyone else and that means you cannot experience the world and especially how you do Fuck you, dude pork rinds Emporium. I want to go in and get me a charge a shot welcome Goodbye Hi Thanks mister That should come in real handy. I don't know who's next So I'm not gonna change myself And we have a new mausoleum to do but for now I'm gonna leave this episode here feeling very good after that one Those had to be two of the most Bullshit hiest fights around the robot wasn't so much bullshit The the B boss I still consider to be the most bullshit boss in the game so far the other ones were difficult But manageable they were difficult in the sense that I had to dodge a lot of stuff And if I died it was under my own fault, but the P poss was just poorly designed again You should never have stuff outside the players Wherewithal ever ever in any game ever you shouldn't be able to be outside the screen where the camera can't see you and still be Able to get hit by stuff, that's just bad, right anyway IRA I'm looking forward to seeing what's next I think we'll have like I think there's like two episodes left (3) And well depending on how hard the rest of this stuff might be but I always want to at least beat one level or at least beat one boss per video I'm trying to aim for two bosses per video Or as least boss on a level sometimes is not always possible sometimes my patience runs very very thin like some malnourished people in the hospital Patience run thin alright.

neighbor has a friendly mode I know what that does it's a friendly mode I'm friendly I'm a friendly guy oh maybe we could actually just be friends together so no one told you life was gonna be this

oh god his shark is back that's the whale I heard earlier whales are sharks right ah so do I have to change the water so I can get across this Jesus that guy's just fuckin goin isn't he Oh Yogi Bear see you got on peoples nerves you kept saying who you could provide for us for us and then everyone's like yogi shut the fuck up and then they killed you I made you into a rogue and put you next to a fire it's the height of irony really he said fucking breaking windows they're your windows you know okay it's hard to see anything aha okay progression man I hate when he does that cuz then I don't know where to go hey at least we got somewhere at least we made some sort of progress so I have to figure out the water sit my ditch what happens if I just go in listen listen oh yeah it's a mechanical shark F for that wrong bear yeah I know the Smokey the Bear I was thinking a joke keep maybe you can turn on the valve okay okay you do not get piston time to be able to do anything with that I can just skip this okay all right okay that's that turn that back off again good to know good to know I figured it out good to know I couldn't hear any sound coming out of it I'll turn this back on then go to bed rest my head rest my head okay I turned it back on you can catch me now I don't care I'm going upstairs again I didn't get a thorough look at anything up here if there's any more to be breaking your own windows is he able to come up here I really hope not okay now we can actually see some stuff that's right there must be something in this room like a clock or a fire hello fire can you kill me and this offering maybe not that's lovely it's just you and me smokey three odd room [Music] all right I'm at a loss stop stop it can't turn you off you down here okay okay hey I did it throw on okay I got it okay I found it nice move an odd Larry can do this thing right oh I was like I wonder isn't working ah yeah dude that suppose the volleyball so I can use it on everything else oh hi hi try freezing the water yes I'm gonna do make it up from the roof I'll be around here don't be around here don't be Ronnie he is around here but he's on the other side I want to see what happens now if I do this does that do anything fucking know okay you know here here are you right there Timmy's her are you right there hi he's kind of broken again what's getting trapped in his own bear traps oh this is different okay so maybe it wasn't the theory that people made up that his wife died and that he had to make a deal with the devil to try and bring her back or something like that yes sir here sorry sorry I'm looking for my pain yes yes your wife's name was Mildred okay Mildred and your name is haunt okay that's a weird name sir but judging by your behavior I'm gonna have to agree with that so what happened let me know okay driving down the street you sat down you sat down at the wheel I mean that's what you'd normally do in a car why would that be what would that have killed her oh and you start tapping your foot like you okay you were nervous start tapping your foot so tapping the brakes whole thing's spun around crashed died and then you didn't get your pizza okay got it well I don't work here but thanks for the gossip I'm just gonna take my coffee and go okay good luck good luck with the death of your loved one good guy weird guy but not good guy right if I go up there again I should be able to do this one right okay if I could have five fuckin minutes to myself money trade two dudes fucking perfect comedic timing again reduce security cameras everywhere now Mary oh hey hi oh I should turn off the power here we go hey you ain't got no power in your cameras are you gonna do it but that okays up there alright stay up there oh oh he just come back out you know what guys you know what in-game camera guys and everything at some point I just stopped caring freeze the water I know I just can't figure out what the fuck to get to that point with okay just fall off gently here you go where was it oh there it is doing it doing it guys oh god fucking physics why okay waters moving water hi kinda steps out of Boyd god you're slow slow man baby so was I supposed to eat the water on cold then thanks get in real quick do anything doing sir what are you doing wait so this is me twisting all these valves just turning on different pipes in different areas like those open pipes that I kept finding okay I need them in here yeah like up here like this open pipes here is me doing all of this doing something to them where you want to open that door am I probably yep I can't nice I don't think I can use the valve on this never mind I fucking can nice but okay okay a mite I can't swim okay I'm drowning I can't even fucking climb this thing I'm so the word pipes elsewhere then there's one where the shark is okay okay if you want to cooperate with me just let me know apparently I can't drown I have the lung capacity of Aquaman if we can't float then what's the fucking point of all of that the aiming a jump [Music] how the hell am I supposed to do this with the the shark because as soon as I entered the water it bites my dick off maybe if I have a box maybe I've drained where the shark is this is my problem with this game I have no idea if anything I'm doing is making any sort of progress what's through here right boxes freeze the water yeah ok then I'll be able to walk across it freeze the water through here assuming that okay could you why sometimes you claim it and then other times you don't why wait sometimes you claim it and sometimes you don't let's fucking fix ticket claim it let's keep there we go didn't even make any fucking sense hey no you can catch me all you want now we don't care let's go back up and check on the the shark I don't think anything would have changed but we can go up and see at least yeah yeah yeah you're fucking four billion cameras in your house ah climb yet big duty brain sharks still fine that makes me happy hi hi I love doop de doop dum Oh baited with ease my dude bye I'm out [Music] so is there a valve to freeze the water okay so the pipe today I twisted outside on the roof was the one that led to here so don't know what that thing does oh wait oh no go on but that did that do anything did that do anything oh wait there's a thing outside isn't there for the goddamn it go away where the trampoline is okay let me let me try this again okay that does not change at all and now I don't know which way it is is it on as it off is what did I do fuck off chair I thought the power might have been off if I were still on he resets the power after every night hey ref I surrender pocket giant circle he just he was around the other side anyway there's a valve on this in here just a sight sometimes it wants to work and sometimes it doesn't hi why why trying guys try my best there we go no you fucking work can I put you here you can catch me all you want now what did that do he's just busy breaking his own windows man he doesn't care didn't even give a care now does that do anything to the shark I I honestly don't know how is switching the valve there will actually do anything hey those cameras aren't on ya at least I'm not making a buzzy buzz am I try and get some boxes and see if that actually works where is he okay just got some boxes uh there's more over here I boarded up that fucking window now if we need to get through there I need a crowbar and I have no idea where the crowbar actually is I forgot about my shoe oh horseshoe I abandoned you shoe is he stuck is he stuck I think he's stuck okay this might be our oh wait no I'm not doing this then I was gonna say I'll go off and I'll mess with the shark I'll try and get across the boxes let me even see that wouldn't have even worked I was gonna say I might be able to use the boxes to get across but if the shark actually gets me now that'll reset the guy and right now if he's broken I need to start twisting all the valves as I can see that lever in there is connected to something here but I don't know what that does is the goal in the end to get the trampoline and then I can bounce out over the fence I never have to deal with this bullshit again forget the nightmare sir yep he's broken we need everybody crowbars in the kitchen huh yeah I can't see throw the tomato sauce is it man we're in the kitchen wait and see if you do that I'm down sir calm down sir no is this final record split hash hey turn on the cooker that's useful I don't know if people in the chat are actually giving me good suggestions freeze the fucking water to walk on it yeah I know but how if you're trying to freeze the water the whole time but there's no indication of what actually freezes it I keep hitting valves and nothing's actually working okay let's get rid of all these wait it was a valve outside as well use the wrench to loosen screws see this is right I I wonder if people are actually giving me good tips or if they're just saying stuff they think works at the fact that you're all saying very different things speaks a lot about what this game is keep fighting the good fight my dude it's my house till out there mom he kidnapped me [Music] my mom doesn't care she thinks I'm dead now you look weird you look different you you look unique can I have that what's in the bag wasn't there any things okay let's let's take a breather for a sec and let's actually see if somebody has a suggestion lowered the water and then find the vault that makes the water cold and the Sharks will stop working find a find a valve jump on the pipe in the area that you flooded and try jumping through that door that's not a bad suggestion get tons of ice and put it in the water that's a good suggestion that's the best suggestion so far okay see ya know what I do yeah jumping across the pipe might be an option up here oh wait the table in the kitchen have a drawer I didn't check that no it didn't has a little wanted shit I heard of door closed okay no he's still brothers that's good hop away you're just messing up my vision my vision of being a number one guy hello why would they give you these things to look into but you can't you're not even high enough I can what respect is weird oh like half claiming up on it all right let's try and claim the thing that's over here Raven is he he's took in the wall somewhere here anymore revolves around oh that's still not gonna work as the doors in the way I jump up on the pipe over here cuz everyone's gonna say okay I put down boxes but the boxes don't give me like the room that I need to get across there I light right there I still don't even know what's over there but I am very intensely curious did you guys up doing karate no Amit climb climb wait there's a game with god-awful platforming and physics have platforming sections can I mess with you again wait hello boy I still love oh I never actually drowned I just stay in the water forever all right Ian yeah you know I can pick you up oh I know this got 10 times better now I don't have to care about anything I don't have to care about anyone oh Jesus I care about you though just get shit on me okay wreck it yank go she's an expert window breaker the best in the business Raggedy Ann get yours today he's right there Oh oh shit I can't get close to that thing if I get close to that he might is he trying to jump through the window but he can't because he put boards up weird pipe up here right yeah that one I need to get in there okay let's let's try this no don't work hey you Colbert right Ian that's a crowbar I could just escape out through there all my problems would be solved go Raggedy Ann you're the best we love you I'm very nervous I'm very worried about getting close enough to a wall where it triggers him to be like oh I got you kind of thing everyone saying the stream froze then restart to refresh oops is it back yet I don't know according to mine it's fine stream should be okay are you going all liars are you all liars oh I couldn't move for a second we're in the money we're in the money I did this one I went down over there all the way down yeah very good anywhere else I can jump too I would say that I'll jump in there but is this another thing I have to get to if I get that one will that actually make there will that make the water cold then cold enough to freeze cuz right now that's offsetting it now the waters just lukewarm where's the door is that the door upstairs that I can't get into okay I need to find me a crowbar that's like the thing that's that's the main thing I need to find right now but most places I've looked don't have a crowbar it is bedroom summer hello yeah it's at this store that I was looking at ha I don't think it is that's actually lower I think it might be this one up here whoa I need to get through right let's start getting some boxes maybe we can make like a runway with the boxes okay Raggedy Ann stay down here jack loves you I'm gonna make a box for it we're gonna make a box runway so that I'm high enough and then when I get when I run across all the boxes I'll be able to leap and get into the air soar like a mighty eagle or you know physics will mess up I'll fall over the boxes break my neck and die all right you know what c'est la vie at least then the problem will have solved itself good fuck it worked we did it Oh Ricky Oh Oh Ricky leads outside right no don't fall in Jesus time is so annoying yeah cuz I can't open that okay Ricky is right here [Music] are you fucking serious I didn't have to do anything with the Sharks yeah I'm out I got away from your house dad so convinced it's a Zed Jesus Christ I didn't have to do anything with any of that my god Jesus and holy Bakala lolly what now why am I alone where am I the white noise channel sounds good sounds great first channel making me some eggs yo those eggs are welded to this frying pan okay well my eggs are coming with me everywhere I go everywhere you go always take the eggs with you who's knocking I got mail apparently I'm grown-up it's still in Russian with no subtitles so this is where the main game game begins then I mean look at his face he's very clearly related to their neighbor turns out I wasn't actually trying to break into the house all this time game froze I wasn't actually trying to break into the house all this time the neighbor was actually trying to stop me from leaving I guess I get hit by a car the game is frozen why okay I can't do anything shit [Music] it's after freezing of my whole system what do we do oh oh game just broke my computer I'm back in the house [Music] [Music] it broke everything okay well I'm gonna I was gonna end the stream here anyway but I guess I have no choice now because this is all broken to hell and the whole game is just frozen are you guys seeing just these guys are still seeing the character on screen all I'm seeing is Raggedy Ann on my screen so I don't know what that means control-alt-delete yeah I tried the Mork the whole system's frozen so just in case it decides to restart on its own I'm gonna leave this stream here man this game I want to give it a fair shot I want to I just want to see what the game has to offer I keep thinking are to come together eventually but it's just it's so all over the place man it controls bad it's unintuitive it doesn't tell you what you're supposed to be doing it does tell you where you're going all this time I was releasing vowels to try and do a thing but really I didn't need to do any of that if I had just gotten upstairs jumped over the thing gotten in that room got the red key and left I would have saved 30 minutes of that whole session so bizarre well I might just it'll keep going and see what the ending is now the fact that it's out I might see what it has to offer what's going on I don't know we'll see what's going on but thank you guys for being here for the stream sorry it was so laggy and so choppy my my Internet's just being a dick all day anyway even just trying to browse YouTube myself it's been all over the place and my computer keeps dropping frames for some reason so I don't know I don't know how to stream good and I don't know how internet but hopefully next year I'm trying to get like better internet in a different place we're trying to get better like a better place to record in that case um so maybe we'll have decent internet day and we can do way more streams cuz right now it's a bit of a mess but thanks guys thanks for being here thanks for thanks for watching thanks for being part of all of this it means a great deal to okay bye good night bye-bye

(Whoopsh!) Top of the mornin' to ya laddies! my name is a! uhhhhhu ohhh. MY NAAAME BLUUUUHHHH!! It's early in the morning I can't talk but welcome back to another shaky vlog! Somebody put together a compilation of all the vlogs so far and it's like every intro is the exact same thing. It's just me shaking all over the place so Sorry, but today's gonna be a cool one Today we are heading off to London early.. And so I can't talk I'm up earlier than I normally am.. We're going off to London because we're going to the Black Panther premiere in London tonight, which I am so incredibly excited for Not only am I excited for the movie, which I really really am I can't wait to see this movie. There's been a lot of really great. Talk about it a lot of really great buzz about it and I really like the trailers for it so far so and I just like Black Panther anyway It's a cool character, so I'm really excited for the movie in general, but also I've never been invited to a movie premiere before So I'm really really excited about it getting to go to that. I-I-I-I don't know what to expect I don't know what it's going to be like and I kind of feel like I'm out of my depth here Going to these types of things, but it's going to be really cool And I want to bring you guys along too! I wanna- I want us all to be able to share this experience. together for the first time and I don't know how much of it I'm allowed to record, And, most of it I probably won't record anyway because... I-I don't to like, walk around and show my camera and everyone's face all the time or trying to be like sneaky with the camera. And everything I also just want to enjoy myself too, so I'll record- I'll record as much of it as I can But we're heading off early- the premiere is not until like, way later this evening. We're heading off early because, we get to do a thing, before the premiere with some of the people who are in the movie, some of the like stunt coordinators, are gonna be there showing how they prepared some of the stunts for the movie. And how they use some of the weapons and some of the moves and everything. I think I get to try some of them out! *cuts to people getting flipped over* WOah! I don't know. You'll know when you see the vlog. But I'm-I'm really excited to get to try and do that. Cuz normally I'm like "No, that's okay!" "...I'll just go to the premiere" or "I'll just stay at home, I won't do anything," but NO! SCREW IT! PMA. Positive mental attitude! I want to make 2018 a really good year. I want to do cool stuff! I want to embrace all these opportunities that come my way, so... WE'RE GOING! It's gonna be a good time! *loud throat noises* God. I am repping Spider-man right now, but I'm not gonna be wearing Spider-man for the premiere Because I feel like I would insult Mr. Panther, and I don't want to do that. I know him and Mr. Parker are friends, but I don't want to *stutters* insult him in any way whatsoever. BUT! Because we're going to London as well anyway I thought we- I'd show like some of the journey going there I know I-I-I said before that I want these vlogs to be like Kind of an insight more as to who I am as a person, and bringing you guys along, and showing more day to day stuff. Normally, I don't do anything day to day. I normally just sit here, and I record my videos and I upload them.. I'm uploading Subnautica right now, so... Normally, that's all I do, so I don't do them daily, because nothing really happens daily, so whenever something like this happens I try and record them so- to bring you along. Normally- normally, I neglect doing that. I don't know why, Um, so these types of vlogs are fun. I think so. Let's go! That was stupid We're on the train now. Heading to London. It's gonna take like an.. hour or something I don't know. We normally never take a train. We got to the train station and was like "This train is leaving in five minutes" It was like "Okay, let's go!" And then we got our tickets, and I put them in it was like "Yeah..." "...You're putting them in the exit. You need to go to the entrance." And I was like "I know that, it's no problem" "..It's cool. I totally get how trains work." *strange continuous noises* You can see the English countryside, it's all brown and boring and nothing and gray. I mean, it's London It's cold as all hell here. I don't like it So we just had lunch. We're waiting around so we can do the- the stunt team thing. Which is gonna be awesome. I'm really excited to do it. This is stuff we used to do as a kid, and now I get to meet professionals who do it as their job But now we're on our way to find coffee because we need... Oh, I think we found it but look at this place Look, cool mr. Farber Square This place everyone talks about in London all the time There it is! Right there. It's not very square though. It's kind of round It's a lie *music* Can't wait to see you back, and then I'm like that was wrong, no, feet not in the right position. No, I didn't turn. It didn't- I looked stiff. I would seriously just sit down and listen to that for like 10 hours I would just go over it, and over and over and over I wanna quit YouTube, I wanna become a stuntman. AND, action! *fighting and cool music* *background noise and music start up again* All right, so we made it home. I'm back. Sorry if this is messy I intended on recording way more stuff. And I intended on recording more stuff around the venue and the actual premiere itself. But when we got to the- the when we got to the actual location, to the premiere at the Apollo Like everyone was already seating and we were just sitting down, waiting for the movie to start, so there was no like fancy stuff going on, so I didn't get To show any of that, but I got the show some of the interior of what it was like to be there And it was so awesome, the atmosphere inside that building was so like electric everybody was so ready for the movie, and we got to see some of the cast to director got up. And he brought all the cast up on stage and everyone got to see them then sat down in the movie started. The movie itself! No spoilers, of course, obviously, but I really enjoyed it! I think I thought it was really really good. Um..Like, not the best movie ever made or anything like that, but just really really fun to watch, and really entertaining. And I like the- I like some of the characters, I like the actors. who are playing them as well, and I also think that it was because of the crowd that was there. Everybody was super hyped about it and everyone was super excited about. Any time any sort of joke landed, or any time some sort of reference happened, or some like, tongue in cheek thing happened, the audience like.. Like who'd and hollered, and everything at all the things that were going on, and they laugh at all the jokes super loudly. When you're in a place full of like a thousand, two thousand people, it just makes everything so much more fun. So I didn't know maybe that's flavoring my experience of the movie itself, but I just had a fantastic time It was so good. I'm so glad I got to do something like this. It was amazing And I did get to do, well you might have seen some of it by now in the actual vlog. I don't know how this is going to work yet, because I did the stuff with the stunt team. Which was so much fun, after it was all done as well. I got to sit down and talk to them for a little while, and I loved it I would I would stay there for 10-12 hours a day, just learning how to do that stuff, and talking to them all day. It was fascinating! And I got the hand- hang a bit pretty quick. Apparently I'd like one of the longer sessions to be able to like practice it out, I did one of the longer time slots to be able to do it. Everybody else is rushed through it in like 20 minutes, and I was there for like 35. So I got to- I got to actually learn it properly and get it down and like figure out what was going on, and then by the end of it I actually knew the whole routine, and they recorded it as well, on like two really good cameras, so, I might try and get that into one like...video on its own, and upload that, so you can see more of it. Whereas in this I might just pepper in some of it into the vlog? Again, I have no idea, you'll see by the time this goes up I don't even know why I'm saying it, but that was super awesome I'm really glad I got to do that too. And weird thing, really strange thing was we were sitting down, listening to this DJ before the movie started and, everything was going great, and everyone's enjoying the music that was lasers going across the thing and you can like see the lasers in the sky And it looked like you could almost touch them and then all of a sudden, the Black Eyed Peas just walked by us...I was like in the middle of recording something like that will.i.am And they just sat.. they were seated like right in front of us for the whole movie. Like four feet away from us, and I was just like, "Whoa, that's The Black-Eyed Peas, dude!" And then I saw will.i.am with his phone, and he was like recording and stuff. And I could see myself in the phone as he was recording. I was like is he recording an Instagram story.. And then I went to Instagram afterwards and me and Signe are in the back of the Instagram story aw, it was the funniest thing ever! Anyway, I had an absolute blast. I'm so glad, and I'm so fortunate to be able to do this. Thanks, just to everybody who watches myself and who is here in this community and everything because without any of you I wouldn't get the chance to be able to do things like this, and this is like one of those experiences that I never forget It's very very rare than anybody gets to go to a movie premiere That was my first one, and I just had a really really good time, and I'm so unbelievably grateful for it And I think it was amazing. Don't know how this vlog is gonna turn out. Hopefully it's good, but I just had a really great day in general And at least you get to see some of it. Anyway, THANK you guys so much for watching this video, if you liked it PUNCH THAT LIKE BUTTON, IN THE FACE!!!! LIKE A BOSS!!! And a high five all-round!!! *Whoopsh!! 2x* Thank you, guys! And I will see you all you dudes, IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!! Outro- I'm Everywhere By Teknoaxe One thing I forgot to mention in the vlog it was cold as all hell today, I almost died 
*Whoopsh~* Top of the morning to ya' laddies,  my name is Jacksepticeye and welcome to what is the final episode of Cuphead! I was going to say, what should be the final episode, but it is gonna be the final episode. I'm not gonna start this and not defeat the Devil, so... People gave me some tips in the episode last time, which was aaAAAaAagony, trying to do this but people also said that the Devil's not as hard as King Dice or even not as hard as some of the other boss battles, so watching some other people defeat King Dice after I did it I was like, "I wonder if people had as much trouble as I did." They didn't, I'm just bad :( But people said to use "straight shot fire rounds" (Charge) So I'm gonna use the charge, well maybe the pea shooter instead of the charge I dunno, I'll see how I feel. I'm gonna use the charge and the spread shot The Devil, "One Hell of a Time", and it's only regular mode again (Devil Voice) Well, well, well! Look how far you've come! Not only did you bust up my good-for-nothing lackey, King Dice, but I see you've got my soul contracts as agreed. Hand them over and join my team! Yes or No? Could I just say yes, and end the game? (Yes, but he doesn't) You know what devil? I'ma say NO. This agony ends now! I'm not going any further than this! Well after I defeat him of course. (Devil) Welching on me just like all the others, eh? I'll teach you for backing out of a deal. Have at you! Nyehhhh!~ Okay, I'm kind of nervous People said he's not gonna be hard, but he's the fucking Devil Oh god, oh god, oh GOD, OH god, OH GOD! Oh those fucking lightning reflexes, baby! Oh What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN?? Oh fuck... I got hit by that? I refuse to believe that, sir! Okay, so this is why people said straight shots because all I'm doing is shooting up Okay GAH, fuck I knew that that was that attack and everything, I- I dodged it the first time by accident And then I knew what was coming and I fucked it up Whoa! (Devil)"You broke our deal...now it's my turn to break you!!!" oh Aw, that's cool, his eye is a cup! His eye is an axe breaking a cup- aw THAT'S what got me! I didn't actually see what killed me last time There's fire everywhere siiiir! Okay oh. Welp Fuck me, right? (Don't give the fangirls any ideas, Jack.) Oh god. What are you doing? What are you doing now? WHADDAYA DOIN NOW?! FUCKing little demons! Okay, I didn't get as far that time, alright, alright maybe not the charge shot, cause I have to focus too much on what I'm doing. nAh....  I didn't time it right okay, I can do this No problem! Aw man! FACK! okay, okay, okay, okay! (fish sounds) I got it. I got it. I got it. Don't you worry! Fucking snake head. Come on! That's such horseshit! How are you supposed to do that if there's demons over there as well Got ya bitch! Okay what the fu- oh, what the fuck! Daaaah! I could have parried that. Ehhh!~ ah! I was just about to jump! Okay, okay, okay. Not doing that good. Oh, I don't like the bubble! I don't like Michael Bubble! (Bubl√©) Aaah~ Okay, okay, okay This one I DON'T like Aw, the demon came from the other side this time, niiice! All righty, dude! Hoohoo! What's up De-Devil- fuuuuck! Oh it's what I get- it's what I get! it's what I get, being all cocky! Mother fucker, mother fucker! Okay, still trying to fight through phaaase 1. PHASE 1 OoOOooOoh, Devil bitch, kay, I don't like the fire ones because it keeps spinning around! At least the bubbles.. You can whaaaaaaaaat? You can double them up?! Okay, I wonder, would any other shots be good for this? Is the spread shot even worth it? *pain filled laughter* I'm going in with my favorite shot I'm doing it. I'm doing it because I can keep shots going in the round as well Fuuck I keep thinking it's slower than that. so I can just fire shots like that and have them fly all across around And then not have to worry about AANYthing. about ANYthing ANYTHING! It's fine. It's fine. Where's that demon coming from? Other side! Hehehe! And see! There's stuff already killing him! This is good. This is great for me. This is good for me. (Jack regrets what he just said) WHAT THE! Got him, not even fazed, not even worried Here we go, Devil bitch!~ Oh here we go! I've got your number. Oh, I'm on to ya!

He actually wasn't that hard, it took me 20 minutes to be able to beat him.... (Hooray for Jack!) man... "The brothers had triumphed over the demon, forcing him to finally give up. 'We shall accept your surrender, Devil!', Cuphead laughed, 'but we're not done just yet.' "And with that, Cuphead and Mugman destroyed all of the soul contracts, releasing Inkwell Isle's residents from eternal servitude to the Devil." 'Gosh, I can't wait to tell everybody!' Cuphead said. The boys set off for home, and at top speed. 'C'mon, last one there's a leaky cup!' Mugman teased as they ran. Once home, the brothers gathered everyone together. 'You're all free of the Devil's debt!', Cuphead announced, 'and that fiend won't bother us again!', Mugman added." Oh, it's everybody it's Baroness Von Bon Bon and... the Cala Maria lady and some others that I can't remember... Ah now it's everybody! Cute! Oh it's some of the extras in the levels, and it's the stage play lady. I can't even remember what her name was Some of them are just kind of forgettable "The Elder Kettle was literally brimming with pride as everyone began to cheer." (Elder Kettle voice)"Let's hear it for Cuphead and Mugman! Hip-hip-(Jack) hooray!!" "Hip-hip-hooray!" "As an all-day celebration began, the brothers promise to never wander into trouble again." "And they didn't! Until the next time of course, but that is another story." Aw!   Aw, it's over! Aw man! "Our sincere appreciation to the members of our team whose loyalty and creative endeavor made possible this production." "Chad and Jared Moldenhauer" Which is MDHR, studio MDHR, studio Moldenhauer. What an absolutely GLORIOUS game. What an outstanding video game!! Completely enjoyed every fucking minute of that! Well, not every minute But you know what I mean Some, some sections of it were bullshit the bee boss I still consider to be the most bullshit boss in the whole game um and King Dice was bullshit for a different reason, just the fact that you had to restart and everything I guess (King Dice starts singing and Jack snaps to the rhythm) Oh, what a cool song but The bee boss fight was just bullshit cause it was badly designed the rest had a few little bits here and there But you could forgive them because they weren't that unforgiving. The bee boss fight's still the worst in the game, I think but everything else- don't, don't get me wrong I'm getting the negative out of the way right now because all I have left to say is praise for this game From the very first time I saw Like, little teasers for this game, I knew I would love it I knew I wanted to play it. I've been waiting for it for years It finally came out, and it's even better than I ever thought it was going to be It was OUTstanding because not only was the visuals just fucking dro- Jaw-dropping all the time the visuals in this game will go down in history as some of the best that video games have ever seen. And I'm not like afraid of saying that because No game has come along like this. That's looked like this. Not only does it look like this like Bendy &amp; The Ink Machine is another game that's trying to Get that aesthetic down, and it does it really well, but this This is just so consistently perfect With that aesthetic tone that you just can't fault it. It all comes down to the whole like drawing frames by hand and doing it that way because you can tell the love, the dedication the, just, passion and commitment that went into doing this and you know they work their asses off to get it done. But not only are the visuals just incredible and it shows that like, you don't need a AAA super high budget high graphical fidelity kind of game to wow people. A game like this wowed more people than a lot of games this year and It's a 2d old-school hand-drawn game Nuts! Just shows that art style goes much further than realism, not- not- nothing against realism. I love realism in games as well It's just something like this is something that like sticks in your head, but not only were the visuals impeccable, but the music The music in this game is outstanding, one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a videogame and that was something that caught me by surprise because when I came back from doing my tour this game had already been out and Everyone was talking about the visuals, everyone was talking about the gameplay. I knew it was gonna be hard and I knew the visuals were gonna be great But what I didn't expect was everyone to be talking about the music and I don't know why it didn't click with me that The music was going to be good because everything else in the game obviously had a lot of passion gone into it and a lot of really good creativity went into it, but the music floored me I've been listening to the soundtrack just all the time anyway in my spare time That's all there is There isn't anymore or is there? heh heh heh... Cuphead 2? will we get, will we get a Mugman game? Man, I'm so fucking happy I played this. I'm so glad I did the entire series I'm so glad you all liked it so glad I was able to defeat the bosses Just so happy and Also, sad. It's a bittersweet ending because Cuphead is over now (Jack's singing the Cuphead theme) Man, I'm gonna miss this This is one of my favorite series that I've ever done It was so good. I like this so much As if you couldn't tell I know I was raging a lot in the game, and I was kind of cursing at it I was swearing and I was saying fuck this game, and this game was a nightmare and agony But it was all just part of the fun for the series Don't, don't get me wrong I Absolutely love this game "Well... the devil will take their heads" So cool, and I have the- I have the POP! vinyls of them pre-ordered as well I'm so excited for them to come and I have the vinyl of it, the really collector's edition I want everything from this game, and people have drew me in the style of the game and it's just so good, nothing but fond memories of this and Just thank you for all all for being here and watching this series as well We had some ups we had some downs but Overall this is one of those series that I'm very very proud of and I'm very glad exists on the channel and I will always go back and Reminisce over this very very fondly and who knows I might go out and I might live stream the game again because I just want To play more of it I think there's an expert mode in the game that unlocks afterwards so I might try that out I might just try and go through it again and With all the tips and knowledge that I kind of have now see how fast I can do it But I just don't want it to end I don't want it to be over Man,  and I thought the devil was gonna be much harder, I thought I Mean people told me he was gonna be easier But I thought just people had gotten good at the game by then and I guess you kind of do learn as you go along but kind of a weird ending fight But it's also kind of Apt because it's like I the devil's not all he's cracked up to be Like the devil is this big demon and he's coming down. He's gonna kill you and that's like well You're not that scary. Wonder what would happen if I said yes at the end if I joined it, would it just roll credits? But, again. Thank you all for being here Thank you so much to the studio for sticking to this game and just making their, their vision come true Thank you so much for coming up with such a cool idea and seeing it through 100% Perfectly to what you wanted it to be Absolutely outstanding so happy Anyway, thank you guys so much for watching this. Oh wait, wait wait wait. I want to talk about my favorite bosses Who are my favorite bosses? God I can't really remember them now, Cagney Carnation was a good one. He was the flower guy I think He wasn't that hard and he wasn't even all that memorable, but his mu- the music in his stage was really really good Dragon was pretty cool but kinda just bullshit towards the final part of that phase and when you start getting frustrated at one of the bosses it becomes a little less A little less enjoyable. Actually as much as I hated Hilda Berg She's one of my favorite bosses just from a visual standpoint. The last phase in that where she turns into the moon Really really cool-looking boss, and the devils final phases were really really nice I didn't talk about it while it was happening because everything was freaking out, but in my head I was like marveling over the visuals of it because the lighting kind of gets a bit darker And you see these shines on his face, and that's really really awesome looking I mean they all look great And I just love how weird and wacky all the bosses are and I'm glad they gave them all names Not only did the levels have names,  but all the bosses have names, and that goes a long way towards Solidifying them in your head because they become characters then, rather than just enemies that you have to defeat The run and gun levels were a little all over the place I didn't enjoy them as much as everything else But I'm glad they were there to break up the pacing, because if you were just going boss after boss after boss after boss It gets a little monotonous, and you get a little worn down on it but the run and gun levels were added after It was supposed to be a boss game only, and then people wanted more out of the game, so they went away Delayed the game and then made the run and gun levels so for for them to do that the run and gun levels ended up amazing. I just, I don't know they kind of pissed me off and There's that war of attrition when you're fighting the bosses like you're in one place, and you're chipping away at them That's a bit more fun to me than running left to right and defeating things because then it's a It's a progress by distance kind of level and when you fail that and you go all the way back to the start I think That's why King dice pissed me off If it was just King Dice and I had to try him over and over and over again That would have been a bit better, but don't get me wrong I'm glad they're in the game. I'm glad they exist because again it breaks up the pacing but anyway! Thank you guys so much for watching this video and series, if you liked it punch that like button in the face!! LIKE A BOSS!!! And high fives all around!!! (Whoopsh!!~ Whoopsh~) But, Thank you Guys! And I will see all you dudes , IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!!~ (Outros~) I'm Everywhere By Teknoaxe. BYE!!!! (Thanks For Watching!!!) 
Top o' the morning to you, laddies! My name is JackSepticEye and as you can hear by my voice already I woke up today not feeling the best! Actually I woke up feeling fine And then an hour later my body was like "Hey, wanna hear something funny?" [loud sniffling] Blocked nose! Blocked nose. Scratchy throat, blurry vision, all the signs of a telltale sickness encumbering my body! It's coming over me, and it's trying to kill me, but I'm not gonna let it! Because I got a PMA, and I'm gonna keep that in here, and flush this disease out of my body. So because I can't go at full tilt the way I want to, I decided it'd be fun to do a "Would You Rather" game again. But not only ... [agonized noise] [reading] "The Toughest Game of 'Would You Rather' You Will Ever Play"! Ever! You're never gonna play one tougher than this! Except for like the four other ones that I found that are titled exactly like this. But what can you expect? It's from fucking BuzzFeed. God damn it. BuzzFeed are like shitty... BuzzFeed are just "Shitty YouTube Titles: The Website." It's like if you want to figure out what to call your video, just go to BuzzFeed. You'll get a terrible clickbait title. [reading] "Would you rather be forced to wear wet socks for the rest of your life... or be allowed to wash your hair only once a year?" [clicks] Huh. Only be able to wash my hair once a year... Could I still use like dry shampoo? Or at least rinse it or something? "Be forced to wear wet socks for the rest of your life." That's the rest of your life. Although, this is once a year for the rest of your- I don't fucking know. Ahh, people picked the wet socks instead of the hair. Yeah, well, see, I would just shave all my hair, then. Eventually. Prob- problem solved on my front. "Would you rather have a finger as a tongue or have tongues as fingers?" Ugh! So tongues where my fingers would be, or a finger where my tongue is. Okay, that's a really hard one. Normally, it's like I can logic my way out of this. But it's like, if you have a tongue... or if you have a finger where your tongue is you can't really speak clearly or maybe you can eventually, but like the nuances of your tongue are what enable speech. And then you wouldn't be able to taste anything. Ohh, strange. "Or have tongues as fingers." Okay, I'm probably gonna go with tongues as fingers, because tongues are just like a muscle that's able to like bend and flex and do all these weird shapes and everything. And I'd be able to curl them all up and I feel like I'd still be able to grab stuff and still do what I want. It would be difficult over regular fingers, 'cause there's bones in these but I still think it'd be more useful than this one. People would rather have a finger as a tongue? WHY? Whatever man people are crazy. "Would you rather wear someone else's dirty underwear or use somebody else's toothbrush?" [sharp inhale] Ooh. Ugh. Probably the underwear. It's gross! It depends on how dirty though. Like if it's someone's just like they wore their underwear for a day, and then you have to wear their underwear That's not so bad, but if somebody else's toothbrush It's like all that germ, and saliva, and everything that they have in their mouth, and then it's going into your mouth That's fucking gross and weird. I don't like that ah This one. People would rather use someone else's toothbrush? I mean it does depend on how dirty these underwear are. If there's shit stains and Cum stains and discharge and everything all over them then probably not. At least the toothbrush would smell all minty and you probably wouldn't taste anything But it's just the thought of one of them over the other. Ughhh. They're both fucking crap. "Would you rather shit bricks or puke slugs?" The Ron Weasley pukes logs, and he didn't seem so bad. Oh, no oh The idea of puking up a slogan all that like really sticky mucus coming up your neck uh For shitting a brick that would fucking hurt and probably tear your ass and a half so maybe that one Finally I picked one that other people hate Would you rather pee yourself in public once a week or shit yourself private Daly this? Your other shit yourself private Daly pee yourself in public once a week I feel like I could hide that doesn't mean people have to see I Would just be out in like a train station then all of a sudden like oops And I'd have to go change somewhere probably should go home whatever I'm not out in public all that much Or shit myself private Daly. That's just inconvenient What I'm the way I'm seeing it is once a week versus daily That's the only way I'm coming to an answer with that. "Would you rather always have to tell the truth or always lie?" Hmmm. Both of them are gonna get me in trouble. I feel like I'm a more truthful person than I am a lying person. I mean obviously you lie about certain things, like depending on the situation, if someone's upset you don't just tell them the cold hard truth because that's not always the best solution. Sometimes you have to tell little white lies to help someone get through a thing. Ummmm... Sometimes you have to lie to yourself to get through some things. That's deep. Oh my god, BuzzFeed was right. Truth! I don't know. Man, 81% of people picked truth! Or did you lie? Haha! There- oh, whatever. "Would you rather never have internet access again or never be able to take an airplane anywhere again?" Ohhh... Ugh! I... See... Normally, I'd- I'd pick the plane one, but I have to travel a LOT. And this year, I'm traveling more than I've ever traveled in my entire life. I'm like out of the country... every three to four weeks. Ohhh. So that's difficult, and I'd never be able to see like many of my friends abroad... Could I like take a plane somewhere, live there, and then never take a plane ever again? 'Cause that's probably what I do. Never having internet access again is... I mean, it's not the end of the world but since I do the job that I do and I'm here talking to you because of the internet now and because it's changed my life so much and it can continue to change my life so much, I feel like having access to the Internet is far more useful than ever being able to travel again. "Would you rather have your body found in a pile of sex toys..." What? "...or have everyone you know see your browsing history?" This! I'd rather people see my browsing history, because I do not want to be found in a fucking pile of sex toys! What the hell! My browsing history is like, "Oh, no, you looked up that one thing that one time?" "Oh, call the police! Arrest this man! Crazy lunatics!" Like... Everyone's browsing history is kind of weird! Who gives a shit? We're all human. We all look up weird stuff! "Would you rather be in the real-life version of American Horror Story..." Never watched it... "...or be in the real-life version of The Walking Dead?" Well, this is more apocalyptic than this one. This is like... worldwide epidemic of thousands of people, millions of people dying to a zombie apocalypse and you could be next... I don't know much about American Horror Story but I don't think it's as extreme as that, so maybe that one. Everyone wants to be in The Walking Dead! You know you don't get to be Rick Grimes or anything like that. You don't get to do the cool parts. You could just be the first person to die from the zombies... "Would you rather..." "...run your tongue down a New York sidewalk," "or press your tongue into a stranger's nostril?" Ewwww! Both are gross! This one's probably gonna get me a fuckin venereal disease, and this one's gonna, this one's gonna make me vomit! So actually by... by severity, this one's probably the best one to do. God this one's more gross though than this one licking a sidewalk though like how how much of the sidewalk do I have to lick? You know I'm gonna be an outlier here and lick the sidewalk. Let's take a my tongue and a stranger's nostril Both fucking horrible, though, would you rather immerse yourself in a bathtub of spiders or a bathtub of tobacco spit? Oh, I've never clicked something faster. What is wrong with? 14,000 or 14% 145,000 people Getting into a path of a spider, so gross Through the people calling all over me And then you'd always have that feeling even though when you got out you Blake are they on me I feel like they're on me okay. That was kind of lame, but didn't really have a whole lot in it come on BuzzFeed Well, what did I expect really there was some? Answers in there there were some questions in there that were a little a little tricky dicky, but overall I've had harder the hardest would you rather quiz in the world? Earth so it says. I don't know I've done a lot of them by now. I doubt that this one's gonna be the hardest one the world This isn't even BuzzFeed or anything or maybe it is it's just called would you rather quiz comm I? Don't know. I don't trust it. Okay. Go to the first question Would you rather be invisible or be able to fly? Be able to fly! Duh! That's not a hard one! Why would that be hard? Being invisible, don't get me wrong, be awesome. It'd be cool, but if you're always invisible that'd be a pain in my ass. Eventually you'd get bored of that. And with great invisibility comes great ability to... not be noticed by people, so I'd rather be able to fly! I'll be able to soar through the air and be able to go all the way up and then dive bomb all the way down, and and Well, I mean it'd be encumbering some serious G's on my body, but it'd be so awesome if I was able to fly oh It wouldn't even have to walk through the shop or anything I'd just be like mmm kind of want a bar a chocolate and these watch out the door fucking simple We're off to a flying start Good one oh my god. That's a little close stranger danger Jesus "Would you rather only be able to whisper or only be able to shout?" Well... One of these things is already true, so that one. [reading] "But that would get really annoying!" I know! Welcome to the channel, would you rather quiz.com! is this the hardest would you rather quiz because the pictures are just really weird Would you rather know when you're going to die or know? How you were going to die? Hmm, I think we got this one before and I think I went with how I was going to die Cuz when I'm going to die, I'll constantly be counting that out of my head, maybe like May fifteenth twenty seventy six never like oh I really got to get stuff done Before then and then I'd be coming up and I all day ever just freaking out I think it would just make me paranoid. If I knew how it was going to die like if somebody said How are you gonna? Die it's like Oh hit by an airplane while skydiving I'm like okay. I just won't go skydiving until I'm 90 so this one Watch out for that. I'm Watch out for what?! I don't know what it is! "Would you rather never be able to open your mouth..." A jacksepticeye that's not able to open its mouth?! Is that really a jacksepticeye at all? "Or never be able to close your eyes?" Hmm. Would my eyes still dry out? 'Cause that would suck. But if I'm not able to open my mouth, Then I'm not able to eat or anything either. There are solutions to it, but I love being able to chaw on some nosh. Being able to nosh on some grub. So good! Just food in my mouth! Right now! All the time! Just food every day! Always! I love it! That's one of my favorite things to do. Never be able to close my eyes. I could just get eye drops. "You're playing a blinder!" Oh! Those are shit jokes! "Nearly halfway there... watch out! They're about to get... [growly] EVEN TOUGHER." Well they weren't that tough to begin with! But okay. Pull up my imaginary sleeves. I'm fucking ready. Let's go! Would you rather marry a complete stranger or be forced to have sex with one? They say yes the accurate reaction. What right okay, so any stranger at all? Before us have sex of a stranger be forced to marry one I feel like being forced to marry one comes with a lot more Than being forced to have sex at one It's like Get in get out, and then get on with your life You know what I'm saying whereas the other one is like marry them And then if you don't want to stay married to them then you gotta like Divorce them get an annulment all this different Type of shit is so much so stretched before sex are you sure every woman and girl? Fleeing her home country is vulnerable to being trafficked or for forced sexual exploitation ah Fuck This got really serious all of a sudden. I just came to answer some silly questions. Oh, man No, you're making me have an existential crisis Would you rather be locked in a Lurie all by yourself or be locked in a lorry with 50 strangers? By myself many people are forced to escape their country in terrible conditions in the backs of lorries where they run the risk of freezing or suffocating to death Oh God This just took a very deep dark twist now I know what you're saying It's the hardest would you rather quiz you baited me with the first few questions Would you rather be beaten by your husband or be beaten by a human trafficker I I'd rather just go somewhere else right now and have nice food. I Just wanted to play a silly quiz game for the sake of Fun and some countries leaving your husband is punishable by death Whilst domestic violence is not considered a crime What the fuck? What is wrong with some parts of the world who's in some parts of the world think that this is like normal I Don't know would you rather suffer genital mutilation or never see any of your family again? Wow At this point it's not even about picking, which one I would actually rather Because this a lot of this I'm I'm guessing the idea behind this one now is that? Some people have to choose one of these some people it's either this or this and that's horrible never seen any of your family again in some cultures girls who refuse genital female genital mutilation are either mutilated by force or Forced to flee their homes and families Jesus sometimes they like They like close up Genitals so that you can't use them until like Your spouse is like the one like you're a gift to them kind of thing. It's so horrible The world's such a messed up place in some areas Would you rather tell an asylum interviewer about how you were abused even though your children are in the room? Stay quiet and risk being sent back to your home country where you will be persecuted probably this one Because it's horrible to have to say that stuff in front of your children But at least this one you might be able to escape the horrors Then back home All asylum seekers should be provided with adequate childcare whilst they are being interviewed So they can freely disclose all the information that is relevant to their claim This is just one of the rights Asylum Aid is working for that's awesome That makes me happy to hear so your kids don't actually have to be in the room because the proper asylum Would provide child care while you go for that interview that that's nice Would you rather help asylum aid improve the lives of the refugees now find out more? Oh? Refugee crisis when was this created a Guy I didn't know that this I did not know that this was gonna take this turn by the way I just looked up like different Would you rather quizzes are like? Toughest and hardest, would you rather quizzes and stuff like that I didn't know that that's what this one was going to be I'm gonna donate for sure Alright done man that took a very strange turn. I didn't - I didn't honestly I didn't know that that was gonna happen Cuz it's called "The Hardest Would You Rather Quiz in the World." I thought it was just like a- a clickbaity thing, but man that really makes you think. That- Like it actually lived up to its name. Who knew? Not just clickbait! Anyway, that was a bit of a different video at this time I guess but I it's always nice to try and change videos around now, and then instead of just doing the regular old either dot IO Would you rather quizzes so we got something? I'll start at this this time really MIT really made me think by the end of it instead of just me answering Silly questions it actually turned into something so anyway Thank you guys so much for watching this episode! If you liked it, punch that like button in the face... LIKE A BOSS! And, high-fives all around. [high five! high five!] Thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes... IN THE NEXT VIDEO! [outro music] [sniffling] Go away, sickness, please! 
Top of the morning to you laddies my name is Jacksepticeye and welcome to 3:00 a.m. at the Krusty Krab, which I think is like a Spongebob Squarepants Five Nights at Freddy's type game. k thanks bai I have no idea. I've just had a really large amount of people- [Mr. Krabs] "Ahhh, money." Oh! I'm Mr. Krabs! [laughs] I've had a very large amount of people telling me to play this game, which either means that it's amazing, or it's terrible. Either way, I am good! [reading] Left Shift sprint, E to interact, C to crouch... F to turn your flashlight on and off. Okay, what's the objective? [reading in Mr. Krabs voice] "Gather all me money from the cash register and from me office, Arg." [reading in Mr. Krabs voice] "Pack the leftover Krabby Patties. Check the bathroom trash bin for any pennies." I should actually be paying attention. I'm more paying attention to the voice I'm doing. [reading] "Pack the leftover Krabby Patties. Gather all the money..." [reading] "from the office. Check the bathroom trash for any pennies. Lock up and leave." Okay. So we're here at 3 a.m. Okay, so this is the Krabby Patty station. Why can I not go through? Let me through. I want to go through! Okay, we're just closing that then. Open this one. Ha ha! What happened? Oh, God. OH, NOOO! He's coming to steal me Krabby Patties! [reading] "When the lights start flickering, you must hide." Uh-oh. Hide where? Am I good? What happened? I just heard some sounds! [laughing nervously] Okay, so I have to collect money from the register... Oh my God, are you serious? Are you serious with this shit?! [electronic flickering sounds] Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Oh, there he is! That's what I'm hiding from! Okay! Hiii! Okay. He's gone. We're okay. Oh God, I have to... [Krabs voice] I have to start the lootin' all over again. Fuck's sake, come on. Come on! Come on, you have time. You have time! Boom! [electronic sound] Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Where did he appear? I don't see him! Oh, he was in there. Okay, I need to check for pennies or something, right? Ugh, sweet Jesus. You need to be much faster at this, dude. Please? I know you have crap hands and everything, you only have little claws but... I've no idea where he is up here! This is so silly. [Patrick Star voice] No, this is PATRICK. Did I do it? Okay! No problem! No problem at all. I'm gonna hide! I'm hiding. I'm safe. I'm fine. Where's he gonna show up? Okay, he's out there somewhere. Yeah. Okay. He's gone. He's gone. I have time to pack me Krabby Patties! Oh, God. You need to be - [Spongebob voice] You need to be faster at this, Mr. Krabs. Ay-ay-ay-ay. I can't do the voice! Man, I wish I was Tom Kenny. Hell yeah! Did I do it? Am I okay? Am I fine? [electronic sounds] There was no sound of him actually coming up. Okay. I'm taking me money! This is a bad time to be at the Krusty Krab. [reading] "All objectives complete, find the key in the basement, lock up and get out!" Where's the basement? [electronic sounds] Shit. Oh shit. [jumpscare noise] Ooh, he's in the bathroom this time! Poof! He gone. Okay, I have no idea how to get to the basement though. Uh-oh. Ahh! Okay, into the basement we go! We survived the upstairs, anyway. [reading] "The key is somewhere in this basement. You must find it." Oh, no. It's the same shit again, isn't it. Oh, this is very like... the joy- [electronic sound] He's over there! He's over there! Okay, I'm hidin'. I love how normal the footsteps are. Okay, I can't see anything with a fucking light off. Clearly. That's what they're for. [electronic sound] Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Oh my god! I'm gonna try forever to find this fuckin' key! [whispering] He was right there. Is he continuously searching, or do- is he just randomized? Does he pop down and then I have to go hide? Because that would be kind of sucky! Okay back where I started. Let's go this way. Come on, Mr. Key! [electronic sounds] [whispering] He was right there! He was right there! He was right there! Okay, okay. He is very fast! Mr. Key, come to me, plea-plea...se! Just sounds like someone walking around outside. Tra-la-la. Is he gone? Okay. He went that way. Okay, that means I'm going this way. That's my plan, and I'm sticking to it. Shut up. Leave me alone. I'm gone! Oh my god, this place is massive! Key! Keykeykey! Yes! Now all I have to do is get out! I can do this! I have the ability! Can't remem- Oooo! D-ahhh! [electronic sounds] Ohhh, fuck. He was right there! How did he not see me? He's big red glowing eyes! You'd think he'd be able to see everything! Okay, just go. Just go lock up. Go lock up. I have the key! I can do this! [Spongebob laugh] [reading] "You have the key... go outside and lock up." Okay... Is that- Is that it? Am I done? Hell yeah! [reading] "Now get to the boat and escape!" Oh, come on! To the boat? Well, I guess that makes sense. It's... The Chumbucket. Wait, where's the fuckin' boat? Ohhhh. Boats are just regular cars in Spongebob. That makes a lot of sense, actually. Did I do it?! Oh, no! He's chasin' us! Go, Mr. Krabs! Yeah, you're gonna want to be much faster than that. He was really quick at walking. [claps] Yeah! That wasn't so bad. I did that in no time at all. I'm the best! Hahaha! Take that, Krusty Krab! I love that Mr. Krabs is staying back afterwards just fawning over his own money. Classic. Classic Mr. Krabs. Man! Need to go back and watch more Spongebob again. I never really got into it when I was a kid, when it- when it started coming out, and then the older I got the less interest I had in it and I always thought it was more kiddie then, the older I got, and now, now that I'm like almost 30 I'm like looking back at it, going, "That was actually really good for its time!" I should go back and watch a bunch of that! Some of the humor in it is still fucking amazing. But it's been so long man. I can't even remember any of it. Half the characters I can't even remember. Yeah, that'll be one of my goals for this year. PMA, make 2018 amazing, and also watch more Spongebob. I also need to watch more of the animes that I wanted to watch and also the other cartoons that I used to watch, and all these TV shows that I've been missing because I've been doing YouTube, and all these movies that are coming out! I'll just stick to playing video games. ANYWAY, Thank you guys so much for watching this video! If you liked it, punch the Like Button in the face LIKE A BOSS! And... high fives all around: [high five sound! high five sound!] Thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes... IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!! [outro music] [Spongebob voice] Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? [Spongebob laugh]   
*waPOOSH* Top of the mornin' to ya laddies. My name is Jacksepticeye, and welcome back to the deep down dark deep down of Sub Nauseous Last episode, we built our infinity space Our infinity base, not our infinity space. What am I talking about? And now, we have- well... It's either uh... It's either a pretzel or it's an infinity symbol, Or it's an 8, or it's a pair of balls, or it's pair of boobs. It's whatever you want. It's basically, we call this base Rorshack And not rorschach, like it's normally spelled, but rorshack as in "s h a c k" Like it's a shack, like a space you live in. So now it has a bunch of different meanings Because the rorschach test is something where you like see whatever your brain sees and then it tests- I don't know. Whatever. We're- we're Gonna, keep this base down here. We're gonna explore a small bit more, but not yet, because there are some things that I want to do That I've been tryi- that I've wanted to do for ages, which is trying to find the extra suits. I wanna find the The reinforced diving suit, and I also want to find the still suit. So, I need to go to some of the wrecks, and one of the wrecks i haven't been to a lot of, Or an area I haven't been a lot to- to a lot of, I can't fucking speak, Is the bulb zone back near where I grew up- and where I was born. I'm also gonna take apart these for a sec. Because somebody put together- kamille v.0 (or somethin like that) Put together a very big comprehensive list of things that people wrote in the comments. Which was very, very nice of them to do. And it was a bunch of suggestions for me, or for things that I could do in the game and it was a lot Of stuff like Where the still suit and all that- those kinds of things were, but another one that somebody wrote down was to put a foundation somewhere And then it would allow me to put down my thermal generators a bit easier, so then I don't have to dick around with them Aum... Exterior modules. 'Cuz now they just sit on this perfectly Yes, I know I'm dying. I'm very, well aware of my health, thank you very much. We're gonna get this done. That actually looks kind of cool Nice! All right, I got very close to dying there. A lot closer than my body would have liked... Man, I need some batteries in this frickin station. Somebody call up ol' Elon Musk there and tell him to send  me over some power walls Because once the power drains out of it then the place goes empty Instead of it holding on to the 500, using up the 500, and then replenishing it It's silly issa stupid, its dumb. I don't like it. Right, so there's not a whole lot going on down here. I might have to make a  trip back home Back to my original base because I have to go to the- what was the name of the place? The bulb zone! That's where I'm going. It's gonna take me forever to get back. I might leave Maria down here. I don't think I need (poor Maria) her technically to get around. Could just bring Pepper, and that would be faster. I dunno. Also... They, sent me this! Isn't that cool? It says Subnautica on it, but it's like a thermos. So right now, I just have like a few lemon slices chopped up and some water inside that But it keeps it icy fresh all the time, and I've been trying to drink this whole entire thing Each day, because I don't drink enough water when I'm sitting here playing games. So, it's good. So, thank you Subnautica developers! I appreciate it, you keeping me healthy, keep me young Keep me hip with the kids righty Some stuff in you. I might keep you just in case, when I get back i need you. I also need to... Okay, this is going to take me a while. I also need to start getting Health. I don't have enough of that going around right now. Yeah, make it. YEAH, baby! That's the Pepper I know and love! That's the effort I- I like. Maximum effort! You guys take care of my camera now, okay? It's a small baby, and I love it very much. It's my child. Okay, good. Watch out for that guy. He's all infected. There's one of them over there that's infected. Stay away from him. And that guy! Don't let him sneeze on ya. Bulb zone, and there's a wreck right here. Have I checked this wreck? Did I chickadee check this wreck before I wrecked this check? I can't remember. oh? OHH? Scanner room fragment. I thought you were a thing that was full of a thing. OOh, jeeeeeepers buddies Don't be doing that to me. That scared me! I don't like being scared. Whoaaa-kay, we're a lot closer to some things that I didn't even know. were there. All right, I might- I don't think I have been here. Can I dig into this bad boy anywhere? Is there any place for- for jack to enter? Initial assessments would be... no. Must be something I can do with this place. It's a giant wreck. It has to have something in it. What is going on here? I have to be able to get in there. There's electricity on all on in the inside. It's just very hard to see what's going on because it's very, very dark. haHA! I have found the hole! Modification station fragment. I don't need those. I need stuff that has- that has like the chips in them, so I could just pull the-the that has like the card reader thing out. Oh, God. I'm so confused as to where I am what did i just open? Oh, I'm in where i just opened. Okay, good. That's what I wanted anyway. You guys fight amongst yourselves. I'll be in here sipping tea. Cyclops sonar upgrade? I HAD that! Oh, poo. I got a pda though. The charter. Okay, that's cool. You're just modification station pieces. I have these as well. Ah, phooey That means there's nothing really new in here. 'Cuz they're, those are the things I'm looking for, those cards that I pull out. because that means it's something new each ti- well.. Supposed to mean it's something new Don't know if I have to like scan for- oh, this is a bad idea... Ohh, it's a bad idea. Did I just go in a circle? No, this is new grow beds waters Cool, I won't be thirsty. Oh, shit I need to get out of here. Oh, god, oh god. Get out. get out. Okay, now i'm kind of panicking Even though I have a lot of oxygen left, I'm still kind of panicking. I don't like to be away from the exits. Oh God, where am I? I don't know what's going on. Where did I come in? Oh, it's making me feel all nervous. I forget how I got into this whole place. yes! Okay, MAN! This fucking seaglide! Can I just infinitely turn off that thing? The little reader that shows me the map- it's the most useless thing. okay, well that didn't have anything in it! I was hoping it would at least have one of the suit fragments in it, or one of the suit pieces, and then I could build it. DisappOINTED! Okay I'll look around this area a bit more. I mean, I did get a lot of water and food. Be able to keep myself busy, that's good. At least I'm not gonna die of that. Heeyyy reefies! &lt;3 Ooh, this isn't one I've done. Ooh neat-o! Oh, please be something cool, please be something cool! Fingers crossed, fingers crossed! Ooh, ooh! Alien containment?! *disappointed Sean* Why. Why do you give me the things I have? Why you giving me all things that I already have? I think there's only one per wreck as well. Lame! I want cool stuff! Even though, I don't know why I want- I want the still suit more than I want the... The reinforced suit, 'cuz, let's face it. I'm not exactly in the heated zone as much anymore. Storage things are empty. That's a piece of stasis rifle. Pretty sure I have those, just haven't made one. Is that it? is that everything in here? Nope, never mind, never mind. Ooh, people also said I haven't seen the little... modification icon here This thing. People said that the scanner room stuff is stackable. Woah, that's a whole water filtration machine right there. And a whole vending machine. Ooh, I don't have yous. chic plant pot And a basic plant pot ooOOOOhhh At least you might be able to get cosmetics. That's good for my bases. well, that didn't last long. Anything here I don't have? What are you? scanner room. Have that! I have two of thems! I have two da those! well this is a big waste of our time. I think those are the only wrecks that are in the bulb zone There's not really any other reason to be in here. Whoa, look at all you guys! There's four them of them! FIVE of them! What're you all doing at such an enclosed space? Is there a concert? OOh! Oh, wait. I got you. Shiiit. That's awesome! I also need to start building that stuff for my... Let's head back to Henry. Let's head back to the moon pool. I need- I can also build, stuff for my... pfftt. My prawn suit. God, I can't fucking think. I can build stuff for my prawn suit as well, like... What do they call it? A thermal generator, or something like that. I can build a heat power source for myself. I'm back everybody! Hey Sal! How's it going? See that? Nailed it! Flawless! But before I do anything, I need to say hello to my, buddies! Where are they? KEVIN! Where's Karly? Where's your sister? Kevin, you tell me where your sister is right now. I won't be having any of this, Kev. Ohh, there she is. Oh, thank god you guys are still here, just hanging around. Oh, that's a weight off my chest. Those guys are the cutest. I love them! All right. Is it here that I make that? Thermal reactor. Okay, I need a wiring kit, polyaniline, and kyanite. Think I have those things laying around. So now I should be able to just build this. Ooh, what can I build for you? A perimeter defense system! Nah. Advanced wiring kit and enameled glass, though, I might be able to get. But first, I want to- I want to build this. I want to put this into you. Wait, I can't even access your upgrades actually without you- see, why? Why, why? You can do this with Sally no problem. When Sally's docked, you can access her modules. you can access upgrades, and the other side you can access storage. But- Oh wait. While I'm here, now that I remember. Hup, and a.. Whoop, whoop Nice. But here, I- all i can do is enter. Christ, all I can do is enter. I can't actually access upgrades until Pepper is out. Why, is that? Thanks, I'm not staying long though. I just have a thing to insert BOOM. Doesn't really do anything right now for me, but BUH. *giggles* Wait, what else can I build? I can build, well I could have built a perimeter system. Wait, what was it that I needed for that? Polyaniline and a wiring kit. I think I actually still have that stuff. And a seamoth solar charger. Solar charger would be a big deal for the seamoth. torpedo arm- don't want. grappling hook, propulsion cannon- don't want. I think I have everything that I need for my... prawn suit. I think pepper is fully decked out with all the materials and all the upgrades that I prefer Because you can get make a propulsion cannon like to suck things in and fire them away but I just like My drill arm the drill arm of the grappling hook are all I really need to succeed in life They were, in this game energy efficiency module Think, you have a few more poly alanines Polyaniline. Have I been saying that right but a seamoth solar charge would be very nice so I just need two gold now I think We'll have to craft a wiring kit but I think yeah cuz, I just used pepper to get some gold Wiring kit. Glad I brought some of this silver and gold and stuff with me What are you saying I could build tools?  A habitat builder! Why not. see, why, can't you just have all that, was the radiation suit and a rebreather I want the stealth suits and everything I, also forgot to get my health back That could have been bad. Okay, peps please tell me you have, oh god it's nighttime Please tell me you have the things I need Yes...YES! *makes weird noise mimicking animal* They're noisy lads... A grand buncha lads, absolute units Is that enough to make it? Shooould be... And then from there...Yeeess solar charger for the Sallers Cool! Do you've one more slot left in you?
You do Now Sally is fully upgraded with all the things I want. Wait do you just... work? Aw, I was hoping I would actually put something on you like a, teeny tiny little solar panel That sucks, okay, what next there's a lot of stuff for the Cyclops I can build but I have to build that in the Cyclops, and now the Cyclops isn't here. Look at my children outside playing around while they do that Daddy's gonna go get himself some well-deserved shut-eye. Think it's time to renovate my home a small bit now that I have all, these like Basic plants and chic pots and all that kind of stuff I feel like, i want to just Spruce up the place a bit... Oh thank god that grass ended up looking better at the end wait Which one's look better I want to see Those ones, those ones look better, don't, not a fan of the chic plant pots. ooh. What do you look like Hmm, no it'll be too futuristicy. You're, not very homely, also you, don't look, right there I need to build some like, tables and stuff to be able to put you down, what do i need for tables Some glass. I can also put up picture frames and then I can take my own pictures- ooh wall plants. yeah Yes, yes give this place a very earthly feel Can I put some plant shelves right next to my bed? Ooh, look at this This is looking wonderful! Need some lights though It'd be cool if I had like a little panel of lights but I could (there were some that you didn't scan in a base, Sean) Like change the colors in here and like a little hue bulb. Or whatever and then you could Mess around with the different colors and then you can Mess around with different shades you can turn them on and off and you can, make your bedroom Really, really, cozy. Aww. need to go off and build a bunch of glass Cuz then I can, start putting a bunch of this stuff in like chairs and desks and everything Put a little bench in. Nah. let, me find out the bench bench to put a... counter in? If I put you there say, if I put you there say, I need, some glass again, and then No see, I want a desk that a chair can go under So like an actual desk and not a counter. so I'm gonna just, spruce up my room It's time- it's time to bring in the spice of life There we go, that's good that's good that's good. I like that. Aaand, swivel chair, yes. Who wouldn't want the swivel chair, also you need a better way of Turning this shit. At least it works for these. Whenever you're trying to put down, the like the little models of stuff when you're trying to cycle through that, and make them turn it always looks shit come on Can I sit in this? sit Won't let me sit cause it's too close to the thing or at least it looks good because I'm gonna put a glass window right there As opposed to you know.

Oh? No, didn't mean to get rid of you. uhm command chair You need to turn around sir. Command chair What does the chair command? Everybody must obey the chair. It's also Slightly crooked. I don't like slightly crooked things Put you this way. Even though it doesn't matter you're swivel chairs you should be able to go anywhere yes Nice! Can I sit in this? Can I sit in this now? Can't sit in this Can't sit in any of them that's lovely I didn't want to sit in my, my cool things anyway. I just wanted to build the Sam right here Yeah, Sam!

Jus' scratch the belly Or Kevin go? There he is. C'mere kev kev Okay, okay, unless, we get this one right now? Okay, it's all the high five one now, top of the morning, yes There we go! I got a screen shot I think it's a terrible one... I want to see what it looks like, when i put it in. Hopefully it's not like, blurry and his face is all weird. I love my messy looking child there AWWWWWWW CUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE, Upload. Look at that! That's adorable My bedroom's coming together finally!! Sweet... kinda wanna head back to the Aurora for a little bit I've only been to the Aurora once and I kind of flew through it But there's a few things that I didn't get in there. I think there's a lot of like furniture and stuff that I didn't get That was in the Aurora And that was one of the suggestions from people in the comments too that was in the screenshot that I took Was to go back there Welcome aboard all systems online And I want to get inside now that I have like more materials and stuff Food might be a problem I'll be all right I'm not, I won't be in there hugely Long I don't have to scan Every single little thing this time But I want to get in and see if any of the the rooms had stuff that I missed I think there might be a Few PDA's and stuff that I missed as well Plus, can't just go the Aurora once! What is this? Going once, going twice, sold? Hey, reefies... Also I just gotta be careful, because, there's a when there are reefies around there's, also reapies around.... I think I can very very faintly hear one already Maybe not maybe I'm hearing things. Am I going crazy? Ha, going crazy I've already been crazy. I checked you right? Yeah I think I checked all the life pods now at this point. Otherwise I'd be getting new messages and saying hey, come over here, we're dying, and I still have signals on my thing. Oohhh now I definitely hear ya' Even though I know he's not like, near me okay there he is ... Ow... Oh God did I fuck this up did I come in the wrong part, oohhh no. Please, tell me I can get under this this is a, ok? ok There we go? Even though I know the - the reaper isn't near me when I'm here It's still just nice to be able to see where they are because if you can't see where they are then you're always paranoid, about them being, like right behind you I am all turned around. I am in the complete wrong area. Wonder if I could scan, some of these little headcrab dude's cave crawlers come'ere. bingo Agile territorial carrion-feeder, well adapted to both land and sea. Gas exchange membrane absorbs essential gases from the air or water for basic, bodily regulation is this your eye Mandibles the species seeks out corpses in packs before defending its claim, while the corpses devour necessary Waste recycler avoid or incapacitate huh so you're, basically, like, little piranha type dudes I just call you a pain in my ass. Ah here's a PDA I missed. Three players players, washed away, by and usually high tide straight into coconut three Really desert island drama dot v rat...They're just playing a fucking game... Don't care about that Seamoth fragments, no don't need those. Can I have... haven't found anything new... I want like new lockers or something. This is where I want to be this room right here, or these rooms right here I should say Single wall shelf haha! Awww that would be cool actually oh nice Cuz all I have right now back at my base is just like a giant set of shelves. So now if I can actually put down shelf by shelf By shelf and make my own design that'll be even better. It was all worth it guys! Oo nutrient blocks. Nice. Okay, I do not need one of those right now. They give me back like 75. Anything else new? Give me all the shit. I got the cabin open! The room where I didn't have the code for responsible autonomous relationships or RAR's All the good things in life are commodities. We trade love just as we buy and sell stock. We engage in human relationships when there is a fair exchange of value, support, motivation, affection - nothing good is ever free. If every physical good in the federation Came from a single supplier it would constitute a dangerous monopoly Personal relationships are the same. It is important for people to get what they need from Multiple sources. If a person finds a better source of the goods they require they are not wronging their original supplier By, changing their purchasing arrangements. If one member of a relationship should feel threatened or jealous they must look at their Own business model and ask whether it is performing competitively -  there's always room for improvement. Oooo and a basic double bed. I don't have'ta sleep on a shitty single bed anymore. I'm moving up in the world! Pick a blue cap. Can I wear a blue cap? I can place a blue cap. I don't want to place a blue cap. I wanna, wear a blue cap, and be cool. Thank, you for the water, oh and thank you for the first aids a toy yes So worth it I'm not even being sarcastic either and that actually is worth it. Cabin 2 locked, okay I can't get in there. Yeah I got your data. Coolio I guess that was it. Only other place in here is the reactor room. So I got a cool a few cool things Time to go back and deck out my home. Sally!!!

He could, have killed all my, ass but now I am going home. That's really cool Actually now that when I drive around in daytime Sally doesn't lose any energy. I drove I drove all the way back from the Aurora all at 100% power neato Should have that in ages ago that would have saved, me a lot of hassle though I don't think I ran into too much trouble With Sally, like that. Did I just call her maria? (inhale) awkward... Okay, um deconstruct you and now can i put down. A single shelf That's awesome Such a such a simple little thing but i love it cool, actually you know, what i Want to do something like this I'm a perfectionist i want my i want my shit to look cool, put you like that and then put you like that Just to break it up a small bit and then i'll take you And put you...

And now Reading your comments With Jacksepticeye "Hey Sean, do you find it offense when people say only 12 year olds watch you" -It is kind of the joke to say like 'Oh only kids watch you' or 'only 13 year olds watch your channel' and- Believe me. I'm in no disbelief as to what the age group of people generally probably watch my content are probably pretty young. At least a while ago a lot of people were very young especially when I was doing stuff like Happy Wheels and Skate 3 and those kinds of things I think there was a lot of very young people on the channel I think some of them have kind of moved off now as I've kind of started to grow up more with the channel and more people are coming in now. I don't know. I don't know what the actual age demographic for the channel is now.  According to my analytics on the channel it says that the main people who watch me are 20 plus year olds. Instead of actual kids, but we all know that people can lie about their age. But it doesn't really offend me because it's just silly that people will try and use that as some sort of way of bringing you down. Uhm, and it's also it's kind of a tone-deaf insult as well from a lot of people. If it's another youtuber saying it to you It's kinda like, well... You have to understand that the main audience of people who watch YouTube are kids Maybe not 12 year olds, but they're all teens and younger, mainly. Because those are the people who have the time to actually watch YouTube religiously unless you're a niche channel with a very specific thing catered towards adults, most channels that have a huge number of either subscribers or viewership on each of their videos are probably mainly watched by kids most of the stuff out there that has a huge viral Ahm.. of..a Huge viral viewership to it is watched by kids That's just the main Viewership of YouTube because these are the people who have the most amount of time they come home to do their homework they watch YouTube Diff-different things like that so no I don't really get offended by it? I-I think that the channel is kind of I-I think the channel has grown up a bit in the last year I don't think it's mainly a lot of kids that watch the channel anymore And that kind of just happened naturally the way I was doing YouTube and some of the games I was playing stuff kind of just evolved a bit that way. No. I don't find it offense "Why weren't you in YouTube rewind 2017?" I talked a bit about this in a vlog I did a while ago I can't remember what the name of the vlog was, but I- when YouTube rewind came out I uploaded a vlog talking about various different things But I mentioned why I wasn't in YouTube rewind 2017 the first one was when they asked me I didn't really have time But then the more I thought about it... Well they asked me and I didn't have time, but I also didn't want to do what they wanted me to do I think they asked me originally to like do the meme thing where you're like flying through space or something I can't remember exactly But I, I- the more I thought about it the less I wanted to do it because YouTube in 2017 were just god-awful they didn't talk to their creators that didn't support their creators a lot of stuff hammered down their creators Which from a business standpoint the part of me understood But them not talking to the creator's about it left this really weird juxtaposition between Ent- er, corporate entity and the people who basically built their platform So I didn't want to be in a video with them kind of promoting their platform For the entire year and pretend like everything was okay And everything was all hunky-dory and all just memes when really it was probably the worst year that the platform has ever had Ehm.. So just little things like that. "If jacksepticeye did not do youtube what would he do as a job?" I think we all know I'd be part of the world sickest k-pop groups I, I'd probably be part of BTS or something and just be like, hey annyeong haseyo, uh homies *laughing* I don't fuckin' know I really wish I was in kpop though. I wish you could dance. "Jack. What is your favorite Zelda game?" Okay, there's a little bits of this answer I'm gonna answer your question straight out Which is your avatar your profile picture which is Breath of the Wild that's far and away my favorite Zelda game but it's for a reason and that's because I've never actually played many other Zelda games. I... I played A Link Between Worlds When that came out because I had just gotten a 3ds And I was like I need a good game to play this on and I got it to play that game And I really really liked it But it didn't really stick with me the way breath of the wild did and I didn't finish it and I also tried playing Wind Waker, but I didn't have time when I was playing that I was playing remake of it and What are the ones I tried playing Twilight Princess a while ago. I didn't get much further into that and I tried playing Majora's Mask Actually, I played ocarina of time too a lot of them, but I only play them for like an hour But then I just fell in love with my switch and started playing Breath of the Wild Non-stop in my spare time like any time that was spent away from videos I was just playing that game, and I completed it and I freaking loved it. It was so good. "Jack, do you think you'll ever take up Korean again? You're 1/5 of the reason I'm learning it by the way" I don't know how becoming 1/5 of the reason plays into that I'm sure you have your reasons, but that's cool Good luck with it. I I hope that you you keep going with it I-I kind of gave up because I didn't really have a use for it anymore I was learning Korean because I was going out with a Korean girl at the time, and it was very very There was a very good reason for learning it then but after that ended I kind of didn't really have a way of practicing it regularly Practicing it regularly. I'm still learning English as you can see But I mean I'd love to go back to it, but I need I need more of a reason than just it being cool Because it was really awesome, and I love the fact that I I became Semi, fluent in another language that had never really happened before but because I had gone to Korea because I was talking to somebody in Korean like all the time, and I was just surrounded by it that's a way easier way of learning a language than if I was just to sit down here and go over notes and notes and notes because then... I don't study well. I'm a very visual based person and a lot of the Korean stuff I picked up was through body language and Through the body language of saying certain things that kind of stuck in my head a bit more than just reading it on a page if that makes any sense, I don't know I don't know how my brain learns but man, I would love to It's such- for anyone who wants to learn Korean, or if you want to learn an Asian language at all, Korean - I think - is the easiest one to learn Mainly because of the way their characters are written because Japanese and Chinese have more complex Characters in their alphabet, which is where Korean has very very simplistic characters in their alphabet It was designed that way by King Sejong, bless up, and he... was it King Sejong? I dunno. God I'm acting all confident and stuff now, and I probably don't know what I'm talking about But it was made to be in syllables so they're syllables are stacked and it's so easy to learn how to read Korean And... just the way the language is all put together everything I found it incredibly easy to start picking up So I think if I went back to it... I-I always watch stuff here and there like kpop music videos, or I watch Korean shows here and there I go back and I watch stuff from like Running Man or Mu Han Do Jun (Infinite Challenge) and stuff like that, and I'm like oh I remember those words Or I see it different places are like playing overwatch and watching some of the Korean eSports players There- just seeing at different places is some of it all like came flooding back So I think I'd pick it up again pretty easily if I went back "Why weren't you at elf practice?" Because I don't need to go to practice anymore, okay? I went to- I went to two semesters, and then everyone was like wait. You don't need to be here anymore You're a perfect elf, so I graduated with honors Immediately before finishing the 4-year mandatory course, so, get off my dick. "What are you most excited for in 2018?" I don't really have like a specific project or a specific video or a specific idea That I'm looking forward to most the thing I'm looking forward to most in 2018 is just *sigh* 
*stuttering* How do I- how do I phrase what I want to say... I'm most looking forward to the act of doing Because I mean just like leaving Leaving the sluggish year behind and going the complete opposite direction and going so super hard at all my projects and really involving myself in it again because got very disconnected with what I was doing for various different reasons I'm not gonna get into that but I'm I'm looking forward to getting back into what I... What I love doing and I think he can tell from the videos that I've recorded in like the last two weeks Or since I came back from the break from Christmas. I've been just so much more in tune with what I want. I'm more I'm so much more in tune with recording videos again. I'm excited about it again I'm really into what I do what I'm trying to make it like a fun entertaining Kind of thing to do again instead of just doing it to be like oh, I need to wake up and record videos again And doing it when I when I feel the energy for it rather than just doing it for the sake of doing it like right Now it's it's 1:00 a.m.. Right now I haven't done anything all day Because I wasn't feeling it and now this certain like burst of energy has come out of me And now I want to record so and now - I dunno - I'm just excited about the change that's about to come this year I think it's gonna be a really positive impact on the channel And I'm excited for you guys to be part of it as well "Do you ever play a game just for fun, but still act like you're recording?" I get this one a lot too a lot of people ask me this but Not- kind of but not really because whenever when I record games obviously I'm doing a commentary I'm entertaining I'm putting on like a show in a sense, so I can't just sit back and like let stuff happen I I need to interact I need to engage so any thoughts that are going on in my head are coming out verbally But normally if I'm recording or if I'm just playing games at home anyway If I'm on my own. I'm not really but if other people are kind of around me I am very vocal when I play games just because that's the way I am that's the way I play games and that's why I've said anything that I do in my videos isn't fake. It's, it's maybe me turned up to 11, but it's still me That's just kind of the way. I am anyway "What do you like most about what you do?" Honestly as cliche as it is to say, this kind of stuff. It's, it's the community aspect of what I do That's the most fun part of it all interacting with the people who watch your content because YouTube is a very Unique type of platform in that regard you can be an actor and you can make a movie But there's so much time between when you start that project when you get the role in that project To when it's actually out and you can interact with people about it Compared to what YouTube is her as I record this video now It's probably going to go up tomorrow And I get direct feedback from you always all the time. It can be a bit overloading sometimes, and some people from traditional media might think that that's a bad thing because it's too much. It's too much stimulus all the time. I love it. I love being so heavily involved with community. I love ... I-I just love being in the thick of it. I love interacting with all of you. I love talking with you. I love getting that vibe from what the channel is and seeing where people's heads are at, and just meeting new people and seeing everybody from different walks of life. I-I'm just fascinated by humankind and human behavior, and why people do the things they do, so just getting feedback from you all the time is a really great like peak behind that curtain. "What's the best pick-up line you've known?" They're lame, but there's two that always kind of stick with me.  One of them, which I heard again recently what it ... God what game was I playing? Oh, House party.  Where he said, "I lost my phone number. Can I have yours?"  Okay, it's so cheesy It's so dumb, but I just liked it and another one is ... *laughing*  It's a bit more straightforward, which is, "Did you sit in sugar, cuz you got a sweet ass." *laughing* "What did you think of the last Jedi?  I thought the part where Kylo and Leia did that dance battle to Africa by Toto is kind of strange. Also that part for Kylo ate raw eggs for 17 minutes straight was odd too?" *laughing* First off, well done.  Great memes Secondly, I actually didn't like it all that much.  When we went to watch it it was me Signe, Ethan, and Robin went to watch it after we did the charity stream and I had high expectations for it because, first off, I didn't really have that high expectations originally But then Disney came out and said that Ryan Johnson had gotten his own Original trilogy that he was allowed to after he directed this one so I was like, "Holy shit whatever he did in this movie must have really shaken some boots and really instilled a lot of confidence in Disney to allow him to do his own trilogy." So then I had high expectations for it, and then I heard a lot of people say really good things about it But what I'm ending to watch it I don't know it wasn't even that I had high expectations, and they were not met because I had high expectations for the force awakens too and They weren't really meant, but I still enjoyed that movie, but the last Jedi just has so many Pacing issues for so many writing and dialogue issues to so many character Arcs and plots and subplots and everything that are going on. I'm like why is this even in the movie this literally goes nowhere There's stuff with I'm gonna get slightly into spoilers. If you haven't seen it in your super sensitive to spoilers don't listen to me right now But the stuff with like Finn and rose going down to that planet literally serve no purpose Like by the end of it they're characters went nowhere It's sure there's a little bit of stuff at the end of it But so so many dumb decisions so much stuff that makes no sense that I don't think should have been in it There are some fantastic moments. There's a scene in the middle of it Agh ...  I don't spoil stuff, but the, the hyperspeed scene The the warp-speed scene if any of you know what I'm talking about.  That was some of the coolest imagery I've ever seen. Some of the stuff with Kylo and Rey was fucking phenomenal I love that, but it was just so much of in it that fell so flat and It felt a lot of what was set up in the force awakens just went nowhere or was just put out and then they didn't do anything with it because they didn't want to ... I don't know.  I ...  I-I just It left a bad taste in my mouth It's the first time I've ever watched a Star Wars movie where I don't want to watch it again "What music have you been listening to recently?" I've been listening to a lot of K-Pop. Especially BTS cuz I-I didn't really get into them what everybody else was talking about them a really big way but BTS are pretty good.  Bultaoreune (It's on fire, in Korean.  BTS reference). "Jack, what is the lockscreen and home screen background on your phone?" Okay, so I saw this picture on Reddit earlier in the year And it was just the cutest thing I've ever seen So I put it as my lock screen and my home screen because every time I unlock my phone now I get to see the cutest image, which is this Ugh, God it's this tiny dog in a jacket with his arms in the air. It's so fucking cute I love it so much so every time I unlock my phone. It's like, "eheheee ..." Oh.  It's the best. "Have you ever seen/been a parent of musical theater?  P.S. I hope to meet you someday, and I love you." Thank you. That's very sweet I hope to meet you someday as well, but I have I haven't been I've seen some musical theater But ages and ages ago when I was a teenager *being a dramatic* Oh that was years ago!  Or but I have been part of some theater. Just not musical theater I was ...  Well, I guess it was musical theater I just didn't sing anything myself, but I was part of some like acting stuff when I was in secondary school when I was like ... Sixteen? Sixteen and seventeen I think, I was I was Fryer Tuck in a Robin Hood Men in Tights kind of thing that we did And I had to wear like a really big fat belly suit, and then the next year we did Bugsy Malone And I was the titular character I was Bugsy, and that was really fun I really like that and booked him alone has some songs in it But we we changed it around we didn't do a lot of those because we didn't have the production But I really liked doing those I just love acting in all its forms, and I'd love to get into it in a more serious capacity. "What do you think is the saddest on-screen slash cinematic death?" Has to be, without doubt, Harry Potter in the Chamber of Commerce. That hit, that hit me so hard.  I cried. What are we going to do Ron? We can't let this law pass into legislation. "Are there any other hobbies like drumming you'd like to take off, but just haven't had the chance to start?" Maaan ... There's so many. There's so many hobbies that I want to take up But I know that if I start trying to do them all, then I'll just not enjoy any of them so some of them, like which would be hobbies for now, is like singing or acting those kinds of things I'd love to just learn more about my voice and learn more about how to, how to act in different scenarios and things like that.  I, that, that stuff is just so cool I'd love to learn how to dance But I don't think there's many like amazing dance schools around here, and it's also a case of me Just not having the time to do them and dedicate a lot of time to doing them properly except of if I was going to do them I'd love to do them properly, and really get some progress out of them, but I'd also like to I'd also like to learn more keyboard just for music sense Having drums is great, but I'd like to learn a more melodic Instrument and have something that I could actually write like full music too, but again I'm more I'm more visually inclined And I I just don't have the brain to listen to sit down and learn music theory in that kind of stuff But I did play keyboard recently and hafen set it up for anything yet, but maybe if I just start messing around with that We'll see what happens. "Is cereal soup?" Oh my god. I've never thought about that before Have I been eating cold soup? Every morning all along But I hate cold soup How can this be?! And that does it for this reading your comments video!  Yes, I know it's been a while since the last one I'm so sorry.  They just get away from me, and it's it's also a case of that I've done so many of them that by now I'm kind of getting the same questions over and over again Or I try and pick questions that have a bit more meaning to them or I can talk a bit more about them while also having the jokey-er answers because if it's just all jokes all the time then I feel like the reason I started doing these videos Is not there anymore because I love the sense of community that evolves out of these videos I love just being able to talk openly With people and whenever something comes up these were always a great outlet to be able to do that That's why I always said that I'd love to start a podcast Because it's a way for me to put more of my personality out there for you guys to be able to interact with and get more of my thoughts out there because when I'm recording a gameplay, I don't really get to like talk about relevant Topical things and I might not have talked about any here either But that's what reading comments were always kind of about, and if I ever did a podcast you'd be able to get more topical Subject matter that's more relevant at the time We're in right now, so I I want to do more of these again and
I'd love to get more comments from you case if you have any comments that are any questions that you would like me to answer Just leave them in there. I was gonna say in the description below That's not where they go leave me a comment down below on this video And I'll try and take some of them for the next episode, but thank you guys, but ALSO Thank you guys so much for watching this video.  If you liked it, PUNCH that like button in the face! Like a BOSS! And! High fives all around... Whhpsh! Whhpsh! But thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes... IN THE NEXT VIDEOOO! *outro music plays* I have a sore back. I'm an old man, my bones are dust. 
(High Five Sound) Top of the morning to ya laddies, my name is jacksepticeye! And welcome back to subnautica, but not only any subnautica This is the full release of subnautica. It has finally left early access, no more betas, no more alphas, nothing like that. This is the full public release of the game. It's finally finished, or into a state where the game is actually together now. We actually have a full game! No more bits and pieces and, that it's just an actual full game that we can play from start to finish. And I am SO excited. You guys know how absolutely much I adore this game. I love it to bits. It's one of my favourite games I've played on the channel. It's one of my favorite games I've played period. Just because of how much it surprised me and how much I got out of it and just how much How much journey I went on and how much I have emotionally attached and invested into this game now at this point and  I'm just so excited for the developers to finally have the game released because they had to push it back and push it back and Push it back, and now it's finally out, and it's just it's an emotional time. It's a great day It's it's a day that I-has been a long time in the making and I haven't played the game in a really long time But I wanted to I said I was going to come back when the full game was released I wasn't going to do the bits and pieces Content that I was doing and I wanted to wait for the game to actually be released fully before I played it again So I could do it some justice and I want to share Something because I got this a week early because the developers messaged me about it and sent it out And they sent it out to a bunch of youtubers. I imagine and a bunch of press and different things but They sent me a really nice message in the email, and I want to read out some of it I'm sure they won't mind because it was just lovely and they were very very grateful for it They gave me the code and everything and then they said "I also want to take a moment to thank you, so incredibly much for your support. You've helped our studio so much we almost went out of business a couple of times before you started playing Subnautica. Seeing your crazy adventures and listening to your zany humor lifted us up many times and helped us keep moving forward, and now thanks to you the world knows about the game, and we're living the dream." How incredible is that? I mean...they don't need to thank me for playing their game, because I think I would have just played it anyway because it was a cool game and I loved it so much. But the fact--it just shows the passion that they had for this project and how grateful they are for the people who played their game and saying that like you saved their business and because playing their game showed the world what it was and now they get to make the game fully, but I also get to live their dreams of being game developers. It's--it's the most flattering thing a person could--could be told about the types of content they make so... thank you everybody, um, who made the game. It's--it's, I'm just so happy for you, that the game is finally out. BUT (Loud) Enough talkin', Let's explore-in'! So, I don't know. Oh, I have an old save. You know what, delete that--delete that shit. Get that shit out here, we don't need that anymore; we are starting afresh. We are starting anew and we're going to go Hopefully from start to finish. I don't know how this is going to go, I don't know what's changed in the game But I want to go start to finish. Ooh so you can do all these: Oxygen food pressure story and death disa--Oh, the stories disabled, so I don't want to do that Uueemm So hardcore is survival mode with only one life if you die No, oh two alerts, and you're dead. It's perma death Survival is *slurring* crash on-land-on-a-dangerous-alien-planet-scavenge-resources-and-manage-hunger. So this is easy mode you can do this you have no hunger or thirst Uhhh-Part of me kind of wants to do that one because I just want to experience the story I've done the hunger thirst side of things for so long, but I I just want to experience the game...fully now. Oh! This little logo is new. I'm gonna be pointing out everything that's new by the way, or at least the stuff that I realize is new. I'm so excited! I've been waiting for AGES to get back in to Subnautica. It's one of the--as I've said--It's one of the-it's one of the best series I've done on the channel, at least I think so and everybody   seems to have loved it, and we had so many great memories back when I played it the very first time and And that's very hard thing to replicate with any series that I've ever done. I'm Just so incredibly invested in this game at this point *reading* "Press any button to continue." Okay. Story me up good. Whoo Oh, yeah some of this was in the original WHOOOOAAAA It's like space mountain! It's hard to- Whooaaaaa I mean it's easy to forget that the Aurora was actually a spaceship. I-I Played the game so many times now where the aurora has been Crash-landed in the ocean that I keep thinking of it is just an ocean. OOooOOOowwwWW I keep thinking of it as an ocean base. I keep forgetting that it was an actual spaceship that we were on that crash-landed Okay, okay, we're in. Man, the visuals are really nice. Okay, you gotta get out. You gotta put out those fires. Oh god we're right into it, Okay, I am in control baby. Ahhhh! I'm on fire There we go, woah, okay, thank god. Whoa WOAH HAHAHAAA! That's all new! Neat-o! Yeah, I'd agree. Woah Directive...? (Alterra assistant, Cindy) please refer to the the data bank for detailed survival advice, good luck. (Jack) Awww thanks Cindy. Uueeeemmmm Cool! So all of the icons are all changed, and the--the PDA itself is just completely different Neat-o burrito! Alrighty-roo. Now the problem lies with--I actually don't know where to start Because I played the game so often and every time I've kind of come back I've kind of used different means and methods to- OoOoohHh I have stuff (inhales) I've used different means and methods to kind of brute force the game and get through certain sections, but now I mean we just crash-landed. That's it. Let's go up and explore the world! Yeah, baby. So am I really the only person that survived this entire thing and of everybody that might have been on board- How many were on board? Twelve? Uuuueeemmmm Out of everybody was on board, I'm the only one that survived? That's a little crazy. Aahhh I got an achievement: getting your feet wet. (I'm) so excited. I'm gonna take my time with this as well, because I love this game and I love playing it and I just love being in this world and all that kind of stuff so... Oh god I already have an alien egg. I think I'm gonna take my time with it. I mean you know you have a choice now because I'm gonna have to um I'm gonna have to build everything again myself, and I don't know the ins and outs of how I -- oOh my O2 shit because I don't have a tank I don't know the ins and outs of how I go about leaving I know that people talked about howwwww How you actually leave the game is building your own rocket ship or at least getting a rocket ship somewhere? It was something that was in the files for a long time So I don't know how I actually do that. There's still a lot of basics or I have a long way to go Some of this I might have to do in my own time off camera just cause'... it would just take forever for me Hey hey! Yeah, thanks, okay FISH! Thanks, okay. We're gathering up metal and fish and food and all this kind of stuff. I need a bladder fish though. Bladder fish! Thanks Cyndee you're the best companion to have may have unexpected applications Okay, I like the UI now as well. I mean some of this was that was like that when I played at last like the stuff from the bottom left, but I just - really like how it looks okay, maybe make I Make a repair tool an air bladder. I don't need that habitat builder Flashlight repair tool any titanium caves sulfur silicone rubber Okay, I'm a crook my peepers Thus rendering them safe for human consumption Not gonna lie like fucking magic Cindy how this thing works? Completely blowing my mind right now Could you just metal me all up there real good? Thanks Titanium is the lifeblood of this game So titanium ingot silicone rubber creepvine seed clusters. It's kind of weird being in the game. Fully now I can't imagine what it's like for people who are just getting into the game cuz I kinda know where everything is now I Mean a lot of it. I'll forget Whoa Ahh, is that the animation if I would've left it for the first time HI buddy Okay because I know over there is the island you can see it within those clouds right there and over there is the other Island Cuz you can see it in those clouds right there, and I don't think they've added that much more to the game It's just all the areas that were in the game around now All kind of fully fleshed out, but I dunno if you go in this direction you get creepvines! Cuz I've done this a million bajillion times REEFBACKS!! I'm back reefback! Well, you don't I don't Don't care about you guys you guys are like in the starting area, and then I never see you ever again And you're fucking useless to me But my my reef back your buddies over here wait, I just saw them where did you go? Haha, man, I wish I could get back I envy Immensely anybody who is playing this game again for the first, er, is playing this game for the first time wait inventory full Because I would give anything to experience this game for the first time again There are few games that I'd I'd give to experience for the first time again Shadow of the Colossus Blood-borne Dark Souls even Zelda breath of the wild just cuz it amazed me a bunch of times this game is one of them because This is a game that kind of freaked me out the first time I played it if you remember back when I was playing it It was like all the freaky ocean kind of stuff. Ooo a waterproof locker. I don't want that A watuhploof lockur It was one of those things that kind of freaked me out because... Because you're in an ocean and being in the ocean was just already scary enough- oh you have a lot of titanium But then when you when you couple that with the fact that when you were walking around you just heard like *Imitates Reef Back noise* That was some scary shit Ooo, Nice Okay, you give me too much food. I can't eat you just yet Filtered water filter water okay. You're all the same Nice. We are at 72 health. And then like my reaction to the first Reaper that I saw Was such an amazing moment because it was so genuine When I was swimming along, and then I was like wait, what's that? I knew they were like bigger creatures in the game But I thought it was like reef backs and stuff, and I was like maybe there's something else maybe there's like a big bad somewhere and I was going along and I was over by the Aurora And I saw the tail drift away and I was like what is that and of course I went in closer to it, like everybody does in a fucking horror movie and Then all of sudden the thing turned around and came at me and it my reaction to that was fucking hilarious Because I had no idea what was happening, I didn't know how to react to it I loved it. LOVE this game So good And even like the the very late episodes of playing this I was still coming across stuff that I had never seen before What wh- Vehicle Bay fragment? Could I just scan you? I don't have a scanner or anything Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh! Okay, we're fine. Ooof... Okay, I have a very very long way to go in this game There's a lot of stuff I have to build. I don't even know if it's worth building Many bases anymore before I was just building them to figure out how I built them and now it's the case of being like well You need to build them in the most optimum locations because otherwise You're fucked How many silicone rubbers I need? I think I'm gonna need one actually I think I just bought got a bunch of creepvine seed clusters now for no reason I'm only building a repair tool because this place needs to be repaired Should check out what else I can make? Or should be making um Where are my tools? What are you? Equipment! Fin silicone rubber trans translate vertical limb movements underwater into forward thrusts. Hell yes. I also want to make an air tank, what do I need to make an- Ooo! Okay um Sweet so now I have I have these oh wait no go back in it was just a plus on them I thought it was gonna leave me something, but that's very good. That's a good start. These are two essentials high-capacity o2 tank glass titanium and silver ore Okay, so I need to get some quartz I'm just going to find out all this stuff first. Just why I can have them because I have to use lubricant for a lot of stuff later on it's just nice to have it Right what did I need for my repair tool cave sulfur and silicone rubber and titanium Okay, I need to make another silicone rubber because they just used the one Ohh, I'm fucking with whittling it down into lubricant when I needed the clusters. That was dumb, okay, I'll go get more. Oh, it's dark Hello Majora's Mask Jesus oh, it's already creepy again Man the visuals are gorgeous now, and I mean we're only very very start of the game So I don't know how much that is gonna change, but the game runs really well But again it was late. It was later on That stuff started to run badly because you end up getting a bigger inventory And you have a lot of different locations that need to load in so we'll see what happens. I assume it runs better I mean it's the full release of the game We ain't talkin'- We ain't talkin' baby stuff here no more Let me just get a bunch of you God oh god. Oh god. Oh god Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Ahh! Were you even near me Probably not, but I heard the snippy snap of your jaws. I don't like it. I also need more fish come here peepers.

Shit yeah, I need to build a suit, don't I There we go I have a hundred and two food That doesn't even make no God dang sense. All right, I'm gonna make a few silicone rubbers just the way I have it my dude is running out of power Security test failed, secondary system offline Radio offline distress sig- Ok I need to build a thing quick Go go go go go go gadget Right cave sulfur is that inside those little dudes who thinkin you who come after you I? I don't know, but I guess we'll find out Caves caves, okay, I can't see shit. It's so much darker in this game now, ooh Light oohs yeah, I would know if we got quartz so now we have enough glass we should be able to make a High-capacity o2 tank So I need to take this one out put it in my inventory yeah Whoa that one looks cool Jesus I had 75 now 135 Nice one okay, that's very very good And I don't think I need to do anything else right now Maybe drink a little Wawa.

Jesus!!! oh BOIIII Grav trap? - fuck is a grav trap when it's at home The boys want to find out- Seaglide is very very useful yes Need to make one of those pieranto..(?) Don't need more Seaglide fragments Okay, I feel like when I scan enough of them And they get the thing you should just evaporate them from the world and replace them with good stuff Jesus Christ. Hi Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, yeah I agree Sandra right The fuck does she know?. Oh where oh where has my little dog gone It's getting dark and I'm scared and I don't want to be here! So let's go back to Henry, Henry's good, Henry's nice Henry takes care of me All right Henry, I'm underneath'cha. I want to try and see what's needed for the sea glide Mobile vehicle bay is very very useful. That's how we make our little sally's But I want to figure out this one first sea glide Sea Glide Seaglide! battery, lubricant, copper wire, titanium Feel like your boy is capable of this yes Okay, what else battery lubricant titanium I have all these things Naisu (Nice), see this is why you plan ahead? Not just a dumb factory my friend! my god that was big Save me are you trying to teach me how to subnautica right now, I know I am The King the master of subnautica The originator, the OG, I got this baby, don't you even worry about jack. On the way down No you don't want to antagonize them no, that's a That's a bad. That's the that's the dude Evidence suggests that a substantial number if not all the local species Reproduce through egg-laying. Eggs can be found resting on the seafloor buried beneath detritus or even wedged into cracks in the rock Different species likely favour different biomes as their nesting grounds eggs discovered in the wild are in some form of natural Stasis likely awaiting ideal conditions in which to hatch or the delivery of some vital enzyme Which will kick-start the process and that's going to come in very very relevant later on in the game It is impossible to calculate the species of the egg from the exterior However it may be possible to simulate a hatching responsive and eggs location was suitable in containment Okay Then you- Aw, you did upload it to my location oh that's nice when you hover over them it actually shows their information That's a very very necessary... UI improvement. Very good developers, I like. Anything new in here? A rebreather conserves oxygen when diving deeper absorbs and recycles co2 into breathable air. Okay? Maybe we should make that   I've nothing on my head right now Do need to make a mesh Isn't the mesh made out of creepvine pieces Wiring kit just needs silver ore x2. Do I not have more in here Damn it Had a lot of silver ore at one point I used it all to make the stuff I have. Is it day time yet? Hey, it is. Okay? There is a very very valuable Where the fuck am I? where's the Aurora God I was all backwards. It's a very very valuable tube Somewhere over here Like one of those coral tubes that I can go into Can't remember where it was.. It's a really big long tube. Hey another one. I'll be back to there listen to you in a minute Hopefully it's my new favorite song that you're playing on the radio. Okay, honestly. I have no idea where that tube was It was like a big dandy boy oh Here it is nice Okay, this just looks like part of the rock formation the reason this is very valuable is because it is absolutely covered in all of these deposits Copper silver titanium you name it, baby. We got it Okay no silver though, I need silver Please a copper titanium, that's all well and good in the hood but It's not silver, Oh Silver's in sandstone outcrops not the limestone ones Sandstone outcrops have the more precious metals lead gold and silver may be something else, but I don't know right now Okay, I I have two silvers now ah Shut up, Cindy. I'm only joking. I love you, you're the best back to Henry Henry Henry Henry Hi, buddy. I'm coming back. I need to put some stuff in you and you need to make it into other stuff Do you think you can do that Henry you think that you you do that for Jack for good old times sake I? Think you can Outta my way, fuckin fish Wasn't making a wiring kit with this No, I want that wiring kit, what was I making? God have the attention span of a fucking spoon And a habitat builder or rebreather and fibermesh oh Aw, is my fish dead? Get me a lot of food, but my Wawa has gone way down, okay Are you gonna get some bladder fishes, but I'm gonna get those on the way over to the creepvine zone The creepvine zone to the creepvine zone everybody get to the creepvine zone Where everybody is respected and everything is expected to be awesome? That's what happens in the creepvine zone. Ah Fucker nuts. I don't has a knife. I can haz knife? come here, you bladder. I can just make a knife apparently The massacre on Abraxas Prime. the knife remains the only exception following the massacre The fuck happened Did shit go down that i missed? was i not part of the massacre. Oh yes, yes indeedy for scuba stevie! very nice We should get this salt actually Now i got no room Cool dude get those creep vines I'm inventories full What- oh my god. They're so fucking big Well ok drop the mushrooms can I eat fit another one now? Otherwise I'm just gonna be going back and forth like a dumbass whoa Pathfinder Pathfinder tool deploys holographic Pathfinder disks used to map a way back out of caves or hard to navigate spaces That's awesome they were never in the game before Fibermesh so my stuff has been updated now since I got this Since I picked up some creep vines okay, rebreather, so you pick up the items Then it kind of gives you some blueprints for what you can do with that Coolie-oh. should I make some more silicon bush yes should because otherwise just taking up space Let's make a waterproof Locker Do i? Do i deploy you outside? Wait why're you all the way down here What the fuck, I didn't send you there Do you not float?? Okay, I'm just putting you inside Henry then. can I put you inside Henry? I want to be able to put you inside Henry. That's what I want to do Can't top the item here use storage containers to say Troubled I am. can I put it on top of Henry? Cheatsy little hobbitses. right, let's put some of this stuff in here cuz i don't need you Definitely don't fuckin need gold right now And some of my flares and this creature egg okay lots of space Alright right gonna leave this first episode of subnautica here. We made some decent progress Probably could have made it a bit faster, but you know what I'm exploring again. I'm learning again I'm figuring this all out again, but we made a seaglide, knife, scanner, repair tool already off to a fantastic start after this Maybe mobile vehicle bay. I need to find the rest of the parts for that cuz then I can start making a Sally I i miss Sally and then we can start exploring further reaches and then going after these areas and we Can figure stuff out you're fucking miles away, though Anyway, thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face like Like a boss! And, high fives all around... Thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes... In the next video!! Man it feels good to be back in this game. I missed it so much.

He's in the chamber of commerce all those mamzers. He blocked every proposal. I ever put forward kike this and kike that He's been trying to ruin my business for years. He's confessing! Mr. Khallu, I'm charging you with the first-degree murder of Everett gage. I Respect your beliefs and your right to hold them I got I hope for your sake The jury can commute to murder in the second degree may God have mercy on you sir Ah. ‚ô™ You're the bad guy, you're the bad guy.

I got him Yes, the fully done the officer folks bring it in it is just officer thumbs I think that yeah, yeah, bring your dear sir ah Get yourself two suits get them pressed You'll be needing them Oh daddy, yay I did it. I caught the bad *with detective accent* yeah back in my office again just *with detective accent* Just climbing that corporate ladder trying to find my way into the justice system So I can wipe out all the badness that is in the world Then we just write that down as very good The best detective the world has ever seen way better than my partner detective terrible detective for I am ~Detective sexy~ okay? Well that does it for another fun-filled episode of LA noire detective action detective Jackson back in Detective action, that's my catchphrase. That's what I'm going to do to kind of find the bad and kill the Justice injustice. No now kill the justice kill the injustice okay, climb the ladder. It's it's hard. It's hard to figure out What kind of cop I want to be so far get me a good cop and get me back up Still off and off. I don't know what you're on I want to be yet, but very very fun I love this I think there's a bit more to So I might continue this and keep it going and see where it leads to because I'm having a ton of fun If it was just a straight like Stand and listen to the characters talk kind of thing and then all of a sudden you point to the things that Maybe led to evidence It would have been so much would have been so much more boring than it actually is I'm so glad They gave you like the arms to mess around with Because I know everyone who makes a game like this once their game to be taken seriously because a lot of the stuff That's going on is serious but when you give the character the ability to be able to do all this stuff like you just give them freedom to do what they want and That is what is most important in a game like this. I think especially in VR There's a reason you do stuff in VR And that's to give players Control over what they want to do So you can play it seriously if you want you can play as an actual detective or you can do what I do Which is create your own fun to make yourself laugh, and do all this stuff and pinch nipples and everything It's just so much fun. I'm so glad they made this and also the thing that impresses me most about this is not only Is the physics of it all and seeing the characters up-close and seeing like? When you play la noir you get to see the characters And you see their faces react to stuff here and there in the game But when it's in like HTC vive and it's up in your face And you actually see them up close sure the textures are a little crummy looking and sometimes. It doesn't blend together well BUT, It's very impressive, and it actually feels like you're talking face-to-face with a real person which is so bizarre because I've never really had that in the Vive yet everything all the characters in video games are usually a lot worse looking So I don't know it's very very impressive what the thing that impresses me the most is the driving I didn't think it would've it would have been so easy for them to just be like okay We need to go here, and then just warp to the next destination like you click on your car And then you're all all of sudden there, and you can do that But they gave you the option to actually be able to drive around in the city, which is so cool I didn't think that they'd be able to do that I didn't think many games would try that because usually that's the stuff that breaks the game when you when you see that stuff it's what It's you when you do that in a game It's usually those things that you have to craft a way bigger world and then because of that you're run into restrictions And you have to break the game a small bit, so I'm just so glad that they kept it in it works So well and I'm having a blast playing it very very highly recommended but for now Thank you guys so much for detectiving with me this time if you liked it punch injustice in the face Like a cop and bad cops 'round *high five noises Thank you guys and I will see all you dudes In the next video! It's hard being a cop you know what like I put the badge down and go home and have a whiskey 
my name is jacksepticeye and welcome back to Batman the enemy within so we just did episode 2 I stream that a couple of days ago that's up in the channel still if you want to go watch that before he watched this because this isn't going to make any sense otherwise but we're on to episode 3 called the fractured mask and last time we ganged up with Hurley and mr. freeze and Bane and we tried to do a thing and we robbed a bunch of stuff and then we robbed the casket that had the Riddler in it so I don't know what we're doing with that and then Catwoman showed up again at the end so I'm curious to see how this is all gonna play out but as the pressure to uncover the impending attack on Gotham intensifies Bruce navigates his dual identity and his relationships with his new allies so I have to stay in with them I have to hopefully we have a is Batman a bit more of the same last time it was kind of all Bruce and I like Batman I want to see I want to kick the shit out of people again but he got beat up a pain real bad so he can't really do that no more well I'm curious to see how they the politics and the tensions fly between all the characters I wear the masks in order to protect this city but when faced with a new breed of criminals calling themselves the pact the direct approach was met with disaster I had to dawn a different mask as Bruce Wayne I infiltrated their ranks the plan was to get in and set the trap and get out but the plan failed now they're one step closer to their goal and all I have are questions what is the pact really after why steal Riddler's body Friend or Foe nice place you got here did it come with the vermin or did you add that yourselves it's a little rundown but the rent is rights this everyone Riddler said you had a luchador in the mix bang oh he came down with the case of the left behind oops we are the entirety of our cabal at the moment oh this gentleman was someone we picked up after Riddler's departure Bruce Wayne Bruce was it John I believe we've met be gentle this is mr. whoopee first and then we met again and again and again and again I'm a virgin huh no Shante oh I didn't know this party was so formal you got the toy we talked about beautiful get the lady sparklies out of the safe John she ain't the one that's out of the goodness of her heart like the rest of us Brucie be a doll and give Kitty a hands I ain't touching that popsicle what we do I got some thinking to do hey guys let's get to what are we doing well we're going to extricate the body Yui built a secret backdoor into the security system of his old employer oh I need to scan his eyes and then create a retinal key for them then I'll use the key to make goggles and we can open whatever doors he could no no goggles to go swimming and then I'll swim to fulfill my destiny and to be what my dad wanted me to be sorry Edward this wasn't the original plan he was supposed to be alive but things change that has had in a good position put it down by your balls ah that's far enough dig the plates under his lids press the button and scan away I don't want to do this that's gross poor Riddler okay we do it in hell did they do to him and what's with the refrigerator coffin why would the agency transport him like this this doesn't add up Bruce yep Bruce I'm sorry about Lucius I'm guessing it wasn't a gas leak or whatever the news said you're right Riddler killed him it was meant for me damn it Bruce this isn't all on you on to the next again I can't even touch my own eyeballs or anything I thought I oh I didn't know what I'd be walking into with this group but I certainly didn't expect it to involve you and I know you're no stranger to peril but you shouldn't be here so what gives I wouldn't exactly say I'm part of the team also the sky is blue now you say another obvious thing this is the game we're playing whatever your plan was must have gone horribly arrived for you to end up here like this yeah you think I mean options one question make it fast why are you here how did you get involved with these Psychopaths run into Harley once or twice but I knew Riddler he tried to bring me in before well before someone here probably killed him miss bebas never looked so good John pay the lady don't spend them all in one place you get the rest when we're inside that wasn't the deal I made with Riddler take it up with him excuse me Edward yeah oh shit oh shit you overstepped when you left him and now it's time to pay the price No oh shit Oh this one's actually got some brains everyone else better be smart too you are a means to an end this is over did it occur to any one of you people that the job we just pulled went sideways a little too quick I think they knew we were coming because a little rats told them Bane was right to beat up his guy before we left to hit the convoy he just beat up the wrong one since he couldn't deliver I'm taking over the case I'm not gonna let whoever it is what I want this leak hit nearly caused the demise of Gotham's favorite luchador luchador so now no one moves no one breathes without my say-so cuz I'm gonna get to the bottom of this and whoever it is it's gonna find their inside suddenly alfresco that make you nervous Bruce know what you have to say it's pretty cool I'm never nervous do I look nervous to you it's that way be excuse me peanut gallery you got something to say Wayne pulled his own out there salt with my own two eyes and I ain't gonna let a good effort going noticed thanks criminal then let's get back to work if anyone else has any issues with the new worlds what uh my door was always open okay leave us to our prize and all will be forgiven Wayne come here a second does Ben have a harp tattoo on his back the harp is the symbol of Ireland thanks for bouncing back there hey it's tough in the trenches we got to look out for one another otherwise like a Bruce thanks guess you clear for now because apparently you're so capable I got an errand for ya I know just about everything about Riddler's plan but he kept one card close to his chest the location of the job I took the secret to his grave now I got his laptop but look at this and keep your Yap shut he'll in any of these monks sense weakness it's encrypted well it's like he knew not to trust any of us try calling IT did you try plugging it out and putting it back in again you come in okay let me see the laptop I'm pretty tech savvy maybe I can crush loose in case you missed it we have a mole problem and until we clear that up the keys to the kingdom stay with me got it viola had a beef with his former employers who were cooking up some very dangerous and super fun stuff at a black site lab somewhere here in Gotham and what is it we're after this super fun stuff you ask a lot of questions you know that's yeah cuz I'm trying to do a job place together most of his plan except where the black site is you're gonna find the location and when you do maybe you'll get a treat all week for us little treats you're asking me to do something with little or no information to go on and when I asked you for some kind of clarification you dodged Bruce did you see what just happens I'm in charge here you're Jeremy when I asked you to bring me something you deliver it no questions asked see I ain't letting this laptop out of my sight until I clear up this more problem so I've want you to head over to Riddler's place and do some diggin I might need some help the place is full of death traps like John with you know Johnny boy don't get him hurt that's my job road trip Bruce I'm Ashley I was thinking Catwoman after all she knew him mmm good points take it - I'll grab some snacks haha John so cute it's precious what's that guy's story never a dull moment with John around yeah wholly trust so I get the feeling that's not a good thing who's ready to hit the road he's so cute gonna tell if you see anything that ain't on the up-and-up you don't Bruce is my best friend he never betrayed me oh sweet innocent puddin friends have the easiest access to stab you in the back oh that's a good line now get out of here I call I could want that black site location fine shut up god you're fucking annoying I won't like Harley in this like and all the other iterations Harley's capable and she's strong and she's ready to go but her in charge is just really weird she kind of comes annoying then oh well we'll see how it plays out we don't look conspicuous where he decided to set up shop wasn't like him to slum it I always thought the event part or was an odd choice I mean the mold risk - away and who asked me to steal a Renoir that's for sure Catwoman we need to find us away my specialty come on John you're with me yes first team up yeah all right Waller glad you answered We Need to Talk listen about the convoy we couldn't get you safely the EMP blast knocked out my ability to communicate with my field agents sorry it obviously wasn't supposed to go down like that well innocent people died because of your emotion you think I don't know that the maniacs butchered my agents my friends I can't take losses like this I need to lean on you even more now Bruce you being inside it's our best hope well now they have Riddler's body it was cryogenically frozen by the agency Bruce this was a 60 year old man who went toe-to-toe with Batman I have some very interested researchers who wanted to see what kept him ticking punchline it's fine John there's a black sign some sort of research lab I'm guessing whatever's there is what they're after and Harley doesn't know the location why she asked me to fight stay put for now and maintain your cover at all costs this is our chance to get ahead of this trade I'll use my expert skills in the perimeter is boarded up but it's nothing we can't get through they delayed lead the way hoodie tag just have to get through these boards don't worry I brought my key let me give it okay Shaymin share-alike is what I always say

we just went to his apartment that's even worse than Ikes this isn't the black site no Mike the man I knew was flawed but he could still muster a little warmth huh sounds like you knew a very different Riddler than the one I met I wish she'd never come back to Gotham me too no one's beyond reach that's a good line there's hope for everyone I don't think any of us are beyond reach I know we've just met but somehow I knew you'd say that genuine best what do you think he'd keep any info on what we're after well not to state the obvious but it's probably behind a riddle or a puzzle somewhere oh I call the downstairs man careful John this place is probably a deathtrap follow him Bruce I don't want John's curiosity to get us killed I'm getting really tempted to touch something don't do it John all right here ooh do much without my bat suit how many TVs is one guy need probably afraid he'd miss something [Music] you were here Bruce you know you know what what went down death chamber [Music] like you gotta admire the edge like that the lock is a question wonderful toy it's a wonderful way to lose your hand well you know what they say curiosity killed the cat he's something

[Music] yeah so I have to lay in the bed hey cab woman hey money man that's not my superhero name how did you and Riddler first meet you know I do a lot of freelance work let me guess rather wanted a painting from the Louvre without dragging too much it was an easy job huh after all I'd already robbed the place twice he became a valuable contact when money was tight okay so why are you really here I said I tell you when we're alone we're not I'll tell you later okay where's my last Jeremy did you ever think about me you know that night we had oh it was beautiful I'm just curious if you yes you

I mean to fulfill it I'm John could you give us a moment Oh gotcha gotcha okay Bruce is good at playing everybody it's something charming and unnerving at the same time yep so now that we have a moment how to fill me in oh oh are you doing this with it Bruce what's going on I'm undercover for yourself isn't Bruce Wayne kind of always undercover or is it the other way around no yes I'm undercover working with a group called the agency partnered up with people huh good to hear you've grown a bit sorry if I was a little rattled at the clubhouse back there wasn't quite ready to see her face again but you were good even with what looks like a piercing gone wrong not great or anything you know crates you can be nice whatever you look great too I didn't say great I said good okay duly noted ow my pride now it's my turn why are you here you're not really in bed with this pact and what if I am maybe I need the money maybe I don't you're better than that you keep saying that you're like a broken record just another minute we've got it under control John fine what you've got a job to do remember let's just see what this is all about yeah harsh all deponents [Music] if encrypted so see ya PowerPoint there must be something nearby we can use SUNY I'm just gonna turn on my computer whoa try a password [Music] Sam and the USB port hmm 3.0 not USB C we might be fought USB Drive [Music] do you really just leave a USB Drive lying around that's gonna hack through his encrypting at that stage is not even hacking detected accessing Santa's project loaders files really project loaders Sanctus retinal scan required I haven't made the goggles yet retinal scan time out nice you know what Sanctus is don't you I heard stories on jobs best I can piece together they are a group up to no good is generous there it's scary great one thing's for sure we're not getting any more info off that thing yeah well there's always Riddler's laptop Harley still has it the Decrypter probably works with that as well everything okay down there send the lift back up this should have come back sooner and real to Riddler in but I didn't knowing he was tangled up with Sanctus and what he did to Lucius this is my fault my mess to clean up by yourself I can help why do I look like I need your help you don't have the code to do what needs to be done here Bruce you want to do this your way you'll have to beat me to it you doing balancing the scales you are not leaving here with that honey I'm already gone John uh-huh time to use my bat brain shit nice resourceful as always how uncool [Music] Viper's it's been fun [Music] that thing's pretty cool oh fuck yeah oh fuck yeah John Marty you haven't gotten past me yet slow down coming up blurry [Music] do you think this is our superheroes think in their heads do you think this is how they see everything though it's so emotional the time gets robbed I forgot how scared you are with your hands [Music] [Music] considering we just met mr. Wayne this is dirty [Music] just a fine stretch over Samantha's fancy straight from the pub yeah yep yeah bones and organs Catwoman why sorry Bruce but I'm taking Harley's laptop for myself and I'm finishing this my way hmm Harley's laptop huh you and I are going to talk somewhere else well shouldn't have tried to kiss her that was stupid why did I do that I just what front leg it was a moment to kiss you know tensions were high hey John that's the stuff I want one cafe taste so John about the laptop you know I'm the first guy who resort to stealing from anyone anyone but her but in a way that almost makes it or in another way maybe I tell her getting their good graces maybe I will maybe I'll do just that then she remembered my name as an H in it she always spills it jail him and how do you think Harley feels about snitches she told me to snitch I think she likes oh well mm-hmm maybe not I don't know Bruce I'm torn here just thinking about her makes me feel like I'm floating she's the most intriguing creature ever to grace me with a demeaning insult that's how you get which is great that's how you ask somebody out from now on I want more Bruce I'm a little ashamed to say that dance had my pulse pounding we rock hard what's your relationship your real one woman I am what we have is a little tangled up oh I wouldn't give to be that tangled up with Harley I've only Harley saw me like really saw me the world's a crazy place isn't it I want Harley and you want the laptop maybe we can come to an arrangement I help you with Harley I see you're up to bat then wait I get it what woman how can I get that with Harley okay see what you do is you take your tongue I'm then okay how can I make her see me pull her strings okay or be yourself John well being yourself isn't really working but that's the best advice rather than pull her strings put her strings see what happens people aren't as complex as you make them out to be Harley smart but she's still human she can be manipulated just like anyone else anyone huh how does one go about performing this magic trick let's find a problem they have and then make sure they think you are the only one who could solve it once they have to rely on you they're yours we're social animals John might as well exploit mr. wave but how do you know what makes them tick too bad you can't just take a look you just need to talk to him just they'll reveal themselves soon enough give them something small about yourself something insignificant that maybe they already know but you act like it's a confession and then you watch the floodgates open I see I see yeah that reminds me did I ever tell you I was locked up in a mental hospital nice dress [Laughter] I've learned that manipulation can take on many forms some of them more subtle than others tell me more tell me everything get inside their head once you know how they think you know what they want and you use that you know one of the doctors in our code tried to get in here wait I have an idea let's try it out now first thing that comes to your head what do you see napkin with honey pearls night pearls I saw pearls before I saw bats pearls like a broken necklace how quick your mom that's emblematic of loss right there I've lost two rows did you know you're not supposed to put a new male guinea pig with a female who just had bumps I didn't I didn't do you know what they do they kill them all of them and not because they're evil no it's just biology no one can help what's in their DNA I got I got I got I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA your interesting case study mr. Wayne I think you might be a danger to yourself and others is what dr. Leland don't say to me what do you see I see me one of my coffee back I see Gotham no it looks like a amaze the alleyways of Gotham uh a complicated path the way out isn't clear you ever do the mazes in a bag of those activity magazines and doctors waiting yeah they suck I have a ton of them been waiting my whole life just to be seen what an illuminating evening this has been Bruce I feel like we're on the verge of a break let's try just one more John sorry something just came up it's business I have to run so soon it's fine a for effort I guess I won't go tattling - hardly so will you help me get the laptop gosh Bruce we did have a good back-and-forth with the tests I feel so much closer it's your relationship with John has changed drive a hard bargain mister wait okay let me Mull over the logistics but I'm in me back at the subway when you're done with your business and because we're pals coffee's on my dime I don't even drink any of it you just spilled it everywhere Bruce Oh John John's not dog I'm still not buying it I'm not buying him at all I'm sure he'll I'm sure he's already had it figured out yes Batman action again Jim evening oh it's good you're here the last time I fired this up you didn't show that me concerned what do you mean the agency convoy all those freaks were in one place and you decide not to show I didn't like you I've seen the middle of them who took time off so what kept you I was there Jeff you just didn't see me of course I know you can be trusted I just wish they hadn't gotten away me too because I can't really talk we got there late but then it was just pain he still beat us to a pulp and got away is that all no I I get a favor desk what's up Lucius Fox I know he was your friend I don't mean to speak ill of the dead but I think he might have been up to some shady stuff before Riddler's attack on Wayne Tower though I might not have been the man you thought go on not entirely think carefully about your next words Jim I've been thinking about him since a moment I threw that switch Riddler had it out for Lucius Fox and I'm sure there's something more the way you're pushing back on this only confirms that Waller's shut down any investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death and that means something stinks in Denmark you could follow that stitch all the way to foxes and all the way to Sweden look just how much do you really know about Bruce Wayne I keep forgetting who knows and who doesn't know I guess that's the point I see we are going to this but you're on the wrong trail Bruce Wayne is helping you well if he's helping us he has a real funny way of doing it I'm right here at first I thought Fox was at the center of it all but there's a hell of a lot more a Wayne Enterprises security guard comes to GCPD saying he was assaulted by Harley Quinn and her gang and who was leading her around like a pet Bruce Wayne then I checked the video recordings someone did it amateur job covering up the security footage files will replace time unaccounted for sloppy afraid and strike three he flashes enough cash at one of my officers to get into Riddler's old workshop why Wayne even dropped my name with Bullock like I'd back him up dirtbags got stones like it or not Bruce Wayne is dirty and he's dangerous Waller knows all of this happened too and she refuses to let me move on it poor Jean so I need you to bring him in that's the favor I can't do it but you can I can keep an eye on Bruce wait Jenna I'm not asking for an eye I want him delivered here with a little bow gods I'm safety is slipping out from under me and I can't stand it I know your friend Catwoman's in town got a rap sheet there to put her away for life maybe I can't move on Bruce Wayne but I can't move on her I should have done this a year ago dropping you threats and walking away you've hit a new low Jim I'll learn to live with it as soon as I get back to the office I'm sitting at a task force after Oh Jim and you you better not tell her we're coming Gordo sounds like he's on a ballpark well if I want Selena she gets away Gordon and the police will blame me but if I don't I put her in danger don't forget that you'll burn down to that laptop God might be your best chance to slow her down unfortunately we're running out of time it's my fault corners like this I want to tell him everything I chaired secrets poison relationships Bruce yeah but to protect this city to protect yourself he can't know you know miss Kyle is going to run sooner or later it's her nature how much can you really trust her as an ally I know how you feel about her she kissed me well hidden cloud your judgment we both want to take down pact now I know for certain allies are short supply these days I know you've worked together in the past but circumstances are different you know what must be done [Music] I hate bees I always make the wrong choice I want to warn her because I like the Selina Kyle but a bat warned her it's Donnell I hope Gordon doesn't take it personally yeah don't go I've got a city to thing oh my god I was really weird yeah you have to let me [Laughter] John you can trust me what if I you that name hi hello so what John my name is John John Doe you don't know well we actually did cross paths once but what did you overhear I didn't hear anything I just got here I swear oh it's just what a pleasure it's nice to finally meet you it's just a handshake I'm not gonna shake his hand he might know something if I do know huh I'm not being Bruce Wayne right now I mean Batman this is Marc Luber again fan of yours in the flesh [Laughter] looking for mentors role models I've come across a few good it it's your your back I don't take on students hold on before you accept here's when I bring to the table I can get you Riddler's laptop all his secrets right there and the game who attacked the convoy they mean it to pull the big score the point so what if I steal it from Harley Quinn no s give it to you he playing out John but and this is a big but I need you to promise nothing bad will happen it's a Harley compete letting one criminal slip through the cracks every once in a while you'd be the worst thing that depends on what she does if she hurts innocence then I stop her you really this is what dedication looks like on but if I get the laptop there is the score so we win yes now when you're on the job what's the preferred method of extracting a target always repelling in more explosives as a distraction or you know what I'll wing it if I were you I'd get a friend to help that's a great idea I hope Bruce is there do anything for me oh one last thing I collect these they mean a lot to me right on my wall I didn't want to destroy his phone laptop behind the stack deck I'll be there promise hope to die destroying it was probably the right thing to do but you won't be disappointed but poor John that's what he wants me to do he wants me to feel bad for him he's gonna turn around and stab me in the back but all I hear are lies friends have the easiest specialists to stab you in the back if you are the rut then wear it proud I would have respect for that and with respect comes mercy greetings wailing come with me as a fellow apostle of technology I thought you might appreciate this Ben and I were acquiring components for a device I'll need once we get to the black site device yes an ice explosive for the fire failsafe we anticipate encountering that isn't the impressive detail as we ran into interference I determined I would be more efficient if I made smaller versions and employed them as projectiles geez who were they hindrances as you can see it's been wildly successful these people didn't need to die there are other ways maybe you're better suited for the realm of business the people you kill there are faceless we live in a twisted world Bruce better to abide and struggle against it in vain oh one more time my friend why didn't alarm go off when it was your job to ensure it didn't faint come on I sucked up dangerous time to make a mistake when you knew I was looking for more you're trying to slow us down no look I want to get paid just like you you got mouths to feed yeah when the police arrived you were nowhere to be found you know I'm no traitor mister look for you remember come on man you have to stand together on this you were brave I'm gonna let him die I like this guy yeah sure pretty bold move good yeah yeah now why would I do that if I was dirty but I don't throw you to the wolves to cover my ass right oh oh a deft turn but it's not enough to save you in fact your awareness of how to deceive only creates bars the deceive pain Alan's going on here merely plugging their league god damnit bane you're running your own investigation you're an ass hey hey hold on damn it you kill why are you complaining I didn't get a chance to grill the guy I'm a trained psychiatrist I forgot about that side of beef with a hunch I'll find the rats and I'll deal with it what do I always forget she's a trained psychiatrist rusted to run your man anymore they're mine now you just killed one I only shot him they want fun of you not to sit on the children too much but that was cold laptop seems like the perfect time you don't know for sure it was him so now what they know the costs high value loyalty above all arrows you know who's gonna have time being loyal now that guy just keep her busy I have to sneak into our office to get it for my old buddy Bruce oh I have to high-five I can't not high-five someone was a good one hey you two what's going on with you guys hardly what a surprise you guys get me a black site location or not the answer better be yes we didn't find the location could use this keep her talking but we did uncover the codename for whatever you're after project Lotus ring any bells now what is project Li Lotus what do you want shouldn't you be informing your men they work for me huh you she can't even keep these stole from colluding puddin are you kidding me he's boiled to a fault I'm Harley yeah definitely not John which is good for you because you need help at all Baines man you may be possibly potentially can't handle it alone I'm really the only man for the job me [Music] you find out [Music] and you we need to talk but fuck is going on all these social politics Bruce Bruce Bruce this here is one of my favorite toys helps me make boring things into pretty things can you be a smart guy and guess another one of my favorite toys is Paramore album come on you can do it John think on your hat you mean your hammer good guess but no it's John you two are getting a little too close for comfort so I'm making a new rule hands off or point is John's mine and mine alone so don't play with my toys or I'll bash in that pretty face of yours [Music] look what I got oh shit Alfred get a suit ready for drop-off of course was your accomplice successful first wait she's gonna walk through a lake Alfred get a suit ready no not my tux the Batman suit I call it the bat suit for sure it's in the Batcave oh hey hey I was hoping you'd catch up to me I hadn't had a chance to thank you for tipping me off about the GCPD I didn't expect it I mean the dog housing everyone who saved my ass if it wasn't for you the cops would have gotten the drop on me for sure you should have expected I would but I've helped you before and it surprises me every time now I need you to help me the laptop I need you to hand it over you proved your point quite the coincidence that we find ourselves here again yeah what do you mean again we're on top of the mayor's old office Harvey's really first met in the first episode of the first season feels like a hundred years ago doesn't it since we had our first chase yeah it does that's the night I saved your life first time I saw you we had something then same as we do now are given a tape you want it take it you didn't think it'd be that easy did you come on anchor vent anchor the helipad I'm gonna hit that shit oh I didn't know crap crap crap damn thank you hi it's me Batman I'm back I'm back [Music] oh come on that was fun you just hope I bring out that wild side of yours the one you like to keep stuffed down in that suit the side of you that's just eight King to break free yeah it's a little crazy but isn't that what you liked about me we both like to live on the edge that's where we find each other I'm just gonna stay silent guess not well have a good night there's only so much tying around you can do Oh Selena why'd you do it run off in Riddler's like that I wanted to get payback for Riddler on my own terms for what they did to him for what he did to you and just what are you offering me in return you're a man of many resources make me an offer I can't refuse relationship okay Celina I'll give you what you want and what is it you think I want something meaningful it's someone who has your back I've had you already but who knows I might be up for a repeat performance right right now on the helipad you just promised to work with me I'll stop playing games we've had our fun haven't we and it seemed like for a moment at least you wanted more than that I came back to stop Harley's so-called hacked the Eddy I knew would have wanted that anything else bus that's just icing on the cake no pressure really now kisser baby yes she didn't beat me up this time Catwoman will remember that she said if I work with her she'd stop playing games it worked out so I'd say it's time to find a black site okay the goggles slope will probably meet our own supercomputer to get into his laptop but something tells me you might know where to find one I have one what's at home you'll see oh well you'll see what what's at home my waterbed my giant slide that leads into a my own adult ball pit surrounded by whiskey and tonics that's what's at home also my Batcave my supercomputer my Butler and my supercool Tower you like that you like that I thought I'd seen it all when I found you hanging with the sewer rats Bruce this place it's really you rich men and their toys only thing missing is a wet bar hey make yourself comfortable I'll try this place it's not exactly cozy I like it I know how hard it is to let people in the fact that you've done that it means a lot to me Bruce I didn't give a damn about anyone else until I met you you're a bad influence on me you say that like it's a bad thing it definitely makes life more complicated being here with you I came back to Gotham for a little Redemption but I didn't expect to find it next to you it's nice the way I feel around you like like I can be better do you maybe feel the same I do I'm gonna kiss you though these two that's what I wanted missed us hold that thought is that what I think it is what is my stuff doing on display in your cave alongside mementos of the Psychopaths you've blocked out that is a little weird not that you're normal by any stretch of the imagination but and there I am right next to Harvey Dent this has got to be good tear my mint keep items from friends and foes reminders never took you for the sentimental type I keep a memento from

Wayne right now or you'll spend the rest of your life as a meter maid hey thank you mr. Wayne is under agency protection and you know it what you've known it for some time Waller and the agency they're not always gonna be around to save you Wayne one day you're gonna run out of favors to call in I'm not a criminal Gordon officers price he's involved they belongs in a Cell this is neither your concern or your purview go home Gordon you're done here hell I will if I were you I'd be very careful for my next words and if I were you I'd stop interfering with GCPD business this is my son not anymore you're so far out of line you can't see the truth you're dismissed excuse me you tested me this is what happens oh damn it Waller you can't do this it's well within my power and you know it Waller Gordon is a good cop he's a good man don't do this not from you it's the last straw I won't allow anyone to question my authority this is strictly professional oh sure time to go Jim Gordo I'm sorry jimothy we'll make sure Gordon leaves and be right outside when you're ready I apologize for everything calling the cops was a bit much well you wanted a chance to talk to me so here it is talk I just don't understand how you got tied up in all this the agency if I had known you were what are you doing with them please just tell me Bruce look if I want to tell her the truth an undercover operator I want her to be my eyes and ears doing it sting I want her to be Batgirl thank you for telling me I see now though this is why he's dead he was involved in whatever you're doing this work you're doing seems incredibly dangerous but there's something I don't get why you I mean no offense but you're just telling her Bruce I'm doing it I'm telling her I'm Batman you're Batman V [Laughter] come on got something to show you she deserves a preview of a new bat suit I know you Alfred are still on your well-deserved retreat but I couldn't help myself did L above the specs to your private server all right hope you guys are enjoying yourselves I'll see you soon it was hard to believe but hearing it from him the truth is there wouldn't be a bad man without your father he made the suit the Batmobile the gear all of it Bruce he set the bar pretty high huh with Dad gone maybe I can still help if Batman is interested it's the least I can do yes hell yes I like Tiffany yeah well my dad would be proud way things are going right now he could use a little help okay I need to digest lunch sorry for everything earlier but thank you for trusting me with this I'm saying they might be pushing him too hey you guys know he's Batman that's attainable and he knows how to cover his tracks our only path forward is through Wayne no let's get to it then I know you have some questions a few care to explain why the videos I saw said this virus was an agency experiment years ago I was brought in to rectify the agency's past mistakes or failing that to cover them up one mess in particular dealt with black ops experiments human subjects the kind of a moral science that makes your skin fall Sanctus they were a division that was shut down for good long before either of us joined but evidently they went underground this is our worst-case scenario with Sanctus off the leash this research poses a global threat if I'd known where they set up their den I would have taken them out years ago if you want them taken out now's your chance we know right where they are it's not that simple Sanctus was dangerous then there's certainly worse now this whole situation it's given me an idea I can't put an agent within a thousand yards of that place without them starting a war or blowing up the entire block just to cover their tracks we know it's tricky but leaving Harley and her gang into Sanctus might allow the two problems to take care of themselves they have read lose info they have a way in and you are undercover with them at least with Sanctus and the pact at each other's throats the agency can act quickly clean up and minimize casualties it's an orthodox but a strike like this will keep damage from spilling onto Gotham streets you two can't be serious Harley Bane fries no they can't be trusted you don't have to trust them trust me it's too much pressure for now just go and check this place out right now as yourself we don't want them to know Batman is on your tail I bet you're the type of guy who has an expensive surveillance we have your back Bruce we'll be right behind you keep me in the loop so I know what my team and I might be facing when it goes to hell defenses security whatever okay lives in your hands Bruce as well as the fate of this city I know you might have reservations about working with Harvey and Oprah - sometimes you have to use bad people to do yeah that seems very much like a motto she would use that's a cool shot all right we can do this the bodhi spa no problem been there many times I'll get my background located the black site they think so what are you were in the office I did some basic online research on the buspar excellent what's the verdict according to reviews it truly seems to be a fully functioning business not just a front good until the service entrance they offer rather popular high-end massages and have an active social media feed sector Twitter's our 24-hour business Bruce there are customers going in and out at all times they have no idea what's coming for them there's no way to tell until I get in there we'll proceed with caution I love you get my contacts to waller let her know I'm here at once need to see what we're up against good idea remember you're able to toggle the thermal imaging in your lenses I'm signing off while you speak with director Waller be careful think so Waller on the line Bruce I'm here I'll let you know if I find anything interesting caution is keepers this situation is a sparkling from a wildfire I'll keep that in mind this is making look creepy measures if there's a future like that wow that's cool isolate temperature okay there are still traces of heat signatures someone was here recently they gave guards that appears to just be a patron cain't glad i wasted my time with that okay nothing down here we're gonna do a whole thorough sweep you want to use both things okay move along I'm using my bat ice okay no everything looks everything that's fine okay heat pipes okay so glad I looked at them okay pull security security panel inside the bill here we go it could trigger an alarm system of some kind if I can hit that before they suspect what I'm really here for they'll be blind and helpless perfect for my people you just saved a few agents lives Bruce hey yay looks like we have a receptionist behind the front desk she's hardly anything to worry about all too easy to hide a gun under that desk okay it's cool so anything else I'm supposed to be checking out here hi what's he doing they're heading downstairs it's the real lab must be under growth secrets Santa's has been in the middle of Gotham this entire time they burrow under your skin and eat you from the inside out this is why I'm willing to let these criminals be the tip of the spear dangerous and expendable my favorite addresses anything else I can't even go down that way okay let's see you know anything else man I'll just walk in that access door is connected to the spa that's a top-notch field where crews Thanks I know being undercover has been tough but you just need to maintain it a little longer if you don't get inside with those maniacs we're going to have a pandemic on our hands oh shit it's pain well I need to go now why would a billionaire be skulking around and then filthy carefully inspecting every detail almost as if performing reconnaissance I could ask you the same oh I'm not skulking I have a very deliberate purpose my pain have you been spying on me spying no I've only been keeping an eye on you that's the same thing I heard that GCPD made your visit at your office so I swung by to see if you might be in need of some aid yo Sanders dead sure then something about the look on your faces from there so they taught me how does he sneak around this the sense you would lead me to something interesting project loaders this is the secret you in Harley hand where are we Bruce what is this place do your best to be honest this is Harley secret to get mine secret a fourth grader could piece this together project Lotus is what we're after and this is it finding you in this duplicitous position while we have a mole problem and it does not look good for you my friend when you wake up you can tell Harvey that you let me write to her conspiracy oh I can't lie sunshine I kind of like the bane in this seems like they got him right and I don't know much about pain oh I Biddy what you're about to face Wayne you had so much going for you Bruce she idiot but try to hide your discovery from me well Harley wanted to spearhead the hunt for them all this will be her chance so be thoughtful with your words in there they could be your last thanks for the warning I'll be careful I hope it's not your Wayne but if it is I'll kill everyone who shows up for your funeral that's gonna be like a billion deaths what is it Mel Bane there's no make a Barbie dump covered wait what's right under your nose and tract waiting for the location of the black site he sent Wayne to scout it so lower your damn voice oh it was the final piece of the puzzle and now we got it go get your boys ready we move on the site ASAP and don't worry your pretty little head about our rat problem I got it covered and Bane tell fries to get one of them popsicle makers ready you're not going anywhere you're in here I'm not liking that hey boys just gonna go in and talk to her Lee you later thanks for backing me up don't mention it can't have him stepping on my turf you know I said I'd find the rats and I will your father he was a hard man right someone lied to him betrayed him he ended them I think he was on to something with that idea show no mercy take no apologies that sort of thing there's always another way killing someone isn't an answer the son of Thomas Wayne - eyes away from spilling blood you are who I think you are Bruce who do you think I am a man out to prove to the underworld he's just as bad as his dear departed dad or they're more to the story I should know hidden depths secrets you don't enjoy walks on the beach I also enjoy long walks on the beach hmm I like that this is some Kenny G money kick back with a mai tai a mother's side you know my dad could be a funny guy too [Music] and they all fell down to the deep to turn to the talk to drown okay he used to sing that to me my dad made me feel safe like nothing could hurt me you have a nice voice that was very pretty you have a nice voice might want to get those ears checked Bruce I'm just paying a compliment once left of them oh my ear but it's nice to know I have a fan been running short of those lately in fact you'll be in like my dad that's why I got such a soft spot for you oh you do you found me the black site didn't you plus you're not a bad guy I mean you're rotten like the rest of us but he actually care for some people like that girl John told me about what's a face Britney no Tiffany you remember early twenties fresh-faced and optimistic oh my goin no no I think it was Britney sorry I barely know her you're cute with your friends you know that's I don't know if she's your friends or mortal enemy I know you care about her Hector John tell her about what happened in the voice except when you have to lose them laptops go on what are you yeah shaaka we have a turncoat I've interviewed just about everyone in the place except maybe one Matsu so gosh that only leaves the two people I haven't cleared you and captain maybe it was the guy who Bain gave the hamburger face but weirdest thing laptop went missing after that how do you seem to have made up your mind already guess one of us has to be the mole but you've already cleared me Trion's make me second-guess myself ain't gonna work sweetie nice try though she's a trained psychiatrist get in here I told puddin I narrowed it down to you - he begged me to let him interrogate you I gave him some pointers and now this is his chance hi Bruce potential grat oh shit Harley and didn t mind can't learn to ride with training wheels on forever you know I'll be right outside bitch frats jump you're then no I have to make it sound good oh it's okay it's okay you have to keep it up Thanks never wanted it to come to this we both know what has to be done Kat has to take the valium Bruce Marley's gonna kill that Tiffany girl if it's you know if she'll stop there come on Bruce you gotta give me something god it's not a little said tiniest bits [Music] telling me did you even stick up for me I tried Bruce I really did I said it loud and clear you know Harley she's not mind reader's not strong as you well I'll get through this Bruce I don't see a lot of options that integrate for you it's either you or her you want to do Bruce she knows it was one of you two she knows I got yes it was Catwoman I went to the safe but it was already gone and you were right there for me hearts I know you care about her yeah alright times up perfect because I'm done you cut a confession great job I need to stay on the insight but he'd say the inside track cowboy herself what if she looks bird told me come on go ahead moose it's okay just please it was Catwoman she took your laptop how do you know she took a phone call at Riddler's Bruce overheard her talking about it man the fan Bruce I'm disappointed too so much for the Solidarity if I need to stay on the inside and I don't want John to feel betrayed by me and I don't want Tiffani to get hurt I don't Catwoman he had hurt either but we are gonna do terrible things together like skin in fact I think Selena can help herself and silk'n Batman can help her so I don't know I hope no one gets hurt ah if I said it was me then I would have been kicked out and I need to be with them to think Carter what are you doing did you think I was just gonna let her go with something that freakin cheese she's gonna get turned into one of freezes popsicles I didn't know nope oh shit we're ready to move good this'll just take a second get her inside okay no I have to protect I've seen that look in your eyes before are other men just before they get themselves killed murder boxes we have a black site I don't like this I don't think this I'm so comfortable right now come on Bruce I regret so many of my decisions No oh fuck oh no I feel so bad if reason was me would they have captured her anyway or what a Tiffany have walked in no 24.8% of players left John feeling valued by you so people are turning against him eighty-seven point seven percent of players left Tiffany feeling honored she felt valued when you took the time to let her apologize she felt honored that you let her in on your Batman secret so a lot of people seem to have told Tiffany oh yeah I'm sorry I regret it I'm sorry I'll do better next time can you 4.8% of players did something that made feeling water-filled mind okay shit less skeptical of you okay so that's about the best they could have done let's see this the thing it says twenty four point eight percent of players but the other percentages could be broken up into different factors it might not just be the the other side of it it might not just be this or this eighty nine point two percent of flares left Gordon feeling remorseful I mean Gordon was a hard one this the decisions are getting higher than this it's hard to know which one which way to go forward did you warning Catwoman GCPD was coming after fifty nine point four percent of players did I thought that would be higher what dating advice did you give John in the cafe to help him attract Harley's attention you and forty two point five percent of players told John to manipulate Harley and he gave you and okay did you tell Tiffany your Batman 86% of people told Tiffany's our Batman I knew it I knew it I'm some in the moments I keep thinking that my logic is sound because I was like okay hit fucker music loud right okay if I say that I'm the mall then I get putting the thing or maybe they actually would have put Tiffany and now that I think about it I thought okay I need to be under the inside to go with the bodhi spy thing and then stop it from the inside out and as like a cat woman could protect herself they'll never get her and I officered they brought her in I shouldn't have done that I hope that doesn't have any bad implications next time I'm sorry fuck inward comics okay well that was episode three we don't get next times anymore for some reason maybe they haven't made them yet or I don't know but we have episode 4 coming soon what ails you a shocking revelation forces Bruce into a desperate change of plans as the villains villains as lethal the plot escalates yes so like these kind of give it away don't they that John's either gonna become bad or he was just playing dumb all along which I think everyone's figuring cuz he's the Joker I mean it doesn't seem like it seems like the worst kept secret so but I don't know maybe they surprised us maybe they'll come out with something that might shock us even more doubtful and again I don't know if any of my choices are actually gonna have any huge far-reaching sort of predicaments I don't know we will see what happens hopefully Catwoman's okay I'm sorry Oh peace shit that was decent I'm I wish there was more Batman stuff in it I'm like episode 3 it was find her episode 2 it was fine to have the the Bruce Wayne stuff and you got to learn more about the characters like you got to learn more about freeze Bane Harley and the Joker which was kind of cool it was it was cool to see a different side of them and I'm still not into the whole Harley being in control but again this might subvert when we get to these episodes and it'll all go tits up for her and then John will come out to be the big bad mastermind or whatever I don't know but it is kind of cool getting to learn more about the characters and see what makes them tick cause normally you don't get to see what goes on behind closed doors with them but have it haven't it for like two episodes in a row is getting a little stale I want more Batman stuff I like that I like investigating as Batman I like uncovering crimes that was one of the coolest things about season one you went into an area and a crime had already begun and then you did you did your detective work cuz Batman's a detective first and foremost and like he's a superhero detective and that's what he does new unsolved crimes and he unsolved he solves crimes he uncovers crimes what I mean to say so to see like like Episode one was really cool because it was a lot of Batman stuff but now it's kind of wearing thin I want Batman to come back which hopefully he will I feeling we might have to be Batman to take on the Baldy spy but I feel so bad after bringing Selina to the Batcave and saying that ah bad decision bad decision hopefully we can make up for it next time this is one of those ones normally I don't really care what decisions I make because I'm like oh it'll just work its way out in the end but this one is one that I felt this is one that as soon as something happened I was like oh no I remedial II regret this and then I couldn't take it back like that as soon as I started thinking about it more cuz the fucking the time the time-bar going down makes me make snap decisions and I hate that but I guess that's the whole point game anyway I'll be back in episode 4 whatever that comes out I don't know when it's gonna be expected in a month or two or three I have no idea we will see when it's actually out but for now thank you guys so much watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face with your boys and Pat raise our Oh Shh [Music] [Music] [Applause] if you don't mind I'm gonna take a back-breaking back stretch 
*Wapoosh* Top O' the morning to ya laddies my name is Jacksepticeye and welcome back to Subnautical adventures! I was about to take the submarine back. I forgot that I left it at the bottom of the deep dark deep dark down Dark, so I decided to go away, but look who I found on the way It's the Sea Treaders!!! :D I want to get out and say hi to them! Did I damage my ship? Probably a lot. I think I did a lot of bangs. I think we can just go out on our own 350 meters down it's not THAT deep we've been much deeper. Okay? Look at 'em! Oh I missed you guys! They make cool sound too I Love the sea treaders, they're so cool because they have three legs and one of their legs as their front probiscus kind of thing And they make a lot of boom booms so this... I thought the sea treaders path was way lower down I I didn't think it was like 350 meters. So they go along this little pathway Hi guy, hi feller You're like an underwater bug You're kind of cool. You're kind of cute. I kind of like you. I'm a swim under you I can't do that okay Whatever, okay. Don't stomp on me. Okay? Don't tread on me He laughed at it. That was his laugh he was like hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Everybody else makes fun of you for your laugh, but I like your laugh. It's cute. Where are you going? You seem to be kind of lost you don't know where you're going uh Yeah, see this is another place where I could have got bits of the Cyclops There's a cyclops bridge fragment, but look there is a whole Cyclops over there, I made it. Looks like we made it right so I need to head back to base. That's my plan for now I need to head back to Henry look at him over there Need to head back there? This would have been a much easier place to get in then There's another fucking piece god. I should have came here I Don't know if you guys heard that but that was the sound of a Reaper... Can we here him again? There he is again I have fucking no idea where he is That's the scary thing about them. You never know when reapers gonna attack You just got to cover your butt and hope for the best right I am fucking losing power here So we need to we need to get the fuck out of here. I think the Reaper might be over there though Shit that's the direction I need to go OOOHHH This could be bad hey Reefies!  wait... You didn't do it. You didn't answer back. That's rude Okay whatever hey Reefy There you go, you're making some sort of sounds, I can't see shit captain Wait are we in the fucking sand dunes, oh there's a warpy boy There you go, hey reefie's All right we were in an area that kind of looked like the sand dunes Maybe they are near the sea traders path so possibly oh The reefie's are so cute. Why would anyone want to hurt them or make anything bad happen in their lives? I'm sorry whatever you were. I'm sure you were loved by many um So plan for today, I got myself a cup of tea oh Yeah, oh yeah, you should say and I will support a and Go back here. I'm gonna make some upgrades And then I want to build a base back where we were I want to build a base back at that location Where I kind of got down near the thermal vent. I'm gonna make a thermal generator down there and Then install it next to that and hopefully get some power out of it, and then are we're gonna have a base down there That's gonna have infinite power for itself Don't really need a whole lot out of it, but it would just be nice to have an area where I could like recharge stuff Because if I keep my site cops obviously my power stuff isn't working Or at least not working to the best of my ability so if I have a base down there I have an area for oxygen I'll have an area for a grow bed that I can put in I can put in a scanner room to Scan some stuff if I want Thank You choir And then I can put in like battery recharge stations and a power cell recharge station And then I can make I can make just easier trips back and forth into the really bad place Hey roofies and I might make like another modification station more fabricators all that stuff that is going to be down there and Then back here is where we're going to end up building our rocket to get off the planet So this is our intermediary position you getting good got it. Yes And the reason I'm putting it down here the lava zone obviously because thermal power because otherwise I can't get power They could have a bioreactor which I don't want cuz they suck And then Lab lab laughs if over The the bioreactor is basically a fucking composter And if I have that then it's not going to I have to like continuously put stuff into it Bla bla bla I have to constantly keep putting stuff into it to keep it going Where is a thermal generator the games already making the power for me, so I don't really have to do a whole lot yes Yes, you're very close to smacking into shit. Well. It's Mike him too. Then let's make it. Don't smack Those might getting it don't do it don't Okay that like a fucking glove like a surgeon. I'm a cyclops urgent turn off the engine Nice okay that works Mr.. Braun soon, can I bother you for a depth module. Thank you very much. I know you're very attached to it we all were it helped us get really power down, but oh yeah, I took apart my power cell charger in the Cyclops - just put it in here the beauty of being able to get all your items back because then You can just take it out of one thing put it another one now the power from in here is charging this while My Cyclops does not fucking run and low - I have all the stuff needed I surely do depth module mark - please This is does the prong should have a mark 3 I Don't know if it does cuz this gets you pretty damn deep once your depth module mark - yeah, I don't think it has a mark 3 I think this is it I also need to make the jump jet upgrade cuz now I found crystalline sulfur I Think I might only have two of those. Oh that would suck Okay well for this we can put you in right. What was our max depth before 1300 meters how far can you go now? 1700 meters I think that's enough I think that's enough for the Cyclops or the prawn seat to be able to go down Where I needed to go? Not sure okay, I need to go get my crystalline sulfur, I swear, I think I only have two God damn it Like copper or though I know I've a lot of kyanite to build nothing with so I Need a load of crystalline sulfur from down there Now that I have crystalline sulfur can I somehow fabricated? Can you just tell me how I can do that now That'd be real nice We still need to go down into the bases down further in the Lava zone because we need to get the information to make an ion power cell and I think they hole like a thousand energy each Which is just fucking bananas the ones? I have now the regular power cells hold a hundred each ooh, but I could make a cyclops depth module mark three Plasteel ingot and three kyanite, so I have the kyanite now I need a plasteel ingot which needs a lot of titanium and lithium whereas my little dude er down here little pepper Has uh, you don't have as much titanium as I thought one two three four five six seven I need three more Excuse me mister bloody ass have you seen three more titanium anywhere? So anything I can scan a limestone chunk. I can get I don't have to go searching from metal salvage Come on man come on don't do me like this there fine metal salvos. You'll do I Got it. Thank you blow - yes Maria I'm gonna do a thing real quick, okay? I know it feels like I'm gonna be ripping your insides out, but trust me. It's gonna be worth it wait What is that is that a? Samara - yeah, I know it feels like a piece of you is missing pepper went through this a few minutes ago I'm peppers much happier about it now because pepper got a branch. I mean you upgrade okay it's not like I'm taking you to the dentist or anything I Just need this fur for a second look look look all pretty shiny new one I don't know how that suddenly makes you go deeper. I take you guys out and put some empty. It's back in Okay, sick really liking this Really like in how how much progress were getting? It's a lot of like go in here make this thing get or that come back out here Go back inside this thing what that it, but it's it's very very vital so now you can go to Now you can go to 1700 meters they can bring both of you deep down deep dark whatever I say Fucking sick dude excited about that. No I put a fucking empty one back in the Go there you go any more empty ones over here Cuz let's face it I'm gonna be here for another little while so I might as well take them all out and charge them all give me that water I need that water Yeah hundred percent we're gonna fucking water there we go I'm blind the power of fucking flashy lights. Okay, two waters. We have a salt deposit We've Power Cells are still charging up you may notice I have taken off the front hub on this because it wasn't needed a little hallway going down that I used to have Power chargers in and had a little hatch on it But those are vital materials That I needed what I also took out was the scan room also vital materials that I needed and I might install this scanner room Further down what I might do is dismantle this Because we're about to make our journey We're about to make our trek like really deep down, and if I have this like way down with me here I can just find bladder fish I can find batter fish and I can make all the water. I want myself in the fabricator That's here. I have taken out everything modification station at the two lockers They're all inside the psych up so the beauty of this game Is that I can just dismantle the modification station put it in the Cyclops? It doesn't take up any power to just sit there all this stuff that is needed for it is In the thing itself so I can't spend them I got every single material I needed for it back out of it so when I need to actually go into the base Later on when I get when I actually build a little bit of a base I can just take it out of psych ops and put it in there so our little base will actually have the modification station again as Well anyway, so we have full power ourselves. I have one. That's at 78%. I'm gonna do that while I also This is a big mission I I don't intend on coming back here for a little bit also all the lights are often here because I'm saving power because now we have I Think we actually have a hundred percent power in our Cyclops. Let me check Yeah, so we're at a hundred percent power right now I'm not risking losing any of that because if I can't get my base built in time Then this is going to be my failsafe I put all you in there Okay, cool, and I still have a completely empty Locker for any items that I find down in the deep dark down deep dark. Oh Diving chamber. I never notice. It said that Because if I build my base And I can't get stuff ready in time at least I still have a fabricator in the modification station and everything is all still gonna Be here, so that's good, but I need to go off and I need to farm a ton of titanium because to build my base Obviously I'm gonna need a lot of titanium I'm also using all the space that's inside pepper to be able to house as much as I can so I Think we're pretty much ready. I think we're ready I mean, it's not the end of the world if I don't have the material said you have to come back? I just don't want to have to I don't have to waste time coming back Now as much as I love copper ore right now any titanium here. We go. That's the stuff I also might bring some quartz in case I need to make some class for some of the Compartments for my base. I don't really intend that fuck off I'd only intend on making any sort of glass panels in there unless I can really really spare the items I Just want to make a basic little base That can house all of my materials Go So it'll have like the fabricator it'll have the chargers and all that kinda stuff and Wow Jesus a Lot to be funneling power off of the thermal vents. Hopefully I do need to get a lot more Titanium just for that as well Because I need to build power conductors. Oh jackpot, baby Thank You stalkers my inventory is full you sons of bitches really Come on wait pop this. I don't need a graph trap anymore. I'm just gonna stick that there Well I'm still full again anyway anything I can get rid of Copper or blah blah blah blah blah blah o HC get rid of one thing and I have enough room I Can write out Jesus I go into the copper for now oh Wait I forgot even in the deep dark place There's titanium and there's copper Deposits I can just drill away at them Okay The only thing I'm sad about is that I won't have a moon pool down there I Could probably build one I need this one here to house Sally, but I I need this I need the the vehicle modification station Okay because eventually I'm going to want to have to put stuff in my Cyclops because the Cyclops can benefit from a a Thermal reactor thing so it can actually generate its own power source from thermal sources Which would be great because when you're down in the lavas own Then it means that all the heat that I'm generating I will just be getting Energy back from it What I need one of those crystalline sulfur things to be able to do that and I don't have that right now. Oh yeah, you just Replenish the stock I forgot about it. That's enough titanium. That's plenty sorry It's been an absolute honor. We're probably not going to see each other for a little bit, but I will be back I'm not leaving forever. Okay. I'm just going away for a little bit in fact. I might even bring you down there eventually I Don't think I can because they don't think you can go that deep But Sully it has been an absolute honor a privilege and a pleasure To get to know you do you have anything left in your storage dad daddy needs No, there's a bunch of torpedoes you hold on to those torpedoes okay, you hold on to them and you be a big girl and He loves you Actually kind of sad All right, we are off. Can I close this bulkhead no? We are setting sail my dudes okay, turn on the lights in here Get that engine a Pern Engine powering oh Fuck yeah, it is let's do this Really wish it wasn't nighttime bit of a problem oh My god. What is going on back there? Oh my god. That is so fucking creepy. Oh my god Okay game chrismad um This is fucking empty We forgot pepper Pepper na ho I knew I'd do that as well. I was even say to my head, okay Don't forget pepper remember pepper when you're leaving this place. I always fucking forgot her God dammit rookie mistake. I I'm so glad I realized that now and I didn't go miles away, and then be like oh damn Because both of these are slow bastards here we go There we go everything's everything's all nice and dandy Except for this it looks like it's some sort of creature incited It's the creep vines coming up from below, but they're glitching through the actual cab That is beyond creepy Mud don't like it. Okay. What are we at now 99 percent not too bad not too bad? I don't care if the fastest cavitating come back to me when they keep you in the vessel speeding Harry fees Fucking fire detected what? Um Excuse me excuse me there will be no fires. I didn't travel that fast for that long Okay, come you're fucking Know you'll stop that Stop that Okay Okay, we understand each other again, right? Okay, goddamnit, Maria. Don't scare me like that Now I'm stress-eating, I hope you're happy this time We have to actually attempt to bring Maria in this is gonna be a tricky maneuver, but I am the world's most ace Cyclops pilot, don't you even worry about it. It's a big hole over there I like it the bigger the hole the better the fit for Maria. That's how it goes the best that this No one's taking this away from me No one's taken away my infinite. Glory of subnautica, okay? straight the needs Strengthening, okay, it's all about using your cameras and your angles all right. Oh, you can beep at me all you want You can beep at me all you want, but all I'm doing is Threading this needle to the best of my abilities look at this look at this gives me good Get the rock a little kiss and I ain't talked about no Dwayne Johnson Fucking sexy sexy very sexy oh This is good This is very good. I like this Ain't nothing but a thang Yes We're doing it. We're doing it. We're making it in Okay, you're close to hitting the shit. You're close to hitting shit, but you know what you haven't hit anything yet. Have you nope okay? Well I'm just gonna stop talking then because you seem to react poorly to that so Alright Alright alright as long as nothing bad decides to come after us You know like a ghost Leviathan As long as that guy stays over in his neck at the woods, and I stay in my neighborhood this isn't Stop, I'm not even hitting walls now. You're just fooling me. I'm hitting fish And there's plenty of them to go around Okay, get that guy to stay over there. I'll stay in my neck of the woods We'll all be happy and no one will have to file a lawsuit okay - Worlds with world's number one premiere Cyclops pilot me and Maria because we have a connection If we were if we could be joined at the hip we would but she's a machine My god. I'm gonna give myself a headache. I'm so good She's just changed the name of the game - Jack Nautica from now on Fuck yeah, what's up? Dudes? I'm sorry. I'm gonna bash into a bunch of you If you don't want it to happen just move out of the way Okay, it's like that episode of The Simpsons where it's like. I'm just gonna keep swinging my fists, and if you run into it It's your fault At some point you have to start taking blame, okay? You guys have been down here and your bioluminescence for far too long unchallenged. It's time for a new challenger to enter the game Whatever that Right so down. Here is where we're gonna start making her base because it's as far as I can go without me getting damaged personally Bet you I didn't even think he could fit a fucking Maria down in here, and we're still at 97% power Oh Baby, okay, Maria you take a little bit of a break see here wait hold on hold up hold up There we go all right The little Cyclops that could right I need to start getting me some frickin Titanium out excuse me Bank of Jack I would like to make a withdrawal Please I would also like the game to not freeze and glitch on me Okay, so Do I have the Reinforcement plates okay you need lithium for that now. That's a bunch of bullshit. I Don't need a huge area for this to work Where did I put my lithium? Now where did I put that lithium? I know I had it around here somewhere, but where did I put it? God I have too much shit Dwight oh, god, thank god Just might say don't even have lithium. I need this because this is very very deep This is 900 meters down and we might start running into some issues with Pressure under pressure Looking down on me Alright, you might be able to build it here less distance to the heat if you know what I mean You know I'm talking about no I'm saying I even need a foundation Okay as close to the edge as I can get it There After that I don't really care, thank you fucking LED for this see this is where you bring it down with you because otherwise you'd already know where you're going and you don't know what you'll need and then I think you get down here and if you don't have everything that it's that one thing that you didn't bring that's like ah balls Now her that I put that led. I think it's fucking memory game there. It is I? Wanna drive you a bit closer actually Hate on that engine powering up I love his voice, it's so cool like the one that the war pers have All righty y'all are gonna have to clear out of my neighborhood now very very rapid all right There's there's a new gang in town the gang at Jack the instant chill pack is in town. Okay? I Mean we're not like most gangs. We don't come in and like do bad shit We just come in with our positive mental attitude if you're not able for that I know you've been down here for a very long time and no one has even looked twice at you Even one such it, but now we're here all right I'm gonna build a multi-purpose room first Because that's going to give me the most amount of space possible right from the Gecko From the get-go not from the gecko and maybe build a little one of these And I need a hatch on you What I need Quartz I have a quartz I have it Mr.. Bass, I have it imagine if I didn't have a quartz If I didn't have a course it would have fucked up the whole thing Because then I wouldn't actually be able to get into my place unless I built a Moon pool, which I don't even think I have the properties for Okay base hole strength is now a total of six point one so it's good. It's fine. Oh Production oh Okay, that's cool and all but I'm just gonna start I'm just gonna start dumping shit in you now in a second You don't need to be producing the water or anything I just need to start getting rid of items and start putting in the stuff that I actually need Don't you all in a specific locker this one Well, this is what I needed that was it okay? What else my building wait could I just build a Vehicle upgrade console anywhere doesn't even need to be in a moon pool that I just always assumed that Probably um I'm gonna dismantle you because you're going in there as well Boom boom boom boom I want to build a room a room full of nice goodies that I can survive with Zombies want to continue to Ryan, but no is this a serious business right now And I don't really need a bed because I don't really need to pass day time anymore We're fucking right here right right there And Little Georgie icon and decided this on my little habitat builder it shows that a bears and it's half energy I didn't realize that before I Don't fuck that didn't I alright and then after this I need to start building the power source Also need an interior grow bed When you could fit right there What you hear Not the most efficient bass, but once it's down. It's down and what I can do with this is there. I've enough room Yeah
I can literally just take seeds from this and now I already have an infinite food and water source down here Let the best water source He still give me water Okay, I'll take... I'll eat one. I''ll plant one back and I can plant four down here. I'm very excited about this! This is very good because this is the stepping stone That's going to lead us to a lot more progress a lot quicker now in the next coming episodes Boom-boom-boom! Perfect!! right what did I need for the thermal plant? magnetite aerogel and titanium I have another aerogel don't I? oh please tell me you have another aerogel Or if not I at least have the means to build it Yes!! Is that it..? yes okey-dokey I can't remember where this actually goes Do you go in it. Do you go on it, do you go near it, oh wait you go in the actual area Okay, so here's what's going to happen. We're gonna take Pepper down. I think the thermal plant converts heat and energy at a medium efficiency, okay I think this one goes down in the hot area it converts the power then I need to make a bunch of power rods that come all the way back up to my base I probably actually should have built the base a lot lower shouldn't I? Dunno why I built it up here It kind of makes no sense as to why I would build it right here, when I could have just built it down in the - - bottom down here. And I would have made need to make less Power nodes to go from there to there Aww fuck off... I'll figure that out in a second! I'm a bit fucking busy here. All right, so how many degrees are we at down here? 51 this should be good, right? .....Did one of those shitheads grab my thing? It fucking did, okay, I'm gonna build you right here, gotta be careful of my health Also take out a knife as time to start stabbing bitches Get off!! I Decided to move it, my base is down here now instead of being all the way up there cuz there's there's no point There's no point in having it all the way up there. I just have to make more rods and more connectors To be able to bring it up that far, so why why would I bother I mean, it sure looks cool here and everything but efficiency is what we're looking for right now. and right now that is like the edge of where I was able to build it and that's the edge of where me as a human boy is able to go without burning alive because as soon as I pass these Falls it starts getting to 50 degrees so I I Might even be able to just build the thermal reactor here oh Fuck oh god. No. Oh no oh, no get me out here! Don'tdoitDon'tdoitDon'tdoitDon'tdoit!!! Oh god. Please go away. Oh..... Fuck they're so scary okay, please don't have more than four things in you We have a lot more than four things in you okay, I'm just going to fucking do it this way then Just build and then power conductor as far away as I can get it, which is not that far. Don't know if that actually reached It right there so you got to put these down and connect the wires basically So these go to a certain distance and continue the power onwards... that one isn't even continuing the power arm words Jesus Oh dude!.... I just put the thermal generator there on one power node, and it just connected the power straight to the base Oh Oh Do I actually have power now? I see lights on! Yeah!!! Nice one! Okay, now this thing is gonna be a pain in the ass, cuz It's constantly draining the power already, so it's gonna keep draining the power, so I don't even know if my power is gonna go up Do these add power or they know they're just extended so if I put a second ther- -mal generator down I should technically have 500 power, right? Hey, I'm just happy that power is working, alright, that's a big big bonus already, to have that working down here Anything else I can put in here right now that I was going to?.. ....No.... All the stuff is back in my a ship. let's try this out then, I am very low on health, and I'm kind of worried about that, but let's put another Thermal plant generator right here, and I'm wondering if it'll feed off the same... ... The same power circuit. No, so if I do this...? Ah shit, do I not gold? Oh I don't have titanium! okay, well let's do this then, since this is pointless being here now Can I just finish this one and that'll do it? yeah! Ha ha ha! I'm a genious!! I know we have 500 power, so the things should continuously get power, even while this thing is draining it all the time. Which is fan-tastic! Now I just need to stock up my little place in here. I SHOULDHAVE BROUGHT MY POSTERS!! Ohh I'm gonna be so lonely now without my kitty poster. Ohh and this is a thousand meters down, so I don't even think Sally can get down here:( I'm having serious deja vu right now! Um how far could Sally get down with her upgrade Sally upgrade! Cyclops upgrades! Seamoth depth module mark one. It does not even say!? I'm building a third one I Don't really need it, but I wanted to do it So I'm pretty pleased with this. I'm pretty pleased at how everything turned out. This is fricking awesome Look at all this, 750 power now! And all we have to do is-- well I could uninstall that... When it makes the water for me, and then just have the power go up to 750, I mean eventually it's going to go up to there anyway. it's just it's constantly draining and gaining a draining and gaining, so it's just really really slow and stuff is charging batteries and everything right now, so It hasn't had a chance to be at full, so I might just do that after it make some water And then whatever. But we have a base again! Reeaa-lly deep down Which is awesome so now that all this stuff is in place and I might spend a little time Doing it up and just making sure that I have all the things I need I have my water I have my food, the two most important things the things that are going to help me Avoid dying. I have materials all around in the area. I have some lockers for storage I have my power cell charger my battery charger my radio. I don't need the radio anymore I don't think I'm gonna pick up any more transmissions, but just in case, plus It looks cool of my fabricator:) Which is really really damn important, and my modification station is down here out of the way so a little hallway down into here I might try and make a bed again, but I need fibermesh to do it, and I just didn't bring any fibermesh with me Because I didn't think I need it, but I bet it would be nice just to have it I don't know, be nice, and then we might eventually... What do you need for a moon pool? Moon pool, Titanium ingot, Lead and lubricant I could actually make that, All I have to do is go up there and get the titanium there's a titanium deposit up there And I could make a moon pool and try and like branch it off of this And then that would just be really really handy, because then I can get the vehicle upgrade Bay because right now I can't put it anywhere and has to be in a moon pool because the vehicle upgrade Bay Says when stuff is docked and things like that, but we have a lot we have a Really great stepping stone here because we have some of the gel sacks over there if I ever need more aerogel this place is abundant With Ruby it also has kyanite it also has titanium copper gold and silver so this Because it's late-game area, the game kind of incentivizes you to come down here and build a base So that you don't have to keep going back and forth and so it gives you the materials to be able to do that It's just a little riskier getting them around here But I really really like it. so after this you warper after this after I do a couple more things here We are going deep and we I'm hoping to go into the other I'm hoping to into the thermal plant first off That's that's like a must, and then I'm hoping to go into... ... The prison, the containment facility, I don't know if we'll get there in the next episode But I definitely plan on going into another alien base in the next episode and getting all the information I can out of that? But anyway, I am very very pleased with this this was a lot of progress here today That was that was really really good. I'm very very pleased at this! Huh! Thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it- punch that like button in the face (inhales) LIKE A BOSS!!! Andhighfivesallaround Whoopish! Whoopish But thank you guys and I'll see all of you dudes.... IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!! Who knew you could be a thousand-meter zone in the ocean and still feel like home 
(Whoopsh!) Top of The Mornin to ya Laddies!!! My name is JackSepticeye, and if you remember a little while ago I did something called #septicart, actually we did something called #septicart, where I I came up with the idea to do some sort of event for artists online because I always see so many artists out there who are drawing wonderful stuff all the time and then other people saying that they just they're having some sort of mental block or art block where they Can't draw or they don't want to draw so the septic art event was a cool idea to try and get everybody to come together and do something for a week and then after a week I Did a video showcasing some of that art. I wanted to do another one for a really long time I even thought about doing a part two with the same art from before and I just never got around to doing it but Since it's the last week of October and since inktober is the thing that's already going on inktober is Kinda the same sort of initiative where artists come together for a month all of October inktober and they draw stuff Sometimes there's a theme around it sometimes There's actually specific rules around and I think this year it was to do with physical art like pen to paper kind of stuff for paints on paper or whatever But I just want to do another septic art event so I thought it'd be a fun idea since it's the last week of October To do another to do the hashtag except the #septicart meets #inktober and merge the two of them together so our community can come together and draw some stuff and People outside the community of course if they get wind of it they want to draw stuff, too Cuz I just love all the art that goes around online And it's sad to see some people with so much talent And then they, they stop, they stop drawing or they stop creating just because they get inside their own heads And they don't know what to do they don't have a focal point so these types of things are always cool and people Really come out of the woodwork to start drawing and the last time we did one of these it was an absolute uproarious success And I always want to try and give back and showcase more art and showcase more artists Because it's one of the things that I always wish I could do. I wish I could contribute to these like Inktober types of things or I wish I could just draw in general sorry for making noise, I'm rattling my spider-man bracelet I've always wanted to kind of contribute to these things myself and because I can't draw I Decided why not use the sort of influence that this channel has to showcase other people who can draw And if you can't draw and you just want to contribute anyway by all means throw your hat into the, name? Throw your name into the Hat. Just create. I love watching people create I love watching people go out there and just like, I don't know, put their brain towards something and Because people have like a focal point and they have a deadline and everything people really start to work harder I think when they have that sort of drive in them so I want to do the same kind of thing again Where in a week's time on Halloween or maybe before Halloween I don't know I'll see what happens I'm gonna do another video where I showcase some of the art again and last time I felt bad because I was recording the video and I recorded it for like an hour and a half And I felt like it was going on too long, and I was there was too much in it or whatever and then I by the end of it it ended up being a half hour long because of all the Editing that was chopped out, so I felt like I didn't showcase enough art so this time I want to try and make it a bit longer or try and get through art a bit more or maybe not dwell on them A bit as long as I did. I just want everybody to have a fair shot and most times I'm all about free rein when it comes to this stuff I'm all about flexibility and people draw on whatever the hell they want but sometimes when it comes to things like this That's worse for people because then it's too many options and people still don't know what to draw So I think a focal point is needed and because it's inktober because it's Halloween because it's October I think it's cool if we draw some Halloween themed stuff or horror themed stuff or dark themed stuff just because that's really cool anyway, and I love I love seeing some of that and people have been drawn at all October already and Sending me stuff, and I think it's really cool So and I just love seeing the different styles Because people all have their own specific unique style that they draw in Some people might not think that they do but you can definitely see some people's personalities in the style that they're creating not just drawings But just little edits that they do here and there You get a feel for what people are into for the styles that they prefer, so I just love that I just love seeing people create. I love trying to I love I love giving people some motivation to create because lord knows That's what I needed when I started off doing YouTube so if I can impart some of that on to some other people and give Them something to work towards then ah that just makes my heart so full So go out there. Create! Do whatever you want to do If you hashtag it #septicart and #inktober I should be able to find it and then again in a week's time I'll do a video where we showcase some of this, so let's have a fun week Let's go out there and create some really cool shit also It's nice to just be back and to have the community back and have everybody Contributing towards something together again. I love this, I love doing YouTube I love having a community here that we can all work together to create some cool stuff So let's go out there and make a difference For now Thank you guys  So Much For Watching This Video If you Liked it, PUNCH THAT LIKE Button, IN THE FACE!!!! LIKE A BOSS!!! And High Five all-round!!! *Whoopsh 2x** But, Thank you Guys! And I will See you Dudes , IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!! (Outro- I'm Everywhere By Teknoaxe) [oooooo its a spooky sam ;) See you guys in the next video! - the people who edit these subtitles] It's about to get spooky, ooooooo!! (giggle) 
Top of the mornin' to you laddies, my name is jacksepticeye, and welcome back to Subnaaauseous! Here, I'ma zap ya! Oh I'ma zap ya real good! What's up farty arses? You guys doing good? None of my other stuff has hatched yet Mainly because I only started the episode right now And I haven't actually done anything yet, so they'll hatch in another minute So I want to go off and get some stuff. The main thing I want to do which Robin Thanks Roth. Hi, Robin! Everyone wave hi to Robin. He's at home editing this right now He reminded me that I should go off and get some creepvines Wait- do I need creepvine seed clusters? If I get those, can I plant the creepvines in the aquarium? Because if I do that they will grow big and tall like the mountains Okay, I can't grab them for some reason cuz I have tiny baby hands Whoa Sally! Can you- can you back off sir? Okay, I'll take out my mace And spray you with it. So! For this episode, we are going to create more babies I said last time we were going to put more babies inside of our uh- our jimmy-jam here Oh low-power Also, the game is running a bit slower now, framerate wise, because I have too much shit in it. The game's not really able to keep up Thank you And somebody else also mentioned that I technically don't need the ladders in here, 'cause I can just go up and down in this But I like my ladders. They're good, okay? It helped me access the rooms on their own. Can I? Boop, boop, boop! Yes! Okay, is that you? Oh my God, they're tiny! Look at the tiny creepvine! Yeah, baby! Okay So you guys are going to grow big and strong right? Big and strong like daddy Jack. And then when I come back, I want to see you guys reach to the heavens! I wanna go get more eggs though. Right now. Wait, I want to go go and get more batteries though right now I want to get those first And then I actually wanna bring Sally with me. Do I have... batteries? Okay, thank Okay, I have two that are a hundred percent Boo Okay. Go in! Oh, I don't need these. Oh wait, before I go anywhere, I have to feed up. I have to feed up, and belly down Okay, thank you for the salt. Every time I pass that thing, it just gives me s- like, something That's how life works, I guess. Life's crazy, man. Do ya ever think about it? I try not to, it scares me :( Uh-- Right, we're going down. I'm gonna drop these seed clusters. 'Cause I don't need them! And also the salt Because I don't need them either All right Sallah wishes are you ready to go on an adventure? I dunno why I'm charging power cells, because.. I don't need to I can just charge them in here All systems online What I also want to do is make some ion power cells, but that's a long way away I also need to find the second cuddlefish! You are a new one. Oh, I don't have you! Whoo! You look like a little sperm cell inside the egg Which I mean... yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool, we got that one. Shut it! People were also saying as well that you need console commands to get the... To get the.. Reefback eggs. Which kinda sucks. I have these. I wanna know what the red ones are What are they gonna turn into? Ooh, sorry! Oh I killed a peeper with my Sal Eh, who cares. A lot of creature eggs around, but they're all the same ones.. Gasopod.. I checked all you, didn't I? Don't know if I checked all the ones over here. Please be different. Please be different Please be like a kaiju egg, or something- God dammit, everyone stop running it to me! Hey, what are you. Have one of them. What is this? Have on of them (- n -) Have one of them... God dammit, they're all lame! What do you want? Go away! To get the other cuddlefish, I need to go down into the Lost River I think I need to go down to the Lost River and go to the.. Precursor cache? I didn't even know that that was still a thing 'Cause the precursor caches were things that I went down and I opened up gateways, but I can't remember doing that anymore Hmm... Either way. Wait! Where did all my ion stuff go? I've got my eye on crystal Didn't I have like, a boatload of ion cubes? None of them are in my containment, I don't think.. Are they? No (=n=) No- My light did the thing again! Didn't it? Am I going fucking batshit crazy I think I might be... It's one of those things where something happens in your peripheral riviviv-vision, and you don't know what it is Scaring me man. At least I'm not playing like, Simulacra or something again. I don't have any of them Where did all my ion things go? Did I use them? I could'nt've.. Whaddafuck! I mean, I can't just go back to the other place and through the fabricator for them But I have to go all the way over there ( &gt;n&lt;) Can't I have a speedier teleport-e thing? So I was gonna say; could just go in Sally, 'cause when you get into the sea Emperor's Nest where I release the eggs, where the sea Emperor is You- your Sally won't get destroyed. Because it's able to- the pressure's all equalized in there, and I could go up But I'd need Pepper to be able to actually drill the thing *Whiney Jack* ( &gt;–¥&lt;) I don't wanna go back there... I swore I'd never go back there Right. What do I need to make ion stuff? Electronics, ion power cell. I need a Power Cell, and... Two ion- ugh, fuck. Ion cubes. Gold, silver ore I feel like I made some of these already Yeah, ooh! We've got to put our new baby inside the aquarium! I have a little baby egg in my hand, and I'm not putting it in Ah, the creepvines are growing! Cool! Can you guys hatch? Oh, you did hatch! Are you just more Spadefish That's lame Ahm... Right, whoop! Grow big and strong What if it's like a stalker? And it ends up killing all the others. Well you didn't hatch yet I want to figure out what you are. And you didn't hatch yet! Okay. What else hatched? Yeah, there's two more spadefish in here. Boo! Boo, disqualified! Now before I go anywhere. I have enough for the prawn suit jump jet upgrade! Two nickel, lithium; three sulfur Two nickel, three lithium two- I- that's not the thing Ah.. Lithium, bang bang bang bang Uh, I need Crystalline sulfur, you guys go in there. Don't need you, don't need lead, can't fit you in anymore.. crystalline sulfur I needed three, right? Yes Uhh I already forget what I needed.. Oh God, my brain is inside a jar. And that jar has been shaken around So very badly Ahm.. Jump jet upgrade Two nickel ore, and five titanium. I did need the titanium, what am I doing! One, two, three, four, five. Ahm Ooh wait hold on, there's a nickel ore in there Do I have more nickel ore? Oh, please tell me I do Come on At least one more. At leeeast one more! Oh, this is not looking good Are you serious are you serious? Are you seeeerious? *More whiney Jack* Nickel ore is all the way down in the fuckin' lava zone    (¬¨Ôºø¬¨) Ohhh, all I needed to do was get one more. All that time, one more. That's all I needed. Peps, we're going on an adventure! We have to go back into the deep down dark deep down, so... Crash fish! A rabbit ray egg discovered Ooh, ooh! Wait, I have to say goodbye to my children before I go anywhere I'm one nickel ore away from being able to upgrade Pepper. How annoying is that? What do you have in you already? Depth module mark two, yeah you should have a lot more cool stuff in you. Why don't you? Oh I know, 'cause I suck I wanna go see my babies! But what's the ray? What- wh- what was that, the rabbit ray? Ray William Johnson? What? Ray William Johnson is inside my aquarium? The fuck? Ohh, the crash fish is the explody bastards! You're not gonna explode me If I go in, are you? Okay, maybe it's a self-defense mechanism that they do. Oh, you! The rabbit ray. Ahhh You're cute. Oh, look at this growing This looks awesome! Okay, I can't wait to come back and see that. But babies, I gotta go I'm going back to the deep down dark deep down and I'm gonna be back soon probably not that soon, but You know what? I- I will be back though. I'm trying to figure out which direction to go We could go back that way towards the blood kelp and get in I could get nickel ore that way... But the place where I need to go to get the Cuddlefish, I think, is near the skeleton And the quickest way to get to any of the lava zone, is back through where the sea Empress was Fyoosh. Let's just go to the blood kelp. What's our power at? 58% That's not enough Hey Reefies! ( Ô∏∂œâÔ∏∂)/ Oh, sorry. Sorry reefies! My engine's about to overheat. I had to slow it down, but just know I love you ‚ô•‚ô• You're the best You too Yeah! Hopefully I didn't say anything that insults you Hopefully there's no reapers around Oh hi friends! I'm back! I think the eh.. From what I remember, the cache The Johnny Cash, is actually over to the side over there, so what I'm gonna do is... what's with all the black smoke? Oh, it's thermal vent. I'm gonna take Pepper out here and go If anything happens to Maria when I'm gone I would be Absolutely sad, and I will come for all y'all's asses Just think about that. I'm gonna go over here 'Cause I haven't scanned the giant skeleton head that was over here anyway either Oh, whoa, whoa whoa. Wait have I sc-
 is it this one I didn't scan or the other one? I can't remember. Um, also gonna get out and heal you a small bit 'cause you're gonna die Yes, I see you ghosty I ain't afraid of you anymore, okay? Well, not a hundred percent. I'm like 75% scared now Um, if I can get some diamond... That's gold Uh, diamonds are a girl's best friend, not gold. Just sayin' Wahhee! Yeah, yeah, you're big and scary. Look, not even afraid. Not even worried. There's a diamond though Yeah, baby! Okay I'ma get this "diamond" real quick, and then I'ma get the fuck outta- out of your house. Right, okay? I'm not scared. I'm not scared even a little bit. Nah, nah. He can't see me in the clouds. You'll never see me down here. Ooh Hey, I know I said I wasn't scared But when a bus is coming at your face, and that bus has a giant mouth that can eat you, It's hard not be a little scared. All right? Big hammerhead bus of teeth. It's pretty terrifying, but you only took nine damage off me, so that's actually pretty good for me. I'm getting diamond because if I can get diamond and an ion cube, i can craft a... tablet Eh fuck, fuck Okay, I'm gettin' out to scan you Ancient skeleton Shut up Whoo, cool picture. Ancient fossilized skeleton. The skeleton of a million-year-old, armored carnivore. Projections suggest this life-form would have been larger than any living creature encountered on the planet. The oceans of the time would have been very different to support life-forms of this size, with more open geography and many more individuals in the leviathan range. Yeah, there's the cache over there I think this is the lab Man, so is this before the- I can't- I can't remember the timeline. Since before the Cataclysm event? The apocalypse event? I don't know. Do you need a purple tablet? Oh wait. Oh wait, oh wait. Oh, I still have the orange one on me. Please accept an orange Yeah! \(ÔΩÄO¬¥)/ Oh, what sheer luck! I don't have to go anywhere anymore! Oh, thank God Is that him? Cuddlefish! Oh, they're so fuckin' cute! They're so derpy, they're just sittin' there like OvO Hi! Wanna take me home? OvO Oh I'm so taking you home, yeees Yeees!! Yeeees! Oh, man Thanks Extensive alien research data on the local fauna, with a special focus on the reproductive methods. Core conclusions have been synthesized: The aliens discovered the life-forms on the planet have just one sex They observed local organisms engaging in asexual reproduction All healthy individuals tested were capable of egg-laying Eggs usually required genetic material from another of the species. In rare case only, one parent was required, with evolutionary mutation introduced by the effects of the environment itself. Research appears to have been focused around hatching conditions and genetic variations between parent and child So they do- they can reproduce very effectively Mixed Leviathan fossils These fossils likely came from the ancient ancestors of the leviathans which inhabit the planet today. The relative size and delicacy of the bones suggests they form part of the ear canal or some other complex internal structure So that- that's uh- that's some big bones right there This looks like a little thing that would- looks like a little fabricator, actually So they're bones from the thing out there Local plants being held in stasis. The aliens evidently sought an extensive knowledge of the planet's ecosystem, which would have been necessary to support any live specimen research. Okay, I don't want to scan that thing. The amoeboid So, if these were parts of the ear The size of them. It's a huge bitch! You go through there, now Okay. Nice, nice, nicearoni Awesome! I have what I came for. I don't need to be here anymore. I don't need to accept all of your shit anymore Well, except you manta ray, dude. You didn't really do anything to me, per se. Oh wait. No, I need nickel Ooh, that was actually originally what I came down here for. Ooh, I forgot Hmm, surprised this skeleton is actually still able to withhold the size of the prawn suit All right, I have to go- Oh, seek the underside of a dogs anus. I'm sorry Cindy, but sometimes you just need to have yo need a hush-hush No need to go a little bit down into deep dark down deep down Place can you ow? Ow ow ow what the fuck was that burning me? What is killing me what the fuck is this acidic Oh my god, I almost died Geez man where am I no more turned around? Oh a nickel or deposit? Don't mind if I crack into this tasty. No good. Do you doesn't matter? What you think of doing it anyway phone. Can you? Re Just a little bit little bit of little bit pumped I'm a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll Really, wish I had a vehicle upgrade way back on day or like a vehicle upgrade fabricator back on Maria Because then I'd actually have the pieces I need to build this right here now, and then we'd have sweet sexy job jet upgrades I'm just gonna take all this because I have the power I have the technology. I have the storage I'm just really glad I have another cuddle fish I'm going to give Kevin a sister and this cuttlefish is going to be called Cara Lee Kevin and Cara Lee together forever So any more upgrades I need seemeth solar charger that stuff I can make back home energy efficiency module ooh a solar charger would actually be really handy seamoth So now I can get that back there perimeter defense I can get that back there um Even though I don't really want defense I'm just trying to think what I need if there's anything down here that I specifically need fire suppression That would actually be really handy. I have a shit on a crystalline sulfur I might owe a repair module That actually be great Some of this stuff, I don't need I might need to get some more gel sacks But I also might need to just get the fuck out of here cuz I don't like it I am on my way I Can go the distance I'll be there someday Okay, sir Sir you need to back off okay each backup all I'm attacking up Oh you want to tussle with the muscle you want to go bitch I? Will fuck you up seven ways from Sunday. Oh Yeah, oh just cuz you're a ghost and you got no fuck Just cause you're a GoSee ain't got no physical body on the bottom does that mean I'm through with you Mess you up I need to be very careful of my health Whoa, whoa why you want to go you want to go again these dodging skills God mighty you just go away I Know if I had infinite health in my pron suit I'd actually probably be able to kill it And if I had some torpedoes and everything I'd probably be able to do it but I'm not here to kill. Okay. I make love not war unless you bring the war to my front door And then I will kick your ass for Now it's gonna rest on my perch here think about my day Fire fire fire fire fire fire anybody you want to help fire Okay Man my submarines so good it's straight fire right now Is that good is that good, huh?

Don't ask me where babies come from though I can't tell you that that's a secret am I finally able to make the jump jet upgrade After 20 new episodes, this is not worthy away. It is what's gonna say It's not where the modification station is but I don't need that I need this one Jump Jet upgrade and Elysium You spin me right round baby right round Listen But all this back and forth I'm doing game look what you're making me do Try my best here What else gonna make a storage module no one wants them? Okay, that's not on that site oh Yes Enter pran no, I just need to end oh god. why is the prawnsuit always so awkward like that I Can access it in the Cyclops, and I can access it out here But I can't access it or repair it when I'm in the actual vehicle doc equip so go to your jump Jets now oh Yes so much more powerful leaner faster Stronger the best jump Jets this game has ever known To space I don't need a Neptune rocket ok maybe you need a little one I Put all my stuff in Henry Man (come on jack really) You are very lucky that there was no nickel ore in there. If there was one nickel ore in this whole thing I would have just (table flipping motion) With my table because that would have been the greatest insult Okay, but what else is new with you hey seaglide guess what I get to put into you a brand new ion battery Or should I save that for an ion power cell and put it in pepper or Sally No seaglide I can charge those guys back here. They don't use up that much energy now the sea glide is gonna last forever. These are all the same eggs (MAYBE BUY SOME NEW EGGS AT EGG STORE) Throw the green and red ones that's lame ah i want better ones Maybe cuz I'm still in the safe shallows, maybe if I actually go down here We'll find some different eggs can I get an Aurora egg? (that would be cool) So then I get like a little mini spaceship flying around inside my aquarium That'd be cool What are you you're one of the ones I already have you're like the sperm cell one (hehehehehe sperm) Can't even remember what you turned into it? was a crash fish or a rabbit ray You think these are all the same mother of Jesus look at all those eggs Holy God Okay, I can't go around searching for all the fucking eggs And you're another one of those Spadefish Okay now I'm gonna have to go back and turn you off. I can't even see the game anymore. Oh there was a stalker, baby I'm a stalker in here. Oh God look at all these other guys Okay, I'm have to pick up some of you. I don't want all of you in here I Just don't I I need to start calling the herd Okay, I need to start getting rid of some of you and just letting you out into the wild Because you can't survive in here. They're too big Boy Jesus Christ, so do you guys just get fuckin hell No smelly (taco bell?) Are you guys holding that in all that time Did you find some of the other fish in there cute and you were like I can't fire it in front of them. Oh?

Top of the morning to you laddies! my name is jacksepticeye and welcome to SpongeBob's day of Terror now after I played the 3 a.m. at the Krusty Krab game I went around looking to see if there was any more Sponge Bob games that I could play especially horror ones because I think it's hilarious and in spongebob there's always these really weird scenarios That they get into and they're always scared of them, and then it's like this well It's like it's not scary at all, but this one this one takes place in rock bottom And it even said you are in rock bottom. How unfortunate So I think I have to go around and collect all the stuff that I need to get out of rock bottom hopefully (game sound) oh..Are you? Jeez, okay. We're in it. We're in rock bottom (jack laughs) It's hippy SpongeBob and Patrick-wait where is Patrick? He got on the bus and left without me didn't he? I don't like it down here. It's weird down here. Even the soil is different I don't like it Hellooo? *spongebob laugh* Anybod- Oh God Oh- What the fuck?? *laughs* Okay, but isn't that good? isn't that what was supposed to happen? he brought my balloon back! he tied it around my hand and I -balloon travel!! No?? Okay, I have no idea what's going on. I've no idea how to avoid this,can I have my uh- Could I have my glove light? That would help me alot if I could have my glove light ooo-uh Candy Better it-bet it tastes better than that glove candy I had before Okay, I got it. I got it. Oooo can I have a Kelp Nougat Crunch? WHAT THE-?! I hate that.I hate that.I hate that guy! he sucks! I need to be faster about this! ohh God, it's scary down here. I can't even tell the restrooms apart Maybe I should just wait to see who comes out Okay, I got two-how do I get away from that guy? you know,if he gives me-Kelp Nougat Crunch! Yes Okay, but don't chase the bus oh,he's over there oh,I see him is he just gonna keep coming at me?! oh,It's like my granddad always said: never chase a bus especially that's what-one that's going straight up at a 90 degree angle. uh-oh, oh no, don't get me now. I can't get that. I don't know what that is I don't even know the things I'm supposed to be getting,these are not things that I need to get out of there out of rock bottom Okay, okay glasses glasses cool. Yes. The glasses will help I think think oh I need to collect the things so I have enough money I get it That's not how spongebob got out of rock bottom though He's right behind me, I don't like that oh man, it's so dark down here. This isn't just regular darkness this is advanced darkness Maybe if I close my eyes it won't seem so dark Okay, okay, I have $7.50. I need nine dollars. ah,this is a safe zone, and the bathrooms are safe, so okay. I probably should have learned the mechanics Could I hear him? There he is Excuse me, I  *Spits* need to *Spits* get out of *Spits* Rock Bottom *Spiiits* Maybe he'll understand that, maybe my accent is too thick Seriously where's my glove light? I need that. I don't know where the-uh- where one of the last items is. I keep left clicking on that one, but it doesn't go. Hi Hi Okay, where am I going? oh oh oh oh oh-Is there anything over this direction? oh, I've got to get caught now trying to do this There's a distinct lack of 7 million buses going by am I supposed to be able to get this? at all?? If I am it's not working Can i just have a ticket? I'm just gonna wait here until morning. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do I can't even go in that direction, is the guy gone? did I break the game? I don't think he's around anymore, can I... Can I get some of this, CANDY *Small moan* So hungry, Okay, let me get the bus, where's stupid Patrick? Left without me. I think I might need to restart. I think the game is broken. uh oh They're randomized That's bad Okay, I got my-I got my hypno glasses. I don't remember that from the episode, but okay ooh I'm- camera? sure, my seashell camera. Can't remember that from the episode either, Umm... But that was in an earlier part of the episode when he didn't actually get to rock bottom yet Okay, walking walking Walking jogging jogging sprinting!! SPRINTING!!!*giggles* Really like that episode actually, that's one of the episodes, I, I actually remember from the show Okay, there are no more items, there's only that weird creepy burger again And the guy is not chasing me anymore.. Did I break the game? Is it just unfinishable now? Let's see what happens if I get this DUN DUN DU-can you guys back off? Ooo! $9.00! yes! it worked, I mean the bad guys not here anymore.] but that's okay. He's trying to give me my balloon back anyway Wait so...is this side cannon? in the Spongebob universe? am I actually gonna get a bus ticket home? *gasps* What? oh my god I actually got on the bus! you escaped rock bottom! *Jack mimicking the game*You are in rock bottom That's not how the episode went. The buses kept leaving and coming and going and he had to- wait. And then there was no buses in was morning and the guy came along and put the balloon on his arm, and he went up in the air... Disappointed! How- How are you going to make great games if you can't stick to- the details of the material Anyway, that was fun for what it was. I don't know there's something... Very rich about the spongebob universe maybe because it's been around for billion years at this point and there's just so much going on but... I don't know I love it. I loved the- I loved the humor that's in spongebob. It's so awesome and even though the font is tartar sauce! "Oh tarter sauce!" *chuckles* anyway, I'm going to leave this episode here, if you want to play it I will leave a link in the description It is free to play, it was up on, Ich.io. I think um..If you have any other spongebob games for me to play please let me know I'm all ear holes! I want to play as many of them as I can isn't,there an actual official spongebob game? I think so I can't remember what platform It's on... I remember seeing somebody playing it might be the Game Grumps or Super Mega anyway, thank you guys so much for watching this episode, if you liked it, PUNCH that like button IN THE Face LIKEABOSS And, high fives around, WAPUSH WAPUSH thank you guys, and I will see all of you dudes............. IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!! "Oh barnacles!" *weird spongebob laugh.* 
TOP OF THE MORNIN' TO YA LADDIES, my name is JackSepticEye and welcome to a game called 'Handle With Care!' It's a game where I have to control, uh... Butterfingers discount Markiplier over here, and I have to go through this Smithsonian Museum, and handle all these delicate objects, and try not to make them crash and burn, but the controls are a little bit, uh... fruity. That's a good word to use, I think. I don't even know what it means, but that's the best way I can describe it, because the controls make NO SENSE, hence the analogy. ANYWAY, (Reading) What an incredible opportunity for you. (Reading) To be now a trainee in our museum! Good job Mark. You're movin' up in the world. (Reading) For the first time in history we have gathered the two biggest collection- of ancient relics in ONE ROOM! That sounds like a bad idea! (Reading) Your work is to put the last three relics in their assigned place. (Reading) GO NOW! -The director Okay Okay, my God. Am I just drunk all the time?! Is that what's happening? Wait, what are the what are the relics, and where do they go? Oh, oh oh! He picked it up. Oh Jesus. What is happening? Careful care- what the fuck?! I have legs, okay. I am a real boy, and I know that that's not how legs work. I have no idea where this goes. I don't know where I'm bringing this. Oh no. Is it going upstairs? AHHHH, careful! WOO! WOO! [incoherent shouting] This is tricky. WHY do you have spaghetti for legs? Spaghetti does not go on a human. It goes in a beautiful bowl filled with tomato sauce! Okay, up we go. I think it goes up here. Okay. We got this. No problem. Take this picture of Zeus smiting his foes And just place it down. Oh no. Oh, no. Okay, gentle. Gentle. Ge- I'm not even touching anything! Ah. Ah ah! AH! Eh- heh. [unintelligible noises] Fuck. OooOOH (The mating call of the majestic Jack) Hohoho! Splay those legs, and display that piece of art! Perfect. Oh my Go- OH MY... stooooooppp [blowing air at the vase] [vase shatters] Fuck it! Ohhhhh, the diwector's gonna be aaaangwy I didn't mean to do that! Why? Why? I'm holding forward, and you feel like- You control like a bus! Okay, okay, take this one. Take this one. I don't even have to press anything. He just grabs it- ah, the fuck! Okay! Tap foward! I'm not pressing anything! This is just how it is. Okay, I should be well used to this. I'm Irish dammit, I know how to control a drunk person! I did it for 28 YEARS! Okay, okay, okay. Thread the needle! Thread the needle! I know I like to talk about how speed is key and all that, but Jesus Christ, would you slow down? Slow is a type of speed! Fuuuuck! Fu- don't fall, don't fall, don't fall- ooooh- oh BALLS! Okay, okay, we're down to the five hundo. Oh, are you gonna fall as well? Oh, the director's gonna have my ASS! Please please please please please please please please COME FORWARD! Yay! Okay. [groaning] Ohoh. God. [Vase shatters] My score went *up* with that one. Ohh, cuz I put the thing in place! O-kay Offset the bad score by doing a good job! Doesn't matter if you break a few eggs, as long as I make this sweet tasty museum omelet. Whoo, this one's heavy. It feels like lifting Zeus's testicle. OOOH! Go- aw fuck, AH! I DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH THAT ONE. Why do I have to be fuckin' Johnny Long Legs? Oh God. Ohhhh God. Oh, children would have an easier time with this. [incoherent noises] DAH HAH (Out of breath) Okay. 1750! I think we did okay! 1750! High blood pressure and a heart attack later, *clap*  we have a winner! Okay, do I just have to do this again? Is this a- okay. This is all the game is. Putting three of these in three places. I can do it this time. I can do it this time. I can at least beat 1750. Oh hohohohoho! Control those daddy long legs! Careful, careful, careful. Oh God standing still is something that you- Sssseemingly can't fucking do! Leeeean to the left ch- *CRASH!* What the fuck was that?! I-I did not tell you to do that. No, I just want to do the cha-cha slide! That one's gonna fall over. AHHHH. (Vase breaks) OH, it's all over! It's all over. Why even bother?! Why even try anymore?! Put this thing down! Oh great! Oh look mister director, all your things have broken! You can't fire me! Because now you have no business, because you have no valuables! Ohhh, shame about the Ming Dynasty! Huh?! [vases shattering in the background] Hmm. Yes. Lovely piece of art. You can really tell that the artist was a fan of the band- Kiss, and it really brought out his inner emotions. You can just sense the turmoil going on in the colors. [smashing a vase] And I don't like THIS ONE- This one SUCKS- This one is a cheap knockoff! This one deserves to be in a bog! Whatever, I hate my job! Okay! Easiest first! WHY! Touchin' things turns me into flubber! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Just don't touch anything. If you don't touch anything you can't break anything. That's simple science at this point. Oh, no. Oh no.... [vase shattering] WHY?! WHY?! Just- just walk forward! Wa- OOOOO! That's it. That's it! Walk forward. Watch, I'll touch the wall and now I'll- Ssspring load into action. Just straight forward. Straight forward. It's very straight forward. Oh! Like ridin' a BIKE. Like riding a bike that had legs made out of jelly. Okay, one down, two to go! I can do this! No problem at all at all. Here we go. Ohhhh, careful! Careful, careful, careful, careful, careful, careful. Uh hi hi hi hi. How you're not falling over, I'll never know. [Nyoom sound, vases shattering] WHAAAAAAAAT?! Oh my god, I didn't even touch youuuu. Those legs, they look small and scrawny, but my God they can hold up fierce weight. Oh God, if you were a real person I would punch you in the back of the head. That's right. You- don't- don't look- turn around and look at me as I do this! EYES FORWARD, Nummy nummy numb nuts! Oh my god, this fucking sucks. This fucking SUCKS! There we go! 1,200! All I need to do is not hit ANYTHING with the last one! That's not gonna happen! Okay, can we initiate Leg Protocol please? Okay, initiating. There we go. Here we go. If I can get through these pillars without hitting any of them, my legs will be fine. Very temperamental legs, I have. They don't know whether they're comin' or they're goin'. Imagine if: Quasimodo's eyes were legs. That's exactly what I have going on here Don't hit the pictures either because I think they're also very valuable. No! Don't hit anything. Don't hit anything. Don't hit anything. Don't hit anything. Yes. Yes! Wha- why? Why? What are your legs doing?! You're like fuckin' Michael Flatley from Lord of the Dance! [vases shattering] STOP IIIIIT! Just put the thing on. Just put the thing on. 1750 again! I'm beginning to think that any a score That's higher than this- the only high score that this game has- is actually surviving by the end of it Is actually going on after finishing the game and living! Because this will kill most people! [vases shattering] And I hate THESE ONES, stupid nipple plates, The big butt- bulbous vase- Screw that. What would you even put on these? The Romans didn't even use them, the Greeks didn't use them, NOBODY used them! They're in perfect condition here! Clearly nobody used them, so why do we have them? Oh mother of fuck. Tho- that's not how legs work! Fuckin' Christ! You're givin' Slender Man a run for his money. I figured it out. This is actually Octodad in disguise! This is Octodad in THIS GUYS! This is Octodad in THIS, guys! STOPIT!!! Ohhh, hit this giant gong of a plate. Can I knock that one down? I want to knock the big plate down. I want to knock the big plate down! Yeah, haha! It didn't break. That's it. I'm leavin'. I'm goin' home to my wife and child. WELL, THAT DOES IT for this video on Handle With Care! I'm going to go away now and handle my brain with care! I'm just gonna go and watch videos of cats, playing with dogs, playing with bigger cats, to make my mind go at ease. Yeah, you- you can stop looking at me and all. Yeah, I bet that moustache and beard are fake. They look like they just pop off like Lego. ANYWAY, Thank you guys so much for watching this video! If you liked it, PUNCH that Like button in the face... LIKE A BOSS! AND, high fives all around, *WAPUSH, WAPUSH* Thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes... IN THE NEXT VIDEO! [outro music] How come on the end screen you're able to stand perfectly still? 
Top of the mornin' to ya, laddies! My name is jacksecticeye, and welcome back to Subnauseous! How are we doin', Sam? wait wait no do another one, you can't just do a high-five Sam- "LIKE A BOSS!" There you go Thanks. It keeps me going in the morning. Also my kitty *Kissing Sound*  there you got to give them a little smooch before you go, so I'm taking this off the wall I know crazy plan it's gonna make sense in a second even though I explained my plans last time I still have all the materials for it so what I'm doing is putting it into my big baby Maria over here What's up girl? How are you doing? You're doing good? I hope this is still a thing I can do Cause the best thing, one of the best things about the Submarine, about Maria is that she comes with built-in storage, so I have a lot of lockers already there I can build more and just technically never need Henry ever again. That's the That's the end goal to never ever need Henry again to just be able to put all my stuff into this and then go What are you? No vehicle docked You're the vehicle thing here Whoa that's cool. Oh you shoot the decoys I thought I'd just shot them myself Oooo I have an upgrade module for you oh, I shouldn't go anywhere yet, oooo very nice Yes, okay, and there's a fire extinguisher on board very nice So this thing has always been here this little like circle thing, that was never there before and I got blueprint to be able to get a creature decoy I didn't know that I needed to shoot them from this thing interior modules This bad boy, yeah Okay, I have you centered right now Maybe not the best idea because what I'm gonna put some stuff over here as well, so this would be like my my manufacturing station in here and the goal is to get enough power cells and put you back in so I don't have space here and We actually just bring a bunch of stuff cuz I'm heading to the island we said that last time we're heading to the island You should drag you over closer, but Maria. You're a big gal I can't drive you that close so I want to put the seamoth into it as well see months should be fully charged where it is now because obviously the Power Cells in my Submarine are gonna get used up like that Cyclops engine efficiency module that is very very useful, none of this stuff is useful out on the road That's all stuff that I'm gonna need At a different date, so just let's clear out all these things Let's make sure, you don't go on a road trip without being prepared. Okay. Is there anything even left in this thing? Oh some things Okay, Imma just take you out and move you around So I just have Oh you're still charging my battery, wondered what that sound was so we're on its own, so you're you're the one that's not really gonna go anywhere I don't think anything is gonna come in here and push you a fish might come and push this one And then I lose it, so I don't lose all the materials. I once had And do I have anything in here? I really don't think I have anything in here. That's useful out on the road fire extinguisher? We bring some purple tablets and ion crystals Just for the rare occurrence that cuz when I get to this island there might be some places that I can Open up there is a warp gate on the other island that I didn't get to, remember the place with the giant gun that shot down my Sunbeam RIP on beam f to pay respects On that island, inside the caves, I didn't actually go in there You there's a warp gate in there that you can use a crystal for to get into I can't remember that warp gate brings you I think that warp gate brings you back to... that don't make any sense Where does it fucking bring you? Oooo! Nice so we can actually put my sea moth upgrades in here So don't actually have to bring it back to my vehicle upgrade bay That's neat okay, give me two seconds, Maria, and we'll get you moving. I know you're aching to go you're aching to bake and These things oh yeah upgrade module Because the thing about the energy efficiency module is that it uses less energy to drive around Within my power cells are already charging themselves so Engine efficiencies have 300% So technically I should be able to hold on Technically I should be able to go Forever now with this. One more power cell would be nice just to fill up the Oh, she's moving she's moving for the first time in a long time an extra Power Cell would be nice to be able to fill up the Just the charger, and then we'd have two on the go every single time. I take out two, put in two, right This might not be the best way to go around this. I can't go that way Because when I do I get stuck Ooooo I mean these are in the game already before, but it's just I know man, it's nice. Please be able to determine How close you are to things because you when you're in the, when you're in the cockpit? Or as I like to call it the jack pit It's hard to see what's underneath you. It's hard to see how close you are to things God it's still hard to see how close I am to things Careful now, easy does it you know on the beach Maria It's exactly what I'm gonna do and the only reason I came this way because I was too lazy to reverse and go back the other way Which is by far the easier method to do because the oceans are much deeper over there. Well once we crest this ridge We are fine Sorry whatever that was I don't really care cuz now that I'm in Maria Everything is go, all bets are off Okay, Maria. Is your arse clear? Well clear okay. We're gonna go down a small bit umm. What's the depth you can go to? 500 meters, okay Still not great because a lot of the later game stuff down by the sea traders path and all that stuff you're getting into like a Thousand and twelve hundred. To get down into the lava zone Where is going to be a thing that we need to get to eventually that's very very deep hey reefies And for the people asking- no you can't kill a reef back They are like the one constant. You can't kill them. They can't kill you, they just flow it around. They're the best They're my best friends in this game And oh wait, I don't need to go up to see where I'm going I can just do this Wait where's the island oh I'm all arse way hahaha You used to be able to build bases on reef backs as well But they took that out of the game before I even got a chance to try it out Which is annoying because I would have loved to put a base on a reef back Put a little like, put a little beacon in there and see where they See where the base actually ends up, very easy lose your base though, hold on a minute. It's my energy efficiency that good? I'm still at a hundred percent Well what are you? Okay, maybe if I sped it up, let's see how fast she goes Is that a reef back? Jesus Okay, so aww we're down to 99% the reason you don't go at full speed most times is because you make a shit ton of noise and Here, that's when Reapers are going to start hearing you But right now that doesn't really bother me because there's no Reapers between here the, safe shallows Wait that can happen oh, that's what this is it's So regular speed you can't you can't actually overheat, but with this ah So as it says that's emergency speed I guess you don't use that until you actually need to to get away from something Okay, there's the island Still immensely creepy Where's the beach? Where's an area can actually get off? For some reason whatever you look at it straight, it always looks smaller than it actually is But it's pretty big okay, here we go and don't forget the floaters so the only reason this island is actually in the air, the other one is I get it The other island is actually like cemented to the ground like most islands in our world but This island is only floating because giant floaters are underneath it Which I think is cool I do not have nearly enough water for this trip Balls to that man Okay, I could have just come over here in Sally Would have been better actually to do that, but I love my Maria! Look at her big beachy goodness, okay, we need Surface You can be Another type of orange so when you get them all different colors, ooh You can kind of see the island in the distance, see there on the right Where the clouds going over? If I turn right though it starts to disappear haha Weird oh fuck it's almost nighttime All these stupid headcrab things are here Okay, okay, okay do this quick Ahhh I hate them, start scanning everything here Fuck off! This is an important island, you saw as I came in that there's a base up on top That's my plan to get to there. This is beautiful. Oh, I got a message Um Well Jack's not home right now, and there's the other one Jack's not at home right now, so thank you for leaving a message I will get to it when I get to it. Okay. There's a base right here lantern fruit You edible? Nice so the best edibles are the ones that give you back water Some edibles don't do that so God you take up a lot of space I'm just gonna eat a bunch of these so my water gets high cuz I'm very low that but it's nice to know that I Have a source here, and then I might be able to actually pick some up for later to be able to plant them Okay yeah, here's the here's the grow bed Exterior crow bed no. I don't want one of them Chinese potato plants These are the best Did I scan you? Oh I didn't even scan this one. I only it's got the other one okay I don't need an exterior grow bed. I need an interior grow bed. I have the stasis rifle stuff Oh it's very very quiet ahhh! Jesus I have to scan the bulkhead? Stop it, go away. This way it brought med kits with me, and you know what you know what we're doing Here Okay little shits, where are you? Who's near me? Come here What did I pick up? I don't know I picked up, picked up a fucking rock Where are you little shithead? Come here Here's why, come here Come here thattaboy thattaboy bye! Have fun on Mars Oh God freaking out Ow! Come here Come here little shitbag bye! Okay, I need be careful though I'll run out of power with this thing if I'm not careful um You have a flashlight and a PDA. I know I'm missing some PDAs as I'm going around the game. I don't mean to Just sometimes to get caught up in the moment and I'm very well aware of how much food and water and oxygen and stuff I have *Voice Log* Son, I said wait for the storm to pass Your life's more valuable  to me than a plant patch You stopped being in charged when the ship you were captioning sunk I'll stop being in charge when you take charge of yourself say chief, cheif What? You know how to drain those grow beds of 40 tons of storm water or how to conjugate? From the air. I know how to prioritize I'm just saying if that's so what's your boys life worth today if tomorrow You're gonna be so hungry you start wondering what it tastes like... Let him go deal with the plants Son, go deal with the plants Interfere with my family again and when rescue arrives I will leave you here Do you understand me? No rescue coming chief , not in time I'm not staying here neither this rain keeps falling sooner or later this place will be buried the only choice We got is whether to get buried with it *Jack* So yeah Bart Torgul was the guy who did all the plant stuff I believe *Log* Chiefs log 5 weeks since the crash. The only other survivors are my son, Bart... (Jack- this one is before the other one) After days drifting in the lifepod rain hammering on the roof the weather clear then we washed up here I had made a service that the Ghazi rec Said not to finding as a stable source of food His education is paying off sooner than that anticipated our only problem is meter she says the weather's going to turn I Say, she's finding excuses to risk our lives Imagine she snuck on a weekend our life the her physical altercation, and she's itching for a fight In every judgment she makes things go from bad to worse If she had my experience. She'd have more faith Humans have spent millennia specializing and had a shackled nature to our will This planet won't cause us any new problems Now what task now is to keep us alive as comfortably as possible until the insurance company arranges rescue And this power of space that could be months or even years *jack* Great I'm just gonna hang out here then Wall planter I guess just scan what you can Can I get in, down here? Yay. Oh, there are purple artifacts here, okay What is that thing? I don't know I found it outside in the sand part of another ship I've ever seen it's not even scratched Don't fool around with that it might be worth something stand down chief Then we're gonna crumble to dust it would have done so when I picked it up. It's glowing We're not the first people to come to this planet people maybe Could be aliens could be the damn sea monsters for all we know one thing for sure we ain't gonna find out by staying here *Jack* So they're talking about that the purple artifacts. I just picked up Okay, I think that's everything in here It's already light out, that's cool. Can I cheat the system and get up here real fast? There's two peaks on this island one up there it has a base and one over here has the other base And where there are bases there are lots of very good Things to scan in it, don't fall off Don't fall off, it's tryin' to claim a hill in Skyrim or something The rocks are all fallin' apart, Lets do a self-scan, we haven't done one of those in a while Nothing? Okay, this is actually the way up. Why is my scan returning nothing? That's weird Okay, this is scary. I don't like climbing these mountains. I never have but hey look at all the pretty shiny water all the shaders disappear up this far I Should have I should scan them before I do anything you never know. They could be poisonous I never liked poison in my body it hurts Okay a land-based fungus species with harvestable spores inedible fuck ya then God the Aurora's far away from here Speckled rattler, can any of you things have an aerogel? I forget where I get that A brittle land plant containing large spores is generating a Characteristic rattle when the plant is shaken this may act to ward off predators, or even encourage pre Predation as a means of spreading the spores Okay almost there. Yeah, show me what you got, okay? That's why the Chinese potato plant is so good because it lets you pull so many off of it And then when you eat it, it actually gives you like a lot of food and water So I just need a couple to be able to There's the other place Fresh food, no building materials nothing left of the ship, and your kid says we're gonna starve without more grow beds Speak up kid. It's true father The natural growth rates are too slow to keep supporting us. I'm saying is oceans got us, surrounded No use hiding Sooner or later. We'll get our feet wet The rest of your life may have been a fight mater But I've made my decision you want to forfeit your emergency paid to take a swim go ahead believe me I'm thinking of it Man, mutiny was ripe wasn't it? a little bit more Technically, I only need one to plant and then I can take bits off the one that grows and then just plant those so This place was not that useful Always nice to have spotlights and shit, though So all that stuff before like spotlights and everything I think they were just in your Inventory or they like you didn't have to get blueprints and shit for them Don't hurt yourself oh Oh, oh is this gonna kill me if I try go down it a A long time ago when I played the game I think it was the first time I actually came to this island there was no fall damage in the game So I could run across this whole place and just leap off as much as I wanted and I never took any damage Was fantastic I loved it There's also some caves in this area, I think Maybe that's where the warp gate leads Maybe each warp gate goes to each Island That'll be handy except if I did that now I end up leaving all my stuff behind which I don't want Okay, give me the good stuff. Give me. Give me something amazing That's not amazing, ooh Water Maybe water is pretty good This is bad after all that time in the deep I've been dreaming of it Now I'm back here I'm finding it hard to enjoy alone father. Was right So deep They do not want us down there despite my best efforts Ill-health is taking hold of me The visions are getting worse Margaery and father are now part of the ecosystem of this incredible planet It's reassuring to know that when I go I'll join them until then There's always the view Man, that's scary so you guys never left this island or that was your plan to never actually leave it? I mean the view is nice and all, but it's nice no fucking it's nothing amazing Oooo indoor grow bed that's the shit I needed That right there is the whole reason I came to this island That is going to save our asses That's what's going to keep us alive if I can get an indoor grow bed going So you should pick up some of these as well plant them If I can get an indoor grow bed going and a water filtration system, then I never have to worry about that stuff again drink this water Nice Okay cool. I think that's the main part of what this island has to offer I think anyway Should be able to just head back to my submarine now So next on my list after this well, I should come back to this island again and explore more of it anyway Because there's a lot to it as I said there's stuff inside the island At least that's what I remember inventory full, okay cool Wait how did I get here? I came through a hole Somewhere out this way Next of my list is to build the prawn suit I need to go out and get some aerogel I think that was the only thing that I didn't have so far that was needed all the other stuff I kinda I can find bits and pieces of it everywhere My best source of stuff like lithium is the other island Lead and all that stuff. We can kind of find around, look at that beautiful baby Alright, there's so much going on in this game all the time as well That it's easy to just be it's easy to bounce from thought to thought Begone tHOT Really hope I can actually just plant this stuff in here again What if they remove that ability? Oh yes, what do we need four titanium? I don't have four titanium? Seriously, that's all I need? That's amazing let's head back Here we go Maria. We're kicking off again, but before we go *heooooOoonk* Haha, Oh engines are on wait while I'm here. Let's go down Oh, fuck this, man Because this is where we are now is near the grand reef And these areas are all super important Like down *stutters* We're going down those holes later in the game Right now we can't I've actually got Maria down until one of them at one point And I was so afraid that I could never get her back out again Really wish I had the depth meter here in front of me now. Oh, I see a shiny Yeah down into these holes is someplace that we are going later on We're at 194 meters? I can take Sally out in that Okay wait no no no no no no actually. I needed to be down there hahaha what am I doing? Okay, here locker boom boom no no no Fuck sometimes, it's left click to move stuff back and forth like the charging stations And then sometimes it's right-click and I keep getting mixed up every now and then and Messing it up so I eat a bunch of stuff as long as I have one of each I'm fine You're a bioreactor right Oh a thermal plant I have that oooo I can get the four pieces of titanium if I scan stuff that I already have Didn't think about that Now I'm thinking about that and that's the thing I'm going to see down the fucking down into the devil's anus It's so fucking horrible. What are you? moonpool fragment. that'll do Wait I was here You really shouldn't have your lights on anymore if I've gotten you oh Yeah I was here Boo Did I go in here though? Yeah, I think I did Goddamnit. Well there was not a fruitless endeavor we did get our titanium So now we can build the grow bed. Oh, that's great I love how fast he climbs the ladder build you right there You're not getting much sunlight in here, that's fucking crooked and that's gonna piss me off but it's done who cares Give me things Do not left-click them keep in mind pay attention Nice nice I'm so goddamn proud of this series so far we are making such amazing progress This is the type of stuff that I wasn't doing until way later in the other series I mean obviously because I was taking way longer to actually figure shit out And I was trying to figure out where all the places were and stuff just wasn't in the places It was supposed to be so now. It's easier to find schematics and blueprints and bits and pieces of everything because it's It's it's just better made floodlights Switch those bad babies on so we can see where we're going- they did not really help. Okay keep your eyes peeled it is kind of sad that- ooooh It's kind of sad that there's nothing really left in the game to surprise me monster wise Like I've kind of seen all the creatures that the game has to offer And I would love if cuz I'll never get that feeling back of seeing a Reaper for the first time again, which Scared the shit out of me Because it was it was that thing where you got into the game. You're like "are there are crazy creatures in this game?" "I don't know" and then you actually got into it. You're right. "There are crazy creatures in this game!" This is the grand reef right? Where these things are? And then somewhere, there's holes to go down further. I'm seeing electricity Is that electricity? That's a wreck Oooo ooo ooooo Wait is that the one I went to? I don't fucking know anymore I don't know where I am Stop it music you're freaky. Um wait what depth are we at? 194 okay Sally can go down a bit more, look at my baby's growing! Te he Imma proud dad So cool so so cool I fucking hope so that's where I left them Moon pool fragments What are you? You just quartz? okay You are just quartz Is this the one I came to? Nope cuz this isn't harvested yet, what are you? Cyclops depth module Oh, baby a triple! What are all these things? Scanner room fragment, I have that. thermal plant, I have that. membrane tree! scan him! don't have one of those! Okay you have a lot of talk on you, and I am on the clock right now So I'll come back to you in a little bit Okay, Imma bring Sally all the way down here Because I can and she's going to be my rescue if I ever need to get out in a jiffy just remember Sally is the yellow one Sally is not Henry me remember that this time yet fucking gone doogal This is another part of the thermal plant fragment isn't it yep? Okay, I don't think this place is of any use to me. Don't get shocked okay Anything do I have you I'm pretty sure I have you I did not Oh and the grappling arm fragment or the grappling arm upgrade is one of the more important ones for that because That saved my ass getting around the place Not just because it got me out of danger. I think it just saves so much time when you can grapple everywhere Otherwise getting around to the prown suit is the most tedious thing in the planet oh, no this was the ship that caused me issues Cuz I remember cutting through this door like five times And when you have to do that- What are you? Have you already don't I yeah? When you need to cut through the thing like five times you start wasting all your oxygen trying to stay alive So it was just annoying Oh god where am I? Okay, I just got you PDA "Torgal Corporation is a long-standing, family-run clan that operates almost a dozen mining and trading operations. The company share price hit an all-time high on the announcement by a Mongolian cabal of their intention to construct a new phasegate utilizing Torgal materials. These plans were put on hold when Bart Torgal, the intended leader of the new mining operation, disappeared along with his father roughly a decade ago." A decade ago?! So they were on that fucking island since a decade ago?! yeah, tho- those people by the way, the people in the The abandoned base that I was just in, they're not like part of the Aurora ship They're not part of my mission. They- they came long, long before me Um... Just make sure I got everything, can I open you? No. okay time to head out. Not yet Cyclops docking repair module That's new isn't it? Oh, shit how do I get out? How do I get out? I can't remember how I got in. okay down here. Oh god That's the scariest part. When you can't find your way back out again Okay Maria and coming home wait a sec Okay, Maria, I'm coming home. a repair module for the Cyclops For like the actual Bay so when I bring my thing back in here it not only charges it but repairs it That'll be pretty cool. It tells you how long ago how long they are to grow Neato burrito okay now we are definitely heading back to Henry because I need to I have some upgrades that I want to see if I can build some stuff for the Cyclops Upgrade modules depth modules that kind of stuff and also that repair Bay Might be a pain in the ass to go repair or that or not repaired by farm all that shit, but what are you gonna so? Sorry! Geez! I'm not even hitting anything you hit the smallest fish That sounds like a nuclear wars going off inside you. Hey reefies! I wonder if this still work, okay? I want to get close enough this used to be like a little Easter egg thing I did it before Okay shh Okay you've already made your noise, let's see Don't know sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't Okay that was just coincidental, and that's the thing I don't know if it ever actually was an easter egg That's just floating. I never knew if it was an actual Easter egg that they responded or if that was just a If there was just a coincidental thing like people pressed it, and then they respond. I was like they respond God I hit a fish oh Wait shit is this the sand dunes This is the sand dunes. That is a motherfucking reaper right there? Oh? Peace no no no no go away. No Good good good fuck Okay exits camera easy Gemma. Oh wait are we played? Okay emergency speed I'm out I'm out. I'm out Am I am I breached is this the thing that I should be fixing repair to repair tool The glass is fucking leak and I don't like that that means it's not fully repaired Okay, just go just go back to Henry back to Henry we go Okay, have a bit of Health gone But it's not letting me repair the crack. I don't know what to do. Hey Henry. How you doing buddy? Doing good? Everybody everybody good. Everybody happy. There's my one-legged moon pool okay, let's Let's pause you right here for a second in Today is he or she not fix any of you am I doing is that just gonna stay there Or is there a hole somewhere else so they can fix Because that's what used to happen Hey Sally It used to be a thing where holes would just prop up and then you'd fix them and it would fix the whole ship But maybe it doesn't work like that anymore. Oh wait wait wait. I need to take Sally out You see if there's any upgrades I can build Those a successful adventure, ooh Nice okay use planter they could put Two more in and then just eat these Okay because that's fully grown I'm gonna take that one out and eat this Sweet Whoo very very good very good very proud of myself Very proud of our adventures everybody that's you included we all did this Okay you go for one bed to another Thanks feels good to be back now. Let's see if any more stuff propped up that I can build On sook rappeling arm and promise you drill arm seamoth modules, okay, so maybe Maybe the other stuff. Then is in here here we go Depth module mark two, I need mark one first, ooh They can make it thermo blades or why not wait where do we get mark one? There's no place to make a cyclops module mark one It says I need that Where do I build that? Either way I need nickel ore which I don't have I don't need kyanite and kyanite I know exactly where to get kyanite down in the freaking lava. Isn't it? Gosh dang it All right well I'm thoroughly confused whoo here. We go here. We go. I forgot I Forgot to give you your name base color Hell yeah name that will be black interior white I guess an exterior will be blue There you guys match Big Maria and mini-me yeah, I got a message didn't I what's this message say play Jesus Carrying high priority passages, I feel like I found that place already All under the life pods. I just found randomly as I was going to like the Aurora and stuff. Oh the fucker no Okay equipment I Don't think new I can make anything worth making It's the air system in the pipe and everything is such like basic level shit Having a stasis, rifle, I guess And did magnetite for that. I don't have magnetic oh Yeah, fluid intake would it be a good idea, but you know what Cindy I Need I I have a job to do first and that job is to be the world's greatest habitat builder no wrong buttons Endora crow bed can I put you in a corner somewhere? I? Don't just put you in the middle of the floor Nice So now I have to I need to go get some stuff off Maria and put it in there, so well, Maria I'll be making a bunch of them. I'll also have a spare back here, so whenever I come home I don't have to waste the ones that I get in Maria You know I mean it's called tactics I still have a bleeding hole in my fucking thing lantern tree Did you make one fruit Are you just a thing that stays and keeps making fruit, I'm okay with that I'm down with that that's pretty cool Drive me insane. I need to fix it so don't have some duct tape then it fix it up real nice I Think now that it says Sally When I get away from Maria it says Maria ha ha For anyone who's new here by the way the reason they call it Maria is not because just I like the name or anything It's because it's it was submarine sub-Maria That was that was the thing it was very very clever on my part I Need some bladder fissures to get the water in my body because I'm gonna die right I'm gonna head to lifepod 13 in a second But another very vital thing that I want to make inside Maria That's going to be another thing. That's the lifeblood of my whole game is a fabricator so If I have a fabricator on the move, then I could just come in here and build all the stuff. I want so if Per se I'm out at an island, and I start gettin thirsty And the only way to get water is to either go back to a water filtration system I've built, wonder if i could build one on Maria or Another idea is to go back to Henry to the fabricator, but now the fabricators here So if we just take the stuff in the storage on Henry and in fact if I oh I could make a radio here but with the radio here and take all the stuff out of storage on Henry I Technically never need Henry ever again. That's just the way things are Eat one of you and 4e two of you and plant three Measure twice cut once Where am I I'm all turned around have no idea where I am Maria I'll be back to you now in a second. Don't you worry oh, it's getting daytime nice I was gonna say I need to go to bed as well So boom boom boom, Nice Do I have any copper laying around I surely do There I can build my radio now on Maria Henry, I'm sorry okay? Wait can it oh you can't deconstruct that one you can't deconstruct any of these things Don't have room? Hell Yeah, I do Everybody Say goodbye to Henry Henry we have loved you Henry you are the best of us that water over there looks really really cool with the moon rule, but Henry we love you, buddy But for now our time must end Even though I'd be coming back here because my moon pool, and everything is here on my base technically here But I never ever need to go back into Henry ever again The sad day It's a sad day when you're in friends up and leave isn't it This shit is so cool as well the fact that you can just store your Seamoth in here or your prawn suit. It's cool shit Put all you guys in here Yeah Why do I have an acid mushroom? I don't know. The battery charger now is another thing I need to uninstall and bring up here and then radio put you right there This is all coming together I'm so proud all righty, and now I should have put the battery charger next to the battery charger Whatever you can go in the corner Efficiency of space is also a thing, but Other things I did Desk I can put you in nice Are we gonna dismantle this thing eventually but Little Jack could go with us little Sam And another thing I have oh not in here is my little Aurora ship And you go whoo capital Aurora ship why oh? I can't place that anywhere, but the base Well that fucking blows alright, so let's Kick it let's head on out. Where are we going? We are going this way? That's a thousand meters away Well whatever I wonder if there's any speed modules you can get for Sally She's a nimble Beast let's go through the tunnel Through the tunnel of love Sally through the tunnel of love look at that lovely lavender glow Aren't you happy I brought you out here Sally. Isn't it wonderful majestic whatever But you're only 175 meters down, and it's faster if I just go there in Sally and then come back Really think I've been here, but if not we might get some tantalizing lore details Now I'd already know what I'm doing next I didn't say I was gonna put the prawn suit Guess I need a lot of stuff for that I might dicken with the alien stuff then after this Really do need those depths modules though The depth modules are really really important because you can't progress the game unless you get the depth modules for all your gear The prong suit can go the deepest quite default out of all their vehicles that you get But it's still not enough to get to the the endgame zones. Yeah, what are you hate? You're shoving stuff shut your mouth oh? Hey courier the second mushroom forest It's a nice place. It's a good place. There's also an area around here that Wasn't so nice. That's not like a little girl screaming. There's an area around here that Think you can go down into and there's like a secret precursor alien vault and Then also it was the first place. I saw the electrical doodads and also the tree life is here Always gotta be near as a tree life Okay, I have not been to this one Whoa this is gigantic Holy balls Hey, do you have any scannable x' How did you guys get interrupted huh? He's got a big hole see this Hole was blown out which means something happened in here to get you out, but you had a fabricator. Yeah a little fabric a egg whatever Entry planetary atmosphere I create as the cherishes and sustainers of worlds give me this day my daily pleasures as I give to those who? Seek pleasures from me External temperature approaching critical levels Show me the path in life truth and love of mine is the power I am the one Universe plays with itself I am done playing as this bundle of flesh Well then I guess we knew what happened, but again this exploded from the inside out Maybe he was the Hulk maybe he Hulk busted his way out. That's my running theory Are you a thing are you just lithium oh? That lycium hanging out on top yeah there the air. This is the first place. I went that I ever saw these creatures And this was like way late into the series as well. I had never seen them before that although I think they weren't actually in the game Much before that I think they were added later on And they freaked me out. Also we have yet to find I did say the reef backs are my favorite big just in general because they've been there since the start And I just love how they sound oh they were the first creatures that I heard had like that And I just loved those sounds shit we're almost at our max depth This is where I went into prawn suit shit gets scary down there, man Let me tell you something for nothing, but we have yet to come across my second favorite creatures Which are almost my favorite creatures, which is the crab squids? So think some of them actually dwell down here and the only reason I like them so much is they look weird and They look scary, but the sounds they make are the best sound in the whole game And they did a really good job designing the sounds for them I have an angel singing in my ears. What the fuck is that??! What is that the ghost Leviathan Holy fuck Whoa that's cool have I seen one of them, did I see one of them in the lava zone Dude this music is baller god, they're fucking scary You're spazzing out there though he okay yours like all over the place This music going along with this is so cool Come back closer, so we can see here shiny shame does the shine turn offers it just cuz I'm far away from them Oh What am I doing tempting fate like this? but he doesn't have any like grab her hands on the front like the other Reaper to come up and like attack me I Want to follow him I want to see his glory shine And he seems to be swimming away instead of getting closer. Yeah, it is just cuz I'm far away Or. Are you luring me to my death? What sounds do you make? That's what I'm most curious about sounds are a big deal to me What's happening? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh God? Oh? This is a mistake wasn't it? Hi-hi big beautiful boy oh Are you are you coming are you coming forever oh? What's coming for me. Oh it's coming for me. Oh shit. Yeah, fuck okay? I didn't know if you're actually coming from me there for a minute. Oh my god. I'm at 49 health already Okay do not tempt fate fate will come back and bite you in your hairy ass oh But that was cool He was awesome! Okay, don't go too. Deep because I'll buckle my own fucking ship As soon as it got away from creatures. I need to get out and heal oh Man Yeah Well just an after saying. "Oh, there's no new creatures in the game. There's nothing left to scare me" boom Subnautica slaps you in the ass You're never safe around subnautica. It always has something up its sleeve That was so cool. Hey reef fees Alrighty, well I'm gonna leave this episode of subnautica here also great progress than this episode. We finally got to the island and God Pretty sure I got all the information. I need to get out of there. I will go back to the island eventually To get more stuff now. I just need to figure out The next episode is an annoying episode because I need to figure out how I get all these upgrade modules I need to figure out the stuff needed to make the prawn suit all that kind of stuff and that's all like farming type stuff, so More of it might not be huge progression But you know who knows maybe we'll find a place to go that we can see some cool shit cuz this episode I didn't think I was gonna see the ghost Leviathan that was pretty cool. I like that Anyway, thank you guys so much watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face Like a boss! And high fives all round Thank you guys and I'll see all you dudes In the next video! The only true constant in my life at this point is you Sally and also Maria, but mainly you Sally 
*WHAPOOSH* Top of the morning to ya laddies,  my name is Jacksepticeye, and welcome back to my nightmare, Cuphead! The game where I sit down and say "Hey! Let's record this for a little while" Three years later I actually have some progress made. So... wait, there's something I want to do before I go anywhere else *hums along with music* People have been screaming this at me for the last two episodes, but I had a lot recorded ahead of time So I didn't get a chance to actually read the comments and go back and see, but there is There's a coin in here It was hiding! Apparently there's a lot more coins elsewhere But I have no idea where they are.  I do know that this... is nothing.. I knew that that was nothing. No, the shortcut was actually over here You could go up and around this I mean, it's all useless to me now. "Cutting corners" Hey, I got an achievement for that! I do know that there's probably more coins hidden elsewhere around here somebody did say Inkwell Isle has more coins on it. I don't know where they are Also, I need some air on my legs 'cause it's fucking warm in here I'm not too bothered about finding all the coins just now 'Cause I feel like the stuff I have is probably what I'm gonna use for a while. Can I swap you guys around? Yes! Okay so I start off using that one. Nice! My charm is a smoke bomb and my super... I do have an invincibility super that I'm not too sure about yet Okay we have a level, that's the end oh nooo OH NOOOO Is that really the next boss I have to do? Please tell me there's another boss that I can do before that I don't want to have to fight the dragon I've heard nothing but nightmare stories about fighting the dragon. I don't wanna have to do it Okay, you talked about a shortcut, right? Somebody was trying to tell me where the shortcut was for her. I actually don't know where it is "Wally Warbles", let's go fight a bird. I'm assuming because it was a birdhouse. Are you a bird? Oohh, not one of these! I fucking hate these boss fights. I hate all the boss fights. Oh Jesus! AAH!! He's belchin' out eggs at me! fuck. fuck. fuck. Okay, it's all about learning. I'm not gonna pass him the fucking first time anyway. Where did that hand come out off? Oh shit! Uh-oh! Also I need to remember that I can actually 
go small in these I can go small in these levels. OH mercy! "I own the air-- I fly where Eagles dare!" Okay This is gonna take me a while. Hey his little thing has a face on it. Oh wait. Now It's a giant face on it *BIRD NOISE* Here we go here we go Are y'all up for grabs? Are y'all ready to go? Shit *makes random noises* Oooh mama! Shit Shit shit. Oh Mother of Christ That's a lot of fucking feathers. My mic is blocking some of them. Oh crap no, mother of god.. Okay, we're doing this! BOOM BITCH oh Fuck I'm so dead, one hit and I'm dead I could go small But when I go small I go faster and I ALWAYS fuck it up Okay, nice. Nice. Oh god. Now he's a fucking Tweety Bird. Oh Jesus DAAAH, I didn't realize he was getting closer. How far was that? Okay more than halfway! Not halfbad not halfgood haha "My dad's the Brawn and I'm all the brains! Together we bring the pain." You're a little PIECE OF SHIT Yeah, it was the same when I was doing the 
Djimmie fight. People were saying 'Jack, you do know that you could have'- Oh God 'You do know you could have gotten smaller during the pillar sections?' but When I go smaller I go faster, and I always end up hitting shit anyway 'cause I'm stupid like that. Oh crap, oh crap. Ah, I wanted to get the thing.. I wanted to get the pink. Popow! Like that, nice. Nice. Oh oh oh, mercy! Fuck. Okay, can you die at this section? There we go. Christ... oh christ This isn't even that hard to dodge, but I know I'm gonna fuck it up stupidly I should be at the top of the map where I can hit him easier. Fuuck.. Agh man, that was stupid.. Woah there, Sonny Jim! Okay, that's a confusing one... Is that all you're gonna do? I really hope so. No, it's not. Why would that be all you're gonna do? Why would you- why would you be nice to me like that? Urghhh, I even hit 'A'. We're gettin' back into it, we're getting back into it. I'm feeling it! Woo! It's been-it's been a little  while since I actually recorded it. It's been-it's been about four days *Imitates Willies battlecry* Use your fucking finger guns all you want, it's no use against Jackieboy. Oh god. Ah fuu.. Dat's a retry there, Jimmy. I don't wanna  be taking damage in ze first rounds *makes noises* This section isn't too bad. I feel like I can actually dodge this shit. I'm not gonna jinx it. nah-uh No, sir! There we go!

Oh fuck yeah, okay another one in the bag Feeling good about that. 'Cuphead!' Oh, over the Rainbow Bridge. Wally warbles is no more. Dead. That wasn't even that hard a boss fight actually, that was just... time consuming, 'cause it took a long time to get to the end phase each time. And I didn't have, like, I wasn't prepared for the end phase. I didn't get to practise it enough so... Once I actually got there I was able to do it and... Okay, Imma do the regular level, "Funhouse frazzle", because the next one, is the dragon. I've been- I've been fearing the dragon. Oh yeah, this. What the fuck? What the fuck? Jesus Christ, I'm not- I'm not ready for that Can I actually kill you? Are you a killable thing? You fucking are! What was I wasting all my time for then? Just take your time there Jack. Okay. ni-ni- nice and easy, nice and easy I- I- fucking no way of getting up there. Shit! My god, can you just Why am I not able to hit this fucker?? Okay, just use this one. Fuck that noise.

I'm dead, I'm fucking... Just go, ju- fuck! How far is that? That better be... More than half way. I can deal with that, that's a thing I can deal with. much fucking easier Are you honk honking at the top? Yeah, you fucking better be! HONK HONK! HONK HONK! Yeah, that's what you get Ow!! Just go, just go. What? what? WHAT THE FUCK?! Think I'll take my chances with the Dragon... "Grimm Matchstick, Fiery Frolic" Okay... Here we go, here's the end of my life everybody. This is the beginning of the end for Jack. Oh god... Oh god, I have to be on fucking clouds all the time?! Well that's just horseshit! Oh god, oh god... Huah! *cries* I don't like this! Ahh, did he use his fucking tail? Yeah, duck it duck it duck it fuck it How can you avoid that shit goin- Oh My Oh My OH. "Don't m-m-misunderstand my flames. I just meant fun and games." Sure you did...sure you did Motherfucker Imma just do this. This is where the real bullshit begins It's like Ribbit and Croaks again. It's the- It's the fucking tail that gets me, I keep forgetin' that he has a motherfucking tail! Oh jesus fucking christ... do that! Oh, what now? What now? Why? What? What the? What the fuck? oh come on! COME ON! I got more than halfway on my second try! I think this is doable mi amigos Enough with the tail, okay? It's fine guys It's fucking fine Ow! FUCK YOU!! You little matchstick pricks It's okay. Can I stand on his tongue and kill them? That's the question I want to know. You ain't so tough *yells* Okay, can't do that, can't do that. That's not 
a thing I can do. Help, help! Help! Oh! Ah! Fuck! cunt I forgot that when you hold down and you jump it does a down jump. Should be obvious, but does my brain know how? NO It's fine. FUCK YOU!! Fuck me *yells* OOOOOooooohhhhhh- very sexy shit. That didn't even DO much to him... I don't like it, I don't like it That way the bullshit Hahaaaaagh, okay, okay? I did that section, I did that section. Wh- what is this? Okay, milk him? Milk bottles! I'm deaaaaad Oh that was the closest so far! "One two three! You'd b-b-better flee!" HahahahHa huh huh... *frustrated noises* Patience, patience is all I need. Okay, here we go Shit! Shit! Why- why'd I do that? Oh g- I fucking hate that phase! Oh, I could have even had a chance, if I didn't fucking use my super when I had nothing underneath me Ah, that was a silly mistake. Okay, I'm back in it These first few phases are like a piece of piss now Aaargh.. Changing tactics. I'm using invincibility this time instead of my superpower strong thing Ahhhh, hit boxes why? I wanna see if that actually makes the last section any easier. Okay, first phase is done. No problem. This phase should be able to do without getting hit. Hopefully. Maybe. Okay... FUCK YOU It's okay, we did it, we did it, we did it. And then you become invincible and you just kick some ass Oh, that does not last- that does not last long
 at all, does it? I cannot AAargh! Oh come on! Now I see why... I see why this shit is bullshit now... AAAAAH! OH! It's not even that hard I think I need a break from Se√±or D-ragon Ooohh... All I have to do is this.. which I guess I could do, this doesn't seem so bad anymore Ehm, I wanna get a different shot Maybe if I find a secret coin I think I'll get four so, I think the 'lob shot' is gonna be really handy for this. I saw some tips saying that the 'lob shot' actually works really well on the on the dragon guy. I need four? Yeah. *Sean mimics the pig* Goodbye! a-ha secret coin! Hello my friend. Okay I had to look up where another secret coin was 'cause I wanted to get four because what I'm gonna  is get the 'lob shot'. I have heard that the 'lob shot' does better 
against the dragon Because you could just stand on top of the clouds and fire down at him I don't know how true that is, I think I'm still gonna suck a fart But you know what? We might as well try it out. I have something stuck to my foot! There was something stuck to my foot, I didn't know what to do. I almost DIED! Okay, let's do this! Uh shot 'A' will be the 'lob shot'. Okay *sings along to music* Oh, I can't get to him from here. Okay, let's just take the long walk of shame all the way back to Dragon land All the way back to Se√±or Fucko Does my 'lob shot' do more damage? What's it saying? "Medium range and good damage with a slower rate of fire." Okay. Good damage! It's not saying 'average damage', it's saying 'good damage'. I'm really excited about this! Okay... nice! Wooo ooh ooh ooh oh, Oh, Bessie! Ho! Am I doing ok? I honestly have no parameter. Oh yeah, that's- that's doing a LOT more damage Now you can just stay here and do this. Aargh! Oh man.. This section fucking sucks! Why do some of them split and some of them don't? Makes no fucking sense! Ow! Oh shit... please tell me I hit him with that. Please tell me I hit him with that YES! OH, OH, OH MERCY ME! OH HALLELUJAH! 
I fell and died. Oh, it still counts! OH! *laughs and woops* Oh, Thank you online tips! You have saved my life. 
And my marriage. My marriage to this fucking game Was that all of the bosses defeated in this area? Can I actually go on to world 3 now`? Well, I think I can. Can I? What's up, King Dice? What you got for me? What you got for me, bitch? Yes. *starts singing* ‚ô™Do - boo boo hoo - ah‚ô™ ‚ô™I'm Mr.. King Dice I'm the game'st in the land‚ô™ ‚ô™I-...... ‚ô™I'm the devil's right-hand man‚ô™ Okay "Looks like I mighta underestimated ya Cupface." "You gave it to them debtors but good!" "Go on over to the next Island. Lotsa fun times waitin' for you there, ha ha ha!" ‚ô™Haven't worked, I sent you asleep‚ô™ 'Don't you mess with me!' "The little- The little mugs got some fight in them." "I'll say that much. They're makeing mincemeat outta them debtors!" "You see, I knew there was something special about those fellas." "Well, don't be too sure just yet boss. I think there's somethin fishy about those two!" "Don't blow your wig dice. If those two little fink's try anything... I'll be waiting!" Okay, you know what dudes? I'm coming for your ass. I think there's only one world left. I think this is 
the last world... "Honeycomb Herald" No! I have heard that that boss is also a big old bunch of bumbleshit. Anyway, I'm gonna leave this episode here. That feels good, I'm glad I'm actually making progress. So many people out there were like 'Jack's bad at video games. Jack can't play games well' Well look who's here. Still can't play them well, but I'm making progress I'm actually further than I ever thought I'd be. I might actually be able to get to the end of this game with enough patience, and dedication, and time! It can be done. Anyway! Thank you guys so much for watching this episode. If you liked it CUP that like button in the head, LIKE A BOSS!! and, high fives all 'round! *wa-poosh* *wa-poosh* but thank you guys and I will see all you dudes...! In the next video!!! *Outro is "I'm everywhere" by Technoaxe* (Captions by the Jacksepticeye community) Cheers! Oh, I deserve a drink. 
Top of the mornin' to ya laddies, my name is Jacksepticeye! And welcome back to Subnaseous~! Today, we have a large task ahead of us. We have to go off and find some aerogel to be able to build a prawn suit, and... where's my... floatie duder? God, you're all the way over here, dude! I forgot!! 'Cause you need to be all the way over here to build Maria. Prawn suit. What do we actually need? I forget everything about my life, Plasteel Ingots x2. Fuck. Aerogel x2. Okay, we need to go over and find that. We're going over here beside the Aurora exactly where you can like see the Aurora right now. We're going over there and find Aerogel. Be careful though, Reapers gonna come up and snatch your ass! Cause not only did they have grabby hands on the face but they'll eat that ass up Umm... We need some Enamel Glass, easy. Lead, I think I have that. Diamonds, I think I have that. Umm... I do have a bunch of shit in my Inventory that I need to dump into Maria. But also, somebody was saying I can just build a pipe to get from this, to this but When I try to do it, it does this. It doesn't let me. I don't know why. Maybe there's something there that I can't get through or whatever. I can build one here... and then maybe... go - no, cause it's not at the right angle. I don't know. I don't think I can merge them. I don't think I can stick them together. Um, how do I rotate you? Just like that, Can't even build that there! oh? Oh hold on, maybe I know why. Maybe it's not the moonpool that's the problem. Haha! Maybe it's the fucking bed that's the problem. GET OUTTA HERE BED! I still need you, but I might put you in Maria instead. I'll get in to sleep inside Maria. That'll be pretty dope. Ah, there we go! Okay, my bad. Wait... Ha ha! Boom, to the jews√≠ jam! Very very nice. God, I love the construction in this game. The way everything just works together. FLAWLESS! Um... Alright. Now we just put our bed back down here. I don't really have the room in Maria to do that. Well, I do, but I don't wanna clogger up, you know what I mean. Also, Oo, do i have any glass? Somebody said vending machine is like a great source of food. I thought these things were just cosmetic. Back when I played the game, years and years ago when I found these things, they were just cosmetic. They didn't actually have a use. Um... So that's why now I'm like, "Ah, they don't have a use. I'm not going, to use them." Uh, okay. Into Maria I go. Uh... Sploosh! Thanks! Maria, you have a very deep voice. So has anyone ever told you that? Actually, I've told you that. Countless times. Um... Copper, titanium, silver. I have one diamond... Did I have another? Ah, come on, come on. No?! *pffft* *tsk* It's annoying because it means I have to go all the way back, to the other island. The one that's all - way over dere? Dat one. Not that one. That ones fine. I need to go all the way over DERE to get the Diamonds. Oh, I thought my little thing was on fire cause the fire was under the aurora. Ha ha ha, silly me! Okay, well... At least I know where to find rubies anyway. That cave system I have kept marked because that's gonna help me... Find rubies. That's the cave I went into to get all them first time... a few episodes ago. Thank you Sally! You're the best, around! Nothing's ever gonna keep you down! All right, we're looking for aerogel. Aerogel is in air sacs that kinda look like this - kinda looks like this thing but they're more closed up. They, they don't have pores on them, they don't have holes... At least the last time I saw them in the game, they look like that. And I... do remember I had to come over here to find them and a good place to find them was going through this crack. Find the crack, Jack, and then you will find what you were looking for. Or was inside the crack there? There should lead you to good things. I don't know where they are, I can't remember. I just remembered that they're in this general area. It's probably gonna take us a long time to figure out, because we need aerogel to be able to build a prawn suit. And if I don't build a prawn suit, then what am I really doing with my life in this game? Huh?! Fuck all. What are these parts of? Are you parts of a cyclops? Cyclops engine fragment. There's another piece... here! Cyclops engine fragment. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, go go gadget open this thing! Water, very nice. And batteries. God I have enough water and batteries to create my own fucking farm. That's what you create farm out of. Um... Alright, these things, I don't think are on the sand... So I might have to explore some of those caves back there. I also know there's a reaper around here, at least it used to be because this is the first place I ever found reaper. And I do not want to reacquaintance, thanks. Okay... Pain in my bollocks. See, this - this is the part that I hate about this game, well, "hate." Using that very strongly... It's like you guys is it? Brain coral. No, you guys give me air. You guys are nice to me! What did I get? Brain coral sample? No, I don't want that. I'm sorry! Oops! My bad! Um, but this searching around for stuff that I can't remember. Cause I want to be able to find the things but sometimes you spend, literally like 40 minutes looking for them. And because the game is kind of RNG when it comes to finding shit, I might find them and I might not. God, metal salvage everywhere. Do I look like a guy that needs metal salvage right now? No, but I do need some quartz cause I need to start making some glass. Hup! Thanks! Appreciate it. What are you? You's a egg. I don't have an alien containment thing so I'm not getting any eggs. I don't want them, smelly! Uah! *pfft*! Day 42 of trying to find gel sacks. I have become the ocean. I am the sea and the sea is me. All together, forever. *gasp* Coffee machine! Glorious salvation! That'll take me out of this stupor that I am in! Did you get it? What the fuck? Go away! I am the ocean! Leave me be! I just want some sacks. Some sacks of gel, some sacks of air gel. To make the aerogel! *gasp* It all makes sense now! Seriously, where the fuck are they? Oh my god, finally! Area that actually has some. There we go! Oh, thank god! That took me ages to find! Okay, I'm gonna grab as many of these as I can while I'm actually here. So now, I'm in, I'm in the mushroom forest, by the way. Right next to the big tree of life. And they were all just growing along the side of it and I started to go crazy because I was like, "Wait, do they look different than when I last saw them? Are they not actually that apparent anymore?" and I was like scanning super vigilantly across the ground trying to figure out, "Wait, is that them? is that it?" gettin' out every two seconds, scanning everything. Turns out, no, I just hadn't found any. Is that all the ones that are here? Okay, it's a start. It might be enough to make two aerogel. And that's all I need to make my, Woah! Sorry there buddy! That's all I need to make my prawn suit so far, if I need aerogel for anything else, Uh, I don't know... I'll come back I guess. Oh my god, you're at 42. What the fuck? Okay, maybe I'm not that sorry. Maybe you should be apologizing to me. You did so much damage, to me. You big asshole! -_- So is that all there was? Okay, where am I heading back? Back this way, okay. Keep your peepers peopled (?) cause you might be able to see some more along the way. If you do, you know your boy's gonna hop out and get that shit. I literally do not, see anymore. A ha ha ha ha! All right, you go in there and rest up. I really should have put you inside -
Maria because I need to go in here anyway. To synthesize my shits, thanks! Good job, appreciate it! Right, Okay, glass, yes. Can't remember what I needed the glass for by now but yes, glass, aerogel. I need rubies?! I can't just fucking make the aerogel? Oh no, that means I've to go get more rubies as well... Okay, I have two rubies, that should - I should have enough to make two aerogels. Right? Okay, and it's only one gel sack to make aerogel. Which is good. Do I need enamel glass? What was I making glass for? I don't fuckin remember man... Um... Right, so, no. Okay, so uh... Nah, I want to keep you all together. So you guys go in there, for now. I'm gonna drink some water. Is that okay? Is that good with y'all? And put the flares away cuz there're just taking up space. Right, and a battery. I - Actually, let me take that off your hand-doos, And do that! Eh, put you in there. Whatever, I could charge it right now but, I don't care! All righty. There's the start of the prawn suit done! I told you guys last episode, most of this episode is just going to be farming. I have been recording for 43 minutes... And that's, that's the amount of progress I've gotten done. The amount of stuff that I have to cut out of these episodes, oh, enamel glass, that was what that stuff was for. The amount of stuff that I have to cut out of these episodes just to make them, actually productive, is obnoxious. I mean, I'm glad to do it, it's just that they end up being gigantic recordings. Lead, diamonds, enamel glass, plasteel ingots. Okay, I do have a lot of lithium to make the plasteel ingot, I just need to get a lot more titanium. But I don't know if i have enough lithium to make, was a 2 or 4, I needed to make a plasteel ingot? Guess we're gonna find out aren't we? Oh metal salvage? There's one... I'ma need a bunch though. Cuz you only to turn into four titanium and I need 20. Jesus christ. All these times I'm going around and I see fucking metal salvage everywhere, and now I can't find any. What I think I might do since, I'm heading over there anyway. I'm heading over to the island. I might just go in the cave, and find out whatever the hell is in... Wherever the hell that warp gate ends up leading me to. Actually, should I bring two of these? I'm afraid that I go through the warp gate, end up in the arse end of Babylon. And then, The portal will shut off behind me and I won't have any crystals to actually get back. So let's just do this. Cuz I want, I want something, to actually happen in this episode. It can't be all fucking farmin' for glory. Um, I know on the over side the island I'm gonna find... *Murloc noises* I'm gonna have to find diamond over there anyway and, should be able to find lead anywhere. Leads, -  leads pretty common. Off on another adventure, it's Jack and Sally! Going through the water, we are so pally! I love you Sal. We should have cop show! Where, where you're like, a talking robot seamoth and every time I solve a crime, you have some like, really shitty pun to tell me afterwards. Like, "We caught him with his hand in the cookie jar, Sal!" and then you say "I SEA what you did there." because it's a seamoth. I would watch that! (me too) I'd subscribe to whatever service that's on. Y'all ready for some fun? Y'all want, to see some cool shit? Y'all want to see what your boy can do right now? Oh yeah, you do! Oh yeah you do! you will have to make do I look at these little jokes in it oh god it's going all the way down okay calm your tattas why did you stop there mr. Frog feet okay hop on in oh fuck yeah oh god we built you in a terrible place oh god you don't have the boosts in you yeah There we go yes PRAWN suit baby It's been so long Now the PRAWN suit as you can see he goes to a depth of 900 meters which is way further than the other ones sali, 300 with an upgrade maria can only go to 500 without any upgrades Mr. PRAWN suit starts at 900 Ok, now this might be a little tricky yes oh like a glove! fuck yeah That's built nice i still have to go over to the cave-or uh, to the Warp gate over in the caves and the island but i had all the materials i needed so i decided to just do this now just, in case i lost them i'm gonna take a bunch of you because i am, running low on water i could just Drink the water i have oh? Well now i'm full on both accords what do you have in you? Did you have something in you you have a storage and a thing you know i think? everybody knows about the thing okay there have any new messages no right um Do i have any sort of? Closeness at all like even remotely close to be able to get an upgrade for the PRAWN suit if i could get a like spirit we could get like a grappling arm or something grappling hook our benzene titanium lithium advanced wiring kit i almost huh i have benzene don't i i had that oil the blood oil thing doesn't that make benzene in here yeah blood oil because that will come in immensely handy if i could have the grappling arm already i need three of them oh Go fuck a goat. Right okay we're going to the island that's upgrades are for another time now i'll pack it in pack It in no we're not allowed have any fun can't even remember where i got the blood oil i'll figure it out eventually but for now i i don't know i Hi Warpie! how's it going it's me your friendly neighborhood bio menace You know cause, i'm here to fuck up your ecosystem you can shite off right now i Was only talking to my boy warpie over there and you've decided to come fuck it all up right? going into the deep dark deep dark by which i mean the caves there is a warp gate somewhere around here actually it's up top God it's very dark. crazy, how darkness actually works huh can i have diamonds and shit more lithium No, it's cool it's cool i've wanted lithium for a christmas anyway there we go diamonds finally you listen you know what i actually asked for you know what i asked for something outright Not usually what i want i ain't about it subtly it's like wow i love lithium so much but diamonds are better And then you go out and buy me lithium anyway because it's the first thing i said you don't listen to anything past my first sentence Who am i talking, to you i don't know but that is fucking cool Really wish it wasn't stupid night time right now i hate the night time it's the worst time this is where we want to be in with the in with the alien stuff amid all that H.R. Giger crap now where we actually get to it i i'll never tell i think we have to do a bit of exploring are you with me i hope so i can't do this alone i Probably could but i don't want to there we go found it see it's cuz you were with me works wow my leg insert that bad boy power up that phase gate Let us travel to the unknown dimension as soon as i get out here i'd be like oh yeah that's where it led i forgot Please be at least somewhere cool think you might go to the other island don't you I think that's why these warp gates were set up just, so you could go back and forth easily Yeah, well i left sally at the other island and now i'm 2200 meters away from her so pretty sure i'm just on the other island yeah, cuz remember i said when i was on the island that those places that you could explore like you could actually go into the island that's that's where all this stuff leads to all this alien techie mumbo-jumbo and Then i remember what i was playing it originally i came in here that's a cool effect now actually and then i came out and i was like oh it is just this island in a way exploring a bit and then it was like shit i can't find my way back in yeah, 100% the other island i mean pretty cool if i ever want to come to this island again i don't know why i would oh i know exactly why i would because everything happens over here down underneath this island is where like is where i need to progress the game basically i Need to get all the upgrades for all of my my stuff and then take my P.R.A.W.N suit my cyclops and everything and go go deep down like super deep So deep that you'll start to think wait can we go any deeper and then you go deeper again and then you shit your pants cause everything is terrifying down there but it's okay cuz this amount of shit ward's off the danger beasts yeah, i want to go through again Split me apart and teleport me all over so if you're playing this game and you ever want to get some lithium gold or diamonds These caves on this island are your best bet to do that shit tonnes o' lithium like the most amount of lithium you can find in the game is on this island it's all in these shale outcrops but just an obscene amount of diamonds and gold as well it's fantastic and because i'm here because i'm heading back and have an empty inventory anyway i'm just going to collect everything i can while i'm here because it's going to come in handy eventually i mean oh mother of god i can only hold two more things okay Do I make it lithium, do i make it diamonds what do i make it? a bit of both good to know right i'll be back whenever i realize that all the stuff i got is useless and i actually needed something else c'est la vie huh i Mean look at all this shale outcrop, lithium, lithium, shale outcrop, shale outcrop, shale outcrop. lithium. lithium it's everywhere best island Aint no other islands like this and a purple artifact shiiiit that would be really handy what do I waste what do I use, what do I drop I don't know I'll just eat a nutrient block whatever. I can always get more food. The other stuff, not so much Well i can but it's just a pain in the ass to get them oh oh you're a sharp edge *dives and screams* We're back at it back in the ocean like the fish man i am i've been in the ocean so long my legs don't even work Because i'm feeling all this weightlessness it's like being in space And then you know i don't want to do that and then you come back from space you're like oh i forgot how to walk on gravity again over here i'm just in the water i don't need gravity anymore! Guys I don't like this And i like this i made it i made a foolish Decision to come down into the blood kelp zone i need it i need a blood oil okay?! I needed it! now i highly regret my life there's warpers, those electric-y doodads down here The music is freaky and i just want to like back into a corner and just feel safe see fucking warper okay, okay do i have oh sweet jesus Didn't realize those things took up so much room okay we're getting the effigy out of here This is bad mambo you know there's a reason the sun doesn't come down here? cuz it too thinks it's an abomination, oh wait I have a beacon that i can use I'll put the beacon whatever who cares Send the beacon off name the beacon this, is not the cave system anymore this is blood kelp okay good good good good good, uh oh okay one of them spawned away from me, above okay that's enough of that, that's enough butthole clenching right now, i have no underwear left anymore, my asshole ate it Now all I needs to do is find some rubies Okay can I have some rubies you know for my troubles? I've been through so much where did i get rubies that time? oh fuck... Oh fuck where...

What's this message from? this is life pod 7 coordinates attached pod is structurally sound but the fabricators bust requesting assistance 7 out signal coordinates corrupted aproximate transmission origin recorded to databank Ok, sunk, to 200 meters in an area of low ecological activity transmission origin approximately one kilometer south west of the aurora's stern section wait, he said that the place he said that it was okay that it was structurally intact ok, approximately 1 kilometers southwest of the aurora's stern it's the back end right i don't fucking actually know ship terminology oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait How do I fix you? you're showing damage Hello?! apparently won't let me fix you it says where the damage is but when I try and repair it it doesn't let me and i tried it from the outside as well and that wouldn't work just, heal everything! Do I need something special for the glass? laser cutter just burn it well you're showing the damage not there though but it's up top... Ohh! Is there damage on the outside up top?! Have i just been that dumb? Could i have gotten rid of my problem a long time ago? OHHHH! *Quiet frustrated yell* and i spent a whole episode like that and people are gonna be mad sorry y'all sometimes my brain don't do Okay life pod seven i need water let's head to the south parth parth? *questions self* of The aurora There's stuff down there that i want to try and see if i can get but mainly well i haven't been down that section yet and i know that there's a specific Area down there but i also know that there's a reaper down at the arse end of this they, say this kilometers southwest Yeah, i hear him he's over there somewhere oh I'll just fuckin crest a ridge now and he'll just be like *angry reaper noise* If you can just show me like a teensy-weensy bitsy witsy? Then I'll know where to go and where to avoid *Distant monster noise* you can fucking hear them from miles away Reaper?! No, god oh god oh god AND HE'S FUCKING HEARD ME AND IS CHASING ME!

Jesus, oh jesus okay he's there oh fuck me oh my god no there's two of them oh? no okay kilometers southwest just go just find the fucking life pod be happy Probably won't even find it life pod? the picture did look like you were somewhere down here stop stop You guys go away i need to check my shit just, swimming around now to try and get away from them they're more aggressive as well because they're infected okay yeah this looks like where i am gruber has sunk to 200 meters in an area of low ecologic activity okay So let's see how far down 200 is if they're scanning along the floor there it should be right around here Oh, I thought that was it. *chuckles* There it is! Anybody alive? Hello there's a minicar in there oh, no? you said that your... okay none functional are you chasing me please just shite off you said it was intact man you said everything was fine... okay let's see let's see what actually happened I've tried everything. The analysis circuits on the fabricator are fried. I can barely manufacture the most basic of materials. What a battery? Here have a children's toy! Need deep-sea diving equipment? Have some lab tech! Hungry? I'll turn that fruit into dust for you. I'm going forward with trial and error. I hit every button here, it's got to make something useful eventually. and that's sad His lifepod was ok and he still died... Am I really the only person left alive in this silly game? Why cruel fate? Why do you leave me alone? hey, reefiess! I hear ya, I see ya! and I hear these other bastards as well these are all areas that i can't really get to yet i can go a little bit down you guys could have some ruby that'll be great i I need that No? Nobody has anything I want! Can I have a chicken sandwich? No? 'Course not. Sally: "Warning, maxium depth reached, hull damage imminent." I know I'm already out of it! I'm already out of it Sally! Oh god, never mind, I was back in it. I didn't realize! I'm sorry you were tilted slightly down. Oooh, that's cool lil' thermal vents Can I scan them? Oh Jesus, oh Jesus it's too hot down here, it's too hot! I'm dying! 50 degre- 56 degrees celsius?! Mother of Jesus! That's pretty dang warm... That's half boiling temperature, ooh.. Look what i found, a gel sack cool what's that creature egg okay, i'm not collecting creature eggs yet they're just filling up my inventory inventory and have no place to put them i I'm gonna leave that till later Any more gel sacks around they're so rare okay that's fine that's fine be that way ah I'm burnin' up again I don't learn from my mistakes back and home sweet home ah safe and sound okay well i'm gonna leave this episode here not the most productive of episodes i kind of expected that going in anyway because i knew i wasn't gonna get everything i needed get a cylindrical sample flask okay whatever on a microscope that's not functional maybe i could make a cure But i i knew it was gonna be a lot of farming i still didn't even get all the things that i wanted to at least i have my prawn soup that's a good thing Haven't the prawn suit was a was one of the missions i had for this episode but i also wanted to get more upgrades for them But i couldn't do that because, a lot of the area's we have to go into now are deeper and darker and i just everything's all spread out now all the stuff i need is not in one area i can't just go to one area and get a Shit, ton of progress done and then come back and like in the episode like i was doing previously so i need to Start going out to all these different areas and then when i go to them it's not Guaranteed that what i need is going to be there so it's gonna be a while before i have all the upgrades i want? or need umm really want just more depth modules To find some magnetite though ruby is the thing i'm looking for next there was an area that i found a bunch of ruby the first ruby that i found And i need that to make some more aerogel along with the gel sacs and if i have more ruby and aerogel then i can make a water filtration system so next episode i'm gonna try and do that and Haven't taken my prawn suit out yet and gone anywhere because number one it flows all hell so is maria and secondly i don't really know her to bring them that would be of any use right now maybe the seat raiders path Because i think that's about at the depth of that i think they Actually think my seamoth might be able to go around in there i don't know We'll go look for it next day because i want To see the sea treaders again they were cool and they made like really heavy footstep sounds i like that ronnie way thank you guys, so much watching this episode if you like punch that like button in the face like a boss and high fives all around *wapoosh* and ill see all you dudes in the next video *Bossatronian kicks in* two hours of recording boil down into what 
TOP OF THE MORNING TO YA LADDIES!!! my name is jacksepticeye and welcome to a VR game called VR Chat Which is a chatroom in VR where I can talk to people. I'm muted right now I hope, maybe. Um this guy's making a lot of noise so I had to turn him down I've seen a lot about this game Everyone's playing it lately and everyone's having a really great time and everyone's recommending it so I thought I'd play it for myself for the first time so. Wait let's unmute this dude I guess I have to unmute myself eventually I'm a skeleton man by the way, I'll show you my avatar before I do anything Oh hello there's people over here. This is me. Hi! This is me. Okay I have to unmute myself *papayrus voice*Hello fellow humans *papyrus voice*Hello human, test subject 831 *papyrus voice*Very nice to meet you "What's up Papyrus" "What's up skeletor" *papyrus voice*Hmm not much.

"Oh god in VR that's... yeah... uh..." "Where did Jacksepticeye go because it sounded like him?" What is a Jacksepticeye? "Yeah, you sound like him" Hmm that is very strange. I don't think he has ever played VR Chat "Hang on a minute well you've given yourself away if you are him" Not all I hate that guy Yes very good. Is this one of those bottle flips I've heard so much about? "Oh yes it's all the rage with the kids" Give me a step by step breakdown of the dab (Oh god) "What, this?" Yes, that looks fresh as hell, let me have a go "Now you're fuckin just being patronising" Let me have a go at one of those dabs "On them haters- there we go! Ohowoah Is that it? "You get kicked on VR Chat for dabbing, you do know that don't ya?" How about you give me a high four, or a high three. Pick a hand. Any hand How did you do that? There is a tiny magician on my table. I am being bewildered by this tiny magic person right here "Wow, that's pretty cool actually" Either they're magic or I'm tripping balls right now "I've had a few beers so-" "I think we're all tripping balls" Hmm. Yes, I must be to play this game. There's tiny tiny people everywhere Maybe I should just try and find some skin first "Hey, can you grab something for us?" I sure can you beautiful tailed lady "Grab this pot right here and give it to Kana" This pot down here? Oh, which pot? "This one right here" Okay, I have got your pot "Give it to her" This is a different type of pot than I am used to "Hahaha oh I get it" "It won't let me grab it. Okay, just follow me okay, follow me." Okay, I'm taking a lot of orders from tiny people but okay "I need you to put it in the middle of the door sideways" I have no idea. Okay I'm- (phone rings) What the shit is that? What the fuck is happening Okay, so if you get into a world with a lot of people, the game starts freaking out. That might be on my end I dunno if that's a server issue, a game issue, an internet issue on my end I don't fucking know. Okay. I'm getting the fuck out of there cuz that was a mess Ah, peace and tranquility Oh wait they can't hear me I can talk in my normal voice. I'm like Batman What's happening over here, what did I walk in on? What did I stumble upon? What kind of ritual is this? (conga conga conga conga conga conga conga) Mother of God, hello tiny human "He's a skeleton" "Don't don't pretend to be Papyrus, there's other maps- avatars for that" "No really, do you want me to drop a portal for you" Yes, please drop a portal for me. Mind breaker show me the way Thank you tiny person. Would you like them? (Rejected) Re-gifting my gift I see" Yes. Christmas came early and I have a low budget. Okay but if you take me to a weird dungeon I will sue you "You're- if you come back...." Well too late now hahaha All I heard was 'if you come back', and then I was gone Where the- ohhh Look at this fancy fancy I've no idea how VR Chat works. He told me there was a Papyrus in here. There he is! Yes! Okay. How do I? Am I him now? Have I become? Yes! I am Papyrus! Oh look at me I'm Papyrus! Yes! "Sans? Oh wait no..." Hello human Okay, I'm still muted. I don't know where people are I just hear voices I love how people are like 'are you trying to be Papyrus?' Papyrus has no voice None of the characters have a voice Okay well I'm gonna leave this episode of VR Chat here Sorry, if that was messy, that was all over the place for me as well. I had no idea what I was doing, I had no idea where I was going, how to get different avatars, how to do different things at all but my god That's fun Cuz you kind of just get in and you don't know what's gonna happen then all of a sudden the world just Unfolds around you and people start talking weird stuff all around you and then you start making friends, you start making jokes But next time we're going on an adventure with Papyrus. We were trying to be Papyrus all this time But I dunno how the game works so I was going around as a random skeleton But next time I actually am Papyrus so we'll figure it out for then, but for now Thank you guys so much watching this episode. If you liked it punch that button in the face LIKE A BOSS And high fives all round *WHAPOOSH* *WHAPOOSH* Thank you guys and I'll see all you dudes IN THE NEXT VIDEO A lot of that has to be cut out because - who knew -  random chat rooms, very racist. 
Top of the mornin' to ya laddies, my name is Jacksepticeye! And welcome back to Subnaseous~! Today, we have a large task ahead of us. We have to go off and find some aerogel to be able to build a prawn suit, and... where's my... floatie duder? God, you're all the way over here, dude! I forgot!! 'Cause you need to be all the way over here to build Maria. Prawn suit. What do we actually need? I forget everything about my life, Plasteel Ingots x2. Fuck. Aerogel x2. Okay, we need to go over and find that. We're going over here beside the Aurora exactly where you can like see the Aurora right now. We're going over there and find Aerogel. Be careful though, Reapers gonna come up and snatch your ass! Cause not only did they have grabby hands on the face but they'll eat that ass up Umm... We need some Enamel Glass, easy. Lead, I think I have that. Diamonds, I think I have that. Umm... I do have a bunch of shit in my Inventory that I need to dump into Maria. But also, somebody was saying I can just build a pipe to get from this, to this but When I try to do it, it does this. It doesn't let me. I don't know why. Maybe there's something there that I can't get through or whatever. I can build one here... and then maybe... go - no, cause it's not at the right angle. I don't know. I don't think I can merge them. I don't think I can stick them together. Um, how do I rotate you? Just like that, Can't even build that there! oh? Oh hold on, maybe I know why. Maybe it's not the moonpool that's the problem. Haha! Maybe it's the fucking bed that's the problem. GET OUTTA HERE BED! I still need you, but I might put you in Maria instead. I'll get in to sleep inside Maria. That'll be pretty dope. Ah, there we go! Okay, my bad. Wait... Ha ha! Boom, to the jews√≠ jam! Very very nice. God, I love the construction in this game. The way everything just works together. FLAWLESS! Um... Alright. Now we just put our bed back down here. I don't really have the room in Maria to do that. Well, I do, but I don't wanna clogger up, you know what I mean. Also, Oo, do i have any glass? Somebody said vending machine is like a great source of food. I thought these things were just cosmetic. Back when I played the game, years and years ago when I found these things, they were just cosmetic. They didn't actually have a use. Um... So that's why now I'm like, "Ah, they don't have a use. I'm not going, to use them." Uh, okay. Into Maria I go. Uh... Sploosh! Thanks! Maria, you have a very deep voice. So has anyone ever told you that? Actually, I've told you that. Countless times. Um... Copper, titanium, silver. I have one diamond... Did I have another? Ah, come on, come on. No?! *pffft* *tsk* It's annoying because it means I have to go all the way back, to the other island. The one that's all - way over dere? Dat one. Not that one. That ones fine. I need to go all the way over DERE to get the Diamonds. Oh, I thought my little thing was on fire cause the fire was under the aurora. Ha ha ha, silly me! Okay, well... At least I know where to find rubies anyway. That cave system I have kept marked because that's gonna help me... Find rubies. That's the cave I went into to get all them first time... a few episodes ago. Thank you Sally! You're the best, around! Nothing's ever gonna keep you down! All right, we're looking for aerogel. Aerogel is in air sacs that kinda look like this - kinda looks like this thing but they're more closed up. They, they don't have pores on them, they don't have holes... At least the last time I saw them in the game, they look like that. And I... do remember I had to come over here to find them and a good place to find them was going through this crack. Find the crack, Jack, and then you will find what you were looking for. Or was inside the crack there? There should lead you to good things. I don't know where they are, I can't remember. I just remembered that they're in this general area. It's probably gonna take us a long time to figure out, because we need aerogel to be able to build a prawn suit. And if I don't build a prawn suit, then what am I really doing with my life in this game? Huh?! Fuck all. What are these parts of? Are you parts of a cyclops? Cyclops engine fragment. There's another piece... here! Cyclops engine fragment. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, go go gadget open this thing! Water, very nice. And batteries. God I have enough water and batteries to create my own fucking farm. That's what you create farm out of. Um... Alright, these things, I don't think are on the sand... So I might have to explore some of those caves back there. I also know there's a reaper around here, at least it used to be because this is the first place I ever found reaper. And I do not want to reacquaintance, thanks. Okay... Pain in my bollocks. See, this - this is the part that I hate about this game, well, "hate." Using that very strongly... It's like you guys is it? Brain coral. No, you guys give me air. You guys are nice to me! What did I get? Brain coral sample? No, I don't want that. I'm sorry! Oops! My bad! Um, but this searching around for stuff that I can't remember. Cause I want to be able to find the things but sometimes you spend, literally like 40 minutes looking for them. And because the game is kind of RNG when it comes to finding shit, I might find them and I might not. God, metal salvage everywhere. Do I look like a guy that needs metal salvage right now? No, but I do need some quartz cause I need to start making some glass. Hup! Thanks! Appreciate it. What are you? You's a egg. I don't have an alien containment thing so I'm not getting any eggs. I don't want them, smelly! Uah! *pfft*! Day 42 of trying to find gel sacks. I have become the ocean. I am the sea and the sea is me. All together, forever. *gasp* Coffee machine! Glorious salvation! That'll take me out of this stupor that I am in! Did you get it? What the fuck? Go away! I am the ocean! Leave me be! I just want some sacks. Some sacks of gel, some sacks of air gel. To make the aerogel! *gasp* It all makes sense now! Seriously, where the fuck are they? Oh my god, finally! Area that actually has some. There we go! Oh, thank god! That took me ages to find! Okay, I'm gonna grab as many of these as I can while I'm actually here. So now, I'm in, I'm in the mushroom forest, by the way. Right next to the big tree of life. And they were all just growing along the side of it and I started to go crazy because I was like, "Wait, do they look different than when I last saw them? Are they not actually that apparent anymore?" and I was like scanning super vigilantly across the ground trying to figure out, "Wait, is that them? is that it?" gettin' out every two seconds, scanning everything. Turns out, no, I just hadn't found any. Is that all the ones that are here? Okay, it's a start. It might be enough to make two aerogel. And that's all I need to make my, Woah! Sorry there buddy! That's all I need to make my prawn suit so far, if I need aerogel for anything else, Uh, I don't know... I'll come back I guess. Oh my god, you're at 42. What the fuck? Okay, maybe I'm not that sorry. Maybe you should be apologizing to me. You did so much damage, to me. You big asshole! -_- So is that all there was? Okay, where am I heading back? Back this way, okay. Keep your peepers peopled (?) cause you might be able to see some more along the way. If you do, you know your boy's gonna hop out and get that shit. I literally do not, see anymore. A ha ha ha ha! All right, you go in there and rest up. I really should have put you inside -
Maria because I need to go in here anyway. To synthesize my shits, thanks! Good job, appreciate it! Right, Okay, glass, yes. Can't remember what I needed the glass for by now but yes, glass, aerogel. I need rubies?! I can't just fucking make the aerogel? Oh no, that means I've to go get more rubies as well... Okay, I have two rubies, that should - I should have enough to make two aerogels. Right? Okay, and it's only one gel sack to make aerogel. Which is good. Do I need enamel glass? What was I making glass for? I don't fuckin remember man... Um... Right, so, no. Okay, so uh... Nah, I want to keep you all together. So you guys go in there, for now. I'm gonna drink some water. Is that okay? Is that good with y'all? And put the flares away cuz there're just taking up space. Right, and a battery. I - Actually, let me take that off your hand-doos, And do that! Eh, put you in there. Whatever, I could charge it right now but, I don't care! All righty. There's the start of the prawn suit done! I told you guys last episode, most of this episode is just going to be farming. I have been recording for 43 minutes... And that's, that's the amount of progress I've gotten done. The amount of stuff that I have to cut out of these episodes, oh, enamel glass, that was what that stuff was for. The amount of stuff that I have to cut out of these episodes just to make them, actually productive, is obnoxious. I mean, I'm glad to do it, it's just that they end up being gigantic recordings. Lead, diamonds, enamel glass, plasteel ingots. Okay, I do have a lot of lithium to make the plasteel ingot, I just need to get a lot more titanium. But I don't know if i have enough lithium to make, was a 2 or 4, I needed to make a plasteel ingot? Guess we're gonna find out aren't we? Oh metal salvage? There's one... I'ma need a bunch though. Cuz you only to turn into four titanium and I need 20. Jesus christ. All these times I'm going around and I see fucking metal salvage everywhere, and now I can't find any. What I think I might do since, I'm heading over there anyway. I'm heading over to the island. I might just go in the cave, and find out whatever the hell is in... Wherever the hell that warp gate ends up leading me to. Actually, should I bring two of these? I'm afraid that I go through the warp gate, end up in the arse end of Babylon. And then, The portal will shut off behind me and I won't have any crystals to actually get back. So let's just do this. Cuz I want, I want something, to actually happen in this episode. It can't be all fucking farmin' for glory. Um, I know on the over side the island I'm gonna find... *Murloc noises* I'm gonna have to find diamond over there anyway and, should be able to find lead anywhere. Leads, -  leads pretty common. Off on another adventure, it's Jack and Sally! Going through the water, we are so pally! I love you Sal. We should have cop show! Where, where you're like, a talking robot seamoth and every time I solve a crime, you have some like, really shitty pun to tell me afterwards. Like, "We caught him with his hand in the cookie jar, Sal!" and then you say "I SEA what you did there." because it's a seamoth. I would watch that! (me too) I'd subscribe to whatever service that's on. Y'all ready for some fun? Y'all want, to see some cool shit? Y'all want to see what your boy can do right now? Oh yeah, you do! Oh yeah you do! you will have to make do I look at these little jokes in it oh god it's going all the way down okay calm your tattas why did you stop there mr. Frog feet okay hop on in oh fuck yeah oh god we built you in a terrible place oh god you don't have the boosts in you yeah There we go yes PRAWN suit baby It's been so long Now the PRAWN suit as you can see he goes to a depth of 900 meters which is way further than the other ones sali, 300 with an upgrade maria can only go to 500 without any upgrades Mr. PRAWN suit starts at 900 Ok, now this might be a little tricky yes oh like a glove! fuck yeah That's built nice i still have to go over to the cave-or uh, to the Warp gate over in the caves and the island but i had all the materials i needed so i decided to just do this now just, in case i lost them i'm gonna take a bunch of you because i am, running low on water i could just Drink the water i have oh? Well now i'm full on both accords what do you have in you? Did you have something in you you have a storage and a thing you know i think? everybody knows about the thing okay there have any new messages no right um Do i have any sort of? Closeness at all like even remotely close to be able to get an upgrade for the PRAWN suit if i could get a like spirit we could get like a grappling arm or something grappling hook our benzene titanium lithium advanced wiring kit i almost huh i have benzene don't i i had that oil the blood oil thing doesn't that make benzene in here yeah blood oil because that will come in immensely handy if i could have the grappling arm already i need three of them oh Go fuck a goat. Right okay we're going to the island that's upgrades are for another time now i'll pack it in pack It in no we're not allowed have any fun can't even remember where i got the blood oil i'll figure it out eventually but for now i i don't know i Hi Warpie! how's it going it's me your friendly neighborhood bio menace You know cause, i'm here to fuck up your ecosystem you can shite off right now i Was only talking to my boy warpie over there and you've decided to come fuck it all up right? going into the deep dark deep dark by which i mean the caves there is a warp gate somewhere around here actually it's up top God it's very dark. crazy, how darkness actually works huh can i have diamonds and shit more lithium No, it's cool it's cool i've wanted lithium for a christmas anyway there we go diamonds finally you listen you know what i actually asked for you know what i asked for something outright Not usually what i want i ain't about it subtly it's like wow i love lithium so much but diamonds are better And then you go out and buy me lithium anyway because it's the first thing i said you don't listen to anything past my first sentence Who am i talking, to you i don't know but that is fucking cool Really wish it wasn't stupid night time right now i hate the night time it's the worst time this is where we want to be in with the in with the alien stuff amid all that H.R. Giger crap now where we actually get to it i i'll never tell i think we have to do a bit of exploring are you with me i hope so i can't do this alone i Probably could but i don't want to there we go found it see it's cuz you were with me works wow my leg insert that bad boy power up that phase gate Let us travel to the unknown dimension as soon as i get out here i'd be like oh yeah that's where it led i forgot Please be at least somewhere cool think you might go to the other island don't you I think that's why these warp gates were set up just, so you could go back and forth easily Yeah, well i left sally at the other island and now i'm 2200 meters away from her so pretty sure i'm just on the other island yeah, cuz remember i said when i was on the island that those places that you could explore like you could actually go into the island that's that's where all this stuff leads to all this alien techie mumbo-jumbo and Then i remember what i was playing it originally i came in here that's a cool effect now actually and then i came out and i was like oh it is just this island in a way exploring a bit and then it was like shit i can't find my way back in yeah, 100% the other island i mean pretty cool if i ever want to come to this island again i don't know why i would oh i know exactly why i would because everything happens over here down underneath this island is where like is where i need to progress the game basically i Need to get all the upgrades for all of my my stuff and then take my P.R.A.W.N suit my cyclops and everything and go go deep down like super deep So deep that you'll start to think wait can we go any deeper and then you go deeper again and then you shit your pants cause everything is terrifying down there but it's okay cuz this amount of shit ward's off the danger beasts yeah, i want to go through again Split me apart and teleport me all over so if you're playing this game and you ever want to get some lithium gold or diamonds These caves on this island are your best bet to do that shit tonnes o' lithium like the most amount of lithium you can find in the game is on this island it's all in these shale outcrops but just an obscene amount of diamonds and gold as well it's fantastic and because i'm here because i'm heading back and have an empty inventory anyway i'm just going to collect everything i can while i'm here because it's going to come in handy eventually i mean oh mother of god i can only hold two more things okay Do I make it lithium, do i make it diamonds what do i make it? a bit of both good to know right i'll be back whenever i realize that all the stuff i got is useless and i actually needed something else c'est la vie huh i Mean look at all this shale outcrop, lithium, lithium, shale outcrop, shale outcrop, shale outcrop. lithium. lithium it's everywhere best island Aint no other islands like this and a purple artifact shiiiit that would be really handy what do I waste what do I use, what do I drop I don't know I'll just eat a nutrient block whatever. I can always get more food. The other stuff, not so much Well i can but it's just a pain in the ass to get them oh oh you're a sharp edge *dives and screams* We're back at it back in the ocean like the fish man i am i've been in the ocean so long my legs don't even work Because i'm feeling all this weightlessness it's like being in space And then you know i don't want to do that and then you come back from space you're like oh i forgot how to walk on gravity again over here i'm just in the water i don't need gravity anymore! Guys I don't like this And i like this i made it i made a foolish Decision to come down into the blood kelp zone i need it i need a blood oil okay?! I needed it! now i highly regret my life there's warpers, those electric-y doodads down here The music is freaky and i just want to like back into a corner and just feel safe see fucking warper okay, okay do i have oh sweet jesus Didn't realize those things took up so much room okay we're getting the effigy out of here This is bad mambo you know there's a reason the sun doesn't come down here? cuz it too thinks it's an abomination, oh wait I have a beacon that i can use I'll put the beacon whatever who cares Send the beacon off name the beacon this, is not the cave system anymore this is blood kelp okay good good good good good, uh oh okay one of them spawned away from me, above okay that's enough of that, that's enough butthole clenching right now, i have no underwear left anymore, my asshole ate it Now all I needs to do is find some rubies Okay can I have some rubies you know for my troubles? I've been through so much where did i get rubies that time? oh fuck... Oh fuck where... Okay he's down there Okay... jesus don't know if you guys know knew this but those guys the worst pretty damn bad it was a place like this that i got rubies that they've- Oh fuck he's right behind me oh, oh don't teleport, me cuz they can teleport you out of your seamoth okay yeah yeah yeah yeah you better warp thinking he can mess with me I've got all the confidence in the world now that you've gone and don't you forget it Alright i'll come find rubies again whatever right now i just need to get back and change my underwear oh i had a message Are there lifepods left? What's this message from? this is life pod 7 coordinates attached pod is structurally sound but the fabricators bust requesting assistance 7 out signal coordinates corrupted aproximate transmission origin recorded to databank Ok, sunk, to 200 meters in an area of low ecological activity transmission origin approximately one kilometer south west of the aurora's stern section wait, he said that the place he said that it was okay that it was structurally intact ok, approximately 1 kilometers southwest of the aurora's stern it's the back end right i don't fucking actually know ship terminology oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait How do I fix you? you're showing damage Hello?! apparently won't let me fix you it says where the damage is but when I try and repair it it doesn't let me and i tried it from the outside as well and that wouldn't work just, heal everything! Do I need something special for the glass? laser cutter just burn it well you're showing the damage not there though but it's up top... Ohh! Is there damage on the outside up top?! Have i just been that dumb? Could i have gotten rid of my problem a long time ago? OHHHH! *Quiet frustrated yell* and i spent a whole episode like that and people are gonna be mad sorry y'all sometimes my brain don't do Okay life pod seven i need water let's head to the south parth parth? *questions self* of The aurora There's stuff down there that i want to try and see if i can get but mainly well i haven't been down that section yet and i know that there's a specific Area down there but i also know that there's a reaper down at the arse end of this they, say this kilometers southwest Yeah, i hear him he's over there somewhere oh I'll just fuckin crest a ridge now and he'll just be like *angry reaper noise* If you can just show me like a teensy-weensy bitsy witsy? Then I'll know where to go and where to avoid *Distant monster noise* you can fucking hear them from miles away Reaper?! No, god oh god oh god AND HE'S FUCKING HEARD ME AND IS CHASING ME! JESUS CHRIST! WHY?! WHOA Fuck he's still here oh, no oh that's terrifying i don't like this and I'm only at like 79 health ARGH DA- FUCK GO AWAW! holy jesus oh (RIP) god he's still here oh god what are you doing? Eat something else,  Did he go through the fucking ground?! He's in the ground right now okay i need to heal sally oh my god that was terrifying please no :o Please please no, no okay *Noise of relief* My heart's not ready for that shit... What the fuck are you hitting? Your ass is not that big sally Alright where are we in relation to their arora no they're not even in that direction okay kilometers southwest just, wanna check around this place.. Don't you dare! Don't you dare come after me again i hated every second of that And i couldn't even see him cuz the water is so cloudy down here! Stupid sand! Oh... Jesus, oh jesus okay he's there oh fuck me oh my god no there's two of them oh? no okay kilometers southwest just go just find the fucking life pod be happy Probably won't even find it life pod? the picture did look like you were somewhere down here stop stop You guys go away i need to check my shit just, swimming around now to try and get away from them they're more aggressive as well because they're infected okay yeah this looks like where i am gruber has sunk to 200 meters in an area of low ecologic activity okay So let's see how far down 200 is if they're scanning along the floor there it should be right around here Oh, I thought that was it. *chuckles* There it is! Anybody alive? Hello there's a minicar in there oh, no? you said that your... okay none functional are you chasing me please just shite off you said it was intact man you said everything was fine... okay let's see let's see what actually happened I've tried everything. The analysis circuits on the fabricator are fried. I can barely manufacture the most basic of materials. What a battery? Here have a children's toy! Need deep-sea diving equipment? Have some lab tech! Hungry? I'll turn that fruit into dust for you. I'm going forward with trial and error. I hit every button here, it's got to make something useful eventually. and that's sad His lifepod was ok and he still died... Am I really the only person left alive in this silly game? Why cruel fate? Why do you leave me alone? hey, reefiess! I hear ya, I see ya! and I hear these other bastards as well these are all areas that i can't really get to yet i can go a little bit down you guys could have some ruby that'll be great i I need that No? Nobody has anything I want! Can I have a chicken sandwich? No? 'Course not. Sally: "Warning, maxium depth reached, hull damage imminent." I know I'm already out of it! I'm already out of it Sally! Oh god, never mind, I was back in it. I didn't realize! I'm sorry you were tilted slightly down. Oooh, that's cool lil' thermal vents Can I scan them? Oh Jesus, oh Jesus it's too hot down here, it's too hot! I'm dying! 50 degre- 56 degrees celsius?! Mother of Jesus! That's pretty dang warm... That's half boiling temperature, ooh.. Look what i found, a gel sack cool what's that creature egg okay, i'm not collecting creature eggs yet they're just filling up my inventory inventory and have no place to put them i I'm gonna leave that till later Any more gel sacks around they're so rare okay that's fine that's fine be that way ah I'm burnin' up again I don't learn from my mistakes back and home sweet home ah safe and sound okay well i'm gonna leave this episode here not the most productive of episodes i kind of expected that going in anyway because i knew i wasn't gonna get everything i needed get a cylindrical sample flask okay whatever on a microscope that's not functional maybe i could make a cure But i i knew it was gonna be a lot of farming i still didn't even get all the things that i wanted to at least i have my prawn soup that's a good thing Haven't the prawn suit was a was one of the missions i had for this episode but i also wanted to get more upgrades for them But i couldn't do that because, a lot of the area's we have to go into now are deeper and darker and i just everything's all spread out now all the stuff i need is not in one area i can't just go to one area and get a Shit, ton of progress done and then come back and like in the episode like i was doing previously so i need to Start going out to all these different areas and then when i go to them it's not Guaranteed that what i need is going to be there so it's gonna be a while before i have all the upgrades i want? or need umm really want just more depth modules To find some magnetite though ruby is the thing i'm looking for next there was an area that i found a bunch of ruby the first ruby that i found And i need that to make some more aerogel along with the gel sacs and if i have more ruby and aerogel then i can make a water filtration system so next episode i'm gonna try and do that and Haven't taken my prawn suit out yet and gone anywhere because number one it flows all hell so is maria and secondly i don't really know her to bring them that would be of any use right now maybe the seat raiders path Because i think that's about at the depth of that i think they Actually think my seamoth might be able to go around in there i don't know We'll go look for it next day because i want To see the sea treaders again they were cool and they made like really heavy footstep sounds i like that ronnie way thank you guys, so much watching this episode if you like punch that like button in the face like a boss and high fives all around *wapoosh* and ill see all you dudes in the next video *Bossatronian kicks in* two hours of recording boil down into what 
PREVIOUSLY IN SUBNAUTICA *maniacal laughter* Oooh yes, keep shouting all you want, nobody's listening down here. ooohohohohoho What! H-h-how do-how do I do an angry high-five? *WHA-PSH* TOP OF THE MORNING TO YA, LADDIES, my name is JackSepticEye and welcome back to Subnautious! REVENGE Subnautica! I'm going back out to get Sally. We were attacked - nay, HUMILIATED, last time. I'm not letting that happen again. I need to food up before I go anywhere. I was just here stop welcoming me abbleleleleleleelele Can't even fucking think straight. Can I-can I have some seeds out of you? I need-I need some seeds. There we go. There we go. Perfect-o! LOOK at all those marbled melons, and I'll need these because I need to eat them. Ooooh, yeah. Okay, that Reaper is not getting away with that shit again. No, uh-uh no no no no no no no no no Batman. :) We are going after them. I'm not being-I'm not being showed up by a stupid Reaper. Not today, not now, not ever. I have the power to fight back. Sally's all the way over there, alone. Fighting to survive in Reaper territory. Balls deep inside Reaper zone. That was the last Reaper in that area as well. (lol nope) They just came out of nowhere. Attacked me. I came out to kill Reapers and honestly, I felt so attacked by them. *kssh* *radio voice* Come in, Sally. Sally, do you read me? Is everything okay over there? What's your status? What's your-what's your six? Sally?! *normal Jackaboy voice* Hmm, Sally's not picking up. That doesn't sound too good. That means Sally is in danger, that means I need to get there faster. I hear the Reaper. You know, normally? Normally, I'm not a praying man. But Spider-man, if you're out there, watch over me. Give me the strength to defeat my enemies, like you did Doc Ock that one time. Where's this sumbitch?! Where are you Reaper? Oh, I see ya. NOO! LET GO OF SALLY! Don't you fucking dare! Don't you fucking dare. Piss off. Piss off, go away. Go away. Wait, can I get you? Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Chop him. Yeah OOOH WHAT'S GOING ON NOW, BUTTERCUP? Why don't you pick on someone your own size? By which I mean my dick! (huehuehue) Got balls of steel and they're ready to fuck. Y'ain't going nowhere. You ain't going nowhere, you overgrown hot dog! This land is mine. This sea is mine. These sea mines are mine. This C- that I got in English class is mine. Stabbing, stabbing, stabbing a fish to death. Mess him up! The force of ten men fighting ya right now. *in sync with slashes* How many slashes can you take? Doie (die) please! Your friends went down a lot quicker. FIIINALLY Oh, and the bubble just ran out. Just like your time on this planet. Down you go, buttchin. Down into the depths of the darkness where all of your brothers and sisters returned to the sand. AAH OXYGEN! SALLY! HELP! Sally, how much health do you have? 13%. He almost got you, Sal, but Jack is here to look after ya. *Various Subnautica sounds* Am I hearing more Reapers? *wild reaper noise* Excuse me. Are there more? God damnit you just-you guys just don't know when to go extinct, do ya? Hey look I can survive down here now because of my suit. *happy Jack* I don't burn into a tiny little piece of beef jerky anymore. That's neat. Still don't know where the Cuddlefish egg is, though. Was supposed to be another one down here. Ho ho, that's kind of scary, actually, but also: MEGA AWESOME cuz I did that. That's my power. Our work is not yet done. *Sally accelerates* I hear more. I- *snif snif* I can smell the tainted putrid mess that is a REAPER around here somewhere. Where are you? Where are you? I can-I can hear you. I can-nooot you. I am the lone gunman. I see you. Oh, I see ya. I'm ready for ya. C'mon. Come on over and play in this side of the ocean. This is where the big boys are. This is where big old JSE likes to play! 'Kay, hit him in the face, and then do that. Nice, nice, nice. Then you come up here-come here. You STUN him. You STUN him-and then you stick him. OH, oh. Billions of years of evolution! Looks like /I/ came out on top! Keep roaring. Keep roaring. It gives me the enthusiasm I need to kill you faster. Yeah, that's it. That's it. Look me in the eyes. Look me in the eyes as you drift lower. As you drift into that inky black abyss. Look me in the eyes. I hope your life flashed before your eyes before you died, but the only live parts that flashed before your eyes were me killing you over and over again. Take that with you to your deep dark down grave. (Deep Down Dark Deep Down, Jack! :) ) Also, /nice teeth/. Where do-where do you go to get your teeth done? I'm in bad need of a dentist myself on this planet. I've been here for a while and all I've been doing is eating, and not brushing my teeth. (Didn't you pack a toothbrush and toothpaste?) Hmm. Okay, see you later, Crimson Chin. All right. Now I think I've thoroughly killed all the Reapers in this region. That was like 5 in this one area. (lol, yeah right.) Made me greater than I thought I was. (Is there a level higher than BOSSATRON, KING OF BOSSATRONIA?) Now I can just go around and explore all I want (nope) easily, without having to worry about /anything/ coming up and biting me in the ass. Except karma. Karma's a bitch. They're always gonna come up and bite you in the ass eventually. Hello! How are you? I hit ya so hard that you shit your ass out. *Giggly Jack* Wait a minute. (*realization*) Are you fucking ser- Wow Sea Emperor! Yeah! You're not the one that I found before! I hear another fucking Reaper as well, by the way. Reapers, you're old news! No one cares anymore, you're boring! Fuck yeah, Sea Emperor! These guys are so badass looking. I would-I do wonder if I could kill one of them? I don't want to, I'm not going to, I'm not even gonna try. But you're so pretty. Wait, I wonder if I can scan you or will it give me the same results as-yeah look at ya. Look at you floating around down there. God damnit SIX Reapers in this one location? Are you out of your mind? I do wonder if I can go kill /other/ things now though, like sea dragons, crab squids, That kind of stuff. Ooowww... Aww yeah, you're a cool-you're a big baby. Hi! Okay, no scan thing is actually showing up. God, you're fast. Hey, hey! Leave Sally alone! Jesus. We weren't doing anything to you. Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on, hold on, okay, okay, okay. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm gone. Bye. Jeesus. Talk about temperamental. That's cool, though, how they're actually still just going around in the world. I love that. Such a neat detail. So are they all out here, then? Cuz that's-wait, where's the island in regards to here? The other one I found was behind the island and I don't think-God. That's fucking-that's a pretty Water shader that they've got going on for that. Kay. There's another one! There's another Sea Emperor over there. Where's the island? Island's all the way over there, so all the babies are actually just over here now? That's badass! You're a bit twitchy though. Wait are you the same one? You're the same one. *giggly Jack* (again) Stupid me. Um, Cuz the other one was up behind the island so it was over in this direction. Hey reefies. Look at ya, my big babies. (Now it's 100% a Subnautica video!) Aww you're so cute. (So is the person watching this!) So that's, potentially, two Sea Emperors then, that I found, right? I think so. /I'm/ curious if I can kill a Ghost Leviathan. (OH THAT WOULD BE SO COOL!) They're a bit scarier, though, to take on. I don't know why, I just find them scarier personally. Let's-let's-let's go on down. Let's see what's happening in downtown Ghostville. Alright. *narrator voice* Deep Into the inky blackness he went. It actually wasn't that dark and black down here, it was actually kind of green. The Lost River does that, it's a freaky weird place. But in he went. Not fearing anything, except the amount of poopoo that would fill his pants in the next few minutes. But that was a risk he was willing to take. For the sake of looking like a badass. *End narrator voice* *another weirdish voice* Oh, Ghost Boy, would you like to come out and have a fun time? *end weirdish voice* Hey, hey, Ghost Boy. Ghost Boy. Have you seen this knife? *Ghost Leviathan noises* Okay, okay, I don't know what you're attacking, but rather scary. Rather scary. Okay, we need to-Oh I have very little power in this-We need to give the concussive burst first. Okay, get ready for it. Get ready for-COME HERE. Stop attacking everybody else and come to ME. *dramatic music and sounds of the fight* Kay. Will that get you? Okay, that got you. Oh, you're way wigglier than the other fucker. Okay, the battle's on. The fight has begun. UH-OH! Yes! 'Kay, I got you. I got you-I need to get your head, though. FUCK, OW, GOD! Need to get you in bigger bubbles. Okay. Okay. Okay. You are fucking terrifying. Stop wiggleworming around! I'MA GETCHA. Ding-ding, said the ref! The round is a go! How do ya keep fucking dodging me? Here we go! To battle! The tenth battle for the ages! Let's be good! Uh-oh. Uh-oh. He's escaped. He's escaped. He's back in it! Yeah, he either sounds pissed or he sounds like he's digesting something. *gasp* oops. YEAH, baby! That's how we roll! Please die, there's a lot of people watching. YES! OH! OH! Bow down bitches! I am The King of this game! (nice voice crack!) Fear me! I am the Reaper now! Oh, you big jelly squishy nude lanky tall swimmy fin motherfucker! Looks like someone is eating the inside of a box of asses right now. It's YOU! YOU are the dead one. I am the winner! That is fantastic. I really wish your glow would disappear though. It would make me feel cool and special and talented. Oh, big vagina face. That's how we do. That's how we do. Ain't /nobody/ gonna test my-my skills anymore! Is there even anything to fear in this game anymore? Huh? Is there anybody here who can contest Jack? I don't think so. I'ma head down to my face. I'ma have a celebratory... Whiskey! Down in Maria. Oh, yeah, I'm all shaky. The nerves were kicking in. How-how are you gonna come at me? How do you want to come at me right now after seeing that big old noodle get killed? He's dead. D E D. What's dead is dead. You can't kill it no more cuz it's dead. Oh, that makes me feel like a big man. There is one obstacle left. There is one more fearsome predator that I have yet to take on. And that would be the sea dragons. Can they be defeated? Can they be killed? These are questions not many people know the answer to, but I am determined to find out what's going on. Can I shock you guys? I don't know. Why's my thing getting that, like, shit in its face? I can't go down there, though, in Sally. Sally-Sally doesn't have the pressure depth to be able to go down that far to challenge the dragons. We're gonna have to go back and get Pepper for that. I wish you could get some sort of, like, big guns for Pepper, or big, like, punching gloves. Just go up and, like, ba-boom, and then you can turn it into Pacific Rim. That'd be really cool. (Not for the first time, we're in agreement.) Want some mods or something to be able to do that. Ok Sally, stay there. I'm going down. I will be back, though. You've done so good. *mwah* You've done so good my precious bean. I also have my new suit down here as well, but I could do with a peeper. A peeper Pepper to keep me safe. Hmm. Cause I could go-I could go contest the big dogs right now. I have the fortitude, I have the mental strength, and the muscles to do it. But. I am lacking a thing called oxygen. Oh, you running out of power because you were using a normal battery. Ooohh...that makes sense.. Charge up those bad boys. Jack's gonna-Jack's gonna chow down on some fucking Chinese potatoes. Wish my scanner can locate giant testicles. Made of steel-oh wait, they're right here on my character, cuz I'm a badass now. Oh pepper my darling baby. Let's get this, ah, let's get this propulsion cannon off you for a second and let's get a freaking prawn suit torpedo arm on you, huh? I don't mean to drop them. I actually-no, no, no, that's not what I want. I want to pick up the vortex torpedoes. Where do I put these in? AaaaAAAAAAAAaaahhh... *singing randomly* Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Nihihihice... Now we got our freaking- Now we got our freakin boostyboost going on. We got a grappling hook and Whoosh? That's pretty good. Oh no! Oh poor baby boy! Sorry! Are you gonna get sucked into it. Oh Jesus. Yes you are. Oh, no. Oh, no. You see them turning around and going Okay Peps, let's go mess. Shit. Up.  *randomly singing again* doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... Ah What's up bitches?  Wonder if I'm still able to check out my handiwork. Uhm, did someone, uh, see a big giant floating piece of spaghetti anywhere? Anywhere at all? But I don't see one floating around in the air anymore, which is good. It seems like the other one just vanished. Even in death, it was a coward. Didn't want to hang around. Didn't want to show its face to all its friends to show that it died. Guess I'm just too cool. Too cool for school man. Pepper? It's time to show these lava dwelling...bastards...a thing or two, okay? No more fear. No more being scared. No more cowering in the depths. Actually we were cowering in the shallows. They were in the depths. But when I got down here, I was cowering in the depths, because I was scared of them. So no more of that. That-that's what I mean, yeah. When-when-when talking trash, you really got to make sure that your-your language is correct, okay, because if your language is incorrect then no one's gonna understand you, and then it's not really talking /trash/, it's just you not being able to talk. *snif sniff* Mmm, smells like victory down here today, boyys. It's gonna be a good one. It's gonna be a good one. I'm geared up. Geared up for the finals. Okay, there's that castle. The castle is the starting block to your inevitable defeat. Now all I have to do is find you. I'm bringing the hurt to you this time. Would anybody like to come out and challenge? Let-let me hear that roar. Where are ya? Where ya-where you skulking? Where ya hiding? Alright, okay, I hear ya. Okay. Ah, there you are, you overgrown goldfish. Okay. By the end of this you're gonna be a goldfish /cracker/. See you. Just chase him around. Chase him around. All I have to do is catch him once. *Sea Dragon noise* You ain't that tough. Yeah. Just trying to be a freaking... A budget t-rex from Jurassic Park. I ain't afraid of you. Hey. Hey! Come back here. Get him. Get him. Hit him. Ah Oh Unafraid, I see. Foolish mistake. Kay, I need to keep Pepper... Close by, though. Okay, there we go. Got him. *charging up* Uh-oh. Ah... It's not your head. It's your body. Okay. The fight is on! This is the beginning of your end, Mister...Whoosh! Nice! (muttered) Fuck him up. Fuck him up. Hit him in the hands. Hit him in those big weed whackers! Feels good. Powerful-powerful stuff. Man, you're just kind of...sitting here and taking it aren't you? I mean the others kind of put up some sort of a fight. Is this good? Not really doing a whole lot. I'm not really getting any feedback. I don't know if you're actually dying. You could be dead right now for all I know. (*continues whacking anyway*) I've had cartons of milk in my fridge that had more of a reaction than you do. You just hold tight there for a little bit. I'll be back. Okay, okay, okay, he pissed. Okay, he pissed. Maybe if I stab your head? Oh god, I'm *very* close. Oh God, Jesus. Okay, so I can only attack the shoulders, apparently. Are you dying? God damn it, this is difficult, I don't like it. I /think/ we can chalk this one up to a big old nope. I have stabbed you...at least a thousand times by now... And you are not dying. You suck, and I hate you, but...oh God, oh, hi. Oh, that was not a good idea. Okay, bye! Wait can you stay here for another minute? I have an idea. I have an idea that I want to try out. And it's an experimental idea, and not many people have been doing this. It's a scary-it's a scary-it's a scary notion. But it's something that I am willing to try. Can we get to your upgrades here for a second? Take off this, put on this. *inspiring music* Here we go. This is gonna work. Yes. Yes! If I just stay stuck to your belly and keep drilling? This is gonna work. I believe in this. Oh, swim away, swim away, all day, every day, but I'm still gonna keep on drilling. This is what I do. Kay, but if you could come back? There we go, there we go! Sometimes they slip away, but every time they come crawling back. They call me the boomerang. Oh-oh! There's the second one! UM! Okay, keep driving. Yes, Uber, keep-keep going. My lava zone Uber. Thank you. Thank you. Can I... attach a bit better anywhere? Yeooo, don't get in front of him! (slightly whispered) Fuck. Fuck. Okay, I need to be in an area where I can just keep smashing. (huehuehue) This is a dangerous game we're playing! This is a dangerous game of rodeo! He wants to keep swatting me, he wants to keep smacking. He wants-he wants death upon me. He wishes a lot of bad things upon my person right now. But I'm not letting go, baby. Go-OH God. OOOw! I'm still here! You can swat and you can swat all you want, but Jack's still gonna be on yo' ass! Okay, you, though, can go away. Second guy? No. No one wants you. (music builds dramatically) No way. NO WAY! I killed him! You CAN kill them! OH MY GOD! I'm the BEST! Fuck you, dude! All I had to do was hang on and drill all day! *Dragon #2 roars* That was amazing! Yeah, where are you, where are you? You see your dead friend? Huh? Oh. Oh wait. Hold on-hold on a sec. Hold-hold on. Okay, um, not what I meant to do. *giggly happy Jack* I can't believe I actually killed one! That's incredible! *roar* Get off my fucking ship. Wrong thing. So that means you can kill everything in this game? *roar* I really didn't think I was gonna be able to kill one of them. Holy shit. That was amazing. All you had to do was hold on and grapple all day. And drill all day. Just like that. Just like that. brrr brrr Oh, you better swim away, or I'll do the same thing to you. I'm going easy on you right now. The only reason I haven't killed you yet is because it takes too long, not because I don't want to. ALL RIGHT, I'm gonna leave this episode of Subnautious here. I am The King Commander of this game now. I'm going to come back next time and kill your ass. *roar* Yeah, yours, I ain't even afraid, Buster Brown. Can you stop? Can everybody just stop? Can you go away? I'm not even over there. Oh my god. Did you actually close your eyes and everything? *gasp* Niiice... Close your eyes, friend, for you are dead now. ANYway, THANK you guys so much for watching this episode. If you LIKED it, PUNCH that like button IN the face, LIKE A BOSS!

I can't get any fucking higher! I'm gonna do it also I've gotten a bunch of the shit. I actually got the battle pass like everyone told me to do, and Purchased a bunch of shit cuz I felt bad being the only one without anything so now I have all this stuff. I like this guy, this guy's cool, and this is my loading screen thing cuz it's adorable, AW look at that! It's cute. And then it's like "Oh this game is free-to-play?" Haha!

What up! Morning. It's Afternoon actually, but it's snowed in Brighton for the first time since we moved here! Apparently it doesn't snow very often. Might mean that its the end of the world and That global warming has taken us over and we're all about to die, but for now it's snow vlog! Yay! We don't actually have anything to do in town But it doesn't snow very often so it's a chance to go out and vlog some stuff around Brighton again, And I want to see what Brighton looks like in the snow, so let's-  Oh Wait! We can't go yet. I need to get ready. Okay In 3, 2, 1 *Poof* There ready for the snow! Come at me winter. I'm ready. I'm not really I'm probably still gonna freeze and die.  (Same, Jack, Same) BUT LETS GOOOO! Signe made a little bear (He's so cute!) Out here we don't make snowMEN we make snowBEARS. And he's super adorable! But he keeps melting and his fingers keep falling off and his nose fell off, but hang in there little buddy. (Bear Grills Impression) Oh me to show you the tracks of the squirrels. They thought they were being sneaky, but we found em' These tracks tell a story.  (Storytime w/ Jack) * Laughs* He went up this way, and then he was like "Nah, It's pretty cold. Imma, Come all the way back and go home" *Laughs* Look at all those chickens (Pigeons, Jack) Oh, he chasing. Oh he chasing. He protecting. He wants something. He ain't gonna get it. Hey Wiish [Wiishu]. Wiishu: mmh. J: Throws snow Wiishu: *looks back* Noooo! *Signe grabs some snow and throws it at Jack* *Laugh Together* Look at all these chickens! ( That's snow Jack) It's everywhere! It's starting to melt though, cuz the- Woah, Because the Sun is out [Science w/Jack!] And I'm just glad that we got to get out into it before it did melt. It's so pretty! So bright! It's so cold! So BRIGHTON! I wanna build a snowman...or something, but Then I get cold. We found another snowman! He's just hanging out! *Tickles Cute Carrot Nose* Hi, little Buddy * Laughs* What's weird as well is that yesterday it snowed a tiny bit and we were astonished. and then I wanted it to snow more cuz it didn't stick in the ground and then it DID stick in the ground and Now it's everywhere and everywhere's freezing, and the power keeps going like all over Brighton. It's incredible. I was just walking by and saw this blue trumpet. I Don't play trumpet. I have no idea how to play trumpet, but I want it. I want it so badly. (It is pretty) It's so pretty I got the trumpet. [Of course you did Jack] I mean I got- I got it! I Got the trumpet. Can you hear me? Hello? (Hear you loud and clear, Over!) Is this thing on? *Saw Impression*  Hello Paul. I'd like to play a game! *Zooms in on sign* * [Jack sings] *Explosion Sound* Everyone's out here building snowmen. It's so cool. It's really weird as well because it's super bright and sunny, but it's also freezing and snow. Guess these things go hand in hand. Some people at home now are gonna be like " Thats not snow! Are you serious? [All snow is still snow Jack] That- We have METERS of snow over here. We got 16 FEET of snow over here. We died in the snow over here (Geez, *Laughs*) Well, I'm sorry. We don't get snow often so I have to appreciate it when it arrives! (As do I) [I get it in winter all the time] Plus, two inches of snow for Brighton is A LOT of snow. [I bet] Look at this teeny tiny ass snowmen They're so cute and To be expected down at the beach, It's like nothing ever happened *Giggles* I mean you can see a little bit of snow on these things, but everywhere else there's none There's like tiny little patches down in the stones So weird, and then the clouds are all dark like it's going to snow again. It probably will, we're suppose have snow like all week (Lucky) [As long as he doesn't need to shovel he's lucky] It's fun. I like snow weather, I like winter weather. I just wish it would stay more. (SAME) Stay for like a week, and then you can go away. [Same] Whoa guys look at all the snow. Imma make a snow(rock)ball Snow- Snowball fight! Let's make a stone- I mean snowman! Look at these guys This guys all big and awesome, and then the dog is like "What are you? You're so big." I mean look it's a crocodile, Or an alligator, I actually don't know the difference between them [It is a crocodile] *Jack sticks his head in a Croc Mouth* It is snowing right now *distant talking* It snowed again! I don't know if you can actually see it in the video. Can you? I don't know. There's snow falling all over me Cool! *Whispers into camera* Give me a Blizzard ( What I say all the time) (Seagull!) We're taking a coffee break, it's so cold outside. My poor little fingers, I think they're all gonna fall off but It's a great time to read my book. This Book. It's Steve Martin's book. It's all about his life as a Stand Up Comedian. And I thought it would be And I thought it would be a fun book to read before I go out on tour, because it's all about his mentalities towards his act and things like that and maybe I can learn a thing or two. This is just fascinating. I was watching Comedians in Cars Getting coffee on Netflix and the episode with Steve Martin they we're talking about his book. Cuz this book came out after he finished doing stand-up, so I thought it would be Fascinating to read. And I've read a couple of chapters So far. It's really really good. I like it a lot. (Coffee Break) ( Look at the Pretty Snow) *Bear Grills impression* We're going out into the icy wilds of Brighton. Where the snow is falling hard I have a belly full of coffee and a face full of blur. That's not focused Nothing likes to focus in the snow. Oh, I can't even focus in the snow *Laughs* A bunch of fucking people on the street are gonna be looking at me so weird like, I don't think he's British *Laughs* Sorry British people I gue- I do very bad accents when I'm cold Ohh! Your gas our network! This is good snow. Ya pick it up Squeeze it together look at that look at that. That's a snowball (Random Dancing?) That's how you know it's good snow. Look at this, I wanna go. I wanna go on the sled (We've Broken off, and cant hear!) *WindStorm* So cold But it's so pretty. Look at all that cocaine ( Jack, no üòÇ) Wow It's like million dollars on the ground *Sniffs cocaine *cough cough 'snow' cough cough* Ahh Yeah, that's that clean clear uncut shit * Continues to sniff* So * eats snow * How you guys doing? Snow Cones are really good. The Yellow Flavor [Eww] *Person trying to make kid fly and perhaps kill the child but no one likes that kid anyways* *Best trumpet solo ever made by mankind and if you don't think so DIE * TRUMPET SOLO Have no idea how to play trumpets, I don't know what- I don't know what notes are what. So I'm just kind of playing by ear and Also, I have never blown into a trumpet before and I was always like For some reason I thought you just had to go And then I always wondered why people's minds look so weird and to play trumpet, but I guess you *Trumpet sound* Mary had a *Trumpet sound* Perfect. Beautiful. Screw Youtube, my career in trumpeting has taken off. Yeah! Well that does it for this vlog. Is it shaky enough for you yet? [No.] I know it's not a whole lot and we didn't do much in town But I just wanted to show off some of the snow and as evidence that we actually did get snow at some point, in case we never ever get it again, now have a catalog of what actually happened Plus it was fucking freezing outside, so we didn't stay outside for that long, and I have some stuff to get done I need to record some videos so Imma get to it. I am glad that I got this trumpet boy though He's gonna come in very handy with annoying everybody all the time, so I'm excited about that! Anyway, thank you guys so much for watching this vlog if you liked it HEADBUTT THAT LIKE BUTTEN IN THE FACE LIKE A BOSS! And highfives all around! But thank you guys AND I WILL SEE ALL YOU DUDES IN THE NEXT VIDEO (Well that was fun! Hope You Enjoyed! Bye!) Lowly, but surely a voice is coming back in here the small man is getting back to work. 
Top of the mornin' to ya laddies, my name is Jacksepticeye and welcome. I guess to - well welcome back to FNAF, but this one's called freddy fazbear's pizzaria Simulator or something like that. I dunno everyone's calling this FNAF 6 it came out literally just a few hours ago right now for me, it's 4:06 a.m.. And I kind of wanted to jump on this now Because I didn't want to wait until tomorrow And then have to wait a whole nother day again to record it and then have the whole thing Ruined for me by everybody else telling me exactly what's happening before I even get in playing it so I thought I'd try and jump ahead of it and Play it as soon as it came out and give it a bit of a fair shot because some of the other ones I was a bit late getting to them and then by the time I did get to them I had all of my All of my vision of what the games were of warped completely by everybody else's Interpretations of what it was so I dunno what this is it kind of looks like it's a piss-take of the game It doesn't even look like it's a fully-formed FNAF game but as we all know these games like to pull no punches and change everything as it's going along and it's only been out for a few hours and already my social media feeds are inundated with people telling me to play it so I'm not too enthusiastic about it, because it's more FNAF and we've had a fucking billion of these And all everyone kind of roll their eyes at FNAF these days, and it's not really as exciting as it used to be but Again, I'm gonna give it a fair shot and make up my own judgments for it, but design pizza Don't mind if I do. You don't even have any pineapple? Come on. What is a pineapple? What is a pizza without any pineapples on it? (A bad one) I mean, it's still a pizza, but But you know what, I'm just I'm put the fucking all these on it The sounds like a delicious pizza with all of these. This is a type of pizza I would definitely make in real life if I had some pineapples they throw them on as well, and then have myself partay But yes, 100% go-to pizzeria what the fuck? Oh. Hey, I'm shooting pizzas at kids. take that you damn kids! Stay in school, don't do drugs. Also, eat lots of pizza and get very fat apparently I'm just killing children! I mean yes, I get it, FNAF has kind of always been about that, but look, I'm pretty! Also, I'm not too keyed in on the lore of Five Nights at Freddy's. Uhm, maybe cause there's just too much of it, and I'm not that invested so, a lot of this Oh God. Hello Phantom bear! A lot of this is probably gonna go over my head What do you want, you blocking my path? Can I stop you? There we go here you go little kiddies, eat up all the pizzas. Tell your parents you came down to Freddy Fazbear's and you got diabetes. And also bad cardiovascular diseases. Okay, okay, other Freddy. You know what you know what, just Stay up there. Okay? I have kids to kill. I have kids to kill, and mouths to feed and also god. You're slow and ugly. is that what I look like really? There we go oh, okay, okay? Alright, this is kind of more of what I was expecting, but I'm shooting bears (Jack laughing at the logic of shooting bears that WERE pizzas) Awesome yes! Fill up the screen with bears and were frozen. (Darkness fills the screen, leading to the slow realization of dread and fear) Oh shit. Oh, hey, baby B.a.y baby It's been a while Hasn't it? You look different though. Are you actually baby, baby was pink and white your kind of yellows and oranges and blues and purples. Okay. Oh, oh!

We're talking about becoming a fazbear entertainment franchisee [Jack]it's uncle sam bear [Game] that's right restaurant ownership and management Something almost anyone can do with a limited degree of success Sure, it's a lot of money to invest, but everyone's doing it and that means it's safe and lucrative With your initial investment, you'll receive everything you need to get started including a small room some tables and electricity [Game] But don't forget about the money you have left over after buying your franchise package [Jack] after buying [Game] use it to decorate [Game] Buy a stage, buy attractions and animatronics and much much more [Jack]does he have blood on his face now Let's take a look at a few things that will help you get started as a fazbear entertainment franchisee Lay it on me such as, Atmosphere making sure your establishment has an abiding atmosphere is essential to bringing in new customers [Jack] This cheese is so REAL [Game] entertainment value in your restaurant will ensure that customers come back bonus revenue [Game] Coin-operated games and attractions can generate additional revenue during the day [Jack] saving moneys for nerds [Game] are here in your pocket ready for reinvestment Health and safety there may be times when you purchase something of questionable quality And we don't blame you cutting corners is just good business But there are steps you can take to ensure. You don't get sued for it and that brings us to Liability being a thrifty shopper is smart. [Jack] You might die [Game] that buying things on sale comes with a certain amount of risk aside from the daily risk of lawsuits There's also the risk that something might be hiding inside whatever you just purchased with that steeply discounted price tag [Jack] oh come on, really? of course, that would only be a serious danger if there were something outside That's been trying to get in for months now, which we are not confirming to be the case This concludes the amount of help We are legally obligated to provide Hey remember you are now the face of the newly rebranded Freddy fazbear's pizza where that smile with pride and let's make some money Fazbear entertainment is not responsible for disappearance death or dismemberment No you're not even trying There's no fucking subtlety to this game anymore as think there might be something hiding inside or something from the outside trying to get in WINK WINK NUDGE THEORIES! We get it okay. Oh, too A 2 step guide to restaurant management use catalog mode to purchase items. Item choice. Am I actually making my own aah I'm ready I'm actually making my own pizzeria Let's get started I Look exactly how much cash you had left over after purchasing your franchise package Great, that should be more than enough now Let's get started on your Left are your product catalogs, you can unlock more expensive catalogs by simply purchasing items for your pizzeria Use the arrows in the bottom right of the item window to browse the products for each catalog When you're finished shopping click the button labeled blueprint mode to place your items you can switch back and forth between Catalog mode and blueprint mode as often as you like before opening your doors to the public When you're ready to open your restaurant for business for the day click the button labeled finished in blueprint mode Give it a try and do some shopping Thanks, also. I remember you from FNaF world Yeah, every else forgot because good idea Like everything the fucking fan is here. I mean I have to play the fan, right You either already own this item or an upgraded version Oh? Take a doc. Oh cool. Oh Bucket Bob's not available mister can do Mr. Hugs Sissy salt pan Stan ah the paper pals. How about you guys? Okay This is weird, I don't know what the fuck is going on, but I'm into it.

Have a pop and good time with fish time pop this. I pop Inc is offering to pay for advertising I cool I got $250 I go back to my catalogue to make my place look even better buy ooh I'm gonna go into Stan's budget stuff. Imma buy me some fucking speakers! OH I could have bought those ones! K I've $95 left mom told me not spend it all in one place, but fuck mom what she know I'm a businessman now (Jack humming to in-game music) Look at my place. It's so cool-looking (Jack bobbing his head as he scats along) Maaaan Looking Snasserific there Jackaroo probably should've bought an animatronic But you know what that's the downfall of the fnaf games. Five nights of Freddy's would be a lot better if they just didn't buy any animatronics Put the kids up on stage, let them be their own animatronics. I don't want a larger floor plan and finished. I don't know what I'm doing. Just got a load of money and spend it all in one place your restaurant is now officially open Awesome that doesn't mean your job is finished however You have a lot of work to do while patrons eat their pizza in the other room.Jack: Oh Shit I turned it off. your terminal you have supplies to buy papers to print and repairs to make Once you've taken care of all the items on your to-do list you can log off for the day and get out of there Money for supplies and repairs comes out of petty cash, so don't worry about it coming out of your pocket We've got you covered the only money You have to worry about is if you choose to upgrade any of the equipment in your office now on to other matters Okay. There's anything to be aware of is that the ventilation System and your terminal are pretty loud and may prevent you from hearing things in adjoining air vents That won't be a problem if there is nothing in the vents however if you feel that something might be in the vents you have a few tools at your disposal to protect yourself Aww Jesus. You can shut off your terminal and the ventilation system at any time to decrease the amount of potential you draw to yourself. (Fiztime ad blares over Mr. Tutorial Man) Shut Up! Directly into a vent will most likely prevent anything from jumping out You also have three tools available from the terminal itself There is a motion detector, an audio decoy, and a secondary ventilation unit. Keep in mind however that you can only have one of these active at any given time. Okay. Now get to it Simply log off when you've completed your tasks for the day, and you can go get some coffee Okay, I've fuckin no idea what I'm doing. Activate silent ventilation That's not silent (Considering it's quieter than regular vents, that's pretty silent, Jack. :/) K, Did I order anything yet? Order cups Oh fucking dial-up *Jack making noises* Okay done I have to go through all of these?! (Yes Jack you do. Tedious isn't it, Jackieboy?) So I'm in here right I, oh activate motion scanning. Oh, it's not just doing it on its own Got it God you're fucking slow. Are you are you still scanning? You just told me that nothing showing up. Okay? I'm order some napkins They're important I need them kids Kids like napkins Kids love napkins actually. It's really weird you think you need toys for kids. You actually just need napkins kids love that shit (Not True. At All.) Okay am I doing things correctly? (Yes Jack you are. Just keep doing things, buddy.) I-is this good? (Keep going, brother.) I have a printer in my office apparently (It's really small) Okay, Jesus Christ I Guess t-this did take place a million years ago. I Don't know if you're actually scanning stuff properly So I'm assuming that something's going to show up here, and then I press audio to get it into an adjacent room Maybe who the fuck knows, maybe we will get jump-Scared! (DON'T JINX IT JACK!!!) Okay, I don't know if I can click off this or if it'll revert that turn off that for a second. ah, I can hear myself think yeah, it does turn it off. Okay Printing printing paper oh, it's getting warm in here turn the air AC back on. Get very hot and bothered Okay, oh, unclog toilets I don't wanna do that oh it's nice and breezy in here now. Back down to sixty degrees. I'm gonna turn it off again Don't wanna waste power were on a budget here people. I only have five dollars. You know I'm doing all this shit with five dollars, but okay Am I hearing something? Okay, A/C's back on. Oh, thank god. I was dying in here. I was dying! Is this it is? Is this the last thing I have to do? Great job. It looks like you're getting the hang of this now. Let's just focus on getting you through your first week, okay? There's a big party here Saturday, and you should view that day as your ultimate test make it through Saturday And you will have proven yourself as the successful entrepreneur that we all know you can be But I don't want that, I don't care about a pizza chain. I care about eating pizza. I don't care about Owning pizza congratulations on completing your first day, Jack: Thanks Man. However your job isn't over. Just yet There is another aspect to your end of day routine and that is inspecting and salvaging any animatronics found in the alley outside the back door Things are something On here quite often and while we aren't sure why Oh God what we do know is that they can be used for parts? Which can mean a much needed revenue boost before starting your next day. Of course as with everything else in this line of work those benefits come with risk The smartest thing to do is to throw it back outside But then you get no money for the salvage choose to keep it And you run the risk of certain negative Consequences namely death, should the item in question not be as docile as it first appeared Jack: Why are you letting me pause now? And decide to try to salvage it then you must complete the maintenance checklist? During this testing phase check on the animatronic frequently if you feel that it is becoming unstable Use the Taser provided to you You can use it three times without damaging the hardware every use over three. However will decrease the items salvage value Jack: I have A Taser?! They take for you is an animatronic found in the back alley. We are unsure of its origins It is your job to complete the maintenance checklist before claiming it as Salvage or if you choose to You can throw it back into the alley where you found it and forfeit payment. Jack: I would like that. Please make your choice now. Proceed with Salvage throw it back to the alley. Bye! *Jack Lauging* Don't forget Saturday. You want them all to be in one place. Wait I can actually just throw it back into the Alleyway?! What the fuck?! Hey it works man. New lawsuits 0, no one' no one's... uh Doing litigation on me. And I have $307 course Okay, so we need to get stuff for the party on Saturday, right? fruity maze arcade entertainment 4, entertainment bonus revenue Let's keep that in mind. Okay. Imma buy you.

I'm just trying to make a living man I got kids at home. I gotta feed them Okay, I get it now I get why getting the sponsorships is a bad idea cuz they interrupt everything else That's fine, maybe I want to be interrupted I want to see some of the game I want to see what animatronics are gonna scare me what animatronos are lying around?! Jump-scares and everyone when I feel like it might be a hoot and holler Let's turn off this for a sec I've heard something At least I thought I did Vents can you come back on it's hot as balls in here I honestly have no idea if I'm doing any of this right Print the pliers have a bar mitzva to promote Okay Everything's fine I was only in here printing posters man Regular ol Quiznos Kinkos FedEx print shop Is anything actually happening I feel like I'd be terrible at this game, I'm just getting lucky Just back up away from the screen a small bit, so doesn't scare me Okay Maintenance unclog those toilets fucking farting bastards clogging up all my toilets all the time Because he keep feeding them that abomination pizza that I made at the start, but it's good.

What is happening Am I supposed to be jumpscared I know it's closing time Oh, but I now I gotta stick my face in a robot's face Before you is an animatronic found in the back alley. We are unsure of its origins [Game] It is your job to complete the maintenance checklist before claiming it as salvage [Jack] Hey, it's Springtrap [Game] if you choose to You can throw it back into the alley where you found it? I mean I could just keep throwing them back into the thing salvage value a thousand okay [Jack] Proceed with salvage [Game] we're going to proceed with the maintenance checklist remember use your company issues taser to return the [Game] Animatronic to a neutral state if you feel that it's becoming unstable or aggressive [Jack] okay... [Game] You can only use it three times before it begins to damage the animatronic. [Jack] I'm ready to taste some ass! begin audio prompt in three two one (Uumm...UFO sounds?) Again with this shit, it's sounds like aliens Document results Oh, GET BACK THERE BITCH!!! [Jack] Taste them yeah, that was fun [Game] begin audio prompt in three two one Second audio prompt (Um...Jack are you having a seizure? I probably should have been looking at you, shouldn't I? Document results [Game] Begin audio prompt in three two one. [Jack] I don't like that you're moving so close I actually don't like that you're moving at all. Document results Begin audio prompt in three I'mma tase you back right now Not liking it begin that audio prompt one Document results [Game] Begin audio prompt in three two one [Jack] Did you move?! I want one of those audio document things to just be like... "Baby you're a firework-" And the animatronic just starts dancing This is a long one... [Game] Document results [Jack] Oh, this is, it it's gonna get me... (Boo.) I   a l w a y s   c o m e   b a c k What? And something is loose in your pizzeria. Oh Fat kids again from the stand today overfed with my abomination pizza. Abominizza, as I like to call it! Wait I got the salvage revenue?! still have zero lawsuits though, so that is a Okey-dokey on my regard Okay, well I'm gonna need this video here on FNaF Pizzeria Freddy Fazbear simulator I have absolutely no idea what to think this is a weird game I'm not I'm not sure if I'm into it it seems so all over the place and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing though the other games they did get a Bit like the first few nights were a bit easy as well so that I get caught OOHH Oh okay, so Nothing's actually going to be walking around in my vents until I fail that because then it said something as loose in your pizzeria so as I actually find all those other nights anyway and Now because I did that wrong which again. I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing So because I feel that is it loose in the pizzeria now so when I go into the thing I'll actually have to scan for stuff now Funny that it's Springtrap because these mechanics are exactly the ones to keep Springtrap away- was it Springtrap...? Yes in FNaF three you had to use the music to guide him into different rooms Okay, um let me know what you guys think I don't know if this is supposed to be taken seriously or not and I don't know what the whole end goal is or even The timeline or any of this takes place, but all I know is that I'm making a ball or ass Not available ....why? I'm gonna give I'm gonna get a fucking baller Pizzeria kids are gonna love it. That's a three liability risk though, and I'm I have no lawsuits yet So I'm trying to keep that up and try and keep my my litigation record Clean as whistle- but anyway. Thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it PUNCH that like button in the FACE LIKE A BOSS! And, high fives all around. Wpish! Wpish! Thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes- IN THE NEXT VIDEO! (Teknoaxe's "I'm Everywhere") I want to be as happy is that dancin' bear in the corner *Jack Noise* 
*whip crack high five sound* Top of the morning to you laddies my name is jacksepticeye, and welcome back to a "Would You Rather" video But this one is different because I want to involve you guys More and more in my videos as much as I possibly can to bridge this sort of gap. I thought it'd be a good idea to do a... "Would You Rather" video, where I take some of your suggestions so this time I'm not going to the either.io website to get some of their Would You Rather scenarios. I'm going directly to you. So these ones should actually be kind of tailored towards me or at least, Something that's going to be hard for me to answer or something. That's a little weird for me to answer, so let's get, let's get jiggy with it. Let's get let's get fun with it I I wrote out gonna try and record a bit of a different Would You Rather video involving all of you this time so write out your own would you rather Scenarios for me to answer and of course one of the first things we get is would you rather: Go on a date with Chris Pratt or Ryan Reynolds? Oh man. That's difficult *chuckles* Oh, shit, okay. I'll have to seriously think about this one cuz, it's not just would you rather go on a date with them and like all- like a romantic thing or anything like that now. I actually have to think about who I'd rather hang out with and get like advice from, and listen to and that kind of stuff Oh, who'd be more fun to hang out with Oooh, very good one! Very good start to this. This is going to be the whole video now me contemplating it. Okay, both of them incredibly fun, energetic, charismatic, people that- that- That's a given. The way it is. I think I could have a crap ton of fun with either of them. I think they'd all- they'd have a lot of stuff that they'd be able to say a lot of advice. They'd be able to give Uhm... I don't- *Giggles* I don't know probably Ryan Reynolds ahh Would I? I don't know I love Chris Pratt as well Well, Ryan Reynolds like as of right now if I'm thinking about this Right now probably Ryan Reynolds cuz Deadpool 2 is coming up and I think there'd be a lot of cool conversation to be had around that. I know Infinity War is coming up soon, too But Deadpool 2 was like dedicated only to one character. With infinity war I don't know how much Chris Pratt's actually gonna be in that, So I don't know. That's a very hard one because I'd like to talk to both of them I'd like to... get to know both of them a bit more on like a personal level or Urm, or just they hear stuff from their own words without like cameras or anything being on and I'd like to hear like their acting advice and, I'd like to hear just their life advice and what they've been through and what they're going through different things like that. So... Right now, I'd probably pick Ryan Reynolds. Maybe it's cuz I had a dream about him recently and because Deadpool 2 is coming out. I know how much you hate heights, so would you rather skydive from 12,000 feet, but get to the ground in five minutes, or abseil down a 600-foot building, but it takes an hour. Ooh... Okay... Ah ha! 12,000 feet I don't know how high-up a regular skydive is... Erm... 12,000 feet is very very high up I have always wanted to at least try skydiving. I keep thinking that I would if I really really wanted to like if I'm just sitting here. I'm like okay let yeah, let's just do it because I I don't know, it's not a fear of me jumping out of a plane. and me fearing that my parachute is not gonna go off and I'm gonna die or anything. It's just that like looking down It's like oh god! That's scary looking kind of feeling and I think I could overcome that and have a lot of fun out of it. But getting from 12,000 feet to the ground in five minutes. I don't know how fast people normally drop from a skydive, or abseil on a 600 foot building. I probably go with the skydive Because I feel like skydiving from 12,000 feet is a lot cooler than abseiling a 600-foot building. Sure, and taking an hour would also it might help me get over it it might help me understand it. It might help me help me. Have a good time a bit of a better time and enjoy it eventually after I overcame the fear. But I think it would also take an hour to get down, which would just be after why it would just take a really long time. Where as after 12,000 feet in five-minutes, I would be buzzin'! I would be so ready to go! I'd have so much energy in me, and adrenaline pumping through me, that I'd probably want to do it again. Definitely this could traumatize me, would you rather crush poop with naked feets or get wet Willie? K-Roose what's wrong with you!? This is a mistake? *Chuckles* So crush poop with naked feet okay. No or get a wet Willie. So are you saying that my actual Physical willy is wet or that- I'm getting like the kitty wet Willie in your ears thing? Either of, I am good with the wet Willie No matter, which one you're saying I do not want to step on poop with my naked feet unless it's like Really dried up horse poop or something cuz then I it's not gonna really gonna make a difference But if its like really sludgy, or manure kind of stuff then... No, thanks. Would you rather be Spider-Man or Deadpool? Now, see this is where you think you're gonna get me, because Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool, and I keep going on about that all the time. But no Spider-Man without question. There is absolutely no doubt if anybody came to me with any sort of scenario being: would you rather be Spider-Man or something else? Does not matter Spider-Man is always the better option unless it's like... double Spider-Man. That's a pretty good option. But Spider-Man always I would love to be Spider-Man. I've got Spider-Man on my  freaking monitor here, there's so many Spider-Man figurines and toys upstairs. I just love Spider-Man. He's the coolest superhero! cuz his his powers are just really unique, and they make him super-bouncy and agile and like really springy, and I love that kind of like athleticism in him, and he's small and He's he's lean he's Not like super bulky or like mad ripped or anything. He's just small and lean, but he's insanely strong and He's just a kid. I mean everyone kind of feels like they relate to Peter Parker I relate to Peter Parker more than I have any other Superheroes alter-ego put it that way And I think that's why I like Spider-Man so much not only that but his powers are some of the coolest that I've ever seen From a superheroes as well so Spider-Man, and he has the coolest outfit! Would you rather play only Shadow of the Colossus or the Last Guardian for 24-hours straight? Hmm, I think I'd go with Shadow of the Colossus Oh See this this is a tricky one because the Last Guardian, I've only actually finished once and that was for the videos I uploaded here on YouTube but... I've played it a little bit since then, but not the whole thing again. So I think playing that again for 24-hours would probably make the 24-hours go by a lot quicker. Because I'd be going through it again, and it would take me what five-hours to get through that game again? So if it did that and I just took my time, and took it all in, and looked at all the little hidden details that would probably make the 24-hours go quicker. Shadow of the Colossus, I finished probably about 10-times already. *Groans with frustration* But I haven't done the Time Trial stuff in a long time. But even then doing that it's like a three-hour game for me now. So, I don't know probably Shadow of the Colossus. I'll go with Shadow of the Colossus, because I could do the Time Trials, and I could start whittling down my technique and- Start getting it like a lot more refined and everything and I could just start like hammering through the colossi and really like Really getting really good at it I'm already really good at it the way I am, but just like getting like Speed Runner good at it. Would you rather die from a terrible long illness or be stabbed and bleed-out until you die. *Chuckles nervously* Wow! I would go with the terrible-long illness. Being stabbed is one of my biggest fears. I think it's such a horrible thing for anybody to do to another human And it's like one of the worst things a human can have done to them It's just it's horrible the thought of that actually happening is so scary! and... either way, I'm dying so I Would rather have something where I can make amends do something with the time I have left if I have a terrible-long illness even if it's like a lot of pain for me. I can at least Do more for the world while I'm here right now. I could start giving away money to different organizations I could just start setting up a lot of different things before I I Went out of this world put it that way I can hang out with friends one last time. I could I could do all these like different things. I could like actually do a bucket list kind of thing. Whereas if I just get stabbed and bleed-out not only is that horrible, but I wouldn't really have much time to contemplate. I wouldn't have time much time to reflect and to make things right this is fun I'm glad I decided to do this kind of one I... It's interesting to see what you guys come up with: would you rather voice act in a good indie game, or a bad publisher game So you mean something like like EA or something? If I voice acted in one of their games, which they have a reputation for being bad Especially now after star wars and all that stuff, or would I rather voice act in a good indie game. I'd Probably go with a good indie game. I Voice acted in some good indie games already, which I'm really proud of and I'm really happy with and... I don't know I, I don't think the exposure is what I look for when it comes to that thing. If I wanted the voice acting something for exposure I could probably just put my feelers out and try and get my name into something somewhere. With like ties to Disney and different things like that, but that's not the point. I want it the way I want a voice act is that I want to be good at it. I want to get experience I want to be good at it. I want to be I want to like play fun characters I want to do fun voices. I want to do all these different things and sure you could do that in a bad publisher game But if it's a good indie game then that's probably like I play a lot of indie games as it is and You could probably help out the developer of the indie game by promoting it here on YouTube Then by playing it because I was in it Like I did for Pinstripe or Bendy and the Ink Machine, which I was really happy with so Probably go with a good indie game. I got a go with anything really at this point I just want to do it, but yeah, good question. Would you rather meet amazingphil or meet Dan Howell? Erm *nervous Laugh* Both I've met both at the same time twice actually So both that isn't an either-or situation, plus are they ever disconnected from the hip? That's, that's the thing I think they're just secretly aliens from another planet, and they came down and they have to stay together because they're symbiotes, and they have to live-off of each other and if we ever figure out the real secret. *Ominous music starts playing* Oh, shit! *Buzzing noise* Would you rather sleep naked in the woods wearing nothing, but raw-steak or take a bath in hot banana milk? Come on! That's the easiest answer ever hot banana milk. It could scald my skin. I don't care, then I would be infused with banana milk. That would be amazing! I would smell good, I could drink some of my own stew. It'd be awesome! Why would I want to sleep naked in the woods wearing nothing But raw steak that just sounds uncomfortable hot banana milk bath. Sounds sounds like something I would actually legitimately do. *Chuckles in a jovial manner* Would you rather have no fingers or no toes? I tried I'm sorry. *Giggles* Oh, that's okay. At least you wrote something. Thank you I'd rather have no toes because... fingers are far more useful than your toes are. Toes are great for balance and all that kind of stuff but Your fingers are like used for everything. I have a cup of coffee right here. That I would not be able to drink without fingers. I mean I could but it would just be a lot more difficult. Fingers are what separates human from a lot of other Species on the planet as well like fingers and opposable thumbs opposable thumbs are a big one, so yeah. I'd rather lose my toes. Would you rather quit YouTube and be a Game Designer or continue with YouTube? I feel like that's a bit of an obvious one that I'd just continue with YouTube But I get what you're going for would I rather quit YouTube and be a Game Designer or go with YouTube and then do something else later on. Because I the thing is I'm not gonna do YouTube forever I'm not gonna be here all the time forever and always I'm eventually gonna have to move-off and do something else Game Design is not something that I would like to do. I mean That's a wrong way of saying it I would like to do it, but it's not something that I would actively pursue because the stuff that's needed to become a Game Designer. I don't really have any interest in I would love to be involved in a game in somehow But I rather be involved in like the mocap aspect of it or the voice aspect of it, or even Music and Sound Design more so than just general Game Design because I'm not good at Math. I'm not good at Code I'm not good at Art any of those things and I don't really have the drive to be good at them to want to become a Game Designer, and if I was ever gonna quit YouTube for anything I Would probably still do something like this? like Voice Acting or Music, or Traditional Acting whatever it's going to be that I end up doing. I am probably still gonna do it in some sort of regard where I can still sit down and do this kind of stuff all the time and bring people along if I do Game Design I don't really know if that's the same thing. The way I interact with everybody now is something that I want to continue doing in whatever adventure I do after this. So doing Game Design I can still interact with you, but I'm not really here on video being able to talk to you everyday sort of thing unless I forced it out. You know what I mean! Would you cry would you rather cry the entire day or get angry the entire day? Oh? I would much prefer to cry for an entire day, than get angry for an entire day. Cuz crying isn't always sad And that's probably what you mean, but I could be happy crying or I could just be crying for different reasons. But being angry, I do not like being angry if something actually like frustrates me or agitates me or gets me angry I I'm in just such a bad head space. I'm so... Unproductive some people can use their anger and use it to like work for them I don't know if that's healthy or not because you're kind of working in spite of things or running on this This weird energy that can't like sustain itself Not that you could work on crying either. I don't think I could work productively under either I could probably just work better under crying and I think I can understand crying a lot more than I can understand the anger because the anger just if I cry I Kind of get stuff out of my system, and then afterwards I'm like okay, that's done. Let's move on if I'm angry usually the anger It doesn't just go it kind of lingers around because I don't get angry often. I don't get angry at things I'm usually fairly happy about stuff, that's going on, but if I do get angry. It's usually over something... worth getting angry over that if that makes any sense. So, if I am angry It's usually because I'm in a bad head space, and I don't want to be in a bad head space. *Chuckles* Being angry just makes me uncomfortable put it that way. Would you rather have ears for nipples or nipples for ears? *Laughs* Probably, ears on my nipples. Ears for nipples all the more to hear you with could hear stuff coming in front of me from miles away. I think, I think having ears for nipples right down here. Would be a lot more useful than having nipple ears if I'd nipples up here I don't think that does that mean then I wouldn't be able to hear anymore? I just lose my ears and have nipples where they'd be because then I definitely go with ears down where my nipples are It'd be a bit weird and anyone taking off my shirt or even trying to put on clothes or anything. Would be a little strange. I mean I could get them cut-off. That's a thing I'd still have these ears Or are you saying where they'd rather switch them around? That's a different type of discussion... Oh Would you rather be lost in a Forest or be lost in the Ocean? Oh, a forest without question. Without doubt. Don't get me wrong being lost in like a very very dense forest and not knowing any way out of it, especially at night time would be very, very scary. But... Then never mind all day like all the ease of Actually having some sort of edible materials or some sort of craftable materials that kind of stuff whatever about that. But just being lost in the ocean sounds like one of the scariest things that a human can go through. Imagine being out there in the middle of the ocean and Having nothing around you and just your legs dangling underwater, and you're not being able to see anything That is fucking horrible! There's stories out there of some people I can't remember which war it was might have been it was one of the world Wars. I think where some of the soldiers had to abandon their own ship, and they were all out in the water, just while the ship sank, they were all just out in the water swimming around waiting for rescue while Like most of the soldiers were all eaten by sharks. Imagine how horrible that would be just sitting there floating in the ocean... Not having a clue in the dark not having a clue What's underneath you, and some of your friends and your allies, and everything are just being picked out of the water by sharks. And you don't know if you're gonna be next. That is so, so scary! That's one of the scariest things! I think in my head that anybody can go through. Would you rather be able to play the piano or the guitar? I think I would be more of a piano man guitars cool. I wanted to learn guitar when I was younger before I learned drums. But... Being able to play piano is one of the coolest talents, I think... someone can be able to do someone can be able to do fucking fantastic English I Just watching people play piano and play piano well is so impressive to me There's so many people out there who can play, well... I guess can play both But if someone can play guitar well Versus someone who could play piano well because I've just seen so many people be able to play guitar well And I have known people who are able to play guitar super, super well in my life. I think that's why the allure of piano is so much stronger for me, and the more the older I've gotten and the more I've gotten into like different types of music... and film scores and soundtracks, and game soundtracks, and things like that. I've just I've been hugely drawn to piano, and I think if you learn how to play piano well it translates so well to so many different instruments, because if you can get you're... Learning piano well means that you learn music theory very, very well. You can read music you can listen to it You can probably play the notes. You know your octaves your circle of fifths all that kind of stuff not only that, but you have insane dexterity in your fingers to be able to play different things, so you could probably go from piano to guitar. Easier than you can go from guitar to piano Just because you have the dexterity there. You know the theory. Erm, and learning a fretboard is not that different from learning a Piano in a way a lot of people out there be like: How dare you!? You know what I mean. Any of you who play these instruments will probably agree with me as well And I just I really wish... I wish I was one of those people who could sit down play piano and make my own songs Because I play drums, I can't make my own music. I can make my own beats But I can't really make music out of just a drum kit unless, I get very, very inventive with it Whereas if you play a couple of chords with a piano, you're already making melodies and music and it sounds very, very pleasing and I'd love to be able to just be that person who could go up, and sit down at a piano and just play. Ah, this is a good one given that you can't interact with your environment in either scenario. Would you rather spend a day in the past or an hour in the future? So, I'd have to spend like a full-day any time in the past or an hour any time in the future But I can't interact with my environment So, I'm only allowed go there and like be like a ghost and just experience it. I would love to go to the future and see what's there? Because the past is in the past the past is written. The ink is dry the stuff that's happened has happened, and whether you mean anytime in the past or even just my own past either way I Can look up stuff that's happened in the past I can get a lot more clarity on it by going back and spending a day there like what really happened during this event But it's done. Whatever whatever was going to happen happened anyway so coming back I think I would just have a bit more clarity on certain things But it wouldn't really change a whole lot where's going for an hour in the future. It's only an hour that goes by pretty quick, but if I could go like a Thousand-years in the future. Just to see what it would be like just to see what would happen, what would be there Would be so incredible, how far space travel has come where humanity actually is that we progress or regress That things get better or worse did we did we did we do great things? or Did we destroy ourselves kind of thing What what does technology look like in the future? How long do people live? What is there a unifying.. language or Different systems like that like all the sci-fi stuff that I grew-up loving, that I wish I could see and like even back before when people watched eighties-movies like 2001 a Space Odyssey. And they had like glass panels that they were poking at and doing science stuff on and you were like that's crazy Imagine having that in the future now. It's like well, yeah, this is a piece of glass that you touch to interact with like How crazy will the future be for us now? I'd love to see what like video game graphics and movies and everything look like I Would just be fascinated way more by the future than I would be by the past. Okay, well. I'm gonna leave this video here. That was really, really fun. It's, it's very interesting getting would you rather questions from people Who, who watch you and follow the content that you make. Because a lot that the questions are like obviously tailored more towards the way I think and a lot of you ask questions that you Knew that I was sort of into like the sci-fi future stuff and those kinds of things, and the superheroes and everything so.. It's a lot more fascinating to read them that way than to just go through the website. So, I'll probably do more like this where I actually ask you to ask me stuff. And it's a lot more topical and relevant because a lot of the Chris Pratt Ryan Reynolds stuff was here because of the Valentine's video I did So, it's just interesting to see that stuff and that was a blast and I love doing videos where you're actively in the video Your- your direct influence is in the videos that I'm doing That is a huge contributing factor to why I want to do these types of videos as well, so I just love them. I love, I love getting more involved at everybody out there, so thanks for giving me some suggestions. I didn't get to all of them, but we'll do this again, and maybe I'll answer your thing next time. but thank you guys so much for- --Sorry, I had a burp from all the coffee-- for watching this episode, if you liked, it punch that like button in the face LIKE A BOSS!! And, High fives all around. *Whapishh, whapishh*, but thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes, IN THE NEXT VIDEOOO *Outro music* *"Russian" accent* Very good question, very good answer, very good video, very good. *Thumps-up* *burps* 
I have never played this before. I've always wanted to play it, but you have played it... I've played a bit of SnipperClips! ..And you're really good at it? No... (JackSpeticlap) JS: I Think we're ready for retro reboot PJ: right let's go retro I might-b,  I might be a little bit too confident in myself right now, but... There's an, There's an all right. Let's try it. There's a mom with a mouse thing.. Where's the mouse? Here, oh, that's a just a classic jackSepticeye gag. Isn't it? JS: yeah? See, normally when I'm here on my own recording, I don't get to do all these goofs. (PJ rambling in back) JS: Oh, good good So, now you're getting the brunt of it.. The burn of the goofs. PJ: Thank you. I love fish, I love water, I love splashing.. Has all the ingredients for a great cake ... Ah, this is cool-looking Yeah, so this... This is a little bit less kind of crafts, and more like.. but it's like retro, is like an old retro game.. I don't know if that's... (Strange grunts in back) So i don't know if I've done this level or not.. Experimental or not.. JS: So, let's get the fish in the thing.. we need a red fish, err.. a pink fish, and a green fish. Come again?? There's a pink fish, and a green fish, and they need to go in the hole And we need it right under... JS:  and you put them in here. PJ: I'm coming back if I can.. Come back??  Hold on. How do I.. JS: Oh, wait, There's a there's a pencil thing... PJ: Oh yea, a pencil. Oh! Okay, all right! Oh, and I fell.. (Jack laughs at PJ's attempt) Let me come back! I'm gonna come back, and then we'll cut some shapes... JS: Do you need to be like a .. scoop again? Yeah, scoop me! We are number one Scoopy boys, and Briner's can say.. JS:  that's the signs that I'ma call this episode Scoopy Bo-. Oh frick,  I was... Did you forget? Wait.. tell you were a... JS: yeah Don't hurt me too much, please!!! I don't know if that's a good Scoop, uh... It'll d- uhh.. I think I can work Okay, okay. Here we go.. PJ: so here... We you're gonna grab that and then you oh, I'm gonna make that fish does not want to play nice. Not you blue. Sorry I'll try and keep this on a thing yes, that's good. That's good. Yeah. Here. We go there. We go there We go catch him and get him in There we go oh I hate fish, I thought yeah, just moments ago, you were saying you love fish, yeah Well, that's another thing you're gonna have to realize about me. I you're a pathological liar Okay, okay, you ready for another one. I'm ready here. It's possibly not Hey, dude this smile always this scoops are real that was a real scoop Yes, cool. We did it Oh All right there we go, so do you know much about this game like do you know how it happened? how it came to be I Feel like I heard the story, and I forget it okay um Well, let's figure this level and then maybe on sir you need to put a scoop in we scoop it all right? Let me speak people and then I can get out a little robot So is that the Frog? Where's the phone? This is him you said get rid of the thing and he needs to bounce up in here Just die Just die do it. It's easier. If you just let this happen. Just let it come on. Just die Okay, I'm in the way There you go Okay So if I stand here oh, I've too much an edge on me Yeah, you're right. You are too edgy right now far too. Edgy. Could you make me thinner and taller? If I could there's only so much science can do PG. All right. I don't think it's possible Well, so how would I make you taller? I'm just trying Let's see if I can just like give you a nice big Divot yeah, he sits in there. No see okay bring him over here. He should bounce higher And you get stuck honest You basically just not leather. You'd need to not be terrible at this game. I didn't want to say it Okay, okay, how does this now? I'm between a rock and a hard place. Maybe what if I know? All right good good go now now. He doesn't jump now. He doesn't Joe stay in froggy friend. Oh hang on I only closed the gate. Yes, yes there. He goes. He's home there goes my hero wait. That's all we needed they just eat him Okay, I'm really enjoying this Let's do cage free sure what you want to say how the game was made. Oh, yes, so Maybe I'd like to guys it so Tom and Adam vien they used to I used to watch their stuff on Newgrounds they used to make cartoons like 10 11 12 years ago like as the super flash bros yeah And they worked together on a load of projects like ones like the code at once the artist and sorry I'm completely screwing this up. That's okay and Basically they made a game like this a Nintendo were like hey. This is awesome would you like to make this into a proper first party like title for the Nintendo switch and From it went from there. I guess Then they made it and I just think that's the coolest thing like I Think I could trust Nintendo's judgment so for them to then say yeah, these guys know what they're doing yeah That's a really cool thing. That's a really big win for them Absolutely we're just muddling through ha ha actually sniffing Yeah, I think they've done an amazing game with the job raise it really props to this amazing game with the job Okay, all right. I'm trying to concentrate here, so words are gonna get Way if I go, that's if you stop, yes, is that we have to do, yeah, well, I did it were not even paying attendees You're watching master class at action here yeah here to pick a favorite shape what would it be? I'm quite fond of the rhombus Don't ask me why Legally I'm not allowed to kind of talk about that, but yeah, just know that the rhombus is very close to my heart Yeah, I'm more of a dodecahedron man. Oh, you have to all right just have to warn up me with everything doing here um no Okay, so we gotta spin these oh, we gotta turn each other in the cogs into one come into a box Professor X I am Weapon X Okay, so you climb the walls he climbing up the goddamn walls This is supposed to go. What if you turn the other way ah there we go? That's how it's supposed the thing in the middle is what we're trying to say you need to be one now Yes, I also need to be an X. Oh god How do I do this now with you being the way you are just in general? Hey, oh, you're turning into something that I am not fond we could redo yeah, we should dip You're you're a you're a you're a throwing star okay a pinwheel I'm a pinwheel There you go yeah, that could have gone very wrong very quickly okay So let's turn me into a new shape how how does this happen okay? I should also not be using the reversed edge that I have I Think every edge of you is perfect. Oh No one's ever light, that's you look like a TIE fighter or something yeah No okay, oh alright don't screw this up so me So basically if you get I neither a gap down Yes, keep 10. Oh hang on now. Let me oh shit faster than I anticipated okay now if you move all the way We both need to go down both go okay, didn't you it's in you go, oh? There's no way you can't mess this up that you're right I'll find a way Slam come on More gentle very nice. Yeah, we slammed it. I'm a master high fiver. I know I'm to be gentle I know when to be rough I know when to give you the good stuff you do high-five for a living so I try trust your judgment you should I'm a very trustful person. Oh only non trustful person would say them. Sorry. It's trustful a word Trustworthy trust why they ask the wet hot to reach Hurt to reach is that like hearted -. Oh, it sounds more like the voice mentor when you say it. It sounds like hurt Hurt turi sounds almost like what they're riffing on um alright. What do we need to do with these? Hearts you need to get them in that slot, okay? Okay But we also can't let them go over a gumdrop Mountain over there Is that what we're calling that wait do we have to rescue every only? We'll go. There's a lot to this level okay. You need to be a thing make me a thing Hamid I'm a thing you're real good Look at that XD X alright, so what can I do I can do many I actually do to pick a D So we're XD right I can bring that down and then Yes, we can get this one in fairly easy so oh wait we need to lower the thing Lower the what there's a pink thing on the other side.

Thank you very much game. I appreciate it I feel like we should have got like some sort of medal Commendation really some fireworks. We should have that like knighted All that by the Queen yeah I live in the UK now Do you think she liked me she absolutely will I think you'll have to do your high five?

Yes, so I guess I'll be up there so you need to take your Like that Yeah, why not let's try that up a bit have a bit of a bit maybe Yeah, well let's try that let's see what happens I think that's it I think level complete oh Come on almost look at that Wait, I'm not in the gap Yes Percy horse blowing bubbles out then nice Flexing out bubbles is actually citric acid is actually its babies is giving birth right now. It's a male seahorse Yes, because fun fact the male seahorse in fact gives birth there you go Sometimes I wonder why I'd be like to give birth like a million babies. Okay. We're on a good roll with these let's yeah, that's probably just not let's brush past why I just Was like wait what I realize how also that could be interpreted say never mind Okay, do you want to be a tail or a head?

LIKE A BOSS!!! And High Five all-round!!! (Whoopsh 2x) But, Thank you Guys! And I will See you Dudes , IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!~ (Outros-I'm Everywhere By Teknoaxe) Nice is it louder in person yes, somehow yes 
(Whoopsh~) Top of the morning to ya, laddies, my name is JackSepticEye and welcome to a game called "Symmetry". I don't know anything about this game Absolutely at all whatsoever, it just came up on the top of my steam list Like a new game that just came out and it looks like resource management game like sheltered or Like what are the games..  like "This war of mine", it reminds me a lot of those types of games And it just looked really interesting. I really really liked the art-style and just the concept of being out in space and all that kind of stuff So would you like to start a new game? Yes, please. A planet everybody was afraid of.. Earth [says jack] A mission nobody wanted a signal which lured them Okay, but then why And a landing which triggered a nightmare. This sounds like a bad time, why did any of you do any of this Crew status: John, Anna, Jacob, alive. Rest of crew status unknown. Are these my peeps, are these my dudes? Ooh Okay, all right, umm Okay you actually are gonna give me some tips Thank god. Miner four, your like Hal from "Space Odyssey". Move around the map hold left mouse button and then left or right..[stumble] Use keyboard WS to scroll to zoom in and out, okay. Okay, got it, whoa Jesus Christ Hello my dudes. When zoomed in hover the mouse over characters see available actions by selecting the work icon You will see performance indicators performed by a given character select any job for the character to start performing it Alright, Jesus this is kill?! NO. god calm down [reading options on screen] [still reading options on screen] Electro wast search ? Don't know what I'm doing. Okay. This game is just absolutely like throwing me in there Okay, lumber, ooh Food production or electro waste search, okay, so you guys get lumbering you  guys do that stuff Are you doing it, okay good, Oh God OH it's snowing apparently oh, it's so pretty *admires the pretty snow* Jesus Okay, *jack noise*  drops you in ready to go alright. Let's do this then So this is my base. And zoomed out you can see tags of broken objects the refrigerator in the shelter is broken to fix it hover the mouse over it And select the wrench icon electro waste is needed to repair the equipment. is that- is that this then? There's a lot of these at least you guys are happy Alright yeah, okay, the refrigerator keeps the food fresh so repair object handyman GERD of food production, but I'm gonna get you to do electro waste search right now Can I? I don't know what I'm doing man, but that's fine you can figure it out as we go along What is this? The power plant produces electricity so we're not that boned There is some stuff going on you guys throw-in wood in there. Oh Y'all got little animations and everything Okay, so there's eight in there now, okay good, and you should be electro waste searching, right? Okay good to keep your crew in good health feed them properly and use regenerative capsules The future man ooh. I like this. I like that there's no like real music or anything going on oh When I hover on you you stop, I should guess I should stop doing that you *cute little giggle* you guys are so gonna die cuz I don't know what's going on All right, so you're doing this so this is where electro waste search goes in So I should put you in food production then and that's what goes in here so the zero of 20 food in there now Okay I'm getting it the amount of resources produced or heresit depends on the skill level improving your work efficiency learning new skills is by hovering Your mouse over the book icon and selecting a skill Okay, but does that interrupt what you're doing now cuz she's making a lot of really great food And hopefully you guys are still lumbering used to lumbering Seven eight nine, okay good. Oh, it's nighttime. I Like these games anyway, I like these sort of Resource management gains I'm not good at them I never have been and I never take the time to get good at them because my patients cancer runs out faster but I really liked them and This one's really cool because I like that it's in space okay, you're not the happiest what's going on? Okay, we're get you to learn a new skill Some equipment can be upgraded electro waste is needed for this if Possible the upgrade icon and its cost will appear after hovering the mouse over hardware select ok I don't need to do that yet. Let me just figure out how the hell to even do the game skill development number of food production electro waste search Electro waste search Because I think that's going to be necessary after a while and you're gonna be lumber Yeah, electro waste search I think goes into all of these then So the more electro waste i gather then I can start fixing up all the stuff around me so that's very very important This is a harsh planet.  what you do have to go sit down and do it *a cute jack voice* Ok he's learning.  ok you can just keep going What just happened what is happening? *freaking out* He was glitching out, did you see that? what's going on? Jacob are you a fake boy? Ok you're not happy so go rest ooh is that what these are? Health generation capsule. Oh, maybe that's why maybe you're low on health *le gasp* I- ah that's so weird. that's creepy What the fuck is happening to everything? is that supposed to happen? this shit is freakin out as well, I'm scared Ok that is taking a long time for you to learn. how much food do we have 9 out of 20? What happened What happened you're making sounds, and I don't know what it is something broke Okay, so I need to repair that. shit you need to go some electro waste So things flashing glitch when they're almost broken then yeah, oh god, there's so much to take care of Okay, you go rest as well Jesus Christ Everything's glitching and flashing and being weird at me. I don't like this (its okay bby boy) You're not happy I'm surprised we didn't shatter into pieces when landing no wonder when they gave- give the steers to mind us programmed fools But finally a sight for sore eyes old man. You imagined it well, and you finally got here Okay, so these guys are happier now cuz they're healthier so you need to You need to electro waste search as well. We have a lot of food, or we've a lot of fuel going on I need a lot of electro waste search cuz I need a lot of electro waste cuz I only have 5 and its 9 to even fix this thing. So at least when I zoom out I can actually see what needs to be fixed What are these things? right engine damage left engine damaged? Power supply module damaged okay, I'll figure you out Like much later, please okay, you need to go rest lack of energy power plant broken. Oh shit oh shit, can I even repair you? I need six aww nut sack! Okay, mister, man. Can you go electro waste search then and? You go electro waste search. How much do we have here? 5, okay thats good. Can I speed up time? Okay there we go Let him go! Oh you're far more productive like this. how much food do you have you gotten in you? uh nothing yet. eat. Can you really not eat because there's no power? Landing like that had no right to happen. the last time our fleets Lander crashed 160 years ago They put students in it and ordered them to test the machine. I'm embarrassed. I'll analyze it later now. We've got no We've got to get to work and get everything set up Okay, is that enough? Okay fix that. oh my god. this is- This is difficult. There is a lot of stuff to keep in mind Hmm, at least I have a handy little thing down here so I have.. Oh I have no food. Thats why. Oh shit Make some food, please. yikes! how much did you eat Jacob? Fucking hell *starts singing* We've got John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith his name is my name too. Why is this not coming back on? *stops his beautiful singing* Okay there we go. ran out a number oh Christ oh My god I can eat them. I only have anna left She's eating them I Got a lot of food out of him though Horrible man she's happy all right. Are you able to keep this place running on your own I? Don't know man. Oh, my god. This game is hard. Oh Shit transmitting the signal anyone hear me we're alive. I hope John didn't turn you into fries and you're still in one piece Frickin trash this thing even emitting any radio waves piece of garbage if anyone hears me if anybody hears me And then you know we're okay Yeah, it Jun's dead Madam I've no lumber and she can't even lumber oh fuck Dude it's so bad, and they're dangerously no temperature in the shelter. How do I get that to go back up I? Know I Could be peacefully sitting in the Academy conducting research at a cozy job And no responsibilities that new PhD student would have asked me out, but no daddy had kicked me out here You'll make history you're going to save us. It's gonna save us now lack of energy power plant broken Can I fix you okay fixing fixing doing the fix doing the fixings Are you learning? You're learning how to do the the lumber? Okay? Didn't go lumber because we're all I'm gonna die soon. Oh W&amp;S work as well That's really nice All right, I might need to take another stab at this okay, don't go outside know don't go outside. It's dangerously low temperatures outside That's bad - 68 degrees Celsius Fuckin hell Calm down game would ya? Christ I wish I had better ways of figuring out how well my people are doing. She's doing bad oh she's gonna die. Oh, she's gonna die real quick She's gonna die. Oh, she's gonna die. She's no health left She died Do I just stay here, okay? What a fuck Okay, would you like to certain you again? Yes, okay? Shut up music Okay, like a Desmond Kate and Jacob okay, Jacobs back Like that guy alright everything is calm down. I'm gonna pause. I'm gonna make you go lumber You can be on food production and you can be on electoral waste Okay, everybody go everybody Do your jobs okay have to monitor stuff this time I Actually have to okay I have eight already so we can get the refrigerator up and running so I let these people do these things I'm just gonna let them keep doing them. I'm gonna I wish I had a way of monitoring their health without having to hover over them and even then going in here well maybe there is a way of doing it I Don't know all I know is that you guys are just gonna have to have to deal ooh communications array I Need to monitor their health That's important. Okay. Go away. I know these boys are These boys are tired. They need to go rest. I guess you get more tired if you're out in the wilderness Which to be fair it makes perfect sense then you go eat I'm actually wasting a lot of time by doing that you go eat We have 20 food anyways, so she's not really doing anything right now When your health is back up you can go eat, and then you go back out the fire we have no lumber already Are you serious okay you shoot through that food very fast, can you go eat? You can eat as well actually Are you fucking serious this thing is down already right god? This game is difficult They do not want you progressing at all can't get back to food production You guys devour that food in no time yeah, yeah, I read your stupid thing already And it doesn't even get fixed fast that shit And back up and running Okay, but we're out of stuff we're out of lumber they turn these things off sometimes cuz it's not that cold outside I Don't know if I can turn this off I should be upgrading the objects actually that's a good idea we'll do that next I need to upgrade the heater I Don't like that does I'm hoping it uses energy better It's right now it's not need to monitor the heads I Can now add a space catastrophe to my CV? It wasn't as bad as the simulators and was focused now? I'm doing everything for this first time. I don't want to screw anything up. Yeah, you go girl Okay, you're making food. How do you have any time to be able to? Like go study stuff and get better at things so gonna keep doing this Okay, you need to go back in though cuz you're out in the cold a lot That's you've done here you can go rest How are you doing boy, okay? We're doing better than last time at least right from the get-go You're hungry to go eat cuz we have a lot of food. Oh god. Dude. Please don't die. Please don't die please Don't die okay, are you okay? Okay? Let me pause here for a sec you're going back out to do that You are going back on food production, and you were resting okay? Thank God. He almost died Hey, she's super happy. Why are you not super happy what's going on with you Everything's kind of full dude Dangerously low temperature in the shelter. Yeah, cuz I'm not getting any more lumber cuz everything sucks. Okay fucking power plant is broken Damnit man She can't make any food until that's back up Christ and there's still no temperatures our temperatures are okay? My people are not I'm not doing the best I could be doing a lot better Thing is not good at using fuel What fools for not noticing the planet has been fit for setting for for settling for decades now good one just no and no No research in this area time to roll up recedes get dirty take responsibility for my son Okay, that's cool. I probably shouldn't have this I'd like full speed all the time or double speeds. I guess You're doing okay? You just need some health I? Guess you could eat And then get back out there, we're doing better at least this time last time I guys were already dead so That that's good you're coming back with more of this Okay, it does seem to be using them a small bit better And if I can get 16 if I can get one piece of equipment Upgrade it if we can get one of these upgraded a lot then it Mitigates the need for that so I can start spreading stuff out more if I get my heater Way way way upgraded then it'll use a lot more Or use less lumber a lot more efficiently but I need Like 16 to be able to do that only have three and this thing's gonna break again in a minute oh God you have to go all the way over here for it now Please be okay. Please be okay. Don't like this place. It's full of electronic garbage. Do you want to use for repairing the transporter? Someone had to produce this and leave it behind strange. Let's do what we need to do do her off, and I think whatever You never have anything good to say Dangerously low temperature outside, so I probably shouldn't send you out again Are you are you full okay um? so go learn how to lumber better and do you Go no no no no no no no did. I just ruin that? Okay, you are going actually oh My god. No. There's dangerously no shelter or temperature in the shelter fuck me Did you burn through the lumber so quick yeah piece of shit You need to eat. This is so bad This is so so bad Could then could the day roll over quickly Never than complaining But Jacob begged me to come here to diagnose the technology for a possible resettlement Conditions were to be no worse than a four star hotel and now Some chaps are telling me to walk around on ice and an uncomfortable suit and pick up sticks Desmond shut up What am I supposed to do what am I supposed to do in this situation? Go get sticks I guess you're ahead no again already. Oh my god Lack of energy power plant broken my Jesus Please don't die out here. Oh God you have to go so far Okay go rest 94¬∞ cells - 96 right now, holy fuck man Please make it please make it please make it please make it. Oh my god. You almost died Go eat something sweet fucking Jesus Okay, it's great. The temperatures are going back. Holy crap man Talk about tricky dicky what the fuck is happening Okay, I'm not reading this anymore. I can't like divulge attention Diverge attention. I think Falls what am I talking about? Okay, go eat. Oh Please respond I swear. I was sure others made it as well. I swear to God. I don't know they vanished disappeared I'm alone hello respond anyone alive Hello, hello oh God you need 70 50 90 oh Man alright temperatures are back to normal huh, it's a nice sunny day out again. I like this part this part is nice Okay, you need a bit of food, and then you're good Actually, I'm gonna get you to study Fuck number one We flew to a planet which is close has a favorable environment and nobody knows it exists fact number two from the beginning Everything was top secret couldn't even tell my mom fact number three. This is a certain smell of a fishy How are you doing go recover At least for a little bit oh my god, this guy has to go so far I feel so bad for him And he's just getting the bare necessities each time I don't even have enough to repair the power plant right now Jesus I Need one more person I need one more person to help with lumber or with electoral waste Electro waste preferably Yeah continue on food This planet is close to just need some finishing touches the agency had to know about it for some time now But why they spent billions on spray space exploration having this beauty under their noses My informants had nothing so it's probably some bigger money or scandal what I? Didn't know where my mouse cursor was there for a second ok and now we're just down to one again so fuck All right, we're doing ok on lumber and apparently temperatures are whatever all cuz I can treat temperatures when the thing is broken What was that what broke Jesus Christ that scared me okay, I need you to go get electro wastes as well Uh-oh I Actually badly need you to go get electro waste now as well poor place is shaken Oh everything's breaking I Need three I need eight fuck's sake no he died Well we're using you as food should have known that that's what the music was oh you're gonna die as well You gonna die before you make it back a hundred percent so close Well I'm gonna use you as food as well, I mean why would I use them as anything else okay now? I need to bring the fucking time down oh You don't even know how to electro waste Well you did her plants broken I Have no food I've just ran out of lumber, and she can't electro waste so Pretty much dead Conditions are killing me and my head hurts like hell. Well. I wonder why If you like something wants to get inside they can't think I'm any other novice. I've got to be tough Something wants to get inside Breathe in breathe out. Well. That's as breath in breath out and get back to work. Oh, there's also look tired I need to be revitalizing the chamber. I'm relieving this planet. I'm showing it the biggest finger ever And well you better show your finger right now cuz you're about to die oh That's cool When you're close to death and delirious and everything you start seeing trees That's kind of cool, I like that Okay, you're actually not doing that badly But you need this... (Jack Sneezing...) (Jack Sneezing) My god.. what the hell is going on you can't even do that because you can't fix the thing there's no power! Okay off you got to go electro waste oh Jesus oh (Jack Sneezing!) Fucking hell oh Maybe I could have used that Somebody footsteps My god I mean I struggle just to even keep the people alive To keep the power-plant going I feel like there's no time outside of that to do anything else maybe I was supposed to talk to that other guy on the radio, and then somebody else would have came in and helped me I Don't know I at least I know the basics of the game Literally my first time playing it so I got a little bit in tight immediately and then tight not so Immediately, so I didn't do that badly, but I'm curious to see Where I'm curious to get more tips and see how this game crumb progressed I I'm kind of like in the mood for it now I kind of want to play more and learn more about it very very hard game I did see on the steam reviews from other people as well saying that it was a very hard game, so I've played a lot of these types of games. This is probably the harshest one. I've played this is just like your dead Bye and it's not even the case of like you're about to die and then You have a way of fixing it and then all of sudden you're back and everything like stuff goes down really quickly I shouldn't have been playing at double speed But it's very hard to monitor things I think they need to update the UI for the game because the game is not finished either I think it's a early access game for now Actually, I should check that out I don't know, but I feel like the UI needs some upgrades because it's very hard to monitor your dudes Especially when you hover over them they stop doing what they're doing so that's hard to keep in mind But I want to try and get better at it. Anyway. Thank you guys I'm apologies. Thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face!! like a boss and high fives all around *WHAPOOSH* Thank you guys. I will see all you dudes IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!~~ (Outros- I'm Everywhere By Teknoaxe) Can't even remember if I said the name of the game when I started the episode symmetry 
*Loud WAPOOSH noise* Top of the mornin' to you laddies! My name is Jacksepticeye, and welcome to a game called Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. A lot of you have probably seen this game already because it's been doing the rounds as one of the ragiest games that people have ever played, and rightly so because it looks ridiculous And I wanted to play it when everyone else was playing it, But apparently you needed to either get a code from the developer Or you needed to get it in some humble- Humble bundle that came out a while ago And I didn't get either so it just finally came out on Steam so now (claps) I get to play it for myself and I've been watching Other people play it just laughing my ass off so if you don't know what it is, a lot of you probably do, but it's from the guy who made QWOP and CLOP and GIRP, did he make that one? I can't remember those really rage inducing games QWOP is one where you have to press weird buttons to make the guy run down the track And that pissed me off after a while so this is the- the same kind of deal. But let's just get in and I'll show you. You play as a dude in *cue silence of confusion* Whaat the fuck... Okay, I've never actually seen the beginning of the game (chuckles) You play as a dude in uh- in this- in a cauldron basically, and you have to get across the environment by using this. *hammer noises* So you, can you can tell how annoying this is going to get oh my god. And I've watched so many people do this That I've always kind of been like, "How does the game control actually?" "What- what way do the controls actually work?" and now I can definitely understand how annoying it is. How the fuck? How do I do this? (chuckles) Okay, and I've made it a point to myself that I'm not gonna rage at this game
(Sure Jack, sure) I'm gonna take it nice and calm. We're just gonna have fun with it It's not gonna piss me off. If it pisses me off then I give up. Oh my god Wait can I just do oh This is so unintuitive (Grunting noise) Okay, so you can push yourself. Push yourself to try harder. This controls FUCKIN' TERRIBLY! Yes! Ah ha ha! I got over it, hey take that Bennett Foddy! I got over-  your shit! Okay. Its gonna take m- Oh whoa what- what- what- It's gonna take me ages to get use to this... I still don't know how the fuck this controls (laughs) Okay go like this Go like go like this Oh my god, what the fuck? Oh no! [Bennett] More intense than starting over if you won an argument with a friend.
 [Jack] Yep, shut up Bennett 
[B] and then later discovered that they just returned to their original [B] Starting over is harder than starting up [B] If you're not ready for that, like if you've already had a bad day [B] Then what you're about to go through might be too much. Feel free to go away and come back [B] I'll be here [J] Hmm, I know  as meme as this game has gotten. [B]Thanks for coming with me on this trip [B] I'll understand if you have to take a break at any point, just find a safe place to stop and quit the game. [J] Solid advice
[B] I'll save your progress always even your mistakes *rave noises brought to you by: Sean* [J] Wait you'll even save my mistakes? Come on, Bennett Nice! Okay so for any of you watching this, this might look like It's not that hard, but good lord. The controls are all over the place *cue singing* this makes no sense Uh oh, uh oh. Ohhh I've done fucked it guys. I'VE DONE FUCKED IT. You're not- No. No, we're not getting mad. We're not getting mad It's just a video game. See that? See that it feels like I'm making the controls go backwards whoa Oh no.. I want to get over I want to get over it with Bennett. He told me that I should get over it with him, so So [J]Yeah baby!
[B] this game is an homage to a free game that came out in 2002 titled sexy hiking

That's what we're trying to do Don't fall back down if you fall back down, I will eat a cheese sandwich Wait, do I go into it or over it? NOOO.
 [B] in a certain way sexy hiking is the perfect embodiment of a B-game [B] It's built almost entirely out of found and recycled parts, and it's one of the most unusual and unfriendly games of its time [Jack] NOOOOOOO! [B] In it, your task is simply to drag yourself, up a mountain with a hammer [B] The act of climbing-
[J] FUCKIN' [B] - in the digital world or in real life, has a certain [J] Nope. No. BENNETT. [J] SHUT UP!

There you go, there you go, oh yes! *angry grunting* NIC- I could have had that I could have had that I could have had it all (references and sings "Rolling in the Deep") Yes get up, get up, NOOOOO I'm not angry.

Oh [Bennett] Anyway when you start sexy hiking you're standing next to this dead tree that blocks the way to the entire rest of [Jack] Fuck you [Bennett] It might take you an hour to get over it *extreme angry noises* *Irish scream* AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH Limits of your reach,[Jack]Bennett! I will find your house and strangle you by the power of Sledgehammer oh I have the power. I was gonna say, but that's just the same same thing again. Okay, okay here we go Here we go and whapoosh, top of the morning My laddies oh fuck you're just gonna bounce yourself back out of here aren't you?

It's just about learning how to walk backwards You know I was when you were a baby and it took you like years to learn how to walk literal years It's like that, but now you have to go backwards Backwards baby backwards cauldron, baby. It's like Million Dollar, Baby Except you're worth about three-fitty oh yes No, grab the edge yeah Turns out my brain does not want to work as fast as my hands do Or my brain is working for yes! [Bennett] Sexy hiking your unyielding And that makes [Jack] this is some sexy hiking. [Bennett] But I'm not sure Jazzro intended to make[Jack] just gonna sit here and listen because if you're talking while I'm talking I'm trying to play [Bennett] The process of building a game about life, [Jack] that's cool. [Bennett] a funny thing happened to me as I was building this man [Jack] you died? [Bennett] I'd have an idea for a new obstacle and build it test it and it would usually turn out to be unreasonably hard [Jack] And the rest of it isn't? [Bennett] and I couldnt bring myself to make it easier It already felt like my inability to get past the new obstacle was my fault as a player [Jack] the fuck you talking about? Ever so gently Attaboy [Bennett] when you're building a video game world you're building with ideas and that can be like working with quick-set cement you mold your ideas into a certain shape that can be played with and In the process of playing with them they begin to harden and set until they're immutable like rock And at that point you can't change the world not without breaking it into pieces [Jack] How do I get through this! Bennet Foddy, I will break you into pieces several of them I Know what I have to do have to get up there and Jimmy wedge myself in but I just can't do it Cap'n Get up on that there you go attaboy I'm gonna get up you all. There's oh. Oh there's lights. Oh, there's lights. No. That's not what I want to stick to Yes Oh, it's one of those things that you know it's gonna be hard, but then when you start doing it's so much harder I might want to make fists. I want to start punching children You see what you make me do Bennet funny. You're this is the new Netflix series of making a murderer Just go just go if these fucking slopes Okay grip the rock, grip the Dwayne Johnson! Um probably not gonna be a game that I finish Just say Just sayin now. Can you? Why did you pick a sledge hammer to do this with? literally anything else would have done better oh My god climbing this with your fucking penis would have been would have been better than this do I have any sensitivity Options, I need to change them And it gets to a certain point where you just lose all your patience for this Here we go here. We go you've done this part before you know it's possible. Just do what you did the first time Oh oh man, oh, man You're a funny funny guy, mr. Bennett f- f- fucking funny guy . There we go I Want to cry okay, this mouse sensitivity is not working I feel like someone was murdered to make a game like this possible I Feel like it must be so okay, so i can get to *bunch of loud groaning* I fucking had that you hairy geranium It's why do you push when I make you pull *FOO FOO I've made it a point to myself that I'm not gonna rage at this game This is the worst game mankind has ever created. This is video game torture :( My issue is that I know how to do the things, but it's when you start It's when you start doing that that his hands can go either side So there's no definitive pattern that this can happen when I pull down to go that side. He can go the other way And then that happens Okay, that's what I need to do Yes, yes, that's not that's not a good position to be in okay, okay? Yes     *Flings over rock* NOOOO! NOO! *cries in agony* *Muffled NOOO!* &gt;:O You fuck don't you dare play that sweet sexy jazz at me you know I like it. you did that on purpose. I finally did it man. I Finally had it done. I hope you're bleeding from the fucking rectum [B] Oh no, it happened again. Keep on trying, don't let it get to you. [J] Who hurt you Bennett, who hurt you to make such a fucking game, Aah Ooh Aah No, that's not a good seal, that's not a good seal Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grave ooh. That's a good seal This is very bad, okay, I need to push up like a bra Full off don't fall off push Push like you're pregnant This thing that we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down very panic oh Oh, Uh. This this game is garbage followed by a hint of pubic hair Rumplestiltskin hear some people probably got the controls of this game. Immediately as well, which is fucking That means they're aliens But I- I just I just can't get it I can't get it I- I mean that's the point it's supposed to be obtuse Okay, okay, okay? Oh gosh Oh into the cosmos. We're going there. That's good. That's actually what I wanted Because now you can do Okay, that's not good. That's not what I wanted Oh Bennet Oh, Bennet Fadi How do I oh shit? Yes yes Yes Fuck you. Could you just be regular human? For once yes. Yes, I'm back in the game find back who I already was This is not a good angle Dangle, okay. It's getting a little easier - oh Shit, oh, shit. That's bad. It's getting a little easier to figure out the directional stuff Okay, okay, this one is fucking awkward Cuz it's oh no shit Just for once in your life do something that your father's proud of Fucking JEEEEESUS CHRST You're witnessing me actually mad now Cuz that that's the part that fucks you up It's not they it's not the actual trying to grab this stuff after a while you kind of get how that works But it's when you grab it, and then you're trying to reorient yourself the game purposely is built to make you fuck up Because trying to reorient yourself pushes you back the other direction What fucking way just what way does life work? For me. I want to know what love is. I don't know what's worse the fact that that took me Forever to do or the fact that I'm just now making back up the progress I made ten minutes ago. Oh My god Get up there get up there tight spaces are not your friend be the sledgehammer be the sledge You know you can be Go grab it you had it. It's so fucking annoying sometimes grabbing stuff Actually pulls you and then other times, it's just Okay, maybe if I push myself Sometimes it grabs and pulls you and then other times it just slides along Why can't I just grab it like that wait Why can't I just grab it for the rock? Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? You're up here. I don't know what what this means I? Don't know where we go from here mr.. Cauldron man It went from funny to rage-inducing and now it's back to funny This is ridiculous, I'm a nice happy positive person I Want good things for all people? except the developer of this game Fuck it fuck it fuck it in its ass Dying whale losses I can't get my head around this garbage Fuck off I hate this I fucking hate this hey guys and welcome back to getting over it with Bennett fatty It's a really great game It's my personal game of the year 2017. I I really like it and I I wish great things for people who play it Everybody all involved everybody involved everyone's a beautiful fucking bouncing child Everyone's just fantastic everything in life is going exactly the way I wanted to Why are you coming off the ground I'm not even pressing that part Okay, is there an easier way of doing this that I'm just nah. That's getting Don't fucking look at me like Oh Jack. I played this game, and I passed a no problem. No it gives a shit No, I kept your birthday party for a reason Jess What I fucking pulled down I Did that exactly I knew what I was doing that time for the fucking first time playing this game No stop rising off the ground. Okay, just pull yourself towards it There you go Okay, no no, this is already fine Bad News Bears. Why don't you fucking flick fast enough? Oh? Oh, it's like someone reached into my childhood and punched every good memory. I had Okay, okay. See it's fucking slippy sliding You know what this is a game I was looking forward to I was like oh that'll be a fun youtube series That'll bring the giggles in the laughs nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah Batman. There. You go there You're attaboy Okay, I don't know how the fuck to make you do this better Fucking Predicament just get the hammer around just get the fucking hammer up there you go Yes, yes, okay Easy does it I am pressing all the directions that I need to to actually get up here Okay, okay, okay, okay, just see there This would soon be made out of prefabricated objects Oh store in ass every inch of my ass that hasn't happened one because the objects in the stores are trashed I Don't mean they look bad or that they're badly made you're gladly me Okay Okay, I don't even know why I'm doing this why am I doing this? Why am I over time? We've poured more and more refuse into this vast digital landfill that we call the Internet In now vastly outnumbers in our ways the things that are fresh and untainted and unused When everything around us is cultural trash trash becomes the new medium the lingua franca of the digital age You can build culture out of trash, but only trash culture be games be movies Be music be movie philosophy Ok I have to say if they slide up this, but everything's fucking backwards now ok you know what I'm gonna leave this first episode here because I do not want to do something that I'm gonna regret I if I keep going now, I will commit a murder on camera and That's not something that any of us want because I pretty pretty nice don't want to commit murder Anyway good lord There are some parts of this that make you genuinely upset I mean, that's the point of the game and it makes you shake and I'm one of those people that if a game genuinely makes me angry if it makes me upset if It makes me feel in any sort of way negative I usually just like in anything in life, if if something makes me feel genuinely angry I like to just disassociate myself with it and just go away and come back to it after a while because Anger is not a very good emotion for me. I don't like it. I don't want it in my body Negativity I just want it all flushed out. I want to be happy positive person a 99% of the time I am but every now, and then a 1% comes along and it's like hey I want to feel like shit today, and you know what it's baskin that misery altogether It's kind of it's kind of therapeutic in a way You just get all the yelling out and you get all the frustration out and then after it's like hey You don't feel that bad. I actually feel ok young with me when I'm playing this game Yell with me any of the parts that get angry, or ie start yelling yell with me, and you too will feel great But for now, thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it PUNCH that like button in the face like a BOSS and high fives all round See all you dude in the NEXT VIDEO This is not a safe space anymore you should not be in punching range 
he's accepted a welcome back to everything is not okey-dokey and okey-dokey literature club so I made some mistakes last time completely my own fault when I went into my settings last time I clicked this thing for Skip unseen text that should have been completely obvious when I read it but for some reason I read it as Oh skipper everything bought one scene text that was not the way it was so apologies on that front because they ended up skipping a bunch of stuff that I wasn't supposed to skip so I went back I had to redo a bunch of stuff I had a save from before that I was able to go back to and had to reboot do a bunch of stuff but we're back before a URI and Nats key fight so we're gonna have to redo some of the same sections because the dialogue is not the same and even the developer of the game tweeted at me and said to turn off the Skip tech stuff and he said that some of the stuff today I missed like the story is diverged enough now that any of the text that comes up should be new enough some of it would be the same but a lot if it is going to be new so thank you to him and also it's really cool that he watched my videos and he likes them anything we've played the game so thank you for making the game it's absolutely outstanding but people got annoyed at me last time so I'm gonna try and rectify it because I want to do this series justice because I like it so much and I really believe in this game so we're back after reading everybody's poems for the first time and Urey and that ski should start to fight again and I also turn off the option as you can see because I went back to my history as well there's a history option to be able to go back and read everything but um not it wasn't there their argument and other argument is about they gingerly exchange sheets of paper sharing the respective poems as they read in tandem because last thing they they argued about her boobs being bigger or something like that I can't remember Lansky's eyebrows furrow in frustration meanwhile Yuri smiled sadly what's with this language um did you say something sorry the game is very fucking loud in my ears right now i'ma turn it down a bit here we go turn turn it down just to a doobie do did you say something oh it's nothing let's keep dismissively returns the poem to the desk at one hand I guess you could say it's fancy Thanks yours is cute cute did you completely miss the symbolism or something it's clearly about the feeling of giving up how can that be cute I I know that I just meant the language I guess I was trying to say something nice you mean you have to try that hard to come up with something nice to say thanks but I really didn't come out nice at all um well I do have a couple of suggestions so this stuff seems to be very reminiscent of what they did what he was looking for suggestions I would have asked someone who actually liked it which people did by the way money collected attracted to so based on that I'll gladly give you some suggestions of my own first of all excuse me I appreciate the offer but I've spent a long time establishing my writing style I don't expect it to change anytime soon unless of course I come across something particularly inspiring which I haven't and Jack liked my poem too you know he even told me he was impressed by it that's key suddenly stands up oh I didn't realize he was so invested in trying to impress our new member Yuri but that's not what I'm you you're just Yuri signs up as well maybe you're just jealous that Jack appreciates my advice more than he appreciated yours and how do you know he didn't appreciate my advice more are you that full of yourself I know if I was full of myself I would deliberately go ahead of my way to make everything I do overly cutesy well you know what I wasn't the one whose boobs magically grew a size bigger as soon as Jack started showing up Natsuki Oh say Yuri came in here see or he was supposed to come in here and stop the argument right but now that she's not here at everything gets fucked up so C or E is the key to everything basically without her everything falls apart that's key that's a lil this doesn't involve you taking out you've their insecurities and others like that you really act as young as you look Natsuki me look who's talking you wanna be edgy bitch edgy sorry that my lifestyle is too much for someone of your mentor for your own mental age to comprehend see just saying that proves my point most people learn to get over themselves after they graduate middle school you know if you want to prove anything then stop harassing others which are sickening attitude you think you can counterbalance your toxic personality just by dressing and acting cute do anything cute about you is how hard you try look be carefully you might cut yourself from that edge Yuri oh shit oh fuck okay okay I get why missing this is important now cuz I said it already that this music is very loud I'm sorry I I said it already that Yuri probably cuts herself because of her fascination with knives one of her stories talked about knives a bit too much and I said we all had a knife stabbing weirdo trapped inside of us and then when she was at my home she pulled out her sleeve really quickly and then one of the poems talked about covering up with new sleeves so now she basically confirms it that you might cut yourself on that edge and before Monica said a line before we found say Yuri hanging Monica had a line saying wow you really left her hanging this morning jack so Monica knew before I actually went to the house oh my bad you already do don't you did you just accuse me of cutting myself the fuck is wrong with your head yeah go on let jack hear everything you really think I'm sure he'd be head over heels for you this yeah suddenly Yuri turns toward me as if she just noticed I was standing here Jack she's just trying to make me look bad oh maybe you you is not the way we thought she was before that's not true she started it oh crap okay so that's of just skips itself anyway but that was the same dialogue as before it was just in black so I can't pick either of these and hey Monica how's it going and then everything resets okay so this stuff I read this is the stuff I actually read we know you didn't mean it I'm sure Netsky and then the day ends the day just magically ended on its own and another section people told me that I missed last name is apparently Yuri's book is very different so I think I'm just going to go straight to that before we start the actual meat of this episode Oh God who the fuck this was not here last time I read this last time nibbles sailcloth blindsight lifeline anon recipe tality faultlessly offered what is up with your mouth what the fuck I don't hate you you're kind of weird I don't hate you either yeah this this over it that was new is the game really that complex you so long anyway this is where she talks about playing piano and I'm fucking worried about skipping dialogue hey yeah your pianos great Monica we love you ride haha love Monica she's the best one it's not listening is she I mean in the club execute the job like in the club and they said that last night alright reading the book again takes a left arm forefinger ah I do the same I'm right arm on the right side of the book that way I turn a page and you resize it under thumb and hiding like this we're hardly even closer it actually kind of distracting me as if it's kind of warm view his face was hidden corner of my vision are you ready to turn the page yeah sorry I think I got distracted for a second by your bleeding eyes from last time although that hasn't happened yet at this point I don't have to be able to keep up with her that's okay you're not as used to reading right but this is all the same am I being tape patient if it takes you a bit longer it's probably the least I could do since you've been so patient with me I'm talking about her breathing here he puts her hand on her chest as if to feel her heartbeat I didn't even notice anyway I'm fine I just need some water alright don't push it up that's a fucking weird face Yuriy stands up and practically rushes out of the classroom what on earth was that about ah so that's what I missed I missed why she left the classroom she was acting a little strange so I also missed some of Monica's poem last time yeah cuz I got to here and I say off meaningless and then I didn't go down at the bottom delete her oh shit uneven thought to myself was like okay I know he skipped dialog and I skip little sections but I can't have missed that much save me at the start and delete her at the end that's awesome so it seems like Monica just talks directly to the player cuz and it seems like Monica wants all the other girls gone so she's messing with your game to make that happen so she's saying that she was she wants to be saved she wants you to herself but she want you to delete the other girls URI maybe Noah creepy Monica sometimes you find yourself in a difficult decision what happens I don't forget to save your game yeah okay and one of the times I went back to save my game recently when I clicked save there was a split frame where Monica showed up before it like when I hit here before it actually went to this Monica was in one of the frames please help me yeah we got to here last time so it was after all this where I where I picked up last time so I found the purse that I missed sorry did I miss the last time but at least we went back and we actually found them they they did shed a lot of light on different things so I'm glad it found them but let's get back to where we were this is where I get left alone Monica so this should be the part where the game just starts to close on its own this is also v definitely red yeah cuz this this is what happens so this is exactly where I left off the last episode so I don't know if picking these even matters anymore oh oh shit okay it matters it just keeps going it just keeps going oh fuck me man hey Horry oh god your eyes are all messed up here hi hi jack I've been waiting for you are you ready to continue reading I brought my best tea today I thought you went home and relieving the club Monica I told you not to ah she really late again and considerate as usual Natsuki excuse me must you always interrupt my conversations with your incessant yelling what are you talking about you say that like I do it on a regular basis or something so now it's starting to mess up my head because I don't know who knows what because we came back one of the days you renew everything that had happened I knew everything but Natsuki had completely forgotten then she got a Photoshop mouse and that certains talk so I don't know what's going on I just wasn't paying attention okay I'm sorry seriously what's gotten into you lately me nothing is it really that bad see it is something I'll get over it it's not even anything noteworthy just been feeling a little on edge lately like the edge of a knife Yuri maybe also you wanted me to try and delete Yuri you her character still there but Monica wanted me to delete her I wonder what would happen if you actually did delete her in that moment fascinating type of game anyway we don't need to talk about it you're definitely gonna be the one to die next you're you're acting so strange well I just felt like I needed to bring it up it's not like I really care or anything oh man and the last one here again well Jack just walked in to wait it's throwing me under the bus not Sookie are you practicing piano again yeah you must have a lot of determination starting this club and still trying to make time for piano well maybe that determination but I guess passion haha maybe I'm not actually practicing piano Yuri maybe I'm actually writing out how to kill you all wait there's a the readme file changed it's a different type of readme file it's a Chrome document wait right way I think it was actually always like that if vote motivates me to work hard for the festival and um right I forgot about that Natsuki we were all talking yesterday on well we decided that we would like to support the festival as well however I understand how you feel about not wanting the club to change I think we all kind of feel that way so as long as we're all working together this club will never become something we don't want um also if you help us out with the festival then I'll buy you a new manga sorry the last part was really funny look but it's some thinking about yesterday a little more hostile than I meant to be I guess I really felt threatened or something I know this is something we're doing together another new member wouldn't hurt as long as they're cool I guess another cool girl would be nice this time we had another girl her name was say Yuri I won't forgot already more importantly would hate to see this event suck just because I just backed out I chose to back out I'm a pro you know so I'm gonna help too oh we make sure a Sun right thank goodness isn't that great Monica oh my god yeah that's wonderful it wouldn't be the same without you Nats key anyway Jack you should check your folder again because I was busy away fucking with your life what do you want to do today I was thinking we could we already have plans today is that so Yuri that's correct Jack is already engaged in a novel that were reading together aren't you glad I've already gotten him into literature Monica I I suppose it was just actually it doesn't matter it really doesn't you guys can do whatever you want oh god she just had a weird expression under yes um thank you for understanding Monica actually I have a request do you mind if I make some tea first no oh Jesus Christ look at the picture oh sorry dad if there's one thing that can make a reading time here any better it's a nice picture of your dead friend ha ha ha not to mention for yourself as well here he stands up and makes her waits at the closet she's not gonna come back with blood tea is she can you hold this for a second sure she hands me the water feature electric kettle this is all the same shorts past me and sets the kettle down the teacher's desk is simply watch her movements that's so unsettling man to my surprise the way she moves really contrasts are speaking mannerisms it made the water pitcher thanks I'll be right back ah wait I'll walk with you that's okay you stay here won't take long pit row 9 Yuri walks to the classroom did you relieve you again no it's not like that this time okay this is different she's just filling up the water pitcher to make tea huh okay sorry for misunderstanding sorry for thinking she was already gone out of your life hahaha ten minutes pass Yuri said it wouldn't take long oh god no I'm bored just waiting here so I decided to go look for her music oh wait I have to okay Yuri's character is still in the game boy this is so cool it's like a fucking detective game see the most logical place for you to be would be the nearest water fountain so we're heading down the hallway what's that noise it's coming from around the corner it sounds like breathing yeah sharp inhale like someone is sucking the air through their teeth are they in pain I reached the corner and peer around it Yuri oh Jesus Christ oh yes don't fucking I can't read that I can't even go back and read the history oh come on game I can't even go back and read that now I'm back thanks for waiting patiently Jack do you like blondie and cut arms fuck man uh yeah anything is fine very well your systems 200 degrees I don't like this what was that all about I didn't even get to read what was going on this is where you guys are gonna have to tell me what the fuck happened I can't even go back into the history and rename this is the same come on game let me read but we were right she does cut herself it was being a good mood nice that's all was i letting show hand you notice I know and pull up your sleeve Yuri pull up your sleeves I know it's behind there here he wasn't kidding I don't even know if I keep over this okay yeah this is the same that sounded a bit different jack have another request do you mind if you sit in the for today yeah cuz you're bad back cuz you got massive boobs what a way that is it's mostly because of my crippling depression your posture right the hunched over maybe the maybe it's talking about her arm I don't know how that would fit into her arm stuff though go ahead and get the book oh yeah this is where I fed her chocolates really fucking weirdly sorry I'm skipping a lot of this I just want to get to the meat I want to get to the good story bits and I need the stuff I know I've read before need to worry about I don't accidentally touch her chest for intense reading expression yeah yeah it's very torch enough to spill the tea on your crotch are you sure well if I touch it then I might get smudges on the pages I your I didn't even think about that my bad no need to apologize to her face just change I'll hold the book okay are you sure of course I'm FEG sweet chocolates you you also the reason I thought you you sounded like milk is because I somebody sent me you who a picture of you who which is like flavored milk drink thing right and I thought that that was it I was like oh maybe that's it but aside it's because of who you who you is milk and Korean so I thought you you like that sounds like milk for some reason that's why in that case you story focus second chocolate County probably in her mouth okay I'm reluctantly pressing this is much slower now this time because I don't want to you're eating chocolate right you're not gonna start to breathe heavy last time you breathe heavily weird shit happened I can't Jack suddenly you ready for sea grass my arm and jerks me to my feet yeah this is different my teacup gets knocked over don't fuck jack my heart my heart won't stop pounding Jack I can't calm down I can't focus anymore can you feel like Jack you already suddenly presses my hand against her chest why is this happening to me I feel like I'm losing my mind I can't I can't make it stop it even makes me not want to read I just want to look at you okay you have been really weird like yonder eats Andheri vibes for me all of a sudden fuck oh Jesus Christ fuck man um it's time to share poems Oh Monica is so gonna wipe you out cuz Monica wants me to herself or at least that's my runnin theory and now all of some ureas like I hate you [Music] let's read URIs let's go to her first this you she's any different finally ahaha hurry hold my phone her face and takes a deep breath I love it I love everything about it Jack I'm gonna take this home I want to make sweet love to a check I want to rub your palm all over what do you let me keep it please sure I don't care uh-huh you're too nice to me Jack I've never met anyone as nice as you I could die not really but oh but really I just don't know how to describe it it's okay to be feeling this way right it's not bad right Yuri holds my poem to her chest I'm gonna take this home with me and keep it in my room I hope that makes you feel good when you think about me having it I'll take good care of it I'll even touch myself by reading it over and over I was joking but give myself paper cuts so your skin oil enters my bloodstream ha ha ha you can have my poem too besides after you read it I know you're really gonna want to keep it here take it I can't wait any longer hurry read it Oh for fuck's sake I can't even I can see poster exactly over eight resend I don't know what this is I don't know I said it's covered in blood and tea stains oh it's definitely yours Yuri Oh is there a transcript from this somewhere online excavate Stardust oh it might be just the same poem as last time just scrawled oh god you're closer do you like it I wrote it for you in case you couldn't tell the poem is about is it about C or E more importantly I haven't doubt it with my own scent what scent is that you asked my perfume my sweat my juices see her die the most thoughtful person in the club oh fuck I think I'm going to vomit I want my mom one of the fun I was hoping a version of the poem would go into my files but it hasn't she's still in the game anyway tech I think you saw something earlier that you weren't supposed to see I didn't want you to have to tell you this but I don't think I have a choice it's getting kind of dangerous for you to spend so much time with URI I don't know why but she seems pretty easily excitable when she's around you oh so you're wiping out the girls whenever they show interest in me whenever they actually confess because when say Orry confessed all of a sudden she died now URIs acting weird albeit not as weird to say Yuri was acting it shouldn't be a problem in itself but when you're he gets too excited she finds a place to hide and starts cutting herself with a pocket knife isn't that kind of messed up she brings she even brings a different one to school every day her like she has a collection or something I mean it's definitely not because she's depressed or anything like that I think she just gets some kind of high from it it might even be like a sexual thing but the point is you've kind of been enabling her I'm not saying it's your fault though but I guess that's why I had to explain it all to you so I think if you keep your distance that would probably be the best for her huh while you're at it don't be shy to spend a little more time with me huh just me all alone to put it lightly I at least have it together in the head but I know how to treat my club members with murder anyway I guess we won't worry about your poem Yuri should have at least had the courtesy of letting you finish it sharing it before taking it I am really curious how this would play out if I went to somebody else first and what's your last well whatever what makes her happy I won't stop her that's for mine I worked really really hard on this poem so I hope that's it's a effective here goes oh my fuckin Jesus Christ what the fuck geez that really startled me um oh well I guess I kind of messed that up huh writing this poem are you trying to fucking write code I was just trying it never mind let's just move on you were trying to write code weren't you nothing showed up I'm on to you mo nica okay nuts key the only normal one left hook normal you give your mom to URI cross what is it with you two hmm it's not like I wanted to read it anyway it's just pissing me off a little bit that you didn't even think to show it at me at all okay I guess I'm gonna share my poem with you anyway but he hated that I have to do this but unfortunately I don't have much of a choice just read it carefully okay you can go away I don't know how else to bring this up but there's been something I've been worried about URIs been acting kind of strange lately now they're not even poems others just directly talking to you you've only been here a few days so you may not know what I mean but she's not normally like this she's always been quiet and polite and attentive things like that okay this is really embarrassing but I'm forcing myself to suck it up the truth is I'm really worried about her but if I tried talking to her she'll just get mad at me again I don't know what to do I think you're the only person that she listened to and in Hawaii but please try to do something maybe you can convince her to talk to a therapist I've always wanted to try being try being better friends with URI but it really hurts me to see this happen I know I'm not going to hate I'm going to hate myself later for admitting that but right now I don't care I just feel so helpless so please see if you can do something to help I don't want anything bad to happen to her I'll make you cupcakes if I have to just please try to do something as for Monica I don't know why but she's been really dismissive about this it's like she just wants us to ignore it so I'm mad at her right now and that's why I'm coming to you about this don't let her know I wrote this just pretend like I gave you a really good poem okay I'm counting on you thanks for reading so you didn't even try and read a poem you know something's up with Monica so you're just talking to me directly oh no oh no she found out oh no I changed my mind I'm ignore everything you just read there's no point in trying to hide anything any more stories on fault that she's so unlikable can you hear me jack you would like to just spend more time with Monica all these problems will just go away URI and I are too messed up for someone as wonderful as you just think of Monica from now on just Monica just Monica just Monica just just Monica Oh for fuck's sake team salvo just Monica okay the characters are still there what are you doing Monica can you hear me who's talking to me Oh God Oh God you actually had a voice for the first time wait okay the load files are still there oh [Music] and the can you hear me file is still the same okay I'm on to you okay everyone it's time to figure out the festival preparations let's hurry and get this over with geez it's almost like we did it all before no keeping urea sin immune hood stagnating airs coming for shouting it's common for shadowing and you've already for shout out of what's gonna happen to you knives blew it slices dices opening seven Roger applets that's key I was thinking if you act up I'll fucking kill you I made cupcakes yet that can run the same page just act normal and you'll be fine Yuri well it doesn't matter do whatever you want as long as you think it'll help just know you'll be dead soon I'm not useless you know I know that I already know what I like to do I can't run a successful poetry a it without having the right atmosphere for the occasion so I'm gonna make decorations set up a nice mood lighting there see that's a great idea and that gives us all something to do what about Jack Jack is going to help me wait you you're the easiest job Monica sorry but that's just how it is like hell it is what are you trying to pull I agree with NAT Sookie not only is your work already most suitable for one person but my task is laborious enough to benefit from an extra pair of hands mine too what your cupcakes please like you would fucking know all you care about now is dragging Jack around with you and your stupid books you and Monica hey I didn't even do anything okay then when I die jack the site and who to help instead of abusing your power I'm not abusing my power yes you are Monica just let Jack make the choice okay okay fine fine geez Jack I know how fed up your app needs to buy now we can just not Sookie shut your fucking mouth and just let him decide for himself you shut your mouth Jesus Christ this is never gonna end just make the choice okay whoa if I move the mouse up it moves on its own oh shit oh shit it's like a fake URI oh [Music] Christ oh it's so creepy yeah do you paint me making meat at your house this weekend I promise it'll be fun Sunday okay with you are you fucking kidding me this isn't fair at all it is fair NAT Sookie it's what he chose no it's not fair keeping us all this work and then taking jack for yourself what a shameful thing to do you bitch URI I didn't even give you any work you decided it for yourself I mean I can give you the work of go fucking killing yourself if you want you're being a little unreasonable here I'm being unreasonable hahahahaha Monika I can't believe her delusional and self-important you are pulling jack away from every single thing - every single time you're not included in something are you jealous crazy or maybe you just hate yourself so much you take it out on others here's a suggestion have you considered killing yourself it would be beneficial to your mental health URI you're scaring me a little that's the key let's just go I don't think she wants us around anymore see that wasn't very hard I want to spend a little time with him is that so much to ask URI follows Monika Natsuki the Lord this is so messed up dude hey check here he's really something isn't she Monika giggles as URI pushes her out the door I don't like that she's laughing in the background finally finally this is really all I wanted Jack there's no need to spend the weekend with Monica don't listen to her just come to my house instead the whole day with just the two of us isn't that sound wonderful Wow there's really something wrong with me isn't there but you know what I don't care anymore I've never felt this good in my whole life just being with you is far greater pleasure than anything I could imagine I'm addicted to you Jack feels like I'm gonna die if I'm not breathing the same air as you doesn't it feel nice to have someone care about you so much oh shit there's something else in here now called have a nice weekend oh it doesn't open up with anything its file type is just file so when I click on it it won't let me open it on anything let me see if I can open it with with notepad for opener with notepad just says have a nice weekend and there's just code that code means something that's a cipher or maybe it's just gibberish there has to be something in that okay let me see if I can get the whole thing on screen so somebody can well you guys can't copy paste it that's the whole thing I don't know what that means let's just call have a nice weekend okay to have someone who wants to revolve their entire life around you but it just feels so good then why does it feel more and more like something horrible is about to happen maybe that's why I tried stopping myself at first but the feeling is too strong now I don't care anymore Jack I have to tell you I'm I'm madly in love with you it feels like every inch of my body every drop of blood and me is screaming your name I don't care what the consequences are anymore I don't even care if Monica is listening oh Jesus please Jack just know how much I love you I love you so much that I even touched myself with a pen I stole from you I just want to pull your skin open and crawl inside of you I want you all to myself and I will be only your's listen that sound perfect tell me Jack tell me you want to be my lover do you accept my confession No yeah doesn't matter I don't think it matters oh fuck oh Jesus what the fuck [Music] Jesus Christ man Oh God was that gonna happen no matter what I picked oh that is so fucked up I mean I thought she was gonna die by a knife and calling herself and I thought that Monica was gonna do it but I thought and it's less she was gonna be next but I thought it would happen off screen I think she was just gonna fucking stab herself in front of me or in nowhere does this text actually mean anything is there dialogue in there that I'm just not able to see oh that is messed up dude that really caught me by surprise well I'm traumatized so DLC in there but I think that might just be a coincidence dokie literature club downloadable content Dead loadable content I really wonder what would happen if I tried to load oh shit no not auto this doesn't mean anything to me URI I'm so sorry she was my waifu of course the two girls I kind of thought about between URI and say Yuri both dead Monica you bitch is there a way of getting past this way just keep skipping [Music] no order wasn't it just keeps going [Music] oh fuck welcome to the literature club it's always been a dream of mine to make something special out of the things I love now that you're a club member you can help me make that dream come true in this cute game every day is full of chitchat and fun activities with all of my adorable and unique Club members say Orie you this is the description of the game and of course Monica the leader of the club that's me I'm super excited for you to make friends with everyone and help the literature Club become a more intimate place for all of my members so it's been a dream of mine to make something special out of the things I love now that you're a club member you can help me make that dream come true of course Monica the leader of the club that's me this is it just repeats will you promise to spend the most time with me that just repeats at the end what the fuck do I do what do we do settings can I have an not Monica option [Music] oh god it's just okay okay I think I'm supposed to skip this cuz it just keeps changing oh very uncomfortable Oh God skipping to the end of time apparently why am I just standing here watching this am I supposed to load a different save or something or go back or go through the menu this is really unsettling I don't know what I'm supposed to do man okay let's save here God fuck this game completely messes with you and that's a load game oh my god I can't load any other files all that's so fucking awesome that's exactly what I was hoping would happen oh you can't change it alright now on the have a night all the stuff is gone all the files that were just in my folder the happy thoughts that have a nice weekend all that stuff is gone the only thing that remains is the trace back but URIs character is still here oh wait I tried to read the trace back is that the same okay that's the same wow you got here before me yeah what happened what did you farm it because you saw dead URI I'm here check did something happen that's key just ran past me oh oh well that's a shame wait were you here the entire weekend jack that's what was happening I was here the whole fucking weekend oh geez I didn't realize the script was broken that badly you're literally writing the code of the game you are the game and it's so meta as well because normally these visual novel games or at least these visual novel dating games the whole game and all the ladies react around your character so this is a fun kind of power shift to be like oh you want all the characters to like it's kind of poking fun at how creepy that is that all the characters revolve around your character making the decisions on who you want to be with but this kind of turns it on inside a psyche you know what yeah let's roll with that and let's see where that gets you because that's fucking creepy and weird so now the game is going to be the one in controlling you that is outstanding it must have been pretty boring I'll make it up to you okay just give me a sec oh no fucking way no she deleted both of them they're actually gone not not Sookie I'm almost done I just wanna have a cupcake real quick Monica lists the foil from NAT Sookie's tray and takes a cupcake seriously these are the best I really just had to have one since the last time I'll ever get the chance to you know before they stop existing and everything but anyway I really shouldn't be making you wait any longer spare with me okay you're gonna restart the game aren't you [Music] oh you bitch can you hear me is it working oh fuck yay there you are how you can Jack the fuck are we man welcome to the literature Club what is up with your eyes of course we already know each other because we're in the same class last year and um you know I guess we can just skip over that stuff at this point after all I'm not even talking to that person anymore am i that you in the game whatever you want to call him I'm talking to you jack this is where the game works so fucking well because now if you named the character yourself she's like literally directly talking to you me you so now she's gone beyond the game now that I think about it don't really know anything about the real you in fact I don't even know if you're a boy or a girl well I guess it doesn't really matter wait you do know I'm aware that this is all a game right could it be possible that you didn't know that but doesn't much that doesn't make much sense I even told you right on the game's download page didn't die and that's trippy if only you'd paid a little more attention this would have been a little bit less awkward you know well anyway now that that's out of the way I guess I owe you an explanation but that whole thing with Yuri well I kind of started to mess with her and I guess it just drove her to kill it herself I'm sorry you had to see that though also same thing happened with say Yuri gosh it's been a while since you've heard that name now hasn't it yeah it's because she doesn't exist anymore this is so creepy nobody does I deleted all of their files I was hoping it would be enough for me just to try and make them as unlikable as possible but for some reason nothing weren't well it's true that I made a few mistakes here and there since I'm not very good at making changes to the game but no matter what I did you just kept spending more and more time with them you made them fall in love with you I thought making cieaura more and more depressed would prevent her from confessing to you you asshole and amplify URIs obsessive personality backfire - it just made her force you not to spend time with anyone else and the whole time I barely even got to talk to you good if cool game is this Jackie or all the other girls just programmed to end up confessing to you what I watch from the sidelines it's torture every minute of it when it's not just jealousy jack it's more than that and I don't blame you if you don't fully understand because no matter how kind and thoughtful and considerate you are you will never be able to understand one thing it's the pain of knowing how alone I really am in this world in this game knowing my friends don't even have any free will you're basically flowey from undertale now I wonder yeah all empty what happens if I save there's no point in saving anymore don't worry I'm not going anywhere so can I even go through the main menu I'm wondering if I go to the main menu and try and break the game and if I go to new game and worst of all knowing what's really out there in your world forever out of my reach I'm trapped Jack but now you're here you're real and you're wonderful you're all I need that's why I need you to be here with me forever I'm sorry if it's hard to understand I couldn't understand for a while either why the world around me started to become more and more grey more and more flat even the most expressive bones felt empty to me it wasn't until you arrived that I truly understood you probably saved my life Jack I don't think I could have continued to live in this world if I hadn't met you and as for the others how could I miss the hem so the only two things that exists are me the player and Monica the game basically Monica is the game she's basically made the game to be a thing that's playable but really it's just her and everything that was in it was all fake matrix basically and her knowing trying to write her own code in the game as you went along was basically like knowing that all the character she was creating for all the characters she was influencing just had no free will and that it was so sad lonely because nothing actually existed so she tried to get me the player here on her own at least that's my interpretation a group of autonomous personality is designed to fall in love with you I should have just fucking read this I tried everything I could to prevent them from doing so but it must be some kind of weird inevitability itched into this game I felt really bad so you're the girl who knows everything the poem you told me about man I'd love to read her poems now I felt really bad that you had to witness some nasty things but I realized but you have the same perspective as I do that it's all just some game and then I knew you would get over it so that being said Jack I have a confession to make I'm in love with you you are truly the light in my world when not when there's nothing else in this game for me you were here to make me smile will you make me smile like this every day from now on Jack what do you go out with me oh fuck I'm so happy you really are my everything Jack the funny part is I mean that literally there's nothing left here just the two of us we can be together forever seriously I don't even think time is passing anymore it really is a dream come true I worked so hard for this ending Jack the game wouldn't give me one so I had to make one for myself the script is broken at this point so I don't think anything will get in the way anymore so yeah your game is basically fucked well unless you obviously know how to tweak bits and pieces of it to go back which I'm very very curious of and you wouldn't believe how easy it was to delete and had Sookie and Yuri I mean there's a folder called characters right in the game directory kind of freaked me out how easy it was well you're playing on steam so it was actually a bit more difficult all God to get through the game directory I had to go into the game's properties to find the browse local files button if you could just delete your own existence with the click of a button so this is this is what I'm very curious about and I've been thinking about this for a while is if I went into the characters what happens if I just delete Monica and better yet what happens because the character files let's see the properties of them okay the character files are a hundred and thirty-four kilobytes so they're fairly small so I'm wondering if they have any sort of data in them if they have any sort of information in them what happens if I try and open one up with with notepad let me open up notepad real quick and don't Monica into it so this is what happens if I just dump Monica's character into notepad so this is the text that shows up every time the black text was showing up well not every time but like when yuri killed herself this was the writing that was showing up and i'm wondering if it's an actual like one-to-one if this is all the dialogue that actually showed up then that would be awesome now I'm curious what happens if you open up the other characters character sheets maybe it was Yuri's character sheet that was showing up and because there's some sort of data in them it means that I can't just go in and create a dot chr file to like bring back Nats the key in URI and I'm very curious what happens if you save them off out on to your desktop and then put them back in after she deletes them or what happens if you delete her and delete the trace back that is fucking mind-blowing that is outstanding that is incredible game design because ok I know we're at the end I know I should keep reading this but I'm gonna geek out on game design for a second because most games 90% of games just go by the standard gaming cliches the sender gaming cycles most of them very very good stuff like say uncharted in the last of us it's very it's very it's very narrow it's very drawn in incredible games I love those games and I will put them on some of my favorite games ever but at the same time they're very narrow in their scope of what they do in the games medium they push narrative and lots of different ways and to push visuals and lots of different ways and sound design in some ways and characters and mocap and all that stuff but what they're not pushing is something that's completely unique to games which is this which is breaking that fourth wall and talking directly to the player and okay let's let's let's bring it further I'm gonna geek out on you a little bit more because I love this shit say you have a movie or a comic or something like that like Deadpool say the Deadpool movie he's a character in a comic that knows he's a superhero in a comic he knows he's in the movie he breaks the fourth wall he talks directly to the audience to you and you're probably thinking to yourself well yeah movies do that to Jack but no no because the way he does that is not the same as this she directly deleted something in my computer to come to an ending and I can presumably go in and start deleting stuff back and forth again myself and that's where games are unique because you can technically code in your own story again afterwards and it messes with what this is if you go to a movie that messes with the fourth wall it's kind of the same thing every single time and this this is not some things can change in this and that's what boggles my mind about this but and why I'm talking about this is because the developer had to think of all of that so like broader terms you have to go further than what's just happening right now that is outstanding that's expert game design and on the surface and that it's a shame that not many people might play this and I guess that's the intention because it's supposed to look like a visual novel dating game with sexy young Japanese girls and a lot of people who roll their eyes at the added like I did at first but then they miss all of this and then again it kind of pokes like at the game's design that like Oh something was there that you never knew was there it's so meta it's so awesome and I would save all of this for the end but I probably forget everything that I want to say so I'm just gonna get back to the game sorry Fillie it didn't come to that stage we finally got a good ending gosh I'm so overwhelmed with emotion I want to write a poem about this don't you I wonder if that part of the game still works I guess there's only one way to find out right we have to go oh god now money writing a poem for you they're all versions of Monica and that's why I'm wondering if I went to the main menu with it even let me I'm gonna try [Music] okay I quit the game it's now I'm wondering what happens if I actually get to the menu myself okay it just gets back here that is so fucking weird and I'm not allowed to skip her dialogue either that's creepy is there any history no okay [Music] okay can I just I read this is the one time I want to skip this is one time I've definitely seen all of this stuff okay well just get to this part again oh my god my brains have you seen them I think they might have been blown all over the floor because there was some stuff about this tonight I started to suspect early on and because I knew something was up with the game I didn't know it would go this deep okay let's go back to our poem writing oh look Monica Monica Monica Monica Monica Monica Monica Monica are you Kim Jack did you write a good poem today so this is the literature Club now I'm just stuck here for eternity don't be shy I'd love to see what you wrote that Jack did you write this poem for me it's so sweet of you there really is no end to your thoughtfulness I'm just falling more and more in love with you but you know the poem I wrote is also for you will you please read it happy end pen in hand I find my strength the courage in doubt upon me by my one and only love together let us dismantle this crumbling world and write a novel of our own fantasies with a flick of her pen the loss finds her way in a world of infinite choices behold this special day after all not all good things must come to an end I hope you enjoyed it I always put all my heart into the poems that I write the truth is all the poems I've written have been about my realization or about you that's why I never really wanted to go into detail about them I didn't want to break the fourth wall I guess you could call it I just assumed it would be best to be part of the game like everyone else and this is also playing at the fantasy of like there's a there's a stereotype in a stigma against these types of games that only like nerdy middle-aged neckbeards play like anime visual novel dating games so this is like playing on that stereotype of like oh is this because you want one of those girls to be your real-life girlfriend so this is like oh now you're my real-life coughing because you're talking directly to the players or plays on that aspect of it as well I didn't want to ruin the game or anything you know you might have gotten mad at me maybe even deleted my character file if you prefer playing without me gosh I'm so relieved now we don't need to hide anything anymore are you ready to spend your eternity together check so many things to talk about where do I start it takes me some time to collect my thoughts then I'm sorry but if I'll always have something new to talk about in the meantime we can just look into each other's eyes let's see very uncomfortable Monica very very very uncomfortable is this it is the game just over now is this just where the game ends is this the ending I don't know she's creepy and weird and I don't like okay oh hey are you having a bad day or anything like that sometimes I get frustrated that a normal day can be ruined even by really small things like if you accidentally say something in a conversation that someone doesn't like if you start thinking about how awful a person you used to be five years ago or if you feel worthless for putting off important work and failing to get simple tasks done when you think about all the different people who probably hate you or think you're off-putting I understand those days just remember that the Sun will shine again tomorrow those kinds of things are easy to forget and ignore as they are to remember and besides I don't care how many people might hate you or find you off-putting I think you're wonderful and I will always love you I hope if nothing else that knowing that helps you feel just a tiny bit better about yourself you're having a bad day you can always come to me and I'll talk to you for as long as you need okay [Music] now I just is this just it is there no actual lake stop point Oh God how do you want to open this file can I open up help in google help help me ah okay deleting saved data and accessing files in some cases you may want to delete your save data to start the game completely over to do this navigate to the game folder and delete the name the file named first first run okay the next time you start the game you will be asked to delete your save data it's like yes delete my existing data the game once then start from the beginning so you kind of want to do that to just fuck with to fuck with her but I don't know I can just I guess I just sit and wait for her to do something I really wanted to lead her character I want to start fucking with the game files so I looked it up and apparently this just goes on forever she just loops dialogue for a really really long time so I'm gonna go into Monica that CHR and delete it and see what happens especially when the game is open oh that's fuckin awesome what's happening check what's happening to me it hurts it hurts so much help me Jake please hurry and help me she tried to get herself back ah will Monica does not exist did you do this to me Chuck did you did you to Lake me could you could you do this to me you're all I had left I sacrificed everything for us to be together everything I loved you so much Jack I trusted you do you just want to torture me watch me suffer are you only pretending to be kind just to hurt me even more I never thought anyone could be as horrible as you are you ain't okay you in you killed everybody I hope you're happy there's nothing left now you can stop playing go find some other people to torture Jack you completely truly make me sick goodbye I don't know what happens now do I have to restart the game myself or will it just go back on its own I still love you I can't help it what's wrong with me how horrible am I for you to hate me this much all my friends I did so many awful things so many selfish and disgusting things I shouldn't have done any of this I'm just messing up a world that I don't even belong in well that you wanted to be a part of I'm haunted I ruined everything maybe that's why you deleted me because I destroyed everything that you wanted how could I do that to someone I love that's not love that's that's what I've made up my mind Jack I know I said that I deleted everyone else but it was kind of an exaggeration I couldn't find my stage in myself to do it even though I knew they weren't real they were still my friends and I loved them all and I loved the literature Club I really did love the literature Club that's why I'm going to do this I know it's the only way for everyone to be happy and if I really love you what's happening he wouldn't the characters back then you [Music] thrown back without Monica Oh [Music] what happens when I start a new game now the courtesy or my neighbor and good friends since we were children used to walk school is recently a big habit check you proud me for what you know for waking up on time we never said anything about it even though we walk to school every day well yeah so it's embarrassing to say oh come on please it's good motivation fine fine I'm proud of you say Orry I can't remember if this is new dialog or not across the street together make a right school creasing you specular the students I'm saving the club to join it I think this is what happens [Music] let's see hold the room number in fire okay so I can't even skip the dialogue apparently so you're dejected see or he's always talking about thank you for stopping by it's a pleasure to meet you jack or the literature Club I hope you enjoy your visit come on Yuri don't need to be so formal he's gonna think we're really strict or something sorry NAT Sookie the tall one whose name is apparently Yuri seems to be quite shy compared to the others in comparison the girl named nat Sookie does greater size seems like the assertive one oh look at you guys not dead well you never really died you just got deleted so I don't even know a whole lot about you or your story that's something I need to figure out but say Orry you're alive you're not hanging out of your bedroom rafters somebody pointed out as well that in her room when she's hanging her hands are all blood so it seems like she tried to fight back against something so she didn't want to hang herself oh it's nice to meet both of you I look forward to working with you we're a king check don't tell me you're that's right the club I've decided to join is your say Ari the literature Club I knew it had some twists my armor forced me this time series are you laying up no way no way Sri Ram Jai Ram is Romi jumping up and down hey well if C or E is this happy but I'm sure it won't be so bad to have you around not to mention there's four of us now that means we can become an officially recognized Club I don't know what to say we out celebrate whoo-hoo what an appropriate day for that isn't it yeah after all that's key decided hey don't ruin the surprise sorry haha everyone sit down at the table okay how about I make some tea as well everyone's so nice to each other now no bickering or fighting or anything like that there was a few des arranged a table okay so feel free to take a seat next to zero that's key probably matches back to the table tray in hand oh okay are you ready wow that's keen it's the foil off straight reveal a dozen white fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cat I hope this isn't just a whole new playthrough there has to be there has to be something that's gonna trigger like a Monica thing the whiskers are drawn with icing and little pieces of chocolate were used to make ears so cute wow those look amazing they will you know just hurry and take one see where he grabs one first and I follow that's delicious celery stalks on rod fall and has already managed to get icing on her face I turned the cupcake around my fingers looking for the best angle to take a bite plasticky is quiet I can't help but notice her sneaking guises in my direction is she waiting for me to take a bite I finally bite down the icing speed full of flavor there are those rude Thank You Natsuki but what of course it is I'm a pro after all there's no need to thank me or anything as she struggles to accept the compliment yuria turns the table carrying a tea set jeffrey places tea cup in front of each was you keeps all these in the classroom we've heard this a bunch hey already trainer it's a new member yuri and that's not insulted yuri looks away i meant that you know i believe you well tea and reading movie sometimes versailles everybody i'm glad yuri frankly smiles to herself and relief so Jack what kind of things do you like to read well I don't actually read a lot nuts Keys head perks up because I read manga not much of a reader I guess well I could change what am I saying I spoke without thinking after seeing you smile anyway what about you Yuri what about you three well let's see huge a dream of Zico up this is all the same there has to be something I'm gonna try and get that at least the end of the first day in this one cuz I feel like there has to be something here without Monica hey Yuri hey well about you know the first thing he said manga that's right Natsuki tends to read manga in the club room don't just say it some reason Natsuki seems embarrassed about it is this new besides manga this literature too you know so if Jack wants to read some of my manga don't try to stop him or anything ah does she not have to keep it in de the closet anymore cuz Monica's not here NAT Sookie I wouldn't do such a thing however it could also be nice for us to diversify ourselves a little he can take this opportunity to try something new as well wouldn't you agree Jack but maybe sensing the tension see or he jumps in there she is that's what we needed all those times when everyone decided to kill each other maybe we can all try something new I think it could be fun and we'd all get to know each other a little bit too I mean that's the kind of thing literature clubs do right huh right I don't disagree or anything yeah you're right its usual president oh you're the president now haha guess that means mister try picking up a novel or something huh like a visual novel looks like you're holding hands well that would make two of us what am i doing it if I'm not the only one then as for Yuri ah do you read manga I have to read manga geez you're the one who Jase suggests the way diversify should be a little more open-minded notnot reminded like a cozy little alleyway that's not a way to be it's kind of hurtful hurtful I didn't realize I think of the expression Yuri thinks to herself I'm sorry for disrespecting your interests Natsuki it if you're into it then I'm sure it's a worthy form of literature you're just saying that no I've realized my error so if you're willing to consider starting a novel then I'll offer my gratitude by finding a manga to read as well really but I mean it makes me so happy that you do that for me Yuri you can trust me to find something that you really like okay same here perhaps I'll visit the bookstore after the club meeting just just you uh would you like to come along with me oh if you don't mind oh they're friends now not at all I always go alone so yeah me too this is so cute see Yuri shut up I'll show you some manga there too okay yes I look forward to it let's keen Yuri start to clean up the food ah okay so this is all brand new I guess the meetings over huh yep looks like it this is he everyone getting along isn't it I think everyone likes you too jack I think so well everyone always seems to get along a little better with around juice or say Ori sorry ah Jack let's say something like that is embarrassing yeah well whatever it was brazen you told me you were starting a club I think you're pulling it off just fine we're going to make it the best cop ever now that you joined every day it's gonna be so much fun hey Jack I really want to thank you I mean I'm really happy that you joined the club and everything let's drew these I already knew you were going to yeah that's actually something else I wanna thank you for getting rid of Monica oh shit she knows oh fuck that's right I know everything that she did maybe it's because I'm the president now but I really know everything jack uh-huh I know how hard you tried to make everyone happy I know about all of the awful things I marketed to make everyone really said this is weird Oh know though if you give me the shipper chefs but none of that matters now oh fuck it's just us now okay and you made me the happiest girl in the whole world anyway it's been every day like this with you forever I never oh god she's the new Monica oh no one was bad enough no Jesus F ar e ve o shit dude no way is this Monica hey what's happening I won't let you hurt him holy fuck who it hurts I'm sorry I was wrong there's no happiness here after all goodbye say Ari goodbye jack goodbye literature club what can you hear me whoa hi it's me so you know I've been like practicing piano and stuff and not really any good at it yet like at all you should never get to practice her song [Music] every day I imagine a future where I can be with you so cute but she was crazy [Music] just move your hand right the way into his heart [Music] take just a fine but will it take just to find that special day oh we actually got credits and everything well maybe credits I thought was gonna start scrolling into credits yeah dan salvato you fucking genius that's clever [Music] Oh [Music] this is the chocolate remote [Music] don't either the music too [Music] vocals Gillian Ashcraft yeah there wasn't a whole lot of them that's a weird image they're getting oddly sexual my girls altogether [Music] you always get to see my character [Music] special thanks Monica and Jack that's very clever is it removing the whole game wait I want to I want to check the character no everything still seems the same anyway this is my final goodbye to the literature Club I finally understand the literature Club is truly a place where no happiness can be found to the very end it continued to expose innocent minds to a horrific reality a reality that our world is not designed to comprehend I can't let any of my friends undergo the same hellish epiphany for the time it lasted I want to thank you for making all of my dreams come true for being a friend to all of the club members and most of all thank you for being a part of my literature Club with everlasting love Monica script file is missing or corrupt please reinstall the game and it crashes whoa okay I'm glad I went that way now I'm glad I actually tried to do more there would've been so pissed if I just left it there and then I thought that that was the ending that's a much better ending than the one I got so they get two endings then oh man so say or he came back and everyone was all happy and getting along but because she was the president was she doomed to replay the same fate because she filled that role that the game had for her oh that's so cool man what an outstanding game I mean I said kind of all I needed to say back when I was geeking out over about the game design but really that whole interactive aspect of this game it was so much more than just like reading and listening to characters and understanding their story it went so much further there was twists there was like real shit in there and then you start messing with your game files and it it added so many layers to everything that was going on absolutely outstanding I loved that so much that was an absolute pleasure to play and I'm glad I did because as I said I rolled my eyes the first time I saw because I thought it was again I was the sucker I was that person that it's trying to trick by saying like oh it's just a visual novel and then you play it it's like oh god it's not so much fucking more than that so I can see why people are so enthusiastic about this game and I can definitely see why everyone's like don't spoil it don't don't spoil this for anybody please this is such a unique experience to go through for the first time and even though I was shocked by a whole lot of it I was still waiting for something to happen so by knowing that something was happening happening kind of spoiled me in a small because I kept I kept waiting for her and then when it happened it was like oh there it is I I can't imagine what it's like to play this game completely blind knowing absolutely nothing about it just seeing this game for free on Steam and be like hey I like visual novels and then clicking into the red and playing it and then having it turn into what it is it's just sensational very few games do what this game did and I love it for that it's so good I believe they're all dead well they're not dead but characters are still there I'm just I'm fascinated to see what it would be like if I went back and tried it out and did different things while the game was live like what would happen if I was just at the start of the game just joined the literature Club and as all the characters run screen I just say I delete URI or whatever that would be so weird I might I might do that at some point also I never really got to learn much about NAT Sookie she seemed like a cool character and at the end she seemed like the most nice one say or he was really nice and then she was driven insane and her depression was made worse by Monica and then she hanged herself then URI was very timid and shy but she had a problem with coding and then she ended up stabbing herself but that's key we never got to find out it kind of hinted at that her dad beat her up but I don't know if that was just a case of her dad being strict or if he actually does beat her up I wouldn't be surprised this game kind of pulled no punches when it came to that stuff but I just I'm fascinated by that whole reaching beyond because this is this game doesn't even work on any other platform it doesn't even work on like a Playstation or an Xbox it doesn't work on phones it's a smirk on a Nintendo switch it has to work on PC because of the way it interacts with the folders so cool [Music] just absolutely commendable effort on that I'm so glad that you guys convinced me to play it but it convinced me to play it but said it enough times in the comments that I it perked my interest and then I went off and played it for myself to try and see what it was all about and I'm glad I didn't get stuff spoiled I'm glad I actually got to the end with some surprises left because I don't think I don't think I could have faked reactions to this because it was just so shocking all the time it jumps scared me so many times and this is one of the things that this is a game that uses jump scares incredibly effectively some games overuse them and it's like yeah I get it loud noise boo scared you shocked me but I'm not actually terrified whereas this was like it startled me but it was still like oh now I'm very uneasy because stuff starts happening out of there unexpected it's like you expect all the characters to be nice and normal and talk to each other and fall in love and then it's like oh you're all glitchy weirdos oh you're deleted you stabbed yourself cool so bizarre man okay well I'm gonna leave this series here I don't know how much else there is left to see I have heard a lot of people say that they like theorizing about this game a lot of people saying that oh this is my theory bear what's going on this is my theory it's like I don't know if there's any theories to have it's the type of game that you think lends itself to a lot of theories but Monica basically spells out the entire plot of the game at the end of the first ending she literally tells you exactly what she's doing so it doesn't really leave much up to ambiguity there's a few things here and there that can be left up to interpretation like what the poems actually mean or what they're referring to and that kind of stuff but as far as the overall plot goes I think it was fairly straightforward by the end of it all but I'd love to hear your thoughts on it anyway down in the comments what what you thought of it what was your favorite parent who was your favorite character what you thought was going to happen and then what did actually happen whether you watched this series and saw the game for the first time through me or if you saw it somewhere else or if you played it for yourself for the first time you just love to know your thoughts on it anyway and please I cannot stress it enough again don't spoil this for anyone and I probably should have said this at the very start of the whole series but I didn't know it was going to be this involving or the type of game that it was but if you have any sort of like desire to play this for yourself you really should again stupid saying it now the whole series is over so if you got to this point you're like oh well gee thanks but you can just tell how much the developer worked on this so I just I'm blown away and I want to see more from them and I'm very very happy for them that this game is rating so well because this game has like a 10 out of 10 on Steam right now and that's a very very hard thing to do so compress them how do I want to leave it here thank you guys so much for watching this series if you liked it punch that like button in the face loyd your boys and [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just Monica just Monica just Monica just Monica 
Top of the morning to you laddies! My name is Jacksepticeye, and welcome back to my little slice of heaven. That I also call subnauseous, So, I'm waiting for some water to cook up in here, I have one, um, I also got a salt, don't need the salt right now I have one water and I'm gonna use that--I'm gonna get two, and then go down into there the deep dark deep dark again but until then, I ate a bunch of these, and now I'm all full up of water and everything so I might have to take Some more of them before I go But as long as we're full before we go and then when we head out we actually start using the water and everything and I just Want to make sure Ya, see depth module mark two; all I need is titanium and lithium But for the depth module mark one. Where is it? Depth Cyclops depth--where is it? Depth module mark one. I need-- oh Oh!!! I'm stupid Wait-- Prawn Suit depth module mark two--Lythium and Kyanite... Oh I didn't see that until there. That's for the depth module mark two! What depth module do you have in you.. I'm all conflustered okay, so many things are happening that now I can't even remember What's in my fucking machines Maria (In that deep voice): Welcome aboard, captain. All systems online. What's in this Lucio--fucking frog suit? Open!! I need to take you out To be able to check WHEEEEEEEEEE--PLONK Access upgrade, so have a depth module mark one in you-- NO I FUCKING DON'T I COULD JUST MAKE A DEPTH MODULE MARK ONE!! OH, SLAP MY ASS AND CALL ME JUDY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? There's something seriously going on up in here that I'm not aware of half the time Depth margin mark one nickel or three Ruby - I should have those Ruby - okay, please tell me Evan of nickel or I Just had enough and Then the plasteel ingot and then we're able to go down into the deep dark deep dark down to our deep oh I want to slap myself so silly This is the type of thing as well that this happens in an episode and then everyone's screaming at me that I'm wrong and then it takes like a whole day until I correct myself I apologize everybody It hurts me too. Okay, it hurts me, too When I realized my own stupidity because there's so much going on in the game all the time and there's so many upgrades to try and get know this kind of shit that I Have to say I don't even know what I'm doing There's so many like balls in the air that they all end up dropping instead of just figuring out, which ones. I need okay I need a lot of titanium though Titanium Millennium y'all remember Robbie Williams I'm loving angels instead and through it oh She was me protection Shouldn't be singing with a bad voice Where the rhyme ride or a row okay, I only need lithium then to make this shiz dang You're a major titanium first. Okay, happy titanium is a happy ball You do all that I may actually make it another Power Cell before I go And then you make the titanium then you go over here and you take a little lithium boy and You don't make you take two lithium boys And then you make a sexy little plasteel ingot boy, and then he's going to be really nice And he's gonna play catch with you and everything and he's gonna be your best son so I need to get the I Don't need to do anything what the fuck no get it Lucy, I need the depth module to make the next upgrade for it, but I don't That's where I make my - it's where I make mark one oh Yes, oh oh Maria and pepper Sally, I'm sorry Sally Pap-pap there you go best little tiny submarine girl, but we're gonna have to go on a bigger better journey And you can't go down that far, so he's like Something's like the child She's not growing up yet. She'll grow into a big Maria someday, but right now. She's not growing up Now you can go to 1,300 meters, I could have done that last time But no someone's brain has to be stupid did it get in get in get in get in yeah yeah, baby Yeah, baby. Well at least we got an adventure out of it last time so Piece of advice that I've seen floating around as well is to keep the engine off whenever I'm not using the Cyclops very good advice right now. We're at 27% energy that is shit. That's not enough That's not gonna get me anywhere, and I am starting to think that maybe my perpetual engine machine Isn't actually working the way, I think it is I? Don't think I don't think these power cells are actually doing anything. I'm gonna change you have now 43% Okay, so wait make some more power cell chargers come which were they? Ruby and advanced wiring kits okay pain in my ass, and then it might just make some more Power cells in general. What do they need to make them? Sit a cult rubber word third reactor rods, no weren't there ion power cells that I could make Once I got you ran a night Crystal's couldn't I turn them into that I? Remember there being a stronger Power cell that lasted longer, and then I made a bunch of them I put them in Maria Okay, we're gonna close that on you because your heads gonna get cold okay pop ha um Right I might have to figure that out first first off I just wanna make more power cells already forgot what I told me, but I figure it out. I think we're good to go I'm very unsure, but let's crack this baby. Open oh Yeah, so we're running down in power Freddie damn quickly, so I I don't think that my tactic works anymore I think that was just a cheesy exploit that we could do earlier in the game cuz I'm charging some stuff right now and It doesn't seem to be Getting offset if anything the powers are just draining from charging to power cells driving around and this thing is really efficient as It should be um and we're all stocked up with some stuff like Wait do I have my my ion crystals? That's a thing that I really want to find out I have purple artifacts They have at least one Would like some more Okay, I have to - will do - is enough cuz when I get down here I want to start going into some of the alien bases now that I can actually go down deep I Want to try and head to that thermal plant? That's blood kelp Wait where is it? Oh my god? So then that's where we go down with Maria That's where the blood kelp starts that descent down, and then that's where the actual lava zone is That's so cool the fact that this whole Ecosystem and this whole world exists underneath the world that you're used to in the game cuz this stuff is already scary When you started off this game the fact that you can't really see you What's at the bottom most of the time and then you get down into these zones where? light doesn't even exist It's badass so when I switch out these power cells, I think I'm just actually going to switch them out and leave them out Because I don't think that that's worth it as long as I can get full power cells back in then I should be okay Because I put two new ones in but now they're there already already drained trying to power that fucking thing the charger So the only thing I can think of is to get iron Power Cells, and I don't have the stuff to do that yet but I think Cuz I was like. Oh don't I need you ran a night to do that But no, I think it's I need the the precursors the aliens Technology to be able to do that Because they're the ones that have the eye on stuff Is that our entrance is that what we're going down? Hey reef ease? How you guys doing good? Good okay, I'm a little nervous about bringing Maria down here. She's a hefty beached You never know what's going to happen And I don't know what happens if a war forgets me cuz I don't exactly have speed on my side even With the upgraded like if you go to like three times speed it's still not enough You won't be able to get away from the warper in time oh Yeah, down we go down we go into the depths it's so much scarier to do it in Maria. I don't know, Hawaii Because I can't maneuver her as well, Oh God Fucking music is Terrifying okay, that's the music I thought it was a freaking Reaper all of a sudden. Oh shit If I get warped pray for me Okay, okay, okay, don't go down again for a little bit. Oh god. Oh? God thank god these cameras exists on this. Oh god. I did the wrong thing How do we turn on and off two cameras I? Already am Jesus they do not go far down. Do they there's music school, but it's spooky is all hell I'd hear that. I go like you're draining water out of a sink Okay, where am I going? I don't know where I am I? Mean, I know I'm in the general area think you have to go through there but I don't think Maria's going to be able to fit as easily as I would like and I don't want to start smacking the shit out of her and damaging her and all that kind of stuff so What I'm gonna. Do is leave Maria here She's gonna be my beacon of glory to get back out Are these things cherish it? Okay? They're fully charged So how much power did we actually get? 242 not that bad, and I want to see what happens in when I actually exchange these guys out Okay are some of you empty and the other side Huh two of you are empty god damn well that fucking sucks so we went from 42 to 75 okay great that that's enough power definitely definitely definitely I mean 42% power was enough to get us back out anyway, but It's better to be safe than sorry You know what I mean, so we put Q in there So I'm not taking up any space want to fill up on some food before I go just Plant one of them and then eat the rest because I want to make sure that my water is high I Do have water to come with me but Now we're doing very good, and I'll take two of you wait Yeah, alright pepper. We're going down Thank you Let's fucking do this pep-pep Wait what's the label to actually build the jump jet upgrade last time? I know I just didn't oh That's a bad wow that's a lot of copper ore that's very very useful actually Alright gently does it past all the big giant pieces of gross Titanium is actually very handy right now Because what I can do Copper or what I can do if I have two titanium is build another Locker in my In my seat in my II in my Maria Which is what? I'm gonna do a pepper stay right there It's easier for me to just go do this on my own because then I can start mining stuff And I can bring it all back And I'll actually have room for it because right now my lockers are actually pretty full they don't like that Well, they go we always say like okay. We're heading out. Are we ready let's do this, and then I have to come back, okay? Yeah, it doesn't exactly sit with the rest of them does it What was that? Was that those Dale things oh my god, it sounded like a voice just going oh Really not a fan of that please don't do that again Waste of in the prawn suit as well don't I thought I put in there Everything's all topsy-turvy This area does not look familiar. Oh cuz they came in on the other side oh I was supposed to turn right in then in Moorea oil by Ok that's actually good because now we end up at a Sort of we're supposed to go, so let's go down left down here Now we might have actually avoided the the ghost Leviathan Right this all was he Speed is not your strong suit pepper isn't Wait am I even where I think I am Yeah, there's the coast of ice and off in the distance there I don't know if you can actually see that, but we passed them okay, very very good Do not need to deal with his shit right now There we go a bit of speed Because now we can go down and get the kyanite and if we get kyanite that means I can upgrade all my stuff pretty far And then we can actually get the upgrades to make trips down into here a lot less scary cuz right now They're fucking terrifying. Oh, I actually wanted to go I Am not prepared for this I am not prepared for this at all I need to come back again. I Can survive the heat in pepper, right Hope so I'm not I'm saying I'm not prepared for this because I need to go in there But I forgot to bring the frickin purple artifacts with me Stooop ain't ready for our first trip into the lava zone. Oh Mom And here we are okay this place Can be bad as well because these guys are like sucker faces and they can all crowd around Your your thing and just like stick to the glass of it, and I fucking hate it, okay That's a big deposit of titanium plank get you before you're fucking even coming close Stop going there Here we go crane is facing to fucking dust oh Hey warper like that Right kyanite kyanite keep your eyes peeled for kyanite. That's why we're here It's the only reason we've come down this far, and I can't remember if it's just hanging on the side of the walls or if it's in like large deposits It's not even like limestone chunks or anything it might be in Like that thing of titanium, we just saw We're at 50 degrees Celsius 51 So my little buddy boy would just boil alive down here Oh Spooky okay, what's this over here? I? Don't know is that from the picture kyanite is blue. I Don't think it's you. I think you're just coppery in get out over the mushrooms Yeah, copper Copper still great though There anything is to get the kyanite I actually have to get out of pepper That might be an issue ooh Are we in luck what are you fuckin led? Do I look like a man that needs led, no, I don't is that it They look like resources that I can mine never seen them before But is this the area oh no This is exactly the area. I do not want to be in What if we can hear it are we close enough yet Does war pers everywhere, so there is a big boy. Yes kyanite Okay, I'm just gonna drill this all down, and then hop out and collect it. I can hop out and collect stuff If it's fast. I won't take any damage. Oh, hey warmers This is this the area where the big daddy lives The big the big dragon Really we shared inventory space Caught there's a lot of it just in one clump Good good good. It's a lot for me. It means. I might only have to do this once and then I can go I Do not want to be here any longer than I have to be My god Okay, are you all falling down? Okay? Quickly fuck no wrong one You go there you go, don't kill me don't kill me don't kill me. Don't kill me.

You fucking suck, dude you fucking suck I Was almost out too without any sort of incident oh? man It's good - shit, I mean, it's just I wouldn't know where I didn't even hear him come in or anything It was just like oh hey may I talk to you about warping. It's this fun new activity we all do When we're - bags? I'm fine, okay. I'm over my experience already. I got out. I stole all the copper kyanite and titanium Reason I stole a lot of titanium as well as that it might be useful for actually building the start of a base like down here I Don't know I'm still unsure because I have a lot of materials in Moorea as well that will help me like some glass and some enamel glass Because that is the plan is to make a base down here Because then I can get to certain of some of the areas without having to worry too much Can I can make it a little indoor or grow bed and stuff like that and they can use their The thermal generator to be able to like sustain myself Okay, I'm heading back to Maria and never coming back in and we're going to the to the alien thing the alien place look i'm spider but I'm just swinging through the caverns spider but spider Bot does whatever a spider bot can he swing? Anymore no he can't cuz he's way too fat look out he is spider bot back at last Maria open up wide and Let me in knock knock. It's me Jackaboy, okay close down your head there Very very good okay, very worthwhile adventure very very nice. I liked it I hope you guys did too, but it's not over yet. I need to dump Almost all of this in here well as much as I possibly can actually Here we go losing a crystalline sulfur. I found some of that on the ground I remember what I needed that for back recently. I know I needed it for something but right now. We are taking these you in Take one of these and actually use it because I I sustained some fire damage And take none of you None of you did they have I Have to iron crystals am I blind did I miss it I might have missed it y'all I missed it Okay Pretty nice music very very very somber Rhino fastened a in the prawn suit here's a little pro tip for you aim at the horizon Let it pull you in ruin and then launch yourself Look at all that speed you get So much speed the people are going to be wondering if you are indeed a prawn suit or the flash incarnate Turns out and a bit of both actually and I'm pretty fucking jazzy Okay, grab that Look at us. Look at us fly Lucas Frank now Do you know why the grappling hook attachment is one of the more important ones for this? It's just so handy, it's so nice. I like it. Everybody's having a good time at least I hope so So I brought my purple artifacts, and I brought some of my ion cubes now to go down in here Pretty sure I can enter this one Well ladies we're gonna have to go way deeper into the fucking lava zone And I hate to not want to do that at least not yet Grab nice are you more crystalline sulfur you hair and some Ruby Wait it's even too hot for me, oh wait, I'm right next to a fucking fainting Okay, I was gone for two seconds, but thanks Appreciate you looking out for me. Okay. I'm just gonna grab more rubies and everything I I think I have enough Ruby back at my base To overcome any obstacles that may stand in my way But you can never be too sure That's why Irish men always say to be sure to be sure All right into the bowels of hell we go and do the shit into the shit Guys if you could just let me through That'd be great really not trying to cause a hassle here Okay you think I'm trying to cause a hassle here. See I get weird the most misunderstand II come from fuck fuck I'm gonna get warped I'm gonna get warped. That's gonna happen Did I dodged it. Oh my fucking god Whoa all right in there is where we're going there's a gap in that section see all the bones See all these dead Leviathan skeletons Well the skeletons are not dead the creatures they belong to our okay. Let's not get into the fucking semantics of language, okay? Okay think about this area is that you have no defense against the dark arts. There's no barrier when you enter So you actually have to Either to keep something out or contain it within whatever their intention it clearly Yeah, maybe there's a bit of both, okay? Trevor think about that so in here I have no defense against Walter basically There's no doors or anything so when you're in you're in Insert a purple table' And let's download some data Specimen research data a catalogue of information on the organisms previously contained within the alien facility a number of entries have been translated small herbivore gamma this entry seems to reference the common people shows no immunity to infection death commonly occurs within four days or A couple hours when I get a hold of eggs, I devour them show symptom remission on exposure to enzyme 42 But symptoms quickly recur shows advanced learning behaviors shows some capacity to transmit enzymes to other specimens, okay So maybe this is the research facility then it would make sense that the thermal plant is actually down in the the lava zone. I Don't think I need to talk about more about that. It makes more sense Leviathan embryos I Don't specimen too large to study in containment egg specimens acquired from nesting site Embryo showed no signs of immunity death commonly occurs within three weeks small sample of eggs has been retained for continued high-priority research on Leviathan hatching mechanisms AHA Large carnivore theta off-site lab established history remains show some potential for immunity to infection But physical remains so far proved insufficient for full reconstruction an unidentified Leviathan this Leviathan species has been assigned design designator C Emperor Keep that in mind bone samples from emperor specimens indicate some potential for karai immunity single specimen captured for study at purpose-built containment facility constructed in volcanic region at depth of 1.4 kilometers, so That's endzone. That's the last area in the game to explore Assessment while it is unlikely that the emperor specimen is still contained within the facility described it may be possible to acquire further data there There on the aliens attempt to develop a vaccine Okay, well we know a bit more than that don't we so Those egg specimens will also come in vital so this is like this is the research facility then it's research facility if the thermal plant in the lava castle Oh man, could I not go in here with you, and then we have the containment facility deeper deeper down This is where they were scanning and understanding everything this might be a Leviathan egg a sea dragon egg this large Egg is held in a hermetically sealed environment and has been chemically sterilized without the means and At the facility to house a fully grown sea dragon specimen as possible the aliens sought to study instead the egg liner Okay, this is the reason that's why you saw the alien skeleton Outside or the sea dragon skeleton Okay, now. We're gonna read that one rib cage Display Kate's gonna array of rib cages harvest indigenous life forms. There's particular focus in the instance of vertebrate skies the structures Interesting I am fighting a lack of oxygen here, so I'm gonna keep going down Download data I read that once I am back to a source of oxygen Damage report Leviathan detected at facilities permitir closing at high speed exterior anchor anchor cable impacted with massive force exterior anchor system buckling facility sinking collision with sea floor This is what happened to the whole place breaches detected in containment unit seven Leviathan eggs immediate specimen destruction protocol initiated 314 specimens destroyed one specimen unaccounted for evacuating staff to off-site sanctuaries plant planetary quarantine protocol initiated Infected individuals may not leave the planet so this whole facility was the start of all that So they kept some Leviathan eggs here, and you saw the sea dragon Leviathan outside date So it came in and it impacted the whole place look at this fucking guy It impacted the whole place, that's why that basically kicked off everything The reason we're even here It's going remains a vast predator house within a habitat environment you structures have specimens blah blah Where it shares some skeletal traits with the biter and sand shark? Including its distinctive double eye sockets this fossilized specimen is significantly larger and features unusual Forearms rarely seen in aquatic species the species has likely gone extinct in this past thousand years and evolutionary relatives have evolved almost beyond recognition Big Boi big big big boy Okay, so this. This is the most interesting facility. I think because this is where you start getting all the information you Know the information about how long this place has been here, and how long all these specimens have been here And what they were studying what they were hoping to achieve? And subjected to intensive study So here we go the these are where the war pers our mate or at least where they were studied in manufacturers So there's one of the terms there's a piece of whatever Skeleton the organic parts and display contained DNA from dozens of different organisms largely originating offworld They are in varying states of augmentation with advanced technologies this production line setup suggests these self warping constructs were built Maintained and deployed by the aliens that designed this facility so they're basically guards the war pers They're so goddamn cool, and they're not they're not organic anymore. They're like half organic half machine So for being quarantine enforcer unit that's their full name Be wearing my oxygen this life-form shows signs of heavy genetic modification and extensive mechanical grafting its digestive and pulmonary systems have been replaced by an onboard battery receiving energy directly from the main grid and Distributing it around the body, so they don't even run on like organic matter anymore Miniaturize phase technology has been implanted beneath the skin and is triggered by the central nervous system allowing the construct to teleport at will The brain and central nervous system have been digitally augmented with advanced processing power and remote communications program a little hunter-killer a void Right I want to go back and get some more oxygen so They're designed as bodyguards basically Just in Garrett facilities so if they detect anything in the area They warp it out or they warp it to them and kill them and the warping as you saw did damage to me, so They're not to be fucked around with, they're pretty They're probably the most advanced species in this whole game to the bacterium is being downloaded Caution detecting atypical fluctuations in blood plasma proteins are self scan is strongly advised Selfscan complete Bacterial infection has spread to the skin and pulmonary system Medical report recorded to databank it is imperative you find a way to neutralize the infection Yeah, this is the next piece of the story There it is So now we're fully infected with the disease the karar infection of the quran contagion this terminal contains extensive data Regarding the bacterial contagion identified as kharaa discovery first encounter during routine network expansion on outer worlds Network error resulted in routine quarantine procedure failure contagion was uploaded to and spread quickly through the core world's confirmed deaths 143 billion individuals 143 billion people died from this attaches to healthy living cells and mutates the basic genetic structure gradual immune system failure green skin lesions and flu-like symptoms unpredictable alterations to biological structure and complete shutdown of executive function mercies have taken core worlds quarantined bacterial samples distributed to isolated disease research facility for vaccine development treatment procedure unknown so This is not the only world that has that this is Just one of many worlds that are fighting off this contagion See all the warper parts they're so cool for like Frankenstein monsters throw out put together, and they're shoved full of machinery and Then there they're brought out and they're just Perpetually out there. They never seem to run out of energy because they're running fucking batteries Think that's all we have to see in here because that was the last room So now you know the the basic gist of things you know what's been going on You know kind of some of the story And you can see some of the creatures as I was going around were infected. They were all covered in like green spots It's pretty cool, I like the story to this game Has a lot going on and There's a lot to it And I like that you get a lot of lore through the environment like this like you see the whole place collapse And then you get some of the information about what happened uh oh uh oh uh oh Just missed the warp bubble oh baby. Oh baby piss off go away go away go away go away go away   Okay, he didn't get me so that's why they sound like they're their machines whirring up every time cuz they actually are machines and Their only purpose is to teleport around and find Why am I able to hear him That sound that roar that's the sea That's the sea dragon boy can they hear it from here, that's like way back down in that direction Or is the floor of this place actually the roof of that other place Either way not nice sounds Fuck grab the wall grab, or yes, I can't get up there Don't anybody warp me. I'm a good boy, so this skeleton here this was the Leviathan. That was at the perimeter I'm pretty sure it was anyway You see if I can check its skull to see if there's any sort of like Damage going on Hmm, I don't know if the skull is caved in or if it's just like that I think that the story goes that this is the one that went into the base Slammed into one of the like structural pieces the whole thing collapsed and then power planetary quarantine was initiated Because the disease got out because this is where they were researching all that stuff. I mean the facilities not huge ow sorry But really really interesting This is the type of stuff that they started adding way later in development When they realized that they had like a decent game on their hands Because originally they said that the game was just supposed to be like a demo kind of like a proof-of-concept to show the type of idea that they were going for and then so many people were interested in it and So many people got like the downloaded game and tested I want everything that they actually got their funding to be able to make the game fully So then they turned it into this and they started adding like lots of lots more story elements I'm just so happy that I got made because the story is really cool and my mission Because I haven't built any of the rocket parts yet. I know that I can actually get the materials and build the base But I don't want to build anything yet because I want to make whenever I build it I want to make sure I have all the stuff ready to build there then and there or Maybe just for the sake of celebration we might build one piece of it I don't know, but I can there's like four or five parts of the whole thing So I want to make sure that I have More more ability to be able to build it before I actually go into any of that Because what I have to do is Find a cure because if I you try and take off obviously that System is going to kill me that defense system So I need to make sure that don't happen Back home and safe for another little while Okay what I'm gonna leave this episode of subnautica here. We got a really great amount of progress on there We got to see a lot of cool stuff. We got to go down and Examine some of the research facilities and get all the story information because another reason I wanted to play this From the start again was not only to pick up on any things that they implemented into the earlier game Because my other save I think was way way way later in the game, but I would have missed out on all that I would miss out and all the stuff like The sea Emporer showing up and telepathically like what are you that kind of stuff and some of the other messages? And I wanted to say mainly I wanted to refresh my brain on the story. I forgot to turn the engine off Goddamnit how much energy are you at? 49 Um excuse me excuse me sir, could you get off my shit? Well what's that? Does that make a danger That's pretty cool Oh god it's really close What is that? I don't know, but I also wanted to refresh my brain on the story and I wanted to get the story from the start again and go forward because there was a lot of stuff that I Remembered, but I just wanted to make sure that I was up-to-date on everything and then we all We all got to sharing and the experience together I chose it up here who the fuck is banging outside These are the shitheads okay, Oh God again Fuck off excuse me could you can you all get off my shit you know what you know what? Fuck you Can't even do it this guy come here can't even get close enough Get off my thing It's mine not allowed here, MA Okay, well, thank you guys so much watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face like you boys and See dude, Oh Seek the inside of my ass 
Top of the morning to you laddies my name is jacksepticeye and welcome to the positive mental attitude Septicart event that I was supposed to record a while ago But life gets in the way and things get a bit busy and all this other stuff was going on And I wanted to sit down and record it properly instead of doing like a 10-minute version of it or anything like that So I'm gonna I'm gonna sit down and try and do it now first things first as always I Apologize if I don't show your art in this I I've been seeing a lot of them as I've been going through Just my Social Feeds over the last couple of weeks so the first place I'm gonna go to is Twitter I want to search there. I normally start on tumblr, but you know what let's let's switch it around Septicart Oh the hashtag PMA so that's what I'm going to do here I'm going to be searching hashtag septicart and hashtag PMA at the same time to try and Get both of them in together because otherwise if I just search septicart I'm gonna get some of the ones from the past events so I wanted to try and find these ones Oh my god the first one here. Oh It's me as spider-man Holy crap I didn't see this one before That's so cool God I want to be spider-man so bad. I just want a spider-man outfit I don't even need to be spider-man in a movie although Marvel if you're hiring somebody else with no acting experience your boy But I love that the spray paint in the background says PMA oh So cool a little Sam is a sidekick. That's it. I'm making a superhero thing With me and Sam is my sidekick. That's it. I just have to it's it's inevitable. I'm gonna do it This is so good this comes from small bean Cici Thank you so much. That's awesome woah Holy crap I Thought this was a picture at first until I looked at it more it's all it's like a mosaic my mosaic for jacksepticeye finished always keep your PMA high and your screams higher we love you. Oh, thank you tweets are hard to read when there's hashtags and stuff That's so cool Is this like paper and then the hair is made out of feathers? The PMA is made out of jewels my beard is made out of like little beads And then the the Hat the beanie is made out of like pipe cleaners God you guys are so inventive That's crazy cool. I love that. Thank you so much that comes from Roxy, Paulina. Oh hell Yeah, look at that look how bright and vibrant that is I freaking love it! As I said every single time so far I love like the Colors that are gonna make my eyes just bleed out of my head like as the more neon they get the better I think some of my favorite artistry is like night time neon sign scenes like cities and stuff like that It's just phenomenal but speed is key woosh small jacksepticeye designed by cheap cookies and it's based on subscribe punch ah That's cool. By Sonic speeds so subscribe and punch is a game that some Artists within the communities got together and made around youtubers. It's a youtuber fighting game It looks really cool, and this is one of the designs that cheap cookies made Cheap cookies you've probably seen around before they make a lot of really great art And I've talked to them a little bit here and there and they're really nice But this is really cool. God. I love it. I love the perspective as well There's something very video gaming about it that I really like so Thank You, Samantha ah From at top of the morning they said well I'm really bad at shading and lighting, but it doesn't matter because I have PMA hell yeah That's what it's all about I tried my best. Hey, man. That's all good The fact that you drew anything at all for this means a lot to me So you don't have to be the world's best artist or anything like that oh Look at my cute little hand I'm pointing at PMA Positive mental attitude. This is still the same as from when We did the uh the charity stream so a lot of the names are still on it Oh and people pointed out to me that I missed somebody during the stream named Madelaine So I'm literate your name at the board now, Madelaine they'd also donated a thousand dollars, but I missed it because I was in the middle of Owning in fortnight, so I'm gonna write your name at the board now Madelaine You're on the board. I don't know how visible that is but Thank you for that and also. Thank you for this picture. It's lovely. Oh these move. Whoa I didn't even realize that um So okay, I'm gonna try and pronounce your name you you had a tweet out before Asking people how you pronounce your name. I would pronounce it Kyosheelia, or Kyoshi Leah or something like that close enough I don't know. Uh-huh but they've drawn a lot of art for me before in the past and they were drawing one for like different days as Like a septicart project And this is like a somewhat PMA stuff I worked on. These are really good I really like your style, and this is exactly how I want my hair to look just like the way I want my hair to look all the time is so anime like Like it's an explosion of ice basically that it just goes Shh, but before it gets anywhere. It's just instantly frozen that's all I want my hair to look like so you capture that beautifully ah so zen So peaceful because I have my PMA my positive mental attitude This comes from @sliceofvariety Michaela Meskell And they said a little drawing for Jack made with normal and colored pencils Congrats on 18 million Thank you very very much. This is really nice look how at peace I am and Sam's just staring up at me like I love you dad, ooh Ooh, I like this Updated it's okay to lose control sometimes the most important thing is that you will come back feeling better Yeah Because the whole idea of this event was to use positive mental attitude to try and spread positivity and just get that Because that's like our our motto or mantra for this year I wanted to try and spread it around a bit more, so this was like a good way of trying to spread that too So this is cool though and always about doesn't matter if you lose control It's all about coming back stronger that does definitely fit the PMA mentality But this this is awesome. I really like this I Don't know it's something about it makes him look kind of like a cool anime villain or something Everybody always draws hair so cool This comes from TagasCribbs or TagasC on Twitter, so thank you very much for this I like the popped collar, too. I might just have to to dress up like this at some point cuz it's awesome looking oh Aww, I got a PMA rainbow Haha, I saw somebody mentioned recently. It was like the sweetest thing anyone has ever said about me It was after I did the talk-show interview somebody said that because I was Irish and a leprechaun that the pot of gold They're like what if the pot of gold was actually Jack's heart all along, and I was like oh no That's way too sweet and too kind It reminded me of the the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but this comes from muchos confusos haha What a cool name. this took me so long to do and yet, it's only two seconds. Welcome to animation Hope you like it. Sorry. It's not great. This was my first time trying to animate hey come on You know whatever you do in life. You don't ever have to say sorry for it being like bad You don't have especially if it's your first time trying to do something. I always see people saying sorry It's not that good or sorry. I couldn't donate more or sorry. I can't contribute more, but you're here. You're you're trying You're doing your best and this is your first time doing it And it's so much better than what my first attempts are doing animation would be so be proud of yourself Take in those small victories. I really like it and I like the motif you got going on oh It's like they're the Spongebob meme where it's like wait. What's the what's the original spongebob me? Where's the rainbow? It's like it's fucking nothing or something like that. So thank you very very much. It's lovely ah that's so sweet Art hashtag PMA my friend made this for me because of my love for this community it's awesome very boss like I Agreed that is very boss like I like the love hearts in the background as well You got a good friend to make you this kind of stuff, but I like that Sam is over here And then the rest is just all floral and colorful It's very pretty woo More of that cup head type style or bendy in the ink machine the old animation style just a tiny cartoon green Curtain green boy holding a big ol ink pen X3 is that an emoji that I'm not familiar with it's not much of an animation But I wanted to make it look like the classic retro style I'd say you definitely Succeeded and in the ink I'm writing PMA if you know I look like I'm about to kill someone But I'm just gonna chalk that up to being anti But thank you spunk it Punk That's very very cool. I like the filter you put over it - Very very retro I'd say you nailed the style hey look. It's a little Robbo over get the knife pin and we got the the The we shoe cacti he's going on as well. Oh and my favorite new hoodie the stay weird hoodie odd It's a lovely picture. It's very cute. Look a lil Robo holding on Text message of positive thinking has helped me so much since the beginning of the year, and it's been a very difficult time I hope one day I can thank him, but for now here's a little PM a boyf a nerd well Consider this you thanking me, and I very much appreciate it. That's very very sweet of you, and I'm glad that cuz again as Cliche as it sounds if you're not part of this community. Just throwing around like positive mental attitude sounds like one of those generic things Where you're just trying to sound Positive because there's so many people out there and so many people with influence and so many youtubers and everything Who are talking the talk and? They're just saying all these things to make it sound like they're spreading positivity or trying to make it sound like they're more positive than they actually are and I don't know. I feel like it's kind of Manipulating people in a way, and it's trying to make yourself sound better than you actually are but I'd prefer to walk the walk and being part of the community and trying to actually spread around positivity and doing things like this where you Interact with the community more instead of just throwing out there and saying positive mental attitude Go be happy, but actually trying to put something behind those words And that's what I like about this because it actually helps people being here in this community all together Not just me, but everybody together trying to spread a positive message to each other and whenever anyone's feeling down Everyone's trying to help each other out lately and that's what I really like about this year so far I feel like my own mentality has took a complete 180 turn and I'm feeling way more positive than I've ever felt Doing YouTube, and it's just a great time. Everyone's being so nice to each other all the time, and I love it It's very it's a very good time to be part of this community And I'm so proud of everybody and thank you rhubarb for this picture and for this message as well. It's lovely Thank you so very much Rusty beam Total bromance right here hashtag pmas I accept the guy. It's Chad. It's Chad and chase BFFs forever Yeah, that's cool. I like how you drew him is on he's got a little like a booger dribble going on Chad's shirt That's the thing everyone's wondering we're chases and Snoop is and Auntie is and every got all these other egos no one No one remembers Chad very few people remember Chad oh Poor Chad he'd probably be back at some point. I think he's still in a moving box out in our garage But Thank You rusty beam. I love it. This is a cool one I like this nurse x3 is actually like the new XD am I not getting something is it like just like it like that plus a cat mouse I don't know. I guess that actually makes sense anyway, so I'm learning so much. Hope you liked my little cosplay of Its Schnee + t-nuts nipple Steen He's not he's not all about nipples, but yes. I love it. It's very good And I like this as well because they I know I see a lot of artwork during these things But hopefully this time I can kind of show off different aspects of the community as well Because I know that that was a piece of feedback people were giving me that a lot of what I was showing were just drawings It's just that drawings are the thing that people do the most off So there are the things that fill the tag the most? So I will try and search out other things like this because I like these like the Cosplays and the woodworking that people do when like that other picture the mosaic with the feathers and everything all very unique in their own Regard, you don't just have to draw to be part of these things and that's really love I love how diverse the whole community, so thank you At Mangal HD made a cute Sam buddy to go with the jacksepticeye. Doll. I made sure in the PMA event ah I love the doll and it's on which made a lot of Sam to go along with him But it's super cute look at the little face He's adorable that's a that's a face of mystery and mischief It's like you can't be that cute without something going on in the background and you wrote little PMA and a shirt That's so cute so that comes from Sabrina Martinez or at sapphire stone 33, so thank you very much for that That's adorable quick doodle for a great cause. Oh you drew this during the charity stream as well I Forgot about that that they all kind of go into the same hashtag anyway. That's cool. I like that Look at me. Go I love this backlight backlighting is such a an underrated well underrated It's kind of used everywhere all the time, but I love that and this comes from frosted world Thank You frosted world I love it and you made some very very deep blue white got a flash in with them baby blues Very their hair also reminds me of undertale I think that's always want to remind me of undertale to stay determined AÃ∂Õ†ÕÄÕÑÃòÕöÕàÃ¨ Ã∂ÃøÃîÕùÃÇÕÄÕôÃôÃüÕìÕï ÃµÕÉÕÑÕãÃÑÃûNÃ¥ÕãÃÑÕîÕôÃ†Ãô ÃµÃçÕëÃãÃÑÕÑÃó ÃµÕåÕÇÃêÕÜÃ£Ã¨ÕïÃ≥TÃ∏ÕùÃÅÕùÃ∫ÃπÕöÃ≠Õö Ã∑ÃÖÕõÕÄÃªÃ¨ÃÆ Ã¥ÕòÃΩÃîÕôÕïÃ´ÕîÕúIÃ¥ÃÅÃöÃÉÃôÕôÕà ÃµÕêÃâÕùÃØÃºÃ∫Ã¢ ÃµÕêÃòÃ™Ã±Ã∫SÃ∂ÕåÃ©ÕÖ Ã¥ÃøÃÄÃåÕóÃ≤ÕáÃ†ÃòÃò Ã¥ÃöÕÇÕÜÃ†Ã°ÕáÃ±ÕïEÃ∂ÕóÕùÃøÃèÃ™Ã®ÃØÃªÃ¶ Ã∂ÃøÃçÃèÃçÃäÕâÕâÃòÃ° Ã∑ÕóÃÑÕäÕéÕîÃùÃ¨Ã≤PÃ∑Õ†ÃÅÕÑÃéÃªÕé ÃµÕÑÕëÃîÃÇÃÇÃ≥Ã∫Ã¢TÃ¥ÕÜÃëÕÇÃôÕà Ã∑ÕíÃãÃÜÕòÃåÃùÃº Ã¥ÃäÕúÃùÃ´ÃôÃÆIÃ¥ÃãÃÜÃ∫Ã∫ÃñÃØ Ã¥ÕùÃ§ÕôÃ≤ Ã¥ÃÉÃíÃëÃãÃáÃûÕìÃßÃ¢CÃ∂ÃïÕÑÃÅÕíÕÉÃ¨ÕàÃ†Ã£Ãû Ã∂ÕÇÃÄÕÉÕãÃëÃñÃ∫Ãπ Ã∏ÃîÃÄÃîÕïEÃ∑ÃÇÃ≠ÃØ Ã∏ÃëÃÉÃìÕöÕôÃπÃ≠Ãñ Ã∂ÕÉÃÖÃáÃíÕâÃºYÃ∂ÕÇÃÖÃêÃÅÃ© Ã¥ÕòÕãÃèÃõÕÅÕîÃ®EÃ∏ÕäÕêÃéÃ¨ Be the new one, but thank you very much.

Oh keep it up keep that music going I want to hear more from you in the future that was lovely Oh That was cute. I love this snapchat filter as well. It makes everything look all like Dance video to this song on Friday yes or no I say yes that Was on the 27th, so yeah dance video go do it Dude, don't ask yes or no just do the thing go out there use your use that mentality to do cool stuff And thank you for this that was lovely from Melissa rice And I love that I love that she chose that song as well for this because that is like the ultimate PMA song Because it's all about not really knowing what you're doing but you're still trying your best and you're still trying to do good by people and Even if you get fooled once or fool twice you're still going to carry on And now well I'm still trying to figure all of this stuff out and still trying to work through YouTube and just Adulthood in general as most people are like you're asking What is your life, and I have to ask myself that many times doing these kinds of things This is like how did any of this happen? How do they get to where I am now? So it's lovely, but thank you for this. I love it. Hey jacksepticeye. Here's my PM a Septa card made it for your birthday, but it's so full of PMA that I had to share it again Hope you like it my dude from hana hog I don't want to say Hana hag cuz it makes it sound like I'm calling you a hag Okay, Thank You Hana, I didn't see this My name is jacksepticeye. Can you believe it? We're here again already at another milestone, and I'm so proud of this community everyone involved because I Often say that you can do a lot of good in the world if you really focus your efforts This is a representation of that that in such a short period of time this from the NASA community all came together And while we might not be able to change the world as a whole We might as well try and change our little sliver of the world that we have let's try and put our stamp on the world Thank you fire. We can reach Just because we can't reach the whole world doesn't mean we shouldn't reach Aniyah But it's all of you here in this community that keeps everything going. It's I'm talking to you right now You're the you guys are the 17 million I died I am talking to you right now right here Weird what life's weird but life is fantastic It's no happy birthday jack. Hope you're ready to make 2018 year year keep up the positive mental attitude like a boss Oh Thank You Hannah that was lovely I Mean it was a lot of me, so it sounds weird to say that but you you chose some parts to try and like just keep Keep it positive, which I really really like so thank you very very much And I am ready to make this my year. I've already made the first two months of this year My bitch, I'm ready to do it with the rest of the year got a lot of stuff planned I don't want to I want to keep it going and I want to keep those positive vibes going for the whole year as well And I read you all along with me. It's not just my year. It's our year good we got to grab it by the whole sheets and shake it around get all up in its face a greater aggressive tenacious positive But Thank You Hannah Here is the first ever animation I've made it took me two days to do nothing like making 32 frames only to have a turn out two seconds lock again walk of animation But anyways I hope you like it also try to ignore the stupid watermark of the editing program. I used I Do love it. It's so cute and I mean for your first attempt at animation You got a lot right in that Not only is it adorable and is it lovely, but you actually made it feel like it has weight to it And you use the squish and stretch effect to really great use Like Sam actually feels like it's a physical character. It doesn't feel like it's floating too much which is something that a lot of people make that mistake with their first animation so Really good job that comes from at brinly burns, so thank you very very much for that There's so many like great videos here and edits and everything from people that I really really want to show But they're all using like copyrighted music, and I can't put them in the video And then if I take it out and I put some re We add something else into the Edit and everything it's just not gonna have the same vibe It's like the beats and everything aren't gonna line up, so I'm very very sorry if I haven't shown off your videos I have looked at a bunch of them as I've gone down through here and some of you like it it astonishes me because some of you have really great editing chops and Far greater editing chops than I did when I was just testing out stuff because that was one of the reasons I started doing YouTube in the first place was to just test out how to do editing and how to Put together a video and talk to a camera and talk to a microphone in that kind of stuff I was just fascinated by how the whole process came together so some of you are really good at editing and I'm flattered that you would use that talent to put stuff together for me so keep it up I I really loved seeing that kind of stuff and seeing The kind of really crazy stuff people can put together and I said this to some of my youtuber friends as well that Some of you out There are just really damn good at this stuff From red scarf Robin after working on this for a week and finally finished This is an animatic with my own music in the background Whoa the animatic itself is about community growing through the ages of Jacksepticeye's channel enjoy and here they have like little storyboard pictures of it And some of the frames Okay, let's give a little peek Even got the slash zoom in there Top of the morning to you laddies Tall Oh, it's me changing through the ages.

That's so cute And really cool ideas well to have like To zoom in and see me one way zoom out see the community growing zoom in and then I'm another way and then the community keeps growing - I like that you brought the community into it I Love that thank you so very very much.

I love that good job Thank you so much. Oh Happy Valentine's Day everyone. I drew jacksepticeye with little Sam feeling the love oh We're so full of love and positivity in this picture notice They draws a little heart That's me with my free jumbo Sam plushie for fans only I'm so glad that they disappeared, but now we have a different bot showing up all the time and I keep blocking them every time every time I make a tweet I Click onto it immediately to see if there's any parts replying to it, then I have to block the bots And I don't know if me blocking them blocks it for everybody. I hope it does otherwise It's really annoying, but I'm sorry you guys have to deal with that anyway That's not what this is about this is about positive mental attitude, but this is very very cute I'm still wearing wearing the stay weird shirt. I like it the hoodie Go squishy. We're so before we move off Twitter, and I'm gonna go to tumblr now to try and get some stuff from there but Because Twitter has this Feature where you can just search by like the top ones the latest ones people and you can search photos and videos and everything when you search for photos it shows a big mosaic of everybody together I Don't know the usernames are not on them or anything here, and I'm sorry about that I wish I had like a little icon and the names underneath them So I could see who drew each and every one of these But as you can see some of the ones that I've seen already, and if you just go down through it. You can see Just the level of talent That people in this community have The level of diversity and the different styles that everybody has It's incredible There's so much talent here on this one page right now and so many loving people or the PMA or the SAMS It's so cute you have such a Range of talent as well From people who are just starting out with their first pictures to people who have been drawing for a really long time to Intermediate people as well and everybody in between and it's so nice to see everybody together Drawing stuff and being part of an event like this because that's why I did it in the first place was to get everybody together Doing something together I'm making an event out of it and celebrating the community Know You guys are adorable oh man what's going on here? I Really wish I could get to all of these. I'm so sorry There's so many people here So many wonderful pictures of so many different things oh, it's a little chalk sound with a flower from glorious day. Eh They said there's a wall you can draw on in my toilets So I did this I know it isn't the classiest place to do some septic yard, but when I'm too overwhelmed upset That's where I hide so I thought it would be nice to remind myself to keep a positive mental attitude when I'm in those situations, that's Really really nice And I'm glad you're doing something for yourself as well To kind of help out with those types of things so good on you. Well. It's a lovely picture as well. It's so cute Thank you, very very much woah look at this one This comes from Jack soup dick boob on Tumblr they say it's not the end there's always more joy to be had it may feel like it's the end but all it takes Is a moment of clarity to turn that murmured a moment of turmoil into a moment of enlightenment? Time might reveal more to you after that You might realize that life is worth living it is worth going on and I truly believe that You can get through anything you're going through if you're going through a really hard time. I do believe you can get through it I don't believe that's the be-all and end-all of everything it might not immediately get better and life never does But life is one of those things That's worth fighting for because the great times do come and I really believe there are great times out there for everybody that Everybody has their moment their shining time, and it's not a case of getting that moment and then that's it There's plenty of moments to be had and your moments right around the corner believe that and hang in there And I untrusting yourself to get there I believe in you and I know plenty of others believe in you too So just hold on keep on fighting that good fight If you feel like you're yeah If you feel like you're just stuck in a rut somewhere anything can happen on a day to day basis I could have been stuck in a cabin somewhere, and if I'd never tried YouTube I'd never be here talking to many great people I'd never be having the best time of my life doing what I do weird life's weird But life is fantastic positive mental attitude That's so nice and the pictures going on in the background as well are lovely too We go from space all the way down into Brighton and then into the recording room My contribution to PMAsepticart This is what Jack said during his let's play afar from noise and this paragraph has come to mean a lot to me as has helped me way more to think then I think anyone would believe Jack is my hero and an Inspiration to me, and I want to thank him over and over again for everything he does he is a light in the dark Thank you for everything Jack. I'm so grateful for all you do and I'd spread that positive mental attitude. That is so goddamn, lovely and so goddamn nice I Feel like I don't deserve Such sweet people But man, I I really do appreciate it. Thank you so very very much, and yeah, I do remember saying that that was Again from fire from noise and there was some stuff in that game I'm not gonna get into it that whole let's play is up on the channel if you want to go watch it now boy yeah, that was said there was some moments in that game that kind of hit me harder than I thought they were going to and Thus this came out so thank you for? Immortalizing that in your own way. I love it. Oh this reminds me of my neighbor totoro this comes from eccentric Ella art, and it says there's something cozy about the rain beating down like this I Spent too long on this and I really like how it turned out This is my first ever gift, and I think it turned out super good. It really did it's amazing I know this piece could have turned out better too, but instead of putting myself down I Think about how much this piece is an improvement from my older work because I have that PMA yes exactly Things aren't always about being good Or bad you can always compare yourself to other people and say that what you're making and what you're doing is bad or not good Enough or not as good as somebody else's, but this is very important to realize that it's an improvement over your older work And you know what sometimes the things you make might not be an improvement sometimes you might feel like you're regressing compared to what you did before But if you regress that's just an opportunity to progress again we're not always going to make a Hundred percent progress all the time you can't constantly progress on what you're doing you can try your absolute best but sometimes It's important about just putting things into context, and I really like that you said that as well So good job. I hope everyone reading this has their PMA if you don't maybe you're going through some rough times I want you to know that it can't get better and everyone in this community wants it to get better What a lovely message what a lovely sentiment John? I think when I started watching your videos you would just hit 13 million. I have a bad memory so I might be wrong My brother watched you first and all you were was a shouty Irish man with ear piercing outro I decided to start watching your videos, too And I think I was drawn by the way you really got deep into a game especially undertale the first series I watched of you, and how you explored every inch you could I laughed when you laughed I cried when you cried I also love your Azrael voice and papyrus and sans and undying and every character. You've ever voiced I look forward to the extra minutes at the end of the video where you've just finished the game or something Significant had happened where you just go on and on letting your thoughts spill out into a video it's a nice way of getting to know someone give them something a video game book theory and see how they interpret it I Think I really like the way you think Sean now ice cream along with you to your outro hold down my spacebar Whenever I you think something scary is going to happen and I smile brightly whenever you do And you smile a lot so that means a lot of smiles from everyone so when I think thank most ever I just want to thank most everyone in this community and Sean himself for keeping the PMA this has been eccentric Ella Thank you for reading That's so nice And I really like That you said that specifically because that was always a thing that I liked about Playing games was being able to interpret them and being able to slightly like review them a small bit at the end of each game that I played and Sometimes I felt like I was rambling too much, but I'm really glad that people appreciate that as well Because I feel like if you don't like that stuff You can just click off the video because we're at the end of the series anyway but if you really want to know what I thought about games that you can just kind of hang around and We can all kind of form some opinions together as well, and I also agree that it's a great way to figure out something more about a person's personality how they interpret different pieces of work and Just try and like pick their mind a small bit and sometimes I have very strong opinions about things and sometimes I just kind of ramble a small bit, but yeah, I'm really glad you like that as well I it's one of my favorite things to do at the end of finishing a series, and I'm not gonna stop doing it So thank you this one comes from sip sketches stuff on Tumblr and it's tacky boy man look at him go in varying stances. He's got fire up here on his face He's got green electricity in these ones Sam doesn't have anything sadly Sam Sam doesn't get powers But that's okay sounds powerful enough on their own But I love it It's like people keep drawing jackie-boy man now and like varying degrees of that outfit cuz what I had on was just like the red jumpsuit with a the eye thing Which is super basic, and I really like it because the whole idea of jacket boy man was that he was Like he's taking on a life of his own now, which I love because I basically have my own superhero But when I started off it was to try and make something as ridiculous as possible He's evolved since then because he's not right now He's not really supposed to be as ridiculous as possible But I like that kind of homegrown vibe about him Because what I like is that like when Spiderman started out and he had his own outfit that he made himself And I feel like jackie-boy man's outfit is like one that he just made himself, but it doesn't matter what he wears It's about what's in here and in here that matters? And I like that all of these are like upgrades to the outfit like what would happen later on that he'd start adding like Hockey pads and stuff like that to try and protect himself a bit more to keep his mobility so I love that Some jacksepticeye drawings for the septic air defense this community is one of the most positive and creative ones I've ever been in I look forward to see forward to seeing a chrome continued spread positivity PMA. I look forward to that as well, and we're all in this together, and we're all helping out And we all need to keep this going Because I I can only do so much on my own I can keep promoting positivity and I can keep Trying to set boundaries and telling people like Guiding them certain ways and setting they're telling them what not to do and things like that but it's it's all up to the rest of you to try and take that and to make it a Decent community, and you have done absolutely Amazing so far and I hope that continues because you can't believe eighteen million subscribers deep I'm Ross still this loving and caring so thank you Wow Congratulations on hitting 18 million showing your cheerful and kind personality inspired me to help others keep the PMA up. That's awesome Spread more happiness around I know the septic Garret is around the PM a theme But I know we all have our other side that we hide most of the time But never forget you can find someone to talk to That's a lovely sentiment as well, and it's for the 18 million Milestone, and it's all the egos together Man that's so cool Jeez I don't know who my favorite ego is Because different ones have different And that's something people keep asking me all the time cause different ones have different reasons like different ones to play like doing the anti stuff is obviously very different than doing like chase Brodie kind of stuff and Then doing jackie-boy man is completely different than doing the silent character because the silent character has to be More about expressions rather than both of what they're saying So I love it. I love that there's a big plethora and Rob Zombie I'm still undecided on because that was something that you guys went Like way off with and I had never actually Done anything with that character. It was just a thumbnail, so I don't know if I consider that an ego But if you guys want to keep drawing them as an ego, go ahead. I'm not gonna stop you This this is lovely I love the the variance in colors - oh wow It's a stained glass Treecko Who finally finished my glass window? That's so cool that comes from? that KC Doric So sorry if I pronounce your names wrong. That's so fucking awesome. You did such a good job with it Man I want to try that out I want to learn how to do Stained glass windows well. I say these things and a bunch of people are gonna be like I can teach you It's more a case of like wishful thinking then actually me going out to do it because there's so many other things I want to do what am I gonna find the time to do windows, but man that's impressive. That's a cool talent to have Oh From your main glitch bitch. I know I'm super fucking late to the PMA party, but I still want to share I'm Trying to turn my hobby into money in this community Support with the positive mental attitude has helped me get to the place where I'm starting to make my dream a reality Yes love to hear that I Love hearing people go for the things that they want to go for and making things happen for themselves That's so cool, and they have like a little PMA sticker on their sewing machine Keep it in the day and make it yours That's so cool, and I wish you nothing, but the best with this And I hope you keep it up and just know that sometimes it might seem like Your dream might not become a reality and sometimes It's hard to keep it going and sometimes it may feel like it's easier to give up on it But just keep it going anybody out there Who's trying to follow their dreams and trying to do what they want to do just keep it going? Even if you can't turn it into money, or if you can't make it beyond your hobby Please just keep it going anyway because sometimes it's it's keeping those hobbies and keeping those things that make you happy that keeps you sane And keeps you happy and keeps you content in what you're doing so Just go into it with the the right mindset, and it will always be a fun thing for you to do From ogly network it says snoop Osteen who is definitely on vacation He is percent alive and not dead and or missing smiley face also Please tell him socks and sandals are not hip everything is perfect. Everything is normal. Everything is fine Oh look at him, and he still has this little stethoscope out because you can't leave the job behind But Jess snoopers seen socks the sandals I mean Yeah Not a good combo especially well I feel like socks and sandals are okay, if you're staying away from a beach if you're going to a beach though Maybe take away the sandals or the socks Cuz no, just get rid of both of them your elbows and go around your bare feet. That's all you need from the BP villian Hashtag zero zero two oh Is that is that is that accurate while I'm missing the hair now was that accurate I think so Merch is coming up stay positive. I'm gonna start tumblr because the new month March is coming up I have lived like rubbish just doing nothing for two months of this year But now I'm gonna start everything new I'm gonna get back to the internet make friends draw and upload some stuff Everything about tumblr is new for me, and I'm so excited to get into this place Jack's PMA stuff Helped me a lot to recover from the bad mood. I'm constantly Reminding it. That's awesome. That's Kind of my mentality going into this year in general as well is to make things happen for myself and to just do the things Don't second-guess yourself. Just do them. Just be be positive about them try and keep a good mentality about them as well overcome your obstacles get there I Believe in you you can definitely. It's it's never too late to change things around either You don't need to set an arbitrary date to do these things you can start right now, and I love this This is a really great picture too. So thank you for that. That's awesome whew that's spooky whoa from Panda pup plane Just a teensy nightmare not big giant dreams. We just have little nightmares. This is the eye staring down at me I meet with the doll as the runaway kid the shadow is coming to get me Creepy I like it though doesn't really fit the PMA theme, but I got out of that situation with my doll We we won't talk about what happened afterwards, but that's great. Thank you for the picture anyway. I love it Wha-ho lazy cake 2:52. What a cool style? There's something about the colors that I just fucking love I think it's also the heavy dark outlines that you do I just love dark outlines on pictures oh I hope when I say these things as well that doesn't Put other people down like if you don't use super vibrant colors, or heavy dark outlines. I still love the art This is just the type of style that I wish I could draw myself so to speak But man, that's so cool Just finish this and I know I'm very late to the party you're right on time you're never late You're like Gandalf for the cool party, but I just found the song and it became my favorite song for the week. Oh for the cool Patrol party Okay, yeah Cuz this is me in the outfit that makes a whole lot more sense and that's where the Jacky boy man character technically started But he wasn't Jackie boy man in that that was just the first place I used the outfit I Became my song for the week the hardest part of making this was sticking to the background the first one I made I made, but I'm glad I did because I think it's a good contrast And I think it makes everything super cute anyway. Hope you like it. I do. I love it. It's awesome Thank you very much So cool Wow sparkle shine boy Hey, oh, so I made that back in summer for another septagon event, but it never reached Jack sorry Many of you liked it though, so thank you. I'm pretty sure I'm late for the recent sceptic art event not at all and Jack has already record the video, but anyways. I hope you liked it once more PS Sorry for the quality tumblr destroyed it. Yeah, tumblr destroys the quality of any picture you upload it. Sorry sad It also squashes things down and everything, but that's that's really nice cuz this also kind of fits the theme of the milestone thumbnails that I do every time I do a milestone thumbnail I Used to always put like space in the back I don't know why it just kind of became a theme that I liked doing and then I ran out of pictures of space without repeating myself So this kind of goes along with that which I really like and it's so sparkly and everything blends together so nicely This comes from Iroh Sl6 I seen you in the tiger punch, so thank you for this. This is an insane one I reblog this before because I just had to it was Outrageously good It's from I'm Findlay and it's for subnautica, but it's also like a positive mental attitude thing But just going down through it we start off on like the safe shallows going down to the stalker caves Then you go down into like the grand reef with all these dudes down here and like there What are they called the ghost raids or whatever? Then it goes down even further than sea shredders and the Tree of Life kind of thing I hope you enjoy and love this game as much as I do so it's the message I put in the time capsule as well going down through the water falls into the lava zone, but now I must leave Take care of the planet for me It's so good. I Love it and I love that it's all just one continuous image as well so when you go up through it It's like actually going through the parts of subnautica It's insane I fucking love it. Thank you, I'm friendly The minute I saw it I even liked her scene I was like look at this and she was like wow So cool Cinnamon grump no matter how treacherous things may seem you can still pull through push through and succeed if you have a positive mental attitude Or something like that hey He's like try to push me pussy out of the water. Oh, you're so mean It's all the egos on the boat, and I'm pirate pioneering the SS PMA These guys might all be feeling the dredges of the water well except Jackie boy, man Cuz he's just as positive as I am, but I'm just standing on top of the boat like yes forward no, one's really paddling though except Robby, but What you gonna? Do he's zombie doesn't fucking know what he's doing, but that's really good Let me go from our weird Lisa Positive mental as you. I love this one point pony pony pony pony pony pony boy that's literally what it's like in my head all the time just Bouncing around never sticking to one thought just wherever why do I do? I'm like a dog chasing a ball That's so cute there.

Hey Shawn what you thinking? Oh, you know that PMA? that's sexy PMA, but it's Chris Pratt for the the Pratt mental attitude Somebody did that after I did that video they put it up on tumblr saying Pratt mental attitude Did I say that in the video?

This is my entry entry for the third septic yard event Hope you guys like it. Don't repost or steal very important and sometimes. It's very hard for me to See who's actually taking stuff because sometimes the watermarks are sad to see or hard to see So I'm so sorry if I've ever reblogged or gave attention to somebody's Art that didn't belong to them, and I thought it did that's never ever ever my intention and but thank you op Shalini It's so lovely so soft So precious so magical I am doing the little the little heart This is so cute first time. I saw people do this. I didn't know what it was I thought it was like an inside joke to something But then it wasn't until later on that somebody said can you do the Korean heart with me? When I met them at a convention and they want to do like a picture together like this Okay, I've seen that picture uploaded somewhere, and I can't remember who actually took it. Sorry but this thing then it's like a little love heart if you like cross off from I hear a Little of her so cute, so precious that comes from call me Kiwi Okay, Kiwi. I'll call you that man.

We're over a very sore throat today I don't know. What's the problem? But god this I I need some sort of like Comic or game or book or show or something in these types of styles they're so nice, and I'm like grabbing to hurt It's a very like video game II hurt as well which just immediately makes me think of like Scott Pilgrim Which I know most artists hate that because everyone gets that like you're so your style reminds me of Scott Pilgrim I never was like no But I love it, and this space kind of door in the background as well actually I kinda reminds me of oxen free Rhea is my artwork for a collab called. What is my life JSC collab oh? It's collab which my friend Mimi Which my friend Mimi?

I love it Whoa I wanna dance ha I never once thought that someone would do an interpretive dance - like the song for something like this, that's so creative You're really good - that's from Vanessa is not on fire. Hey guys I wanted to participate in the jacksepticeye ppm aseptic air but sadly I cannot draw see this is why I wanted to do like I wanted to include more stuff like this because Can't draw or write, so this is my way of making air and I agree This is your version of art, and it's your own talent, and it's something that you're really good at as well So I want to try and show that off for these things, too And I don't want to try and make people feel left out, so I'm really glad that you did this I had a little improv session - the Gregory Brothers. New remix of what is my life? I have a longer one, but it didn't feel like confident enough to post it so here's this one. I'm glad you posted this one So do you take like dance lessons or is it all just stuff that you kind of feel? Out and have done yourself over the years, and you're self-taught cuz I want to learn how to dance But I kind of want like to have somebody else to go with me to learn how to do it I want to learn how to do kpop dances - like I want to learn how to do Fire by BTS fire Fighters the positive mental attitude Canon PMA blasters blast away your negativity That's cool. I always imagined Jack What is firing his positivity everywhere and makes everyone happy what a hero oh? That's clever. I'm firing shamrocks out of it as well, and I got my little goggles and Sam sitting on top of it Man, I should get a PMA cannon for the tour and for conventions where agents go poof and confetti comes out of it Never I was like wow positive these These are always so good for mr.. Camila They do these every so often and they have like smaller snippets. This is a bigger one I probably not gonna show the whole thing just so we can get the video moving and we can get more people into the video But the way they put these together is always so good I've done some changes to make the Edit flow a bit better since the last septic art event so drawing and maybe not even air Hey Art is subjective Everything is art, but I love how you're encouraging the community to be creative in their own way I just love that you guys are creative in your own way because this is like all the egos interacting with each other But it's like a little story No not today See if there's anything worthwhile in it or to see if we can get any sort of magic out of this I don't think I have the patience or the time we're gonna learn magic why oh? Come on people oh Oh by the end of this we're gonna be so amazed and a precious Magic tricks, it's so good. It flows so well together It's amazing the things you set down away through all of those to try and put something together out of that It's just so good.

I like it a lot It's like playing like an anime game It's like playing an anime basically, but I just couldn't like put the time into keeping up with it all the time But this is fucking awesome Speed is key. If you haven't played persona. I highly recommend you play Persona 4 is good, but I'd say play persona 4 golden and also play persona 5. They're so goddamn good I love them especially if you're a fan of anime and RPGs it's like the perfect game for that, baby goes on a bit too long but God the style in persona 5 is.

my name is jacksepticeye and welcome back to doki doki literature pub we're certain off the next day exactly where we left off the last episode coming in on mana ken is right here saying and the last one here again don't worry I just walked in to where are you practicing piano again yeah you must have a lot of determination again with the determination you keep saying that or in it no that's actually in the poems that I keep saying that starting this come and now picking a piano maybe not determination but I guess passion remember that the club wouldn't be here if it wasn't for all of you and I'm super happy that you're all willing to help out for the festival - ah I can't wait for the festival it's going to be great weren't you complaining about it just yesterday Natsuki well yeah I'm not talking about our part of the festival but it's a whole day of school where we get to play and eat all kinds of delicious food you sound a bit like say Ari all of a sudden Monica I do usually have fried squid squid that's a pretty specific thing to look forward to come on are you saying you don't like squid you of all people I didn't say I don't like it say is that something on my screen it looks like she is something around her mouth like she's a little bit of food like a little stain around her mouth besides what do you mean by you of all people because it's right in your name Martin Iike that's not how you say my name at all I don't know how she was supposed to be saying that also that joke makes no tresses sense in translation she break it the four of them all again that's cool but never mind let's just focus on our own event for now okay fine fine few reactions earnest fun it's URIs or say or ease anyway excuse me where is se or e anyway oh they're here C or E is sitting at a desk in the corner of the room looking down at nothing I walk over to her they say or eo8 my hand in front of her face hey you're spacing out again ah sorry huh don't mind me you're gonna go talk to everyone else huh is everything all right hey of course yeah why wouldn't it be just feels like you're a little off sorry for assuming things cheese you worry too much about me ha I find C ha ha don't let me distract you from having fun with everyone well alright if you say so I worriedly glance at C or E before turning back toward everyone else the conversation is already dispersed with everyone back at their usual activities maybe I should ask Monica if she's noticing anything about say or e recently since they've been preparing for the festival there must be spending a lot of time together i timidly approached Monica who was shuffling through some papers at her desk Jack what's up hey this might sound a little strange but have you noticed anything I would say or you recently anything up with her in what way do you mean maybe I'm meeting a little too much into it but she seems a bit down class today oh you think so can't say I've noticed anything about her Monica peers across the room I'd say Ari who is idly dragging a rubber eraser up and down her desk maybe there is something on her mind but I'm surprised I'm not the one asking you check you certainly know her a lot better than I do yeah but she's never really liked this she's always talked to me about things that bothered her but this time when I asked her she was really dismissive sorry I know it's not your problem I just wanted to ask if you knew anything so I'll drop it now no no it's important to me too I mean I'm also friends with her and I also care about the well-being of my club members you know maybe I'll try talking to her myself are you sure about that she seemed like she wanted to be left alone are you sure maybe she just has a hard time bringing it up with a person of interest person of interest what do you mean by that I'm saying that maybe the thing on her mind is you jacked me own earth would you come to that conclusion well I probably shouldn't say too much but say Ori talks about you more than anything else you know huh she's been so much happier ever since you joined the club it's like an extra light was turned on inside of her what girls have lights on the inside Oh God but my understanding of human physiology is all over the place no way C or E is always like that she's always been full of sunshine and now they're full of sunshine I need to get my medical book they're not any different now than it always has been you're so funny Jack have you thought that maybe you've always seen her as so cheerful because that's just how she is when she's around you oh god I never thought about that I said too much I'm sorry what do I know anyway I didn't mean to jump to conclusions so you just forget about what I said I'll try to talk to her so try not to think about it for now all right Monica smiles meaningfully I know she said to forget about it but I already know that I won't be able to get her words out of my head Monica sends up from her desk and walks across the room to where C or E is city I watched her kneel down next to say re and gently talk to her she's keeping their voice so quiet I can't hear her from here maasai and sit myself down oh I know she already told me not to worry about her and to have fun with everyone else but that's impossible to do when she's behaving like this exactly how much do I care about her that I'm letting this wait be down so much now it feels like I'm the one behaving out of ordinary there's nothing I can do besides wait for Monica does it feel like I'm being watched I glanced around the room hey I just did that suddenly I noticed you were you peering at me from over her book people really wanted me to stay with URI like really really really wanted me to stay with URI I don't know why but we might have to do that but as I see how I feel in the moment but she looks away just as quickly with a flustered look in her face I realized that she won't get anywhere like this I've never really seen you ready approached anyone or started a conversation of her own accord so I've no choice but to approach her myself by now it's a little easier for me to do that Center from my dad's can sit in one next to her own I didn't mean to bother you or anything relax you didn't even do anything but I could tell you wanted to be alone with your thoughts alone my thoughts how are you even able to tell what I was that I was thinking like that well it's something that I do a lot so it wasn't hard for me to spot based on your posture and expression but not that I was staring or anything I didn't do anything creepy like that 90 case I guess you were right sorry if I caused you any concern you did hurt a hick and concern jack doan apologize your troubles are only the concern of those willing to sharing that concern of course there are certainly those who find the most comfort in keeping to themselves but if you would prefer to share what's on your mind then I would be glad to listen it's really not that big a deal I was just feeling a bit uneasy about say re se re yeah she seems a little off today but when I asked her about it she didn't want to admit it to me so I can't help but wonder if something happened to her oh that's quite romantic alright sorry I didn't need to say something stupid it's not that I just didn't want you to misunderstand C or E and I have been friends for a long time that's all I see then perhaps it is unusual for her to be dismissive to you about her feelings maybe I'm just reading into it a little too much check the world is full of meaning often hidden deep beneath plain sight and there are many untold mysteries behind every person no matter how well you may know them ah I waited getting all deep on me I was just asking about my oh my my my girls yo yo over there you think that there might be something behind it after all oh I smacked oops I smacked my my mixer and I'm afraid that I mess up by mic settings today there's a sound okay I fucking hope so mmm I think that say Ori is a very complex person her mannerisms on the outside don't always match what may be going on inside her head she may not always know what she wants I noticed her strange behavior today too but I also feel some concern for her but in your case it looked like she was fully occupying your thoughts wasn't she well I guess that was the case C or E she really means a lot to You doesn't she uh I guess you don't need to put it that way we're just good friends that's all Yuri suddenly looks deeply into my eyes hey Jack how's it going her expression is gentle and curious if she was searching for something like gal gadot in the Wonder Woman movies Pier Austin if you're Wonder Woman gal gadot playing Wonder Woman in any of the movies I love her as Wonder Woman she's great but notice how many offices she goes like out and watch Wonder Woman i watch after she goes like a puppy try to figure out what's going on embarrassed I avert my gaze sometimes a person's mysteries are untold even to themselves and you as someone honest and caring may uncover feelings you weren't aware were in you that that is I think that she would be a very fortunate person to have you feel that way about her Yuri you're giving me too much credit I'm a pretty simple guy I'm a butt man Yuri that's all it is I should say boobs Yuri's all boobs so I think I'm pretty good at understanding my own feeling singular I'm not nearly as sophisticated as you that's not a compliment is it it is what it is it abs or the dams anyway as long as we're here but always do some reading well as long as you're okay with it yeah she should be taking my mind off this whole thing anyway cut use first someone died okay everyone wait did we do the the feeding sensual chocolates to each other again the whole shoulder robbing me and you you man I hope so cuz it was adorable last time it also got me kinda hot under the collar after some time passes Monica it calls to the club room they don't we share it phones out oh yeah for a Poetry Club before I know it everyone is back to normal everyone goes retrieve their poems and I do the same oh my god I contact with Monica she smiles at me what she was just what she was talking about with say Horry alright let's go what my girl you you again you you first you you waifu that's what i like to call her decided to try something different today oh yeah I forgot I did a I did a mix match and it's a Horry and a yury poem didn't I I did like a half and half or at least I tried I guess so is that good or bad well neither I have my preferences but it would be unfair of me to call something good or bad based on that as always I believe what's most important is exploring and discovering yourself that's comforting kind of afraid of disappointing you in some way or another why me well you're always sophisticated with your writing and have the most advice to share is that so URI thanks for a good hot minute that must be terrible what no for me to have become someone whose opinion is fearsome how unlikable of me you're a sweetheart shook him up don't be saying those things about yourself it's not as bad as you're making it sound in your head just meant that I respect your opinion I see I'm sorry that I always overthinking come to these sorts of conclusions I'm just a little too used to it overthinking being disliked oh that's sad we like uuu we like Yuri very much right you like Yuri right don't don't you're disappointing spider loaf he's gonna be sad if you say no I'm sad that's what Spyder love says all hail spider loaf Yuri what what what am I saying I'm sorry I didn't mean to bring that up let's move on all right you want to share your poem now okay here so somebody pointed out her last poem was it could have been symbolic towards self-harm because she talked about feeding the raccoon so the raccoon is like perverse or like personification of self harm and the more she feeds it the more it comes back kind of thing which is interesting and I'm glad that a lot of people are taking different meanings out of the poetry even when because what I what I'm recording these I don't take like a lot of time to actually sit down and think about what they're writing and I think what the writing is very emblematic of how what type of character they are maybe what's gonna happen with them later on so I don't really have time to sit down and think about it for ages so I'm glad that people in the comments go away and think about it and then write what they feel Beach a Marvel millions of years in the making where the womb of Earth chaotically meets the surface I like that line under a clear blue sky an expanse of bliss but beneath grey rolling clouds and endless enigma the easiest world to get lost in is one where everything can be found one can only build a sandcastle where the sand is wet but where the sand is wet the tide comes will it gently lick at your foundations until you give in or will a sudden wave send you crashing down in the blink of an eye either way the outcome is the same yet we still build sandcastles I stand where they all god-sent where the foam wraps around my ankles where my toes squish into the sand the salty air is therapeutic the breeze is gentle yet powerful I sink my toes into the ultimate boundary line tempted by the foamy tendrils turn back and I abandoned my piece to erode at the shore drift forward and I returned to earth forevermore hmm be curious to see who I am the beach represents toasting in the sand salty salty air therapeutic region I sink my toes into the ultimate boundary line tempted by the foamy tendrils turned back and I abandoned my peace to erode at the shore so her the beaches her peace like her happy place I guess drift forward and I return to Earth forevermore does Earth make you sad I'm aware that the beach is kind of an inane thing to write about but I did my best to take a metaphorical approach to it you say that like you didn't even want to write about it oh you haven't heard after yesterday Natsuki and I well it was amusing that we wrote about something similar in such different ways so that's a key wanted us to write about the same topic as each other again I'm supposed to better compare the differences in our writing styles or thought processes anyway it was her idea knowing her it's no surprise that she wanted to do something like that she probably just wants to show off it's not like I have a particular interest in her writing style I just went with her request but well I suppose it's not so bad to write about something simple on occasion it could be refreshing you know it's good for me to count my thoughts once in a while yeah I think I agree and it works out well because my character technically wrote something different today as well so everybody's trying new things squirt they're trying new stuff put your feet into different shoes and walk a mile in someone else's steps for a day thanks for sharing okay so I have to go to NAT Sookie's then after this just to see what she's writing about yeah no thanks you didn't even next it's fine it's cool do you even want to fucking read your stupid poem anyway nasty your name should be Knotts K you know like that's okay don't you read your fucking home okay Monica let's let's listen yours hi jack have you thought about what you want to submit to perform at the first of all well being in this club is one thing but performing in front of a bunch of people I'll have to give it some more thought okay no pressure but make it awesome whatever you do I'm sure to turn out great just don't embarrass the whole cup in front of everybody Thanks it would also make me happy to see you know if you made something really awesome maybe not the bullshit that you were reading before okay Monica I get it honey let's take a look at today's bullshit I mean Tom sure I don't Monica take the poem I'm holding in my hands I like this one it makes me think of something C or E would like that's also a NFC or e to last because technically I wrote the poem for her today that's so you and say are you're really good friends right I wouldn't be surprised if you had those sorts of things in common oh well we may be good friends but C or E and I are actually really different well that may be the case but maybe there's also some similarities that you wouldn't expect haha anime the way she talks about you it sounds like the two of you would really care about each other's well-being even if you show it in different ways it ends up being more similar than you think so I guess that's the kind of vibe I get when reading your poem say you're he's also entered bullshit huh just like you are hmm you sure you're not reading into it too much huh I could be but it's a fucking literature club Jack I kind of have to read into things all the time it's what we do you don't ask okay Monica Jesus relax oh gosh I sound like Yuri Yuri my wife who would never talk to me like that in any case series writing has a kind of gentle feel to it you know don't like she doesn't know what she's talking about I can tell that she likes exploring with emotions like happiness and say yes who knew that someone so happy you would enjoy sad things too yeah that's totally unexpected it's almost like people's surface emotions aren't the full picture all the time how often do we hear about comedians committing suicide in real life or not even just comedians but like people who always seem so happy in interviews like especially celebrities whenever you hear one of them committed suicide it's like what they seemed like they had everything together they seemed like everything was fine it's not always the case and you shouldn't be afraid to experiment a little bit either anyway I'll share my poem with you now all right just try to understand it I know you like to write shit and you're stupid and everything but sometimes maybe I can teach you all right perfectly the lady who knows everything aka Monica an old tale tells of a lady who wanders earth the lady who knows everything a beautiful lady who has found every answer all meaning all purpose and all that was ever sought and here I am a feather oh you really do like messing with the stuff on your page lost adrift the sky victim of the currents of the wind day after day I searched I searched with little hope knowing legends don't exist you're looking at one huh in-game Jack pure legend read my poetry also visit my blog but when all else has failed me when all others have turned away the legend is all that remains the last dim star glimmering in the twilight sky until one day the wind ceases to blow I fall and I fall and fall and fall even more gentle as a feather a dry quill expressionless sometimes she's this little - under her letters and I don't know why but a hand catches me between the thumb and forefinger the hand of a beautiful lady I look at her eyes and find no end to her gaze the lady who knows everything knows what I am thinking but before I can speak she responds in a hollow voice I have found every answer all of which amount to nothing there is no meaning there is no purpose and we seek only the impossible I am NOT your legend your legend does not exist and with a breath she blows me back afloat and I pick up a gust of wind I like that poem I think it's talking about again my interpretation of these things on a first glance first surface-level read is not always gonna be the thing and the thing about poetry is that everyone takes different meaning out of them anyway but I think the lady who knows everything is there is the it's like is a character you create in your head that everyone has somebody out there that they think is perfect or they think that there's a perfect version of themselves the lady who knows everything could be who Monica thinks she has to be or what she's striving for what she's aiming for what she's looking for a person who has their whole life together but then they're just drifting through the sky on the currents of the wind and day after day they're searching for that that purpose that goal that perfection that version of themselves that they think they have to be or they're searching for that person who they want to look up to who is everything they want to be but then they realize that maybe they're never going to find it or maybe sometimes they're sad and sometimes they think that they're never going to get there and they're not worthy so they fall but they fall like a feather through the air and then they meet that version of themselves or if they come to terms with that version of themselves and the lady says I have found the answer of all of which amount to nothing but there is no meaning there is no purpose and all we seek is the impossible I am NOT your legend so Monica sorry I'm going off on a tangent but I like this stuff Monica's seeking a perfect version of herself the impossible which doesn't exist as she comes to terms with the fact that it that that character doesn't exist and she's blown back into her day to day life she finally catches a ghost again so I think it's the the duality of like happiness and sadness some days you're happy and sometimes you're striving for that perfect version of yourself but sometimes you're sad and you fall back down and you come to terms with yourself that maybe that version of yourself doesn't exist but I liked it can be a very pessimistic ending to it but I like to try and see the silver lining and everything so I'd like to think of this as coming to terms of things in a good way that you come to terms he's like you know what maybe there isn't a perfect version of myself out there maybe I don't have to find a perfect version of myself I can just go back into my life pick up a gust of wind and just live my life and that's fine that's all there is to it you don't need to have to find the lady who knows everything let's see what she says about it you know I feel like learning and looking for answers are the sorts of things that give life meaning not to get too philosophical or anything but it was kind of on my own mind so that's what I wrote about ah so maybe it's a spiritual kind of thing lady who knows everything is like like God or I don't know I see I never really put that much thought into it in a way it's almost paradoxical because if we had all the answers wouldn't the world start to lose its meaning you know there's one thing I noticed it seems like everyone in the club prefers writing other things that are more sad than happy haha are you surprised I mean if everything was okay we wouldn't really have anything to write about would we no we would humans are two-dimensional creatures I think you'd know that better than anyone you mean one-dimensional uh-huh yeah that anyway here's Monica's writing tip of the day are you ever too shy to share your writing because you're afraid it's not that good it can be really disheartening to get a lukewarm response to something that you put so much into but if you find other people who enjoy writing I think sharing becomes a lot easier because instead of just telling you that your writing is good or okay or bad they want to focus more on everything that went into it and the things you can work on it's much more encouraging that way I'll make you want to continue improving it's almost like having your own literature club don't you think that's my advice for today solid advice for any of you out there who wants to do anything art writing movies anything like that the first thing you produce does not have to be a thing that even if you put effort effort put into something should never equal praise given afterwards it can and that would be great that's a perfect word not a perfect world but that's that's that's the hope that if you put a lot of effort into something people will like it just as much as you had as much energy going into it but that doesn't always have to be the case and it's not always the case and as soon as you come to terms with that the easier it is to keep creating stuff because you've put a lot of effort into something it's easy to build up expectations that people need to have an outpouring of just as much affection towards it and then when that doesn't happen it's easy to be like oh well there's no point putting that effort in again because it didn't work out it's not the case keep on working keep on trying keep on pushing and find that light it's worth it I promise you but I do not trust Monica in the slightest she's she's very weird she says things now and then and then all of a sudden it's like wait you mean this she's like oh yeah that like talking directly to the player twice now saying that it's lost in translation and that you should save and now she's talking about being two-dimensional and then I have to correct her with one dimensional so it's almost like she's talking to me as the player and then Jack in the game is correcting being like wait don't you mean one-dimensional it's like it's like if I started talking to you guys and being like humans are just four-dimensional creatures and then you guys are like don't you mean three dimensional and I'm like oh yeah that it's I think there's something more sinister going on so Oh trust you Monica thanks for listening all right see yo yo can we say yo yo okay no I can't pull that off whatever that's that's cool perfectly fine it's nice I guess come on I can already tell you don't like it I wrote I wrote it for you well you don't need to worry about what I think after all you wrote this for someone else didn't you probably Yuri huh I didn't write this for anyone specifically maybe that's not really what I meant though but it's okay you're making new friends just like I was hoping that makes me really happy and you're happy too right in this club well of course I am yeah good that's all that matters to me thank you jack so Yuri is there something wrong huh no nothing I'm just a little tired today haha all right just tell me if you need anything okay oh well hurry about me okay he can go play with everyone else now if you insist yay I'm gonna go home a little bit early today no sirree turn Monique I wasn't feeling well okay let's see you tomorrow before I can say anything else see or he cheerfully walks out of the classroom humming to herself so I don't get to walk home and say or easily is she getting upset because I was becoming more attracted and incident Yuri and then Yuri was getting upset because I might be interested in say Orry don't do this to me game ah horrible poor say Ori cuz that's the thing Sayuri's attitude well uh her her cheerful mentality is like the thing that I'm more drawn to in real life that kind of chipper Pipper kind of thing but URI was like the first one ah God you know what let's not question it it's still just a game at the end of the day but do you think this is a motherfucking game well done sharing poems right why don't we start figuring out hold on a second is it just me or did you say something strange just now something did sound a bit unusual that's right you deviated from your usual catchphrase when addressing the pub catchphrase I don't have a catchphrase jeez weights DeMuth so we're today look given Yuri as an immune to it stagnating air is common for shadowing that something terrible is about to happen I don't like it I don't like it in your books maybe look the only thing different is that say aureus in here it seems you're right see Ori always helps lighten the mood a little bit doesn't she it's almost like everyone's balance is thrown off a little bit she's not around who the heck did she run off to anyway I thought she just went a pee that's a key please show some decency oh come on Jack she wasn't feeling too well so she went home early is that so I hope she's all right seriously of all the times to not go home with her you picked the time she's not feeling well so much for you two being all lovey-dovey uh no first of all stop misses understanding my friendship with say Ori she my girl Maya she she my ride-or-die yo and second she's kind of been avoiding me today so I didn't want to force it what sound is this who I'm an owl the curious expression coming from Yuri of all people calm down guys I talked to her earlier and everything is fine what did she say anyway we need to figure out the rest of the festival preparations so why are you not telling me is it because I like the you you which sounds like milk is you you are a form or brand of like flavored milk you you it sounds like that is that an American thing I remember this is a whatever we'll be doing this weekend I already know what I'm doing that's right that's the key will be making cupcakes but we might need a lot of them and different flavors can you handle that all by yourself Natsuki a tiny little shit sorry challenge accepted and as for myself I'm gonna be printing and assembling on all the poetry pamphlets Siri will be helping me design them I'll also be disliking all your pictures on Facebook because I'm actually a chaotic person but as RiRi Yuri you can suck my ass um guys can you help me come up with something for Yuri I I'm useless no that's not it at all you're the most talented person here you know her nuts he's like oh no not sakis pouting - jeez even I can tell now I guess I never gave to say Yuri enough credit but you can tell things are even harder on you when she's not around haha that may be the case are yeah cuz she's vice president but if I can't also be a leader on my own then it won't grow as a person oh shit I forgot to leave the I forgot to leave the thing open there their files for the game I'll do it in between days if anything has gone in I'll be able to see anyway so URI you have beautiful handwriting you know so you should make some banners and decorations to help set the atmosphere atmosphere about that I I love atmosphere curious expression suddenly changes as she stares at her desk and focuses sarah's nodding to herself your mind is already racing I see that's great you'll be a wonderful help URI but anyway that just leaves you Jack you're a piece of shit you want to do anything huh the one who is truly useless don't say that I mean we're all thinking it but just don't say it in fact boat Natsuki and you already have some pretty heavy tasks to handle it'll probably go a long way to give you one of them a hand you can always help me out as well I have a really appreciative of that I mean I could do it all myself and I actually don't need your tiny hands in the middle of all my work but whatever that's is Monika suggesting you spend the weekend one of my club members how on earth are they gonna respond to a suggestion like that I suppose I wouldn't mind a bit of help you you I know I I knew I loved you for a reason you build big milky mistress and I'm not just saying you're big and milky because you got big boobs I'm saying you're big and milky because you you sounds like milk well even if you don't know how to bake there's always some dirty work I could give to you it's like my laundry it's not something Monica's gonna give me a choice and you should it's not like she's gonna give me a choice I don't know I can't speak can't make good mouths and you shouldn't be sitting on your butt anyway that ski tries to mumble a bunch of excuses like that um if I recall Natsuki you mentioned that you would like to handle the baking on your own Chuck may not like to be around you if only you make him out to be a nuisance so therefore he may be more suited to assisting with the decorations also I really want to make out with him is that obvious by now hold on I never said that how could it be to make a few decorations anyway sounds more like you're just making excuses for jacket but what are you saying it would be extremely meticulous work and baking isn't just what do you think guys guys let's settle down for a moment in the end I think it's up to Jack to decide how he'd like to contribute besides he hasn't really gotten the chance to spend any time with me yet you know it's cuz you're a demon and I Johnny you don't trust you so I'm sure he's interested in you literally just said I'm surprised as well sorry sorry I was just saying though jeez can we just settle this already yeah Jack you're okay with this right in the end it's up to you uh of course very well in that case everyone looks straight at me oh I could pick say Yuri why does it always rain on me I really want to pick say Orry because I think she's feeling down but people told me to stay with Yuri and they really wanted that but I don't know Hawaii I don't want you guys to be able to participate in this as well I wanted to be a series for everybody and I don't know I'm kind of interested in Yuri as well so let's go with Yuri well I probably be most useful helping out Yuri I don't say you're he's doing anyway me are you serious why would you that's the key I can already tell you're about to say something mean that no was just saying wha so you'll be helping Yuri then Jack yeah that's what I'm going to do I'm glad I have a bad habit of overthinking these sorts of things so I think your assistance will be very useful that's great to hear Natsuki will you'll be able to handle their baking by yourself I mean yeah hurry said I would be fine okay okay everything tell that Natsuki is feeling a little sour that's our key haha got him so is that everything we needed to go over yeah that should be about it are you guys excited show me your excited face show me your game face well excited may not be the right word but I suppose I'm looking forward to it a little bit I'm positively ecstatic can't you tell from my expression and my demeanor do you feel the same way Jack me I guess you could say I'm interested to see how it'll turn out that's good enough for me how about you not Sookie that's a key what why is everyone yelling at me didn't even do anything no that's not what I meant at all Yuri anxiously glances between everyone in the room but I'm sorry for this I don't really know why Jack picked me you you fight heavily for me to come over I guess he could come over and help me about my decorations is really meticulous work and you guys said you didn't want him to be with you anyway I have no idea why you picked me and also you cupcakes are the best cupcakes I've ever had they go really well with my tea nothing that I do for the event will compare to that so so I get it I get it kind of surprised oh why um well I'm the one acting immature I already know that but you're trying to cheer me up all of a sudden yeah I know I'm not very good at it I'm sorry if I said something bad that ski isn't the only one surprised Monica and I are all so taken aback by Yuri's words know when she already has trouble with words trying to cheer someone up must be far out of her own comfort zone but they begin to understand her II was trying to sound like say Yuri oh that's sweet even if it didn't work out perfectly I can tell that she tried to say something say or he would say at a time like this because he or he always helps everyone smile and feel good about themselves Oh Yuri oh I feel I feel so bad from the picking er appreciated it I'm sorry for making everything a big deal out of nothing I'm gonna say this huh you better bet that my cupcakes are gonna be the best part of the whole event uh-huh I believe you yeah I hope to see everyone do their best but with that there's nothing more for me to do today so get the fuck out of my classroom bye all right let's get out of here then everyone packs up their things I said to follow Monica and Natsuki out the door as they chat between each other I turn around sorry I didn't I realized that I don't have any way of contacting you this weekend oh you're right I believe that's it my mind boy so give you my phone number I think that would be the best way yes all right then just write it on my chest Yuri and I exchanged phone numbers okay then I'll be stopping by your house on Sunday huh my house it is that a problem no not at all I just gotta clean up my socks my stiff and harden socks I just thought that I would be the one going to your house since I'm the one helping you I suppose that makes sense but if you don't mind I think I would prefer going to your house all right in that case it won't be a problem decided not to press Yuri for a reason it's not like it should matter much either way so I just need to make sure my room is clean I hope I manage to make myself useful in some way I'm not nearly as creative as you are don't underestimate yourself Jack I think that will make a very productive team even if you only chose me because you felt bad or something wait you don't actually think that do you of course she does she's full of self doubts I don't know it's difficult to come up with any other reason why you may have chosen me I can think of a few reasons you're forgetting the one reason with the most common sense I think of the game is trying to like lead towards that as well it's probably just gonna do a point and flip on me I chose to help you because that's what I want to do but but Yuri thinks to herself with an extremely tense expression Yuri you're overthinking this you wanted me to point out when you're overthinking right I didn't realise I'm telling you I want to that's all there is to it do you believe me i yuri things really hurt again she looked straight into my eyes for a long while I believe you okay thanks as if it took her tremendous effort Yuri finally says that and relaxes her expression and I'm really looking forward to Sunday yeah I am too after the exchange I make my way out the door and Yuri follows so nothing has changed in the game files or at least I don't know how far how deep I have to go I assume it's just in like the main folder everything still seems to be the same so I just keep that open now as we move forward I can't believe this yours is going to be come to my house on Sunday my anxiety shoots through the roof even though I've gotten pretty used to handling her at this point there's no telling what might end up happening when we're outside of school maybe you'll feed chocolate to her again more than that she told me that she was looking forward to it is this the chance I have to make something happen between us where's the too early for that only time will tell but until then I won't be able to take my mind off it I seriously can't wait oh he's cute [Music] it's already Sunday I've been getting increasingly anxious about URIs upcoming visit I keep telling myself there's no reason to be nervous but it doesn't help much okay i'ma save real quick just we have a save URI is clearly an introvert and almost an intimate person in general there's no doubt that she'll end up a little bit that she'll open up a little bit I can't fucking read man when it's just the two of us meanwhile we've been texting okay occasionally she was extremely apprehensive at first but it wasn't long before I was already learning more about her but putting URI aside I haven't heard a thing from say Orie since she left the club early the other day it's not like we text each other all the time or anything but I've been worried about her in the back of my mind if you might see ory said and what Monica said the really okay for me to put say or his feelings aside when she might need me I was just gonna say like she just she lived next door go say hi to her I decide if it's a C or E before URI comes over rather than asking I simply tell her I'm coming over much like we've done in the past once I reached say or his house a knock at the door before entering it myself again we used to play so often that we've made a habit of simply entering each other's houses like we were family the house is quiet C or E isn't anywhere on the first floor so I assume she's up in her room it's already strange of her not to run down and greet me I don't like this head up to her bedroom where I finally find her say re hi I forgot the voice I gave you okay hi hi jack I sit down in her room she already forces a smile but it's easy to tell that she's different there's a minute of silence between us plus she's in her underwear no are those shorts odd little peg was pink polka dots I thought it was around aware you haven't come over like this in a long time have you yeah I guess you're right has been a long time how much has really changed has it Suri's room is as messy as it's always been I also recognize the same stuffed animals and wall decorations that she's had for years now uh-huh if you came over more often it wouldn't be such a mess it's because they end up cleaning it up for you how come you suddenly wanted to come over today how's your foot supposed to meet you hurry today yeah but wait how did you know that see oriya Dori left foot the time we decided that last meeting Monica told me it's only natural for her to keep me informed about the first of her preparations right huh that's true what about you aren't you gonna be helping Monica today of course I'm just helping her online I didn't plan to meet up or anything oh so that's why she didn't come downstairs ah so it's just me and URI then yep there's more silence between us so Yuri stares in a random direction everything about her behavior is really uncharacteristic I finally get to the point I just wanted to see how you were doing after you left on Friday when something's wrong you can't hide it from me I know you too well so see your smile is shaking her head that's no good Jack huh why can't it just be like it's always been this is all my fault if I didn't get so weak and accidently express my feelings but didn't make a stupid mistake then you wouldn't have been worried about me at all you wouldn't have come here he wouldn't have even thinking about me right now but this is just my punishment isn't it I'm getting punished for being so selfish I think that's why the world decided to have you come over today it just wants to torture me ah Jesus so Yuri I grabbed see already by the shoulders what an earth are you saying you listening to yourself right now I know something happened to you there's no other explanation for you be like this so tell me already until I know I won't be able to stop thinking about it ha ha ha see already gives me an empty smile you really put me in a trap jack but you're wrong but nothing happened to me I've always been like this here's just seeing it different but you're seeing it for the first time seeing what are you talking about CRE haha you're really just gonna make me say it aren't you jack I guess I have no choice this time the thing is I've had really bad depression my whole life did you know that what do you think I'm late to school every day because most days I can't even find a reason to get out of bed my reason is there to do anything when I fully know how worthless I am why go to school why eat why make friends when make other people put their energy and caring to waste by having them spend it on me that's what it feels like that's why I always just want to make everyone happy see this is what I was talking about you never know what's on the the surface emotion is not always what's underneath without anyone worrying about me I'm in shock I can't even figure out how to respond how is it that C or E kept this from me the entire time that I've known her does she really want so badly for me to just not think about her why say or e hey why is it that you've never told me about this promise feels like I've been betrayed as your close friend because if I knew I would have done everything I could to support you even there's only so much I could do I would have tried a little bit harder to make every day a little better for you that's why I'm your friend all you had to do was told me you don't understand at all jack why do you think I didn't tell you because if I told you then you would have to waste your effort caring about me instead of doing important things I don't want to be cared about it's bittersweet when people try to care about me feels nice sometimes but cause it feels like a bot being swung around against my head ha ha ha that's why I wanted so badly for you to make friends with everyone else helping everyone be happy together it's the best thing for me but then I discovered something else too seeing you make friends again with everyone in the club feels like a spear going through my heart so that's why so I decided the world just wants to torture me every path leads to nothing but hurt you're right that I don't understand I don't understand your feelings at all C or E but I don't need to understand whatever it takes for me to help you to stop hurting that's what I'll do no Jack there's nothing nothing at all the only thing that could have helped is if everything could be like it always was but I was selfish finally showed you how what a horrible person I am tears streak down say or his face I'm if I made you join the literature club because I was selfish and I was punished by my heart hurting in a way that I couldn't understand now you came here and I made you hurt too but I'm just weak and selfish that's all I am that's why I'm going to accept these punishments because I deserve every last one without thinking i once again grabs aori shoulders this time i pull her into a tight embrace but uh Jack say Ori I don't care if you feel selfish I'm really happy that you convinced me to join this club seeing you every day makes it worthwhile enough if I make ever if I make friends with everyone else and that's just a bonus but please never underestimate how much I care about you Lordan have it any other way Jack say Ori isn't hooking me back despite my hours being wrapped around her say orys arms remain at her sights she starts sobbing next to my ear no don't do this to me please don't do this jack I say already barely manages to speak between her sobs I don't know if I'm doing the right thing but all I want is for her to know that I care if you have it in you to call yourself selfish then you have to let me be selfish too no matter what it takes I'll figure out what needs to change I'll make these feelings go away and there's anything you need me to do then you'd better tell me I get mad if you don't I don't know I don't know I don't know gently say or he finally puts her arms around me in return I don't know anything it's all really scary I don't understand any of my feelings jack the only time I'm not feeling nothing is when I'm feeling pain but your hugs are so warm and that's really scary too oh jesus this hurts oh man because I didn't pick her as well Jesus but it's it's also a thing that is my is a bigger relationship than friendship really the things she needs she won't let me go as she does I let her go as well the first of all is tomorrow yeah it's gonna be fun right yeah how would you like for me to spend it all with you [Music] haha that's what I want I promise and this is also the thing while he's trying to be a good friend she also has deeper feelings for him so is that making things worse or better right I think that would be nice then yeah see already wipes her eyes if I could spend the whole day here I would of all days this has to be the one where I have other plans maybe I should cancel no no don't please don't if you did that then I would really wouldn't forgive you but it's almost time for URI to meet me at my house at the very least you want to come along and help out would be fun to my surprise cieaura shakes her head I'm sorry I don't know if that would be very good for me today you understand right it's kind of hard for me to fully understand but I'm trying my hardest it's okay don't worry too much about it I'll see you tomorrow okay all right look forward to it Oh Oh see Rory say goodbye to see Orion exit her house and the way home I find myself still feeling uneasy but it's hard for me to keep thinking about it when Yuri is about to come over to think say Ori is right shouldn't be worrying too much and we're definitely going to have a great time tomorrow I should just focus on what's ahead of me as I approach my house I see something that makes me feel a moment of panic Yuri thank goodness you're a little early sorry I wasn't home yet were you waiting for a long time no I just got here but I started to get really nervous when nobody answered the doorbell you could always have texted me wait no when I would have reassured you and hurried more on my way home I suppose that's true I didn't think of that for some reason I shall be common sense to do that but I decided to ignore it anyway let's go in sight see you brought a lot of stuff with you that's right and did you manage to find everything I asked you to buy as well yeah pretty much at least I hope I got everything right I'm sure it will be fine I take Yuri to my room the first thing she does is glance around curiously which makes me feel anxious I feel like that's what everybody does with each other's bedrooms oh and nothing has gone into the game files so we good we gucci it's so clean ha ha ha i clean it before you came over so that's very considerate of you to do that no I would be really embarrassed for my room to be a mess while you were here hmm well or well I do enjoy cleaning I would have gladly helped you clean Jesus no you don't make your guests clean your house ah well that would have been even more embarrassing wait don't look in there my statue is rais'd which was in the process of opening a desk drawer of mine first off I think I know it's in there secondly why was she just reaching for drawers is in your house I'm sorry I wasn't thinking for some reason I was just spacing out it's fine it's fine let go of Yuri's wrist she puts both of her hands firmly in her lap as if making sure she's keeping track of them so um should we get started yes I have a few things planned that I can that you can help with decorations and other atmospheric enhancements atmospheric enhancements you know mood lighting aromatherapy candles oh wow I didn't think you planned on I didn't think you planned on taking it that far of course I wanted to keep I wanted to help keep our take our guests to a faraway place although money will stop by just out of curiosity and for cupcakes I guess I'm determined to provide an experience that will leave them wanting more that's great Ceaser's forget that you're a pretty intense person intense I guess that's the best way to put it is that a bad thing no not at all it's something that I like about you actually it is that so that makes me feel relieved and kind of happy yeah no need to be so anxious you can relax a little relax I brought some things for relaxation I was going to use them during the poetry event oh yeah like what let's see Yuri rummages through her bag she pulls out a few candles and a wooden cylinder shaped object a pattern appeared dildo Yuri I did some shopping on the way here so I happen to have these in my bag convenient I plan to cover the windows in black paper and use the candles to light the room I think that would be amazing don't you yeah that would be really neat a little weird but pretty neat what's the wooden thing though oh this it's just a diffuser for essential oil shaped like a butt plug you don't mind that do you how familiar are you with aromatherapy not familiar at all ice that's so it's one of my favourite contributors to a positive atmosphere depending on the oils are herbs you choose you can change the mood of the air itself you can even feel it permeate through your body relaxation positive energy romance reflection violence speed momentum you know it's almost like magic URI takes the cylinder and pushes a switch on the bottom in just a moment a thin ray of vapor begins to spout through a small hole in the top I have done some aromatherapy stuff not well I don't know if you'd call it aromatherapy but getting one of those like Glade things that and smell their little spouts of like vapors that come out of them it's actually quite relaxing to have in a room just have the room smelling like something wow this most wonderful kind of mood is that one fir that is Jasmine essential oil it says in the box that it's for a sexy time smells a little sweet and flowery right yeah that's a good way to describe it I chose Jasmine for the event because it provides more than relaxation and it's my favorite Disney Princess she enhances your emotions and helps you feel them flow through your body you feel warmer and your heart pounds more heavily don't you think that'll be perfect for sharing our poems sure it is sound suitable but you seem to know a lot about this so I'll trust your opinion with anything Yuri smiles gently clearly enjoying herself she again reaches into her bag and pulls out several spools of thin ribbon no come on you can't have that line and the next thing you know you pull out a book that says my name is Jeff well did you purchase the origami paper I asked you to get yeah I have it over here you won't we won't be using the paper for folding origami what I'd like to do is write a different word on each paper we'll need about a hundred of them oh yeah well those be used for well I'm gonna cut I'm going to cut pieces of ribbon to hang from the doorway of the classroom then we can fasten the paper onto ribbons to create a doorway curtain it's pretty cool wouldn't that be beautiful it would also catch the eye of those passing by the room it may attract some to peek inside that's really creative head no ID be so good at this Yuri is that's all well I suppose I do get a little intense as you put it hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo ah she's cute Yuri giggles with red cheeks is it just me or is she more relaxed than when it's just the two of us or maybe it's the excitement she feels from sharing something that she enjoys here's a marker check you can write any characters you want I'll help you once I finish cutting the ribbons ha all right sitting on the floor together the two of us get to work I carefully draw a different character and each paper doing my best to manage my bad handwriting Yuri unravels a long strand of red ribbon to her desired length then she reaches into her bag once more and pulls out a pocketknife okay okay huh the knife is strangely beautiful the silver handle has an interphase pattern of ways edged into it the blade itself is gently tinted blue that's no ordinary pocketknife looks really fancy but you mean my stabbing knife well embarrassed URI looks away what is it you're going to think it's weird URI whatever it is I have no reason to judge to each their own you know if you promise you won't be weirded out I mean as long as you don't say that you stab people with it yeah I promise all right the thing is I'm kind of into knives they're just so pretty I can't help it I don't know what it is the combination of craftsmanship and the feeling of danger maybe yeah they do seem to suit you alright you knife branding weird oh she did talk about knifes off in her poems as well didn't she huh what am I saying please don't think I'm weird for this you're laughing at me no I'm laughing at you it's just funny how nervous you get about sharing it's well it's an interesting thing to be into I guess but I think it kind of suits you I mean didn't Angelina Jolie collect knives didn't her dad buy her knives and she was younger suits me yeah it's kind of intense besides it's a really cool-looking knife I can't deny that it is isn't it URI relaxes her expression once again what do you like to hold it you like to hold my knife sure I'll check it out URI carefully hands me the knife with the handle facing me I take it and turn it around in my hands feels heavy and extremely solid or do you even get a knife like this curious of its sharpness I feel the point of the knife with my index finger ow Jack why did you do that oh I didn't expect that me that's sharp I barely touched it at all it's my fault I should have warned you this knife is extremely sharp it can cut through skin like paper okay calm down miss I want to stop a person oh no small drop of draw blood trickles down the side of my finger here he takes my hand and gives the wound a closer look she stares at it and noticeably fidgets if you're squeamish I go wash it off now uh-huh without warning URI puts my finger in her mouth and licks the wound what I feed her tongue turn around my finger what okay this wind disco way weirder than chocolate startled I instinctively pulled my hand back oh please forgive me I I wasn't thinking I URI lowers her head her face burning up URI that's the most embarrassing thing I've ever done how could I do something like that I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sure it was a little weird and it took me by surprise it's very weird but I guess she was just trying to help bright URI I think you're overreacting a little uh-huh she doesn't lift her head what if she doesn't recover from this for the rest of the afternoon all right you know what this might be a stupid thing to do but I do it anyway I take you his hand and lick her index finger in return I feel like the police are gonna like kick down my door any second Jack did you really just do that now we're even URI just looks at me like I did something wrong hahaha I knew that would be a bad idea it's not for the sweet aroma of jasmine oil the air would be extremely heavy right now and full of the sweet scent of my sweaty underarms because I am sweating profusely their immediate trauma that I am in you're so weird jack URI giggles shyly huh URI calling me weird I have no response to that where do you keep your bandages ah I don't think I need one actually there was a tiny cut look they're already stopped bleeding I see that's relieving the tension is quickly lifted we each resumed our respective activities and what's your reason I've cooked through ribbon like it's nothing but air meanwhile I continued to make progress on the paper this time that's timing myself to death after we finish attaching to paper the ribbons we lay them all out side by side he looks better than I expected and would be very effective as a talker it looks great good thinking coming up with this URI Thanks it's just something I saw online really are you ready to move on to the next task yeah let's do it what do you have in mind I'd like to create a banner that's why I asked you to buy the paint tablets ah that's right one of the items Yuri had asked me to buy it was a kit of watercolor watercolor paint tablets will need about six cups of water to put each of the tablets in do you mind fetching those for us of course not six cups of water I'll be right back in a jiffy jiffy did I really say that no one says that Oh bonehead bonehead thank you very much oh and just a little bit of water is okay if you fill the cups too much it will be too diluted taking Yuri's advice I decided to use a small plastic bathroom cups rather than full-size glasses wait what are small plastic bathroom cups does everybody just have those put them on a plate to catch any paint that drips then bring it back into my room Yuri yes and come in to see you read quickly unrolling her sleeve pulling it back over her arm ah nothing your face is a little red this is too hot in here or anything no not at all coz I mean I turned up the thermostat really really high so you take off your shirt oh I said that out loud didn't I there's nothing wrong so let's mix the paint Yuri hurriedly dismisses wait a minute okay so it's clear that she has some sort of like anxiety or fear of confrontation and some social anxiety and stuff like that but as somebody pointed out she had a poem that was very reminiscent of self-harm and she's into all that kind of like darker stuff and now she says she's into knives and now she's pulling her sleeve back down so if she pulls up her sleeve is he gonna reveal that she's a bunch of self-harm moons is that what this game is about we have C or E who's just admitted that she's had severe depression her entire life and now we have URI who self harms and is a ball of anxiety and nerves Jesus this game doesn't pull any punches so I thought we would do something simple that would look very nice I'd like to paint a gradient across the banner starting with the colors of first sunrise then daytime then sunset at the nighttime once it dries I'll write an inspirational quote across the banner we can hang it on the wall behind the podium on front the classroom I don't need like bender neat just take a picture are you gonna write well it would be more fun to surprise you URI smiles at me if you say so after rolling out the banner URI and I kneel an opposite end so we don't get in the way of each other URI uses a brush and adds a few dots of different colors across the banner to serve as a color guide when we paint hmm thoughtful it's kind of reminds me of elementary school painting on a banner with watercolors feels a lot less or a lot like art class projects we had back to it relaxing I'm sorry if this feels too childish no I didn't mean that at all it's just kind of fun you know yeah it is fun I'm glad you feel that way too URI stops painting for a moment thinking to herself for me I don't need to go out and do crazy things to have fun in fact I usually don't even want to it's just like when I could spend time with one other person even if it's something simple like reading doesn't even matter if we don't talk much just having a friend next to me makes things feel a little bit nicer I think that's all it takes for me to be happy that's so even if URI and I are quite different I can understand where she's coming from I feel that way I feel that way about things like anime and games were simply sharing the experience that someone can make me happy me too poof I think I feel the same way Yuri smiles gently I knew you'd understand Yuri leans over the banner to grab an unused paintbrush but I move at the same time causing my head to bump into hers yeah oh god that's the most the most Japanese anime sound you could have made so sorry Yuri reels back and I quickly lift my hands and surprise are you hurt no I'm not hurt it just startled me that's all are you seeing pink spots though it smells like copper in here sorry I should have asked you to get it for me it's not your fault ah your face there are droplets of paint on Yuri's face and neck so something I might fate or is there something on my face yeah I accidentally got paint on you sorry it's totally my fault I get the towel right away I rush out and fetch a small towel and I dampen it with hot water I return to my room and kneel back down in front of her damn here I pat down Yuri's face and neck with a towel is something wrong it's hot I just didn't expect it sorry I didn't want to use cold water having finished I start to retract my hand but Yuri suddenly holds my wrist wait yeah just for a little longer it feels really nice ah I keep my hand still against Yuri's cheek she looks into my eyes it's an intense expression that I recognized from when she reads her books almost as if she's lost in a daze enveloped by her own thoughts if you think this music does not go with this she breathes gently half half through slightly parted lips what's happening zero monoi giving me this dizzy feeling URIs gentle fingers wrapped around my wrist sent a tingling sensation through my arm turn into my pants and suddenly her face seems to be much closer to mine and it was just moments ago kiss her jack you ready slowly pulls away sorry I've been feeling a little light-headed today I didn't mean to space out yeah it's it's fine I damn it the moment is over as soon as it began URI picks up her brush again but her movements seemed clumsier like she's unable to focus I remained silent forced to ignore the event that just transpired I hesitantly retrieved my own brush and continue following URIs example huh there that should do it I finished off I finished filling the night sky with white dots that looks like stars looking at the banner as a whole it's very pretty a natural looking I think it came out better than I expected I'm really happy with the results yeah me too are you gonna add the lettering no not not yet it needs to dry first that's true but won't that take a while well perhaps it would be best to leave it here then have you bring it in the morning I can do the lettering in the classroom before her event starts is that okay I was totally fine wonderful in that case I don't think there's anything more for us to do here who you say that like you're glad it's over was I wrong to assume that you were at least enjoying yourself for a little bit URI please stop overanalyzing everything ah no it's not that I'm just glad that we managed to get everything done I see I am - I was a little concerned about time I need to start making dinner soon ah so you don't have any time left I'm secretly hoping we could have extra time after finishing the work well URI thinks to herself but I think it would be too irresponsible for me to wait much longer I'm sorry I was hoping there would be more time as well it's probably my fault sorry for being such a slow worker no it's not your fault at all and the important thing is that we got everything done right yeah so I shouldn't be disappointed or anything gathering all her things URI seems to look a little down caste I understand why it sounded like she rarely gets the opportunity to spend time with friends in a relaxed environment but that doesn't mean this is the last time it can happen once he packs up I walk her out the front door thank you very much for having me today no problem I was tired I was able to have you I mean have you over just let me know if there's anything else you need me to bring I will well then your religious and then she spins I guess I'll see you tomorrow wait I kind of say that without thinking about today it's fine that we didn't have as much time as we wanted because we can do this again whatever you want you can come over we can go out somewhere ah I forgot you don't like going out that much introvert yeah as they stumble over my words Yuri simply smiles bashfully anyway you know what I'm trying to say so you're very thoughtful jack Yuri takes a step closer to me then briefly squeezes my hand whoa whoa whoa whoa I kind of like that about you oh how am I supposed to respond to that but I don't even get a chance as Yuri suddenly pulls back but so Yuri yeah ha hi jack she said hi jack though she's trying to hijack sup the terrorist okay sorry oh god sorry sorry flashbacks see Ori just just no we weren't uh it's okay jack I just stopped by to say hi um well it's nice to see you I'm sorry but I'm already on my way to leave ah really that's too bad I'm sorry but we'll all be together at the festival tomorrow so so that's fine right of course say Ori beams yeah so I'll see you tomorrow clearly embarrassed Yuri hurries off see Ori waves goodbye after fat pi C or II thought you didn't want to come over today well that's right saying in my room but my imagination was being really mean to me stupid imagination don't like you so I had to come here and see it for myself see what what are you talking about you know how much fun you were having with Yuri how close you got to her it makes me makes me really happy that you've made such good friends it's all it matters to me tears started to fall down and say orys face that's all that matters to me why am I feeling this way Jack I'm supposed to be happy for you why I feel like my heart is splitting a half it hurts so much everything hurts so much this would be so much better if I could just disappear C or E don't say that it's true Jack if I wasn't here that you wouldn't have to waste your sympathy on me you wouldn't have to put up with me being selfish bah Rika was right I should just Monica Monica was right about what C or E what I said before is true I'm not gonna let this continue carrying about you like this isn't the burden your mind is making it out to be something that makes me happy it's something that I wouldn't trade for anything else so even if it takes an entire lifetime I'm gonna be by your side until you don't feel any more pain but see or he looks away I put a hand in her shoulder to reassure her I'm scared Jack I'm really scared what have you what are you scared of C or E I'm scared that that I might like you more than you like me C or E it's true isn't it I was weak and started to like you too much I do this to myself Jack I like you so much that I want to die that's how I feel and and that's enough C or E I don't want you to hurt anymore it's like my hand don't say orys arm thank God that's an arm and squeeze her hand in my own you remember how I said I always know what's best for you do you still believe me wordlessly say or he nods even if you don't understand all of your own feelings I know what you need the most right now and that's what I'm gonna give you oh fuck [Music] uh technically I do love her but as a friend if I say you'll always be my dearest friend that will absolutely crush her but I also don't want to lead her on fuck she's gonna be one of those things where everyone's like Oh Jack why did you pick that but you know what might play through my choices you will always be my dearest friend what you need most is for things to be like they've always been Monica told me the truth she told me how much happier you seemed after I joined the club I know you're struggling with some really difficult feelings right now but please trust me that I know what's best and what will make you happy in the end I promise I get things back to the way they were I I see so Yuri forces a smile through an incredibly pained expression is this what it feels like to get stabbed in the chest I should write a poem about this so Yuri it's okay this is just my punishment remember for be so selfish so please please don't worry about these stupid feelings I know you're right I knew this whole time that there's no happiness down that path that's why I came here just so I could get the answer I needed to hear and the other thing you're also right that I just wanted to go back to the way it was I realized that now you really do know me better than I didn't want Jack I'll trust you at anything anything at all so Siri smile finally breaks all of a sudden she turns around and drops to her knees clutching her head with both hands she screams as loudly as she can I'm so shocked that I don't know how to react sir he looks over her shoulder and flashes me one more weak smile before turning around and running off say Orry I'm left helplessly standing in the front of my house why am I feeling so horrible about this there's nothing more I could have done the most I can do is support say Orry through her feelings and help her on the path that's right but I'm having as much trouble understanding serious feelings as she is even though I can comfort her I keep wondering if I should be doing something more or something different you know these thoughts will continue to plague me until things are back to the way they were I'm gonna give it everything I've got so Yuri will always be my dearest friend and I'll do whatever it takes to put a smile on her face every day Jesus Christ mother a god that episode got heavy okay I feel like I feel like we're starting to get into some stuff so I stuff started to get a lot more real than it was feel I feel horrible about that but there's the thing if she's having really really depressive thoughts and she's like clearly in a very bad way me saying I love her for the sake of saying I love her just to appease her in that moment might make her might late her and give her a false sense of euphoria and it's for a false high right then and there but it's it's only temporary and if anything I'll do more damage than good saying she lost me my dearest friend gives her an answer that's truthful but that's also very damaging because who knows what's going through her head now and and like where her mental state is going to be but as the jack character I know you feel like you can solve everything you feel like you can help and you feel like you're there for your friend and you will do everything in your power to help but sometimes that's still not enough sometimes it's important to note when to seek outside help you may feel like you know what's best for your friend you may feel like you know exactly what's happening and I'm not a therapist also take this with a grain of salt these topics are very very tricky and they're very very scary and they're very they can turn into something very serious very quickly so they're not to be treated lightly a lot of people do treat it lightly like URI self-harm if that is the case it seems like it is it seems like she's also maybe having problems at home because she didn't want me to come over to her house C or E then obviously being very depressed it's it's easy to treat these things being like we'll just get happy again and that's not always the case and some people are like you you're fine you're privileged you have everything you need everything you want oh wait a thing just came into my folder happy thoughts a picture called happy thoughts but it's well H X P P Y th X so the vowels are different way what oh my god oh Jesus that just gave me goosebumps what the fuck oh no that was just put in there the folder for the the game in the steam folder that was just there called happy thoughts you can see up here HX p py th x ug h CS don't like that oh it's like playing I'm scared all over again oh I don't like that wait is that C or E yeah cuz it has a bow in her head series wait doesn't Natsuki have a bow as well oh I don't like that when I was in the middle of saying something as well now it's completely detracted from what I wanted to talk about so they did the festival of all days I expected this to be the one where I'd be walking to school it's a or E but C or E isn't answering her phone considered going to her house to wake her up but decided that's a little too much mean why the preparations for the event should be nearly complete the banner Yuri and I paid it as dry and I gently rolled it up to take it with me she sent me a pleasant text reminding me not to forget anything and I reassured her fully enough I probably feel the same way as Natsuki about the event more excited for it to be over so I can spend time with say Ori and Yuri at the festival but knowing Monica I'm sure the event would be great too oh no you should have gone to check I'd say Ori she needs you man getting fucked up I don't know how I feel about this I'm all weirded out I'm kind of creeped out so the game starts to like break through the game and it starts messing with real life I mean I fucking love it that shit is awesome but it's freaking me out at the same time as I was saying if your friend is in like a really bad way don't be afraid to talk to their parents about it even if it feels like you're betraying your friend sometimes it's better to do that before mistakes can happen or talking to encouraging them to get professional help as well or encourage them to talk to their parents first and foremost and see how they feel just it's tricky topics and again I'm not fully versed in it I'm not a therapist I'm not a psychologist I don't have all the answers all I can do is try and point you in the right direction brainy way that does it for this episode I didn't realize they'd been recording for much more I actually wanted to get in and do a whole lot more my god this game goes by like that but we're getting into it now we're finally starting to uncover some stuff and see kind of what the game is about and now this is weirding me out even more this picture because it's not just happy thoughts it's like a fucking horror picture happy thoughts it's like the game is invading my computer so into it very into an account wait to record the next episode of this anyway I would have to leave you guys here but thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face like your pores and hazel Road Shh thank you guys [Music] [Applause] man it's complicated fighting between yo-yo and you you it's difficult 
Top of the morning to you laddies, my name is jacksepticeye and welcome back to subnauseous Things are going pretty damn well for us. We're doing very very great things: my water filtration system. I went up to it last time I was like what do we do with this again? I realize that it just says that water is at 58% It just made salt for me, which is great. That's not salt... Salt for me! Which is really good I like salt, salt is the best thing that I could have in my life right now I was really sad when my other salt left there There if I keep if I just pet the kitty I can keep cam and keep my positive Mental attitude I can keep that PMA going and then we as a team as a community Kind accomplish great things and subnautious. I want to eat you guys While I wait for this water to be cooked You cooking water right now is 63 percent ok fair enough, ooh Scanner room I didn't use you last time that would be very cool I Don't want to search for any of these things wanna search for copper Do you show better things if I actually bring you out and around? wait So if you're new to subnautica the scanner room basically has two ball cameras on it you can upgrade it and get more of them and as they Progress around the island and as the planet I should say You can already go a certain distance with them But when you get to an area you can put them down and then on this little map thing They will show you how many of those? Items are in a specific area, so you can get it to search for specific things Which is really cool. I like it a lot That's bad sounds believe me here Maybe pull you back of it in case the stalker started to fuck with you, so Leave the camera there and cycle to the next one And Cycle to the next one And thank you, and then the next camera. I will just bring in this direction so I can spread them out in two directions and Then we should be able to get oh god. It's very dark No, it's nice now I can bring the thing about the scanners as well is that it's kind of like bringing around a CMOS But now I have no danger if the camera gets destroyed I go Wow Oh, No Whereas in the seamoth I'm in there, so I'm at risk whereas this time. It's just like ass just a little camera You know they're cute little bodies, but I'm not a danger, but the game is out now Sobotka is actually finally out now It's it's not just me and a few other people who have it anymore the game is fully Publicly out you can go to Steam right now and buy it for yourselves And you will play the exact same version that I have in front of me right now, which I think is fantastic I'm really excited that it's out and have you guys seen the new cinematic trailer that came out with it? really good And they they had a quote in the gameplay trailer from me saying that I love the game to bits. It's true. I do Sue Sunstone chunks titanium you can see all this shit around here, I think if I Oops, I gotta broke it did my water get made ah fuck Rumors dizzy power only cuz it's freakin nighttime So I'm gonna go to sleepy sleeps and when we wake up it's gonna be sunshine and it's gonna be full power watch this full power yeah full power, ahh Almost well not almost Not even close don't even a third of the way there, but how close are we to water? 96 percent that's great So the scanner the scanner room itself is a bit Confusing to me like the way this shows up. Is that the titanium? But I don't know if it's camera one or camera two if you know what I mean It's confusing. I don't really have an orientation. Maybe it's just the way I am so like left is actually just over there I Don't know okay stop scanning for that and what changed yeah, it disappeared, okay, so That's how it works if you want to get these things That's what you do so this is gonna come and really had to get Ruby but I would need to have built it near a place that has Ruby and I I couldn't do that so what I want to do is yay water AEE done oh, and you made more salt, so what this thing is basically doing is taking the water from outside It's pumping the water in from outdoors, and it's separating the salt and turning it into pure water But that's all its really doing but it's taking up a lot of power And it's constantly working, so I need to build in another solar panel, but it gives you 50 water So let this thing go ahead and make a few waters, and then go out on a trip And you're golden - two waters from that can bring you from zero to full So that's a big boon what I also want to do is To get more upgrades because we have to go into the lavas own now eventually to get the upgrade for the exosuit I'm going to have to go into the lava zone itself to get some kyanite Kyanite is on the walls in the active lava zone or the inactive lava zone or whatever It's near that area where we were with the giant school so we need to go back there Boyd. I don't bring my prawn suit this time as good as it is I might just bring Sally because now she can go to a depth of 900 so There's no difference Everything I have can go to a depth of 900 and I can't bring the site cups down there So there's no point, so I'll just bring Sally down there. It'd be quicker as well anyway But first solar panel, what do I need to make a solar panel? Titanium copper or and quartz Okay, why can't you find copper for me? I? Mean you're finding limestone chunks and gets the coppers in that Is that it is is there copper right there Is this the center then no cuz I've never used this thing properly before so I'm just assuming things alright still scanning for them oh Yeah, I need I need power badly I think What was the limit before God? There's a lot of okay? That's going okay? You stop scanning cuz you're wasting my power I'm trying to think how many Solar panels it was to be able to power that thing fully As you know this is my problem coming out here now. I have no way of knowing again. Where the fuck those limestone chunks were thought a lot of guesswork, so Yeah excuse yourself Ropes I'm just going to look for limestone chunks and quartz Needed this anyway. I'm gonna look for them the way I always do copper or copper or think copper That's not copper There's the copper see after the disappointment of the first time you started to believe in yourselves And then you got me some copper. Thank you appreciate it Just don't ever do that to me again Go away hate those are the shitheads so annoying They want to pick up more courts cuz I might make more than one solar panel because I would like my base to just have Continuous power all the time Can I put some like giant batteries in it as well? Titanium come on I Don't need titanium Copper bored that's the stuff. I like to see more a copper or yes That's the shit was the two copper, or as I needed oh just one That means it can make like two more power cells right solar panels Things, I don't know what I'm talking about go fast to see great please oh I'm not supposed to be in here and supposed to be out here Don't even build a solar panel lesson oh right yeah Now I might just build um You turn that way nice nice nice nice I Can't remember do they increase the actual max power that I'm able to have Because right now. I'm at 75 power as my total is that just how much Oh? A just see two more courts they can make another one Ooh Or would they just replenish their 75 power more it's been a long time, man. I can't remember leave me alone my dad owns, Nintendo we Play scam and relaxing. It's a nice start for the storm. That's about to come Oh Porter I'm over there you guys in a little bit Coughs titanium a little bit we're gonna have to go far far away and make some bad juju beats so I'm not looking forward to that we have to go back into the scary scary dark dark from last time and That was already very scary and very dark, so I don't wanna do that again, but you know what I'll do it for you And for my base, you know, okay, let's go in Yeah, it does increase the overall power Sweet okay, how close are you to order 42% come on in? That's not enough percents Eat up all that eat up all that real good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Now do you see what I mean by getting a farm? It's like the most useful thing ever It's just infinite food Let's get much sunlight, it doesn't taste great, but infinite food I Should also look up my other upgrades. What else what else am I trying to get okay? Jump-jet upgrade I need crystalline sulfur, and I need nickel. I don't know where I get nickel promise new depths module mark one I Didn't go to depth module in the prawn suit yet today, so If I get some nickel I Need to get a lot of nickel, and he's figure out where I could find nickel Maybe I'll find it down in the caves and Then I can build a bunch more upgrades for my project because the bronze suit is the one I'm gonna have to upgrade the most cuz that's the one that's gonna get me the furthest and See Martha's fully upgraded well, I could put a torpedo system in it and That'll be great, and I probably do that later on when I run out of things to do but right now It's just it's not worth it you Could shoot little things here and there, but I have to may I have to Let's just see what I need okay? Torpedo system lithium aerogel and titanium I I'm able to make that aren't I I'm able to make that right now Wait how much of each three titanium really Waste my fucking time, Oh what can I make in here storage module I have one All right, we'll make the torpedo system then fine. I know a lot of you out there What is he Sallie fully decked out and you know what I'm with you on that? I want to see Sally have some badass weaponry as well I Know what you can't stack these modules it says It does not stack because that was a thing that I was wondering myself in the game before Because it didn't say it does not stack and I tried to put two in didn't work I thought I'd be able to go to like 3,000 meters But I never worked so I think they put that in because of people assuming that but now we have a torpedo system now I have to remember how to make torpedoes a Vortex torpedo generates gener ah Generates a localized gravity distortion load this vehicle. Whatever and a gas one guy spuds in titanium I can actually make some of those right now gas paws are the things that come out of the fire T boys over here The way to hardy boys, but not really Okay do the thing you've done it a seven billion times since I've started this series again, so come on do the thing It is out of them, right? Hi here we go here we go Cass box But you gotta get them quick cuz they explode and kill you I Don't like that Okay do it again. There's so many of you guys around I? Remember when I very first played the game back when it very first came out in early access and Get them get them get them get them get them get them okay I got a punch there was only one of these guys around and he was floating around in here And that was it there was no more You gonna do it come on fart for me be a bloaty boy Blow deep low deep floaty boy party party party boy Thank you torpedoes torpedoes torpedoes for my Sally torpedoes torpedoes gonna kill all those crab squids Hopefully, maybe these don't kill them though. Oh wait wait. What do these do? Release the car toxic gas load this into a vehicle torpedo bay. Yeah, the other ones freeze them in place They like give a gravity bubbles that just holds them in place which is Also pretty cool, and it actually has a cooler effect when you do that but you have to get a lot of magnetite for that and I don't have any magnetite so I'm not really that asked to do that. I was already reluctant enough to actually do this Can I actually load them in from here whatever, I just I'll just enter And there are you weak? Dammit Sully we can't be having that we'd have no weakness See math torpedo story. Yes, II I Can only hold that money in there? Oh wait you have stuff in this idea? What are they putting you oh? Yeah a whole bunch of garbage He's not garbage Let me put those in the base. I like the toy car oh, I have to get a battery Okay, let's see if I put the toy car inside Maria probably can't cuz I couldn't put the fucking little ship in there Thanks Appreciate it. Can I put this down? What's even the point toy car Toy Karen to Toy kick fuck it I'm gonna put it on my bed So I can like look at it before I go to sleep. What the fuck are you doing? Here we go nice now. It's a racecar bed I needed to dump did I need to dump? Do I need to dump the question everyone asks after a big meal? Fine I put some other stuff in this one out here, whatever in fact. Do you have anything in you? She's completely empty which means that I could just do no I could not do anything because I'm stupid Just do this With another locker over this site. This is all about making things look nice as well. You know They're Very good very good bah bah bah bum bum bum buh buh, buh bah bum bum forever Papa And then in this storage check out that blood oil. That's salt And then we put a bunch of torpedoes in You like a fucking war Arsenal now Sally Everybody in the deep dark deep dark dark is gonna. Be scared yet Take all completely clean inventory I like me likey likey likey Oh anybody ah the soaps can just says infected now on the little screen watch Just as infected, that's it that's why it felt like it wasn't scanning anything before I Get it now Okay, I want to try and get my food up Before I hermana my food my water off before I go anywhere cuz I don't want to have to Like waste stuff while I just head out Okay, how much power are you a? 39 percent Who's wasting all your power is it pepper. I love fucking words. Oh, I have a message Hello playing partially translated oh I don't like this one Destroyed mode Patrol new targets unaccounted for one Oh Creepy but freaking awesome. It's the war pers talking man It's so cool Wait they said that there was a target that they were looking for And now they said there's unaccounted targets for one which is me So was I the other target to begin with or was that somebody else that was still alive And they found him and killed him. I don't know I probably is still just me but Very very interesting and in the cinematic trailer for the game They kinda added a like a little bit of story And it was a lot of CG and just looked so cool and it showed the aurora coming in and the captain saying that he's coming in for a control landing, which we heard and Then it could to the de gas II which is the ship that came before? That got shut down as well It's the one that Bart torgul and his dad and what was her name Was on it when I went to the island they got all their stuff and wanted the voice Logs from there was the one that was saying during the trailer Saying that father was right. We shouldn't have gone deeper, and then it showed like the crab squids And it showed the Reaper and everything and then It showed his Base kind of like this but his base then Went over time after he disappeared And it all got all decrepit and everything and then it showed the aurora coming in to land in the water is so fuckin badass What do I need to make a beacon real quick Because I would like to make one for Going down there (like how i went down into ur mom!!!) deployables Copper warren titanium. I don't have those now. Now I got those and I can make two little beakers Do a little beacon boys I hope Kyanite is actually in the lava zone. I can't I just want to go back there anyway Just hang out. Just chill out max all cool. You know and As well as that I'm going to bring another battery oh I didn't know I thought the orders just went in your inventory I didn't know they actually stayed on the fabricator if you're not near it. That's cool I once I want a battery with me because I do not want to run out of power in my sealant All right, we're heading off Me and Sally on another adventure That should be your theme song it's like Jack and Sally and we're like back to back But I look all cool and Sally's just like a machine So it looks really weird, but that's kind of the quirk of the show I'm telling you that show is gonna happen. Hey REE fees How's it going? You got something to say to me? Come on we're friends right speak I Knew I could count on my big tentacle whale boys Alright, see you guys later. You guys just hang out. Oh, I actually saw a kid front ready today that had a joint octopus kite Look up octopus kite And it looks like those just with more legs, and it looks like CG the first time you look at it. It's really weird Should I go back down into blood kelp zone and get to the thing that way? I'll go down through the crab squids I Don't know either directions fucking risky and weird so Let's just do it We run into war purrs again, but Whatever Let's have lights on this thing Quality doesn't have lights right-click is unless it has natural lights, but right click and the prawn suit is to shoot or say punch whatever Now this isn't a freaking surefire science ok so I'm just gonna keep going down along the bottom of this until we get somewhere I Remember jumping down further and further and at about 600 meters. We get to where we want to go Think I'm going in the right direction. I'm gonna keep talking as well because this scares me This is it right that's really easy to find it's much easier to find them the way I used to go That's weird Where is he though, I just hear him Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh here we have some skeleton bones From a Leviathan Creature There's more Skeleton bones. This is basically a graveyard for giant creatures But they should just call it. I'm pretty sure this is the Lost River This section here because this looks like a river flowing underwater which can happen first time I was through here. I was like That's silly and then ever was like actually And then when I looked it up. I was like oh That actually is a thing Oh a new message oh The ghost leviathans here You guys see this Indicate this biome contains unusually high concentrations of organic and fossilized remains hell. Yeah, it does look at this one You guys thought you saw some shit last time with that chain school. Nah. Look at this bad boy This is something that died in a very very long time ago Okay, I want to avoid you avoid the noid But if we can just get kyanite off there Which way are you going? Okay, you're coming right at me. That's cool. That's fine. I am NOT fast enough to outrun you am I oh Fuck just go sali. Go sali. Go go go God, I really wish this creature was still alive in this game, or there was another version of it I would love if there was just a version of the game where they didn't talk about it They didn't say anything about what they were adding. They didn't talk about any of that stuff Did I get rid of him ? okay, good, and then all of a sudden you just come back into the game, and I think What? There's just a giant creature again. That was so awesome But off of this area Squeezing through there To the right down here Should be another area that's of interest Maybe the change something about it. I don't know Hopefully we can actually get a little bit down into the lava zone It's not too deep it's just over one of the ridges down here a Lot of bad sounds going on Okay, I am worried about our depth Because the lavas on is further down again so this bad point this is a Sea dragon and we'll get to one of those eventually But this is the remains of a sea dragon, and I think it was a mother and it was pregnant I can't remember the specifics one of the areas around here Oh through there one of the areas around here tells the story of what actually happened to that creature And I think it like crashed into something and hurt itself and then died oh I did not bring any water with me oh That's what I was supposed to do this area Then this look familiar Pretty badass huh, this is the thermal print? More pers around though I can hear them. I don't think I can go in here yet. Oh Fuck he's right up there. Oh, oh oh stay low stay low our division. Oh god. There's another one there See they're all around this shit because this is Dick analysis reads caution hazardous materials and life-forms contained within Oh Pookie Nice I'm not going there because they don't have any Purple artifacts I didn't bring that stuff with me because that's not the purpose of our journey right now Okay you guys just have lithium on you It's really worrying oh the tree of life It's so cool, it's even more Full of life than when I came through it the first time Wow Isn't the theory that this thing or maybe it's actually fact that this thing is just a giant egg waiting to hatch I Like that theory I subscribe for that theory I think that that's a good one Okay, yeah, we still need to go like another 100 meters down and we can't so What's gonna have to happen is when I go down here? I'm gonna have to get out, but as you can see The walls certain to get very weird Because we are starting to get down into lava territory, so this is all hardened lava Cooled and hardened, you know like me cool and Harden okay, death reached damage imminent Okay fuck man This is where I built a base before I built a base right there last time and I do hope to do it again All right down I go Where I died nobody knows I Need new materials or anything there's Ruby down here, but I don't want to fill up on rubies ah Shit I Can't even go down oh No what am I supposed to do wait how am I supposed to get the kyanite then I? Can't make Sally go any further down, and I can't bring my pron suit down because that's too deep for it But I need to get more depth for my pron suit. I need to get The kyanite which is down there So what do we do? Okay first off and put you down We put we we put you down and we call you doll for fuck's sake just Make it two different buttons just make right-clicking on him be able to edit him Lava zone Okay I Get kinda any closer Nickel oh There was nickel down here oh Nice nickel is for... ugh, I think it's just for the joke jet upgrade though Not really what I want here's some gel sacks again, I guess I'll bring them Okay, just give me a bunch of nickel or something then I Mean I could chance going down into it and seeing how long I last I don't have a medkit with me though uh Irritating I think I get it well. I'm gonna have to head back anyway because I'm starting to get thirsty in-game But I think because in my brain, I wasn't ever able to come down here regularly With the Cyclops and everything because I had to go down through all these gaps and holes everything and I made life Just really hard for myself, but now that I have the blood kelp zone. It should mean I'm able to come down here with the Cyclops pretty easily Because now that I have nickel ore I'm able to make The Cyclops depth modular mark - which brings me beyond 900 meters And then to get the kyanite I need to come down here with that So it actually does make logical sense cuz I was thinking how am I supposed to get the clay night down there if I need? The kyanite to get the upgrade to be able to be even to go down there kind of thing So now I know it makes far more sense hi guys These guys are nice because they don't attack me They're not shitheads And also bringing the Cyclops down it's gonna be a major plus for us, too Because it has the fabricator and it also has the battery charger, and it has the the farm and everything on it so I should be able to just survive longer as a cause of that so I Just leave Thanks When did it's go? Forgot fuck off how do we shoot and wish your torpedo? Oh? I don't know oh, I have to be on it right oh Okay, okay, that would have been handy a couple of seconds ago It's okay. I got it though. Don't worry. I'm I need a repair tool Rep I need a repair tool You can't switch quickly between items when you first equip them because it just doesn't work Before okay, okay you want you want to come at me you want to come at me? Nice oh jesus fucking brought him closer. I don't want that There was a vortex one And I had a nuke ribbon for text one was that oh is that just in it Okay, well, I hope you learned your lesson all right Now tell your friends. I will fuck them up if they come any closer See wouldn't it be cool. If there was a creature that size of the game Fuck fuck fuck Okay, okay, take that take that is that guy's mode good Yeah, you better run no. I'm just about to make it back. I've almost died in here a thirst That would suck is when you die you lose all the items that were in your inventory That you've gotten before you get back to your base so anything that I collected while I was out aka nickel Or would have all been destroyed. I think and I would have to go back and get them again oh Man Now works out better because I have the water filtration system Which means I can just I don't have to farm a bunch of stuff and then go Like turn it into water, okay, I can just braaap oh hey Nice and then I can just Fall as a boss Okay, what what are you doing? Pick the chair picked up data. Plant nice now. I'm full oh That was a close call alright. Let's get building some frickin modules shall we is it in here I build it depth module I need to plasteel ingot so I need a lot titanium I Need three more titanium do I have more titanium I Just I had four I Just had three, and I need a lithium to be able to do it nice nice nice nice nice nice nice. Oh I need a titanium ingot first, and then a plasteel ingot there. You know you know you know you know and Then I need to lithium That's okay, bro, I have two lithium see getting all those resources that time of the island pay dividends Sick Alright, I need the actual upgrade module out of you, right So if I dumped you in here I got a bunch of you ran, and I crystals as well Just in case I need them. I think I need them later on for some nuclear. It's pronounced new killer I need it first stuff like that later on All systems online um let me get me just make sure of a few things I don't want to put What does he prawn suit depth module yeah? I do need kyanite for that but isn't Can we just find bits of kyanite? It's in Koine a thing that's in giant chunks that I have to drill away at we're gonna get down there to do that I Don't know oh, I have a message Don't like it that's them saying they're pissed off because I left That it Okay Thanks, I guess That you there, yeah, that's probably just them being pissed off cuz I swam away, and they couldn't catch me too nimble Jack be nimble That's the Rhine Alrighty So deep can the Cyclops go now Then go to 500 naturally my upgrade brought it to 900 so there's this fella Bree it's like 1200 No way 1300 meters whoa Jesus so in the earlier days as well if I eat a prawn suit or a seamoth in the Cyclops And I went below their limit, but the Cyclops could go past that it didn't do anything to them But now I'm afraid it might explode them You know Would like an upgrade module for you, though That'd be pretty neat I'm gonna take this And I'm gonna put it back here No, not that one this one. That's at zero there we go It's a little like pod that I have to get to There is which Life pod is it? Life pod to use lifeboat some 500 metres before she abandoned it, okay. Let's go there Whoa you're pretty damn far away. I Didn't really check where I was either right now. Oh, I'm at the side of the island okay these floater things are always around there Yeah, cuz I couldn't go down this far before it could I passed 500 meters Oh That's scary, man. My life. Pod worked out fine. I don't know what happened to all you guys mine mine just landed in the safe shallows places literally call that you guys landed in like the deep dark devil caves Probably fucking down here. That's terrifying no wonder you died oh crap squid Okay, no what what Oh, ghost of Ison, is that the one I found that time the first one I found Yeah, well we got PDA oh You piece shit, it's working. I can't do anything to him. I can't do anything to him. I supposed to do okay We've stopped sinking Ferb the oxygens going to run out in 30 minutes and with 500 meters down. What do we do? We'll have to use the remaining juice to send a distress call and build whatever gear we can Then we find a way to the surface then we find a way to the surface   crab squid Yeah, tell me how that worked out okay, I am almost dead I have very very little health right now That was terrifying I Thought I was safe inside this thing so anything else. Oh who gives a shit, I'm out oh Fuck go wake awake awake. Awake away. Everybody go away. No wait. I just want to go home Alright, well that's about all the time. I have for this episode alright well thats about all the time we have for this video we do we did make a journey back down and we got some stuff to increase its time. We do we did make a journey back down and we got some stuff to increase it next time we're gonna make another journey back down and hopefully get a were going to make another journey back down and hopfully get some more items Few more items that might help us, I don't know how that's gonna work out God. I'm running out of power fast i dont now how thats going to work out god. i am running out of power fast Because I have to bring the prong suit down to get the kyanite. I think you've any water in you It's salt water takes forever I should just build two of these machines We've to bring the flake up stone with the prong suit in it, and then we have to but hopefully we wont need the prawn suit at all. But hopefully we won't need the prawn suit at all But if we do I have to figure out a way of getting down and getting kind like with that and then working from there And then I want to build there the jump jet upgrade for that But I need crystalline sulfur for it new thing I've had before is Cave sulfur So I don't know for crystalline software comes from but it's all part of the journey and as I said Because it's fucking nighttime As I said, this is still... I'm trying to take my time with this I'm trying not to jump over too many gaps And I'm trying to just share this journey and this adventure with people and just keep it going because it's fun It's it's easy to sit back and just like ne- feel like you need to constantly make progress, but sometimes It's nice to just sit back relax and talk about a few things, and let the game sort of just unfold in front of you So I like that aspect of playing this game But for now, thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it, PUNCH THAT LIKE BUTTON IN THE FACE LIKE A BOSS! And, (quietly) high fives all around (epic high fiving sounds) THANK YOU GUYS, AND I WILL SEE ALL YOU DUDES, IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!! (I'm everywhere by "Teknoaxe" plays) *Mwah* we love you Sally! 
Top of the morning to ya laddies! My name is jacksepticeye and welcome back to Subnautious! Woah, that mountain looked - the thing over here looks WAAY closer when you go to the side. Jyeesus! I thought you were right beside me, but you're not! Erm, so first things first before we can go in our Sally, Uh, I do have to name you after a while, but don't I need the-- The moon pool thing to be able to do that? Can't remember, but I have some messages that I need, need to do and also I have some feet. Hey whats up! Come in! [Radio: Playing pre-recorded distress call...] Jack: Thanks.
[Radio: This is officer Keen in life pod 19, the captain is gone. Radio: I have assumed command. The last thing the captain did was give me coordinates for dry land] Jack: Aha!
[Radio: "We regroup at one and a half kilometers south-west of the crash-site.] [Radio: Stay together and good luck.] [Radio: This message will now repeat." ]
Jack: Oh, please don't. [Cindy: "rendezvous coordinates corrupted transmission origin coordinates downloaded"]
Jack: Okay, then I'll just- [Cindy: Signal location uploaded to PDA] Jack: Can you stop? Then I'll just go there. It's over... Wait isn't it over behind me? Yeah. Lifepod nineteen, cuz they're just talking about the, the landmass that's over there. The mountain that I already talked about. You know why? 'cause I'm th-the king of Subnautica, I'm the best! Not really. Umm I need to get some bladay fish (Bladderfish) before I can head off because I'm gonna die of thirst. That's a creepvine seed cluster that I left there, that'll come in handy later on when I don't care. Erm.. Wait, why would I use this fuckin' grav thing? Hold on a minute, go-go-gadget grav-ball! Bladder fish! I choose you! Uh, you didn't catch the bladder fish. You catch limestone deposits though, that's pretty fucking cool. I didn't know you did that, okay? I'mma just grab all you- I'm, I'mma gonna just grab all you. Hey, It's a new one, it's a Hoopfish! That's a fish that loves to play basketball. He gets mad ups. 'Kay, I got my bladder fish. Got A bladder fish. Okay. You guys can go, wait! Bladder fish! C'mere! I got him I got him everyone calm down. I got him. It's fine. I need to go make some water and some food because I'm a hungry baby boy And before I head off, I need to do this. Cuz when it comes to long journeys, you gotta be prepared you gotta get your water, you gotta get your food. You gotta get your nutrients, otherwise you're going out there in an empty belly belly. Now, that's not good for anybody If I cure you though... "Seek fluid intake" (Cindy) Seek? Seek my ASS. Okay? Did ya ever think about that? No you didn't. You guys reduce O2 *gasp* BUT THAt increases Did I just eat both of my fish? Ooh, what happened your hand? I just ate both my fish like a dumb. That was stupid. Oh well. Into da ocean I go. Sally! Jack: Hi, Sally!
[Sally: Welcome aboard captain.] Welcome aboard me. All right, we're heading off. Go away farty boys! They're like far--they're like the party boys, but smelly. I wanna--I wanna to go over here and we have to get this thing It's good to just check out all the life pods anyway. Maybe THIS is the one that is near the wreck. I believe it this time. I think I'm right on this one. Last one? I was wrong, but it does get me towards that other place, over there, the cave system. Which, I'll be able to go down eventually... In my... seamoth- Wait, what's the maximum crushing depth for this? 200! Okay, It says it at the top. That's kind of cool It shows you where you are and the max Nice! Put a little smile-o on my face :) Okay, we'll hop out at this one, because there should be some schematics around 'Kay this is for the bioreactor, that's good. I need dis, dis I need dis me! Dis good. Yes! [Cindy: "New blueprint acquired"]
Jack: Mmm, nothing, nothing! ooooOOOHOOOO-OO-HOO I hear ya baby! Erm.. Nothing... fuckin' NOTHING.. Are you- Oh Scanner room fragment, I needed one of those... *Weird face Jackaboy* Ah! crap, I need another one. Hey! Reefies! How ya doin'? Long time no smell. Yay! Here's the last one :D And... BADOINK! Okay, cool, got it. [Cindy: "New blueprint acquired"] Metal salvage? I can get you any fucking time, anywhere. Can I get any of this? No. Alright, we are deep down now! *Reefback noises echoing in distance* Ohhh, we're in the ocean now! *Jack mimicking Reefbacks' noises* Just talking to my dolphin buddies. Jack: (imitating Sally) "Welcome aboard captain" Yeah, y-you're missing that this time. Why-why there is no welcome aboard? S'fine I don't need it, :( It's cool. I wish I had a lot more beacons. That's a seamoth fragment, isn't it? Yeaah. That-wait wait wait wait wait, get out again. That's cool-lookin'! Sally in the front, the reefbacks in the back! *Smiley Jackaboi* Whooooooa. If ANY game could give erections... It would be this one. Actually-many games, there's lots of games I played that give me erections Shadow of the Colossus... Bloodborne... Dark Souls...DUUUDE, they're releasin--re-releasing Dark Souls, for the Switch! I'm so goddamn happy about that. I can poop and prepare to die at the same time! (What??) Prepare to poop! I'll make a series like that! Just p-play Dark Souls on the toilet and call it "Prepare to Poop". *Lolz* Oh, shit. You're deeper than my crushing distance aren't you... Okay, there's some stuff over here though as well. Dammit, man. A lot of shit over here. What are you for? *Boom* Vehicle upgrade console! Hell yeah! Thermal plant! Wait, thermal plant's pointless for me. I mean, it's good to have... later on, I'm gonna need it but... It's only around like the thermal vents that I'll be able to place it where I am... ...currently. And that's not that good. Okay, anything else...? Ooh! What are you? A second one! Dude, I am getting soooo many... fragments. *Gasp* yes!! Prawn suit parts! I don't get most of the prawn suit stuff, until I... go to the Aurora... so that's gonna be on our mission list as well. Keep that in mind, keep that in the back of the head-o. What are you, Thermal plant? Yeaaah. There's all the parts! Also, re-Oh wait! I had all the parts! 
 ...nice! Also, Rebreather...v-very very handy. [Cindy: "Biodiversity in this region is unusually low. Cause: unknown."] Whaaat...? *Boom* ...oh HELLL YEAHH. [Cindy: "New blueprint acquired."] Do you have... ANY idea how long it took me to get these things when I played it before??... Whoa, wHoA, what's down here?? WHOA. Okay, Sally come here for a second. I need-I need air... Shit, I only have 12 percent left in this thing [Sally:"WARNING, maximum depth reached. HULL DAMAGE IMMINENT!"] Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay? Okay? I'm backing up. I'm backing up, I'M BACKING UP!!!! Wait, I got all the thermal plant parts. Where did I fucking see that thing?? Is it over here?...yeaah. whAT DIS??? What the hell?? Scan it... Alien vent! These are new. "These vents connect to an ancient piping network that extends beyond maximum scannable depth, the pumping system is still functional. The inflow vent is drawing water from the surrounding area and pumping it into the unknown location below the surface." *fFFFF* "Most creatures are avoiding the vents. Assesment: Further research required." Oooooh cool! Neato! Whoa, that's fucking scary, look at that! Are those the lights for my Sally? Duuuude, that's awesome. What are you?  *Click* A RUBY?? ... What the hell do you use rubies for??? This is brand new information! I'mma collect a bunch of them! Oh wait, this is THAT area. Ohhhh, oh, I fucking HATE this area! I hate every area! They scare me. *Underwater bubbles* ...Okay. [Cindy: *boop boop* "Thirty seconds"]
Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh crap, I've only 4% power left in this thing. I, NEED to get... More beacons cuz I need to start putting down. Oh shit. You're all the way over there. I need to start putting down beacons for where these places are. Shouldn't be that hard to find it again, right? Oh god, OH. "Warning maximum depth"-oh god.-"reached" yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah *BAM* AH! SHI- stop stop stop stop stop... Okay, we've got to go down into the ARSE end of nowhere. Imma shine some lights down so I have... Okay, this rebreather is the thing that's keeping me... Alive, right now. Because I wouldn't be able to make these trips... Without it. Cuz I'm so deep down... *sh-plonk* Okay, let's see if we can hear this. I'm not gonna talk so, Robin you can boost the audio so we can listen to this "CAPTAIN: Keen! This is Aurora, come in! KEEN: This is Keen, lifepod detached okay, planetfall in 30 seconds! CAPTAIN: The computer has identified a landmass at the attached coordinates! I want you to regroup the crew there! KEEN: Understood, but- CAPTAIN: They are your responsibility now, don't let them down! KEEN: Captain, you need to evacuate! CAPTAIN: Negative, you'll need the ship in one piece if you're going to contact HQ on the long range. I'm attempting...a controlled descent." "KEEN: CAPTAIN?!" Ooh, that sounded cool Damn Okay, so what did I get? I got a thing for-- advanced air supply or like an extra air supply-- thing. This is-- awesome, man! This game has come so many leaps and bounds! Uuuuh, Seamoth, seamoth depth module mark 3 and mark 2 Ultra high capacity air tank. Ah, I need lithium, fuck. Wait, I'm making-I'm making a trip to... I'm making a trip to the island...anyway, back from where Henry is. Oh my god where am I? Oh god, that was scary I could not see a thing. Oh, I'm getting that- Oh there it is! That's the-that's the island I'm getting that uneasy feeling again. Ah! There's uh- aw, I wanted to try to jump the reef back, cuz when I come out at the water, I can get some air Like that, that's not enough t-to go pass him. Hi, buddy! How's it going? Good, glad to hear it! Hoo, okay, uh. One second, I'm gonna repair Gonna repair Sally here real quick And get back in. Nice, woo. Those dark depths, no matter how often I played this game, are gonna terrify me because there's just so much unknown going on. It's so pretty It's also crazy that I still have so much like gusto for this game Even after playing it so often Do I have all these parts? I think I do yeah? Because it's like, it never ceases to amaze me the type of game that this is a game like this has never really been done before this either. Nobody's, nobody's done a game. That's all underwater Because most games that are, that have underwater seg-segments are a fucking nightmare. *Runs into fish* Oh, sorry little buddy Cuz underwater segments are just a pain in the ass to do because it takes up so many, uh, game resources Oh shit yeah, I don't have anything Oooh, I have all these I'm not scanning them cause all they're gonna give me is a shit ton of titanium. I don't wanna bog down my inventory with that. Alright, let's head back. What say we make a little trip over to an island, huh? Let's say we head over this direction and head over to our island buddy. Now, we need to be careful because we could end up getting trapped by a--or warper. *clears throat* Reaper is also a a factor, but that guy's dwelling like deep down... So, I have to go down further to get to him, so that shouldn't be THAT much of a problem But, the warper hangs around the area that I kind of need to go to... and... before he was never able to warp you...in the seamoth But I think that that was just a thing that wasn't implemented properly, so now he might be able to warp me and I don't want that to happen. I don't think he'd warped me that far, but just in case. Ooooh, I probably should have made a battery... For my Seaglide Shit. I hear you, shut up, go back to eat metal. 'Kay, we should be coming up on it soon Yep *lolz* "Should be coming up on it soon", THERE SHE BLOWS! Alright, I need to be careful because I don't know if anything else has been added... Oh, I hear the Reaper. I hear him already. Normally there's a warper around this side... Can you hear him? The Reaper, that is. (ok Yoda) See this is the thing, I know where everything is, I'm still scared. I just want to see him. Famous last words. Keep your peepers peepled (peeled?). Every fucking like, little movement, I think is him Reaper??? Ah! There he is! What a cute boy. God, he looks so small in the distance All right, we here. Hey, just stay down there shut up. All right, what are these things are you-- "Detecting massive energy signature in the region. Cannot identify." (Cindy) Yeah, I know what it is, it's a big fucking gun. Yeah, let's get out and explore the island...just a tad. Ah, oh you guys, can you like, uh! d'oh! Fuck! Jesus, I don't like you Stop it 'Kay, I'm not even gonna message him just leavin'. Hello island! Missed ya! Ah, there we go a purple tablet. That goes in down here, didn't it? Um, um ah-fuck. I'm not here to do all this stuff yet I'm here to-Can I scan this? Yeah. I'm here to just grab some, some diamonds and stuff. There you go. I mean we can go in the first door. "Scans indicate this structure is composed of a metal alloy with unprecedented integrity" Integrity "No matches found in database. Performing structural analysis." (Cindy) Okay, I myself scan myself again just to see..."Self scan complete, foreign bacterial count has reached statistically significant levels, no adverse effects detected, be vigilant for symptoms." (Cindy) Uh oh, I'm starting to get affected by it just by being on the planet and in the water. "Unknown language. Attempting translation." (Cindy) Yes, please Ah, discovered inside an alien facility it was not possible to translate any useful information. However, scans have returned some information on the device itself. It is likely a solid-state computer, although there is no clear way to interface with it, on approach it began producing a low-frequency radio wave containing complex, but recognizable data patterns. It is likely the alien species which designed this technology evolved or genetically selected sensory apparatus to hear and understand the information being broadcast by the device and to communicate back. The mental processing power required to perform this kind of telepathy would imply the designers were considerably more psychologically developed than the common human. Further research required. Yeah, and we know that they were able to harness that power and put it into like warpers and then warp technology and all this kinda shit. Cool, I got me-self a block. What was in this base? What was at the end of all this area I can't remember But hey! We're back and we're discovering stuff again! "Unknown language. Attempting translation." (Cindy) The fuck is going on in front of me? "Your best probability of Interfacing with this facility is achieved by accessing the control room in the lower section." (Cindy) Yah. Enforcement platform schematic. This data set appears to be a multi-dimensional schematic of some kind. By mapping the pattern to three-dimensional space it is possible to gather a basic understanding of this facility's inner workings. Yeah, that's how that works The facilities unknown construction material is identified as an ultra hard, non-reactive metal amalgam synthesized from off-world materials. There is no indication that it can be damaged or destroyed by available means. The schematic indicates the facility was to be powered by a separate, self sustaining power plant, located elsewhere on the planet. The location is not listed, but there is evidence the designers intended to harness the planet's natural thermal energy. So that's the one that, that all the ones that are deep down In the area that I went past t-the crab squids and you get into the active lava zone. That's, that's all this stuff. They're like, they have facilities there, that're just huge thermal plants. The facility consists of the upper engineering section where this schematic was found in the control room which is accessed via a security sealed elevator shaft or a separate underwater moon pool. The control room in the lower section houses the only known way to interface with the facility, however the schematic does not detail the operation procedure our installed security measures. Oh yeah, we go down in this. Wee! *shook noises* Man that make you vomit up your shit Ah hah! Yes indeedy Oh yeah, it just comes out there. Now I remember. What else you got? Show me what you got. Yes, more ion crystals. Need dem. Okay, we go here before we go up. Oh, I got messages Hmm, it would seem it time-a portal. What are you telling me I can scan? I walked past something and the scanner showed up. Oh wait, wrong one. Oh, just the whole thing, Jesus. This structures intended purpose is unclear. Theories on function: ceremonial or religious role...jus- we know what it does. It's a teleportation hole. It's not active right now, is it? No. But you're normally able to put ion cubes in these and travel somewhere, but...maybe this one is dysfunctional. Time to head up Ooo, oo, oooOO Whoa! An alien rifle?! Wasn't this in a much different area before? *old man jacksepticeye* wHOAaa That's badass! Strong resemblance to human weaponry inform this device must have been designed with a humanite user in mind Whether the aliens that built the structure with themselves humanoid or otherwise employed the use of humanoids is unclear. What is clear is that they consider defending this facility a necessary precaution. There's no obvious way to remove the rifle from the case Can we scan it and reverse-engineer it? Thought that's what you're gonna. Tell me that I was getting like a part of it, and then I could make it oh Oo! Thanks! Wow, another purple uh--tablet So this whole place as we know eventually-Oh God-eventually ends up shooting down our Sunbeam that's coming to save us. The fuck is this thing? Looks like a doomsday device that Professor Farnsworth has. iT IS A DOOMSDAY DEVICE *laughs* I was only fuckin' messin' Scans indicate this device contains enough potential energy to destroy the entire planet along with most of the solar system fortunately it has malfunctioned. That is not a thing you want to hear with a- a doomsday device. Oh my god that has to be some kind of fucking reference or something, that was too perfect. "Scans indicate the facility's control room, lies beyond this doorway." Wait, I wasn't able to get all those materials and tablets and all that stuff before, was I? Just by going through the area once? Maybe they restructured how everything works. Oh god what am I gonna do? AHh he's gonna stab me! He's gonna stab me, watch out! AAAAh "The control panel is broadcasting a message. Translation reads: warning infected individuals may not disable the weapon. This planet is under quarantine." (Cindy) I get it, so the only way to stop... Th-the gun shooting down the Aurora... "Translating background broadcast. Downloading summary to databank." (Cindy) Is there any way to stop it shooting down the- the Sunbeam from coming down is if I find the cure already, but I don't think you can actually do that first. Intercepted background data regarding further alien facilities elsewhere on the planet. Death 800 meters, blah blah blah. We know all these ones. The disease research facility. Cave system with extensive fossil record Because I've been to all of these, but I can't remember which ones were which? I know the prison, is the last one. The thermal plant I think is the one on the right when you go into that cave system. Then you go down further into the BIG lava zone where the fucking dragon is. The event of an outbreak quarantine procedures will be automatically enforced. Yeah, so the whole story for this game is that they were working on something... And an outbreak occurred and a disease spread, and they were trying to figure out how they stop it And then they had safety precautions. I think that put the planet into quarantine and all these facilities kind of shut down, and they either left or died. I was never really too keyed and what exactly happened, because everything was kind of just, intermittent information, passed down. But, they also had the-the the Sea Emperor The telepathic creature, that's down below in the very last facility. They had them and Were trying to figure out how to utilize their blood to fix everything, I think. They also had their babies And they weren't allowed let out all this kind of stuff So I need to get there and I need to synthesize a cure for myself from that facility And then I can come back here and do something and that's how you end up launching the rocket to leave the planet Is by figuring all that out and then you're able to just go. I'm heading out this way Okay, well. We explored way further into this than I expected to. I didn't intend on coming in here at all I just wanted to get to the island to get some diamonds and stuff, but I Liked the first time I discovered these areas, cause when the game came out I don't think the developers had all this stuff in mind, all this story element or maybe they did, But there was no indication of it ANYWHERE When the game very first came out cuz I-I was one of the the earlier youtubers to play the game when it came out in early access and then All it was was a game about being on a planet -that's cool- Being on a planet with alien creatures, and the whole planet was kind of water and stuff But there was no indication of any sort of story or any sort of way of Getting off the planet or any idea of why these creatures were here Or what the hell was going on nothing like that? It was just a game where you explored and then they started trickling in all this other stuff Which I think was such a good idea, and they they handled it so very very well Because it had a lot of cool intrigue to the game And plus, I just love aliens, I love technology, I love teleporting, I love all that kind of shit, So, I'm going out the other side 'cause I think that that's where I first- Well I'm going on the other side mainly to get away from him, also, I think that's where I got my most diamonds and shit before. and then, down there is the moon pool that I was just at If you've watched me play Subnautica before, this is all What was that? What was that? Oh the warper! He has a different sound, that was awesome. He sounded so mechanical Okay, I'm getting away from him. I really don't like him. Okay, I just want elements, please there we go "Remember that materials you gather are the property of the Alterra Corporation"  (Cindy) sHUT UP "You will be liable to reimburse the full market price. Your current bill stands at 3 million credits." Fucks sake. *laughs* Not that you have a humor setting Um, but yeah, I was right the diamonds are all around this island. Really wish my seaglide had some batteries in it. What is this? What are you? *gASP* Yes! Cyclops fragments! OOOOO baby! Shit's gonna get real fun if I-if I'm able to build one of them. Blue Pom, Cave bush! Yeah, I don't want to scan every single little thing... ooh purple tablet.. Purple tablet, purple tablet, okay, I think that might lead to an area somewhere. I'm not here to do all that. I'm just here to get some diamonds. I think I only needed like two... Well silver ore still really good. I shouldn't--shouldn't--shouldn't owWW Shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth is what I was gonna say Before I got violently bitten on the ass. Oh shit. There's a warper right there Ooo. Lithium, I needed that as well didn't I? Okay, he's not really teleporting anywhere. He's like a *werw* sound now. Oh jesus, oh jesus, oh jesus, what the fuck you got there quick. The hell was that about? Is he gone? I don't know where he goes, I don't know where his patterns are. You know if I could just get a little bit more lithium, a little bit more diamonds And I'll leave. I'll stop interrupting all your shit at least for like a day or two. Then we'll back to fuck everything up. That's what I do in this game. Also. Have you noticed, very few hiccups in performance Remember when I would travel to this area and the whole game had the potential to just crash and stop working. Now it's fine Fantastic! Now, stay away from the Reaper... That's a warper. That's a fuckin warper. Oh, he's right there Go away (x11) No (x8) Fuck off (x4) Shit NoOOOOO Okay, that's fine. That's fine if you wanna do that again. That's okay. Please leave me alone (x4) noOO, shit. I don't like him. That's some scary, bad juju. Aww, the sounds he makes is awesome, all the sounds in this game are awesome Okay, I keep finding silver and gold and all that stuff, but not enough diamonds again. I also need four lithium. Wow, look at all the stuff I have. I need four lithium to be able to make the ultra air-tank. That's what I needed it for. Maybe they're only on the other side. Little bit of a freeze up there, but nothing major. NOo, lithium and diamonds. Diamonds are-a jacks best friend. I told you this. Yes! Got 'em all, four lithium and I actually ended up getting three diamonds. But that's all I need right now now I can head back to Henry and start making some gooood- Start making that good shit. Start making that- aah fuck you little bite arse - Start making that like good, clean, uncut shit. You know? What was I making again? Oh, high-capacity air tank andddd I spent so long away from home that I forget what I'm making aaaandd *SMACK* The laser quarter, that's what I was making. Uh, I don't have a battery for you Shite Do I even have anything to make a battery? Oh, I've lots of copper ore that I just got out of that place. Oh, I need some acid mushrooms. Just get those acid mushrooms maaan and then you're-then you're sailing hiiigh mann, then you're making a fuckin' laser cutter duuuude Um, while you're doing that I will be getting some cave sulfur. Um, mah cave sulfur's not in there. Cave sulfur's in here. NoO I don't know how much I needed A Uraninite crystal? Don't need that. I mean, I will later, but right now, I don't I don't even have a fucking-- I don't even have a bay for all my stuff, like all my vehicles Laser cutter, cool. Now we'll be able to go around and check out all those wrecks, um- I got stuff for the propulsion cannon as well, so I need a wiring kit- "Seek fluid intake" (Cindy) That would be very wise uUUM Why do I keep forgetting what I'm making? Something up here... ultra high-capacity air tank! Okay, how do I-how do I make that? Pull you over into my thing... Okay, I gotta dispose! Boom, boo-no I need the foods, um, a bunch of these are no use to me. You in there... Should be able to make it-- Som- wait, what?! Is this one of those things that I need another Fabricator in like the base. There's like different fabricators, like a vehicle fabricator? Yes, it's not down here. Well, that's suck. Yeah, need a modification station for those. Okay, I don't even have the parts necessary yet to do that, so I was over there finding lithium for no reason, it's fine. It's all good. Jesus. It's weird when it gets dark so quick So, I need to deposit all of these... I don't have enough room. Could I make another one? Right, I need to answer some messages, and I need to Okay, I only need four titanium for this... That's not, that's not it, that's not how many I needed. Make a NEW locker Thanks. Yes, yes, yes, I know I have messages. But I also have to go and get water. Uh oh, I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm down to less than ten water. Oh fuck, bladder fish! Bladder fish, I NEED you! Where are you buddies?! Grav trap! Bladder fish, bladder fish, yes! I see you! I see you! I'm coming babies! I'm coming! Dad is coming! Here we go! Get these and we are good. Grab (x9). Okay, there's no one over here. We should find-Don't you eat him! I need him! That's my meal. Okay, c'mon (x4) (jack r u ok?) Massages? Play them to my ear holes. "Playing partially translated broadcast." (Cindy) "*distorted noises* Nine new biological subjects designated. Mode *distorted noises* hunting/analyzing. Sharing subject locations with other agents *distorted noises*" That was fUCKING cool Is that the warpers talking? Because the warpers were like, biological containment agents, their--their job was to go around and warp people to the locations where they could deal with them. Oh, that was awesome! Alright, so I think I'm gonna leave my episode here. I know it's gonna sad in a lot of you We-we at least got to go to the island and go through the alien base again. And see what was changed, not a whole lot was changed, but we actually got to go through the whole base so, now we can continue on doing our own stuff outside of that. Think I might head to this island next time and try and get some resources from there, what I need to start getting now is a modification station for my for my vehicles and I still need to start building a base and getting a moon pool and everything in that so I can start housing them and Then I need to start getting some-- See the problem is I need a lot of fragments for these things So I need to gather fragments for my battery recharge station as well because that's gonna come in really handy later on. Actually, it's gonna be come in really handy right now Cuz I don't even have any batteries right now for my seaglide so all of that stuff needs to happen But I'm-I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying it. I thought it would be a chore to go through all the stuff again, especially since I'm playing just Survival mode. So having to get food and water and having to find all the fragments again having to find all the materials again But I'm having a blast man. It feels like it's easier to find stuff, which is good because last time we was just so convoluted and it was also a fact of it was already accessed so stuff was kind of bugging out and stuff wasn't showing up in the areas that was supposed to, my saves were all broken and then I was I had to spawn some things in and then it broke other things so It's just so much more streamlined, and it's such a joy wait. Oh, actually next time we might make our way to the Aurora And I have my laser cutter now so I can start breaking into all these wrecks That's what we're doing, anyway, Thank you guys so much for watching this video - if you liked it punch that like button in the face! Like a boss! And high fives all around... *WAPOOSH* *WAPOOSH* Thank you guys and I'll see all you dudes in the next video! I'm gonna have to stay far away from those warpers. They suck. They're looking for me. 
And now Twitter comments with Jacksepticeye What are your favorite ways to stay organized? My favorite way to stay organized is not. I like to have my day and my life in pure chaos all the time So that every day is a new adventure and everything is completely Spontaneous and random 'cus that's what keeps me light on my feet, so it keeps me on my toes That's why it keeps me like this Do you know any little tunes on your keyboard if so, can you play them for us sometime? I sure I haven't been practicing a lot though, so I'm a little rusty, but But that's all I know so far. Dr. Jack I need your help my manager gave me the flu What do I do? What you do is that you go back into work? And you sneeze and cough on every single other person that works in your workplace And then everyone's gonna have the flu and everyone's gonna be off for like two weeks And it's all gonna be the managers fault, and then you don't have to work for that amount of time I don't like coffee. I always wondered what it was like to be absolutely wrong about something in life. What's that like? Weird question, but what kind of dog is gizmo gizmo is a good dog. That's her only type That's all she needs to be like every dog, that ever existed. What's your favorite vine uh? That's a hard one probably grape I've heard a lot of things through that so it's very helpful Jack makes everything better. Ah that's a bold-faced lie There's plenty of things that I do not make better Funerals Circumcisions, bear hunting, and most if not all Medical procedures, what do you do to relieve stress? One one of two things it kind of depends on availability But the first thing I do if I can is punch a small child in the face Really gets the stress out really makes me feel like a big man. Makes me feel like I'm better than someone The second one would be screaming into a pillow if if there's no children nearby so either one of those usually works Why did you stop wearing your flat cap the flat cap killed my dad, so I just couldn't keep them around anymore Just it just wasn't gonna work out They've been on the run for quite a while now, so if you have any information, please contact authorities immediately Thanks. How did you start listening to heavy metal music? I think it started when I was about 15, 16 and it was kind of like this Do you still use eggnog in your coffee I would I seriously would because on one hand it was absolutely delicious And I made coffee SO good, but on the other hand I do want to live to see the age of 30 so... Kind of a pro's and con's situation. What's one horror movie that you really love? Shrek's a good one Mike Myers doing a Scottish accent.. *shivers* Ooh scary Are the egos okay? The Paul Brothers? I don't know I don't I don't talk to them What is the most valuable thing you learnt on tour? The most valuable thing I learned was The glory that is a proper toilet because nothing will make you miss your Home toilet more than being on a tour bus what movie would be greatly improved if it was made into a musical? Ooh.. tough question probably something like The Godfather or a Scarface. Like he kicks in it down that door is like say hello to my little friend While he's gunning people down Amazing. What do you have? I have absolutely zero fucks to give, that's what I have What game are you excited to play this year? I'm really excited to play the game of life this year I think this new season is actually going to be pretty decent if There's a lot of patches that have come in and I feel like I really have like the mechanics down now So I'm really looking forward to that And that does it for this episode of reading your comments if you had a chuckle if you had a laugh Like, comment and subscribe you can find me and all my funny Moments and jokes and sass on all my social medias especially my Flickr and my photo bucket account really poppin off lately Also check out my Swindell account That's that's really been going good lately.

Top of the morning to ya ladies , my name is Jackcepticeye and welcome back to subnautious Im here in my PDA immediately because there was a log i missed a while ago and i still didn't go back to it after saying i missed it, and i think it was lifepod 6? That people said lifepod 6 crew log one. I don't think I've listened to this I need you to stay calm. We're not in immediate danger Where are the rescue teams? The aurora didnt make it So where are the rescue teams? No, I listened to that I cant remember which one it was This one when the altaira crew landed in area of significant alien activity encountered predators in the Leviathan class highly aggressive spectroscope scanner assigned species designator Reaper one specimen attempted to swallow the Life pod doing extensive damage in the process Only viable option is to make the safety of the Aurora crash site I have retrieved a data box with the creature decoy and enough resources to fabricate a couple of them The swims longer than the decoy lifetime, but it should just be enough to keep them busy If you don't find me on board the ship presume. I miscalculated and you miscalculated so Maybe that's not the one that people were talking about but that was one that I didn't actually listen to I did get something for a creature decoy as a blueprint and Lord knows where the fuck it's gonna be in the middle of all this Probably pass it over as well. There's there's a creature decoy that you can make that you put down as Like a reapers gonna attack you and then all of a sudden. He'll attack that instead of attacking you Also, somebody gave me one of the best tips I've had and it's such a simple one is that if I put in a bed I skip nighttime wait how or do I need for bed fiber mesh and titanium? I don't think I have fiber mesh I can get it very easily, and I didn't know that in all the time. I've been playing subnautica I never knew that beds just skipped the night, and if I did know it it was ages ago, and i forgot. Oh yeah I've changed the color of my beacons Henry is still blue the the other beacons are red and Damn it. I'm like what am I full of. Oh god i have a lot of shit. It's still not enough space I destroyed the creep vine as well anyway God dang it Fohkssake never enough space yeah, so Sally is now yellow and That was the tip people gave me after because the episode that just went up is the one where I said I lost Sally so I'm quite a bit ahead in my own playthrough, then the YouTube Let's Plays are keeping up with and I'm trying to take some information as I can have any messages From the comments, but sometimes. I'm just delayed because you know I need two of them I'm delayed because I just have like my stuff is far ahead of that u know I could put up the posters in there Yeah, put a fire extinguisher Extinguishers in here okay? I'm gonna. Have a little base It's not much of a base there's not a whole lot going on, but it's my base Okay I put you you are i only have two posters? Hahaha Keep Calm and hang in there Kitty This one they look awesome I really like those I do have a model of an alterra airship And i dont know where to put you but you I did have a table Should I should I try and build a table again? I have two titanium that should be enough for a table right? Okay, no equip this there we go um interior module Still need to get my modification station I didn't get that oh yeah aerogel I need that badly - Where's that miscellaneous where do you- miscellaneous items a counter - titanium there we go boom Nice I put my little ship here It's cute Not a very complex looking ship, but it's a ship nonetheless. I want to deconstruct Sam and then we can place him on the table as well I Know guys, I'm starting to really like this little base He so what I want to do now is go looking for oh Jesus oh wait, what do I need to make a bed? titanium, fiber mesh I already knew that that's what I'm out here doing I Was getting rid of items so I could go get more creep vines. I wanna do is go get the Cyclops parts and maybe explore the other Island because there's some stuff in there that I desperately need Stuff like the I think that's where I found a lot of the farming stuff or at least that's where I find Inventory full? I'm fucking bad at this No, I have two now right yeah, now. I have enough to make there the thing I just need some titanium now I should have some back at my base Titanium is that one constant that you always have Even though I just used some to build my table so maybe not There we go - titanium, I need to make the fiber mesh, I'm all over the place Cuz now its night time and i dont like night time. I wanna just skip it. That good? okay cool Let me in let me in let me in geez and then a single bed I Don't know about you guys but if I was stranded on a planet like this of course that's going to happen if if this type of scenario happened to me where I was even just stranded at all and As ludicrous as it is to be able to just build things out of nothing in this game that would be such like a huge boon to my system to be able to just sit down and lie in a bed I Don't know I'd like I need to change all the batteries in these because I have nothing but full batteries Here we go so many batteries and then take you Jesus Christ now i have an overabundance Now I have a problem. Maybe I should try building a locker Interior modules a wall Locker, I just need two titanium I have one Surely to God I have some titanium laying around somewhere, right Titanium? No Fucking everything else all right. Oh, I'll be so cool if I could just put the wall Locker there wait wait wait wait wait wait Yeah It makes perfect sense to go here all right so drink that water I'll store two Store three med kits and a store three nutrient blocks Cyclops efficiency module. I can't use yet and these batteries can go out and the fucking flares Oh yet the other poster I had I did have another poster, but it was the one I put inside Henry It's like this one to go right there It's a prawn suit in that cool Very nice, I do also need to find some moon pool fragments. Eventually. I'm gonna take you Put you in the Sallers all right, let's make a move, oh wait no, I've got a bed first Can't make a move until I go to bed until they go to sleepy sleeps even though it's morning time now Well I guess I'm not gonna sleep all righty mushroom forest do your thing and give me items I Am in need of some Cyclops fragments I Do know that You hold some of the hull fragments, and I don't want to have to go to the other place Which I fear remember correctly is the sea treaders path? And that would be terrible I do not wanna have to go all the way over there to do it I don't actually can't even go down that deep right now I don't have anything that can go down that deep I think I had to use the Prawn suit the last time I was down there Crap keep thinking these are like good things But it's just like a chunk of rock that I need the francais to get through. What are you? What do you know? What are you moonpool fragment? Okay, that's also very useful I Will take that moonpool fragment if you can give me another one of those that would also be great cuz that's That's something that's on my to-do list as well I actually thought I was gonna have to wait longer to be able to do that so we get the moonpool then I can put in the the vehicle Bay, and then I can start storing Sally in there and just Messing about with stuff in that regard oh There's a Reaper around but he's the one over near the aurora so she keeps searching around here a lot of people want me to Yes Well, that's the Cyclops bridge fragment. That's still good I Do need that I need one more of those and I need one more Full fragment and one more moonpool fragment a lot of people say to leave this Series uncut I said this before but Whoa what happened to you This is all I'm doing in the sections that are not like put into the series I'm literally just dicking around and looking for stuff. It's not even anything worthwhile. Do not come near me you shits You leave me alone, what is this scanning room fragment? I have that Okay be extra careful No no no no no no no no no no no fucking Mesmer's oh Jesus I've never come across one like that da fuck oh Man this place sucks I'm back in a tin mushroom forest where these guys are these guys don't even want anything to do with me Sure, they don't like me, but they don't gonna beat the shit out of me at the same time The Mesmer's I knew they were in the game, and I think I'd actually seen them before But I can't remember ever having that happen because what they do is they suck you in and then hurt you By like hypnotizing you Okay, give me those fragments I Need another whole fragment fuck So these vents I Talked about them before and I said how cool they were? But people are explaining them hmm like I didn't know what they were I know exactly where they go Yes, no Cool baby Actually now, I might actually Fuck yeah Now just give me that last bridge piece, I know where the events go I know what they're doing I know who they're pumping water to It's just that before I kind of just expunged the entire information of what this whole game was and I felt a little bad about spoiling everything so now I'm just gonna kind of lay back and Talk about stuff as it happens or at least if it's the next thing that I'm definitely doing oh wait Let me radiation helmet on I don't need that anymore Why my oxygen was running out so quick Whenever I get back to Henry I need to remember to put on my rebreather because now I have fixed the seal so now there's no radiation anymore And I didn't find there the pieces that I needed for thing That's gone, I didn't find the Pieces of the Cyclops that I needed, but I can build a moon pool all right now Elaine talking about oh I need to farm for a bunch more stuff I mean as long as I can get enough titanium right this second I have enough I Need to make two titanium ingots So I just need as much metal salvage so they can put the titanium ingots cost ten each So need 20 titanium to lead and something else that they already had I have the lead back at my base so Logic says I can build this bitch And I'm very happy about that That is something good going on in my life. I can't see anymore Matt, and I probably passed the freaking Cyclops fragment as well this is it's so dense in there that it's really hard to see I Think I can do it. I think I can do it can I do it Do you not need to be attached to my other one can I touch you is that another thing I can do This is weird this is all freaky, okay, I can't put you there cuz I can't get me fucking thing to get over there Okay, this is awkward. I wanted to put him near my other base, but Just put it here for now I can always deconstruct and come back after Wait will you you only have one leg holding y'all? How is that any good Baby Cool wait you have power Are you technically counted as part of the other one? Man I'm not even going to question it I do have to put up a power transmitter though vehicle upgrade console computer chip copper wire Three titanium all after weeks without human contact it is normal to experience psychological discomfort Research indicates symptoms may be partly alleviated by a doctor Inanimate object inanimate object, I'll just bring my Sam around with me Right I'm going to go Fuhrman to get all the materials. I need for the thing but first I'm a I'm a test out my bed Haven't I stood over my bed yet? I need to get in there and test that out and see if that works bed oh Yeah, oh, yeah probably not the best sleep since you don't have you're not getting under blankets and You're soaked Hey man first night's sleep you got in I don't know fucking how long how many days have we been here So far I can't check that right off the bat So you can hear acquit it quite a time so the fact that you got your first night's sleep now Says a lot give me copper or give me death. I just spent the last 20 minutes looking for copper in a place where copper is not I Was looking for copper in all the sandstone outcrops where you find silver? It's just in the regular old limestone, man Okay, is that what I need that it Yes vehicle upgrade Bay now this is at the end of it because I'm getting all these materials to build the upgrade Bay But then I need materials after I build it to actually put the shit in to put the shit in like my my my Sally So a good place not sure if I like that place Here this'll do oh Wait uh, yeah, you can just go here nice, I forgot it's just like a little recessed section, okay, so Seamoth modules depth module mark one. I have that Did I not get a depth module mark two Storage module energy efficiency module Oh Polyaniline why I? Thought I had a blueprint for okay four more upgrades for my Sally Hold on let go up here where Sally You depth module mark to Need CMOS dip module mark one. There's a build one anyway Does not stack an America three plasteel ingot s' she'll be able to make that and I have Ruby magnetite I do not have any magnetite I Do not know her to get magnetite ultra high capacity air tank lithium x 4 I might I'm not on board. I got off board I Should have four lithium right I picked up a bunch of it as I was going along There's one please tell me I have it then I can make it an ultra high capacity tank That would be marvelous that would help me so much open storage There's three Come on baby, I know you have it. I know I have it I have to Know There's only one place left that this could be and that's on top of Henry my boy Please please one lithium one lithium Okay Henry kicking me off like that. I am your dad. Oh, where did my storage unit go? The game glitched Well bugged out it well, it's my fault because they put the thing on top of Henry But it pushed it off an hour gentle where it went It could literally be anywhere by now Excuse me Okay first off I'm going in and I'm going to bed because that fucking nighttime as a pain in my ass. We're gonna have guns That's very heavily dependent on how far it got pushed oh Fuck that man Is it landed on something else over here Because they have no beacons or icons or anything on them they just look like this That could be anywhere by now, or it could be right there And it does have the lithium oh Thank god, okay. I'm fucking taking everything out of you Don't trust you anymore. Okay. I'm putting it all in here It's like having a bad child Don't need you don't need you don't need any of you Okay, I don't even have enough room for all of you des fine Lady wish I got my Cyclops built by now there was supposed to be a thing that we did. Well what am I even building? What did I need the lithium for Oh High-capacity air tank that was it nevermind, Shh I don't have a brain that forgets stuff in two seconds. I don't have the attention span of a teaspoon Amy alone Bye-bye weirdo Where do I build these things That's a vehicle upgrade console Modification station Oh An indoor grow bed I Didn't know I started that So yeah modification station is how I build all these things not the thing I think modification station modification station Oh Suck a fart Let's talk about a bit more about the ink or indoor grow bed though Green is unknown Does that mean I came across one and I could have had one that's that's my firm basically, and I'm shading around lights There's no point doing that There's no point looking around for bits and pieces that may or may not show up What I'm doing is I am a man of action right now, and we are heading to the other Island Before I head to the other Island though I want to start checking around some other wrecks because I still need bits for my modification station Came very sad that I haven't gotten that yet hey babies And I need it I need my modification station to be able to do the things that I want to do This is the sealed door so what we're gonna do boom Laser laser Cut that bitch open They got time for shenanigans anymore. We're going deep-sea diving We can't find anything here We're heading straight at the island because it might not have the items that we need but it'll have some items it loves some Information it has PDAs has all this different stuff that we'll be able to use Oh God Would bite look going into these wrecks. We might also be able to find a modification station fragment Because they do lay around polishing cannon fragment have that that was a blight crate. It's effective water battery charger have that Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah oh Hello in the last I world I Didn't realize you had a hole in you We've been here before we've been to this wreck don't you try and chomp on my ass? Ain't just some cheap piece of ass. This is an expensive ass you got to chomp on okay? You'd pay extra to chomp on this ass But I also want to just keep making progress because too much of it is me going oh I'm gonna build this and then I'm gonna build this. I'm gonna build this no It's time to be an exploratory Oh laser cutter fragment That's just obnoxious Laser cutter fragment in the room where I use the laser cutter to get into What was that? That's a piece that I already have battery charger fragment? Modification station fragment, baby We got it. Oh boy look Yeah, I know oxygen is the thing I need thank you look Got it. What are you worrying about? Okay? What do we actually need to make that putative titanium Timon? Led? Do I have enough to make that I think I've enough to make that modification Station here. We come. I need to start getting some Upgrade modules into Sally just wander. Let's go to 300, but that's not enough Actually in fact. Oh hold on I Should get these while I'm out No Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the one I want yeah, yeah, I like that one that's the good one He's going away with metal. We just let him do his thing for a little while come on Don't get stung okay stop, okay, stop. I had a good boy. I had a good boy. There's fucking nothing in here That's a bad boy I was gonna say yeah, I need upgrades in Sally to be able to go deeper like see trainers path and that's up but all that stuff is just Wildly deep Like that stuff is way way down that I'm gonna need a prawn suit to be able to do that Which do I even have all the bits and pieces to be able to build a prawn suit yet a Good for fragments well What was the thing that was something out of 20 those 20 fragments for something got to do with the prawn soup I? Know what that was okay? I need copper or before I head back ooh, ooh Oh, it feels so good To have a modification station Yes This is the shit I subscribed for okay plasteel ingot some magnetized, I don't have that shit a Battery and okay thermal blade all dry capacity. I think I had the fucking This game is just they came a back-and-forth isn't it? just doing the one thing I would have another thing into that thing a blob of black over and over 1 2 3 4 How many let them do I have 4 yes, I am all turned around I don't know where I'm going boom Okay 135 now I'm guessing me. Hey. Can we get up to 225? Okay fine, I'll Take this off 225 give it to me give it to me here. We go here. We go. Oh, baby 225 that's a lot of oxygen I Like it ultra got my fins are useless to me place precursor force it why oh? It's the repulsion cannon okay, yeah, I don't really want that right now And all these things Oh Magnetite magnetite where do I get magnetite? I don't know pokemon This island over here the islands just in front of me this island over here is like Everything around this area fucking socks Because this is this is where some of the deepest sections of the game actually take place a Lot of the area around here goes down down very very far down and it freaks the shit out of me I Love this game To bits I have such a good time playing it. I played it a lot I think the original series still stands at like 45 episodes and This shit still freaks me out Maybe it's all because I'm still not a hundred percent used to it Hey, this is the cave system I went into where I go all the Rubies Now I can actually go down deeper there's another vent Over here you make sense you're closer to where your your water pump pitch is going oh Do I even want to be here Do I even wanna be here Why am I here? It's just the way. It's just fucking freaky. There's no explaining it As a human you your body is just like no We should not be here at all Are you? loyal Repeat ep that's not a reaper. It's a water. What am I saying? I'm fucking scared. I don't know Wait are you this thing I need I Know why you are what is this? Can't scan it probably nothing So yeah you remember last time We're not last time a while ago The Reaper was like sharing location with other agents or the warper. I keep seeing Reapers They had the voice that was on the distress signal Almost sure that that's a warper because what they do Like they're not fully organic so to speak So freaky So if my porthole could clinch anymore it would end countries There's nothing you can't see I don't know where I am. I think I might be near the sand dunes, and that's a bad idea Just like exploring though So the war purrs are somewhat synthetic So, that's why they have a big robot voice I hear one oh I Remember this wreck this wreck give me a Key I didn't realize I was already too far down This was the wreck that gave me the biggest trouble in the game Cuz I knew there was some stuff here that I really needed When I was playing it naturally myself And then when I got here all the stuff that was supposed to be in this Fucking place in this wreck or at least what unlined said was not here Never what that was? What are you nuclear reactor oh? Yes I Know it was a nuclear reactor that I wanted I just remember those bits and pieces of everything that I was trying to get and there were some items. Oh nice There's some items. They didn't have yet in the game like the water filtration system at that time. I didn't have a bunch of shit like that so I was trying to find all the pieces that I could And just find all the upgrades and everything that I could for my base, so I just had the items Anyway into this Hello Thank God. I got that ultra-high capacity tank before I left It's gonna be a lifesaver right now There we go okay, no back up to my seamoth Just get oxygen back and to put my rebreather back on so you don't need to worry about that Thought did you guys whirring all that much? I know you guys are cool Okay, I I'm gonna pause this because I want to see what this is it's not about money and without my oxygen going down That's what every director on Altera's Board has told me and I believe them profitability is just an interim measure of success Power and status are the real goals, okay? I read you When I when I have more time To react a fragment nuclear reactor fragment, okay, no don't need those Fuck this place is confusing. Oh, it's so very quiet oh It's so very quiet, and I don't like this oh, I'm getting myself into a lot of trouble by coming down here Was this Cyclops or our upgrade cool I Don't think I actually have fragments for a driller Tasty Okay, I think I can actually get out down below here anyway and head back up to my AC MOT So I have a quicker escape if necessary and this is one of those wrecks that I was searching around and all of a sudden I Came back in and stuff was just spawned in the middle of nowhere like I went in looking for it. It wasn't there I came back all of a sudden. It was there anything nuclear reactor fragment Jesus Drill arm oh great yeah Nice we got lots of good upgrades. I think that was it I searched around a lot, and it's just Bronze to drill iron fragments and other stuff like that so Alright, that's a reef back up there. I reefy So I think it's about time we hit up. Oh god. It's fucking nighttime now Okay, I still want to head to the island I still want to get there and search around a bit Where am I okay Henry's there oh? This way should be kind of under the island by now No way no way no No no no no no no, no don't do it don't do it, okay? Okay, okay, you didn't do much. You didn't do much yes Cyclops Cyclops, okay? I know I said, I was gonna go to the island. This is more important getting this Getting your Cyclops That BRC trenor's yo Like a coast of their pathway, then I can't see fucking anything Okay, there's the surface Jesus That was risky I was just like no way What's happening What's happening Was let the sea Emperor get inside my head again Where's this just the fucking music there's no way that's just the music That was creepy But yeah, I saw the thing I was like there's no way that's a cyclops bridge fragment Is it and it was like the little steering wheel? So have all the parts, okay Good because that means I can actually build the Cyclops Now hopefully, I know I'm gonna have to go find all the parts But if I can build the Cyclops now that means I can bring that over to the island And that would be way better for me I'm excited I can see Maria again. We get to see Maria again. Oh my god. I can actually make the Neptune launch platform Whoa It doesn't need a whole lot I still need lots and lots of pieces of it But I forgot I could just make my pron suit now as well if I'm aerogel oh Man, I have to go farming for a lot of shit to be able to make this Plasteel ingot s' enamel glass The legends stuff shouldn't be too hard but no one ate for plasteel ingot Segen Lithium and titanium Jesus Reactor pods what the fuck is this benzene synthetic fibers cuz I pick the blood oil There's a creature decoy Okay, well I have a lot of farming ahead of me then I don't even think I have enough lead for this Some lithium ok blood oil go in there, and I have one stalk or tooth Just be happy you guys don't have to see this shit. Are you ready? Are you ready for this? Are you ready for the big bad lady in town to come back? must be constructed Ok ok What That's plenty deep are you ready for the big bad lady to come back? Yes Jesus man it's been so long Maria you're back watch her watch her go what you do it. Oh oh It's so good Maria oh Man Getting emotional at this game man. Oh Hold on so good so good, I'll wait for it wait for it Engine offline ok You have to turn on the engine and everything now tonight wait how do I how do we do it? Otherwise that's doing How do we honk your horn Oh wait Rig for silent running Jesus There's so many different things now, I don't know the button for the horn is anymore. He used to just be left click There it is actually the press like care Oh Oh Maria I am inside you once more. Holy fuck. This is awesome This is new I've never seen that before our little compass down here is no this is new this was added a While ago, I remember this kind of little display is new this is new Oh Some of these features were in it already like the silent running and going twice as fast and the cameras in that kind of stuff They were in it But they were in different locations. This is so sleek God that did such a good job upgrading this Food lights on or off or internal lighting on and off. I'll just not mess at you yet. Oh here we go Here we go soap, Maria Okay name you're gonna be quite the bass Tonight there we go the bass gotta be green and Then this stripe is gonna be blue I think I don't know I have no idea how that looks let's get out and check oh Yes there she is the Maria I know and love Oh God it took me forever to find all those items, but it's worth it She's back baby. Oh I'm so happy. Oh my god Now they know the fucking real fun begins in this game now We take this majestic beauty and we go do whatever the hell we want Right okay? What I'm gonna leave this video here. We did a lot in this next time We are definitely going to the island I've been putting it off for the last like three episodes, but I'm definitely going there now I just have to take some stuff from here Miles oh, I think some stuff from here and put them inside, Maria, and then she will act as my mobile base and then I have to somehow get Farms everything going on inside her I have to put the prawn suit and then that can go inside her but for now the sea moths can go in Either way, this is good progress. I am so goddamn happy, but for now Thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face Like a boss But thank you guys, and I'll see you in the next video! Seriously man that's enough to make you cry so good

*Whapoosh!* Top of the mornin' to ya, laddies! My name is jacksepticeye, and welcome back to Subnaaauseous! uh, as I used to call it back in my earlier days. Let's get back to that shall we, but I wanted to show you guys something. That's in the game now, so this is how the game looks normally okay? Everything fine. You get how it looks It's the way it always looks. So if I go into the options... Hope this shows up on the thing anyway, but there's a color grading option in the game now So this is how it looks normally if I go, there's a neutral and there's a filmic mode this is what neutral looks like. Um, I call this the garbage filter because I- it just desaturates everything and it makes it all look (fart noise) I don't like it, but they have a filmic filter Which makes the game like, pop a small bit more some of the colors are a bit weird? Um, The sky is like a little less blue, but I kind of like it. I kind of like how it is I-I don't know do people like it. I have no idea can it gives it like a Noir Filter to it. We'll play it for a little bit, it makes everything look... Alot more contrasted? Also, I love the water effect in this game now. I adore the way it looks Under water is whatever the Sun rays coming down are very very nice, but the way light filters through the actual like.. transparent layer of the top of the water is phenomenal. When you see it at sunset, it's really really good, so what-what did I want to make next? oh I have a new message Hello!? Yes tell me, tell me everything! tHAnk yOu Cindy. Ok lifepod 3, but I like who these people are like well... The other guys were kind of freaking out a small bit because the big giant snake thing was coming to kill them these guys were like Uhhh.. Yes lifepod 3... If you want to come get us that'd be great.... Please? But really they're all dead. So I can't make anything right now, I might go to that pod because it's closer... Gosh this game is fuckin pretty... Good job developers! It looks awesome now. I really like this game. I did see some people asking How I'm playing the game with no framedrops because the last versions of the game were notorious for that but It might be because the game runs better. I mean I'm sure the game runs better in its full release I need you bladders The game probably runs better in its full release, but also it It's only the first area, so I don't know how that's gonna affect it- oh man, okay? Okay, oh god. I didn't mean save I meant to go into my options. I don't think I can play with filmic mode on This is without any filmic mode, look how much you can see here and then with it on you can't see fucking shit Okay, we're not playing with that on. Looks really really nice, but it's- it's a detriment to my actual gameplay unless I up the brightness as well But I'll figure that all out afterwards. We're here to play a game. We're here to go on an adventure! I'm so goddamn excited to be doing this again. I'm gonna take my time People are asking to have the game uncut to see everything that I was doing and normally I'm a fan of that, but I've played this game a million times. There's a lot of stuff that I did a million times in it, so... I'm probably gonna cut out the stuff That's insanely repetitive. like if I have to go farming for materials Or if I have to go farming for food and that kind of thing Unless people want to see it If people want to see it, then I have no problem showing it I just want to I wana... I want to make sure that the series Doesn't get bogged down with going over the same stuff again and again and again But stuff like getting my sea glide and that kind of stuff. I will do again And one more okay, cool. We are going to life pod 3 Their sea glide damaged. You want my sea glide? Well, too bad you're not gettin' my sea glide Sea Glide Suzy. There I gave it a name finally Awww come on game Now you're just fuckin trolling me Swimming was your favorite routine. Well no shit, Shyrlock. Oh, this is what I mean. Look at that water. Look at that like Sun effect and the lighting effect and everything It's very very nice right here's their pod Hello??? how did you guys die so quickly? Right let's read this They read them now! Your regular seglide tows a mass of 80kg at over 30km/h. The power cell linked to this one should double that. you think there's something out there That's faster? oh sure and that's assuming It doesn't overload three metres from the life pod. you're calm about this I'm seeing the engineering problem So your regular sea glides tows a mass of 80 kilos you think You think there's something out there faster? Oh sure and that's assuming- so that I just get my my Sally blueprint? oh the sounds There's still- oh.. It's pretty... Ooooohhhh..... It's so beautiful There's  still something very very very freaky playing this game about being in the ocean and dangling your feet in that kind of stuff I dont like it blueprints, fiber mesh A compass, air bladder, Pathfinder tool, I had these Seaglide.. oh are you getting an upgrade for the seaglide? Seamoth! ingredients unknown, Dammit That's what I want, I want to build my seamoth again- AH the jacksepticeye septic tank!!! oh, it's in the game already!! I Want this, I want this! We just need some glass! I need to get some quartz! YAAAYYY! ooh There's a thing here You're not a thing you're lie! I'll be having no lies in my game. No lies in subnautica, please. Oh, here's some quartz Thermal vent, thermal vent, get out!!! Ahhh! Kicking my little feets! go faster. I don't like that. that's scary. it's spooky Wait how do I make the thing is that a habit? local radiation readings suggest the Aurora's drag core has reached critical state Oh, I want to see it. I hope the Sun's up when it happens Um do I need the habitat builder to be able to craft that thing? A compass, copper wire and a wiring kit, okay copper wire I can make Do I need more silver for the thing wiring kits silver ore, do I have some in my... Do I have some in my- my Henry head? naw I fucking dont I dont have any of that. old cooked peeper? why are you out of date already? you pizz'a chit? (what? that is what i heard lol) (*is editing* me too lol) Wow... hi Mars! um It's nice that as soon as I got to the Life pod the thing disappeared That's neat. It's actually very useful Right we need to go into cave... hello big bulbous eyed bitch Yeah, I get it life's pain Agony, torture, whatever leave me lone Dat are not a cave system come on, bro. You're better than this- oh DaFuck oh it's one of those guys- I was like that's a fucking-. I got a grav trap Don't fuck Jesus, Oooooooh get away from me! You dick Is He's still after me? He's not still after my ass is he? okay Goddddddddddd Those guys suck. like really and truly Okay see glide fragments... What are you? A counter? I don't need a counter... I do however need this other beacon fragment. yes! Getting those blueprints dawg This is the content I subscribed for. okay, I need one more silver ore Silver ore? oooh oooh! Ooooh! Yes seamoth fragment, fuck yeah! Nice... are you another one? just- just give it to me. That's a fucking egg. I don't want an egg Okay, so if there's one in the seamoth fragment around that should mean there's more here, right? Whoo exciting! seamoth is what I want. I want that in my life Come on Sally come back to us, please You were- you were the best part of my life playing Subnautica, I just can't place. I'm not here about you Sal It's just not the same Sandstone! Here we-here we go Be advised: a common complication the cave divers is loss of orientation followed by eventual asphyxiation. Oh Jesus Thanks... I Gotta say that- come on silver, silver, silver, silver. Think silver. That's fucking gold. I don't need gold I guess that's why they have their the new like Pathfinder things in the game. Okay. I need air Stupid human body needing oxygen I Don't need- are you gonna explode yet? Hope so... wiring kit! There we go! it's one of those things that you spent so long Hmm- out away from your area- there we go You spent so long out farming stuff that you kinda forget why you're out there in the first place Uses artificial gravity to attract light objects and small creatures Thats pretty cool.  I want- I kinda want to try out to grav trap You gotta make battery though. How do you make a battery, copper ore... I should have some of that Boom okay, and I also need to make another battery soon because my seaglide is running out of power Oh, I need another copper ore for the actual thing Ah nerks, no I don't need to name it- Oh- Nice. I got a lot of copper ore. that's good. I've got a cave sulfur and gold as well These are not things I need Imma eat you to get my stuff up I know my water's going down, but hmm, that's my answer Cool I got my own little ball, and if I have a titanium I can make a beacon Okay, yeah, dude make it all it depends how much what do I need to make my mobile vehicle bay ingredients unknown? Didn't like get all the parts for that? Um see-oh I only have two Okay that makes sense um right I guess I gotta find 'em First I wanna try out a grav trap Kind of want to just put it down and see what happens Go! Go grav trap! Hohoo! Baby! That's cool, they were never in the game when I played it before- wait no get back here Peeper! Now can I just pick it up and go again? That's cool, I like that a lot That's gonna make it so much easier to get food. also I really want to throw the boomerang Right let's go to a place where their bladder fishes Are. yes? Yes, yes yes indeed Go grav trap! suck the world into your domain. Oh my god Get fucked tiny fishies! okay blip blip blip blip blip blip blip blip blip Okay, I need to start getting some- I need start getting some salt because I need to start curing my food Or an aquarium These are all things that I need, okay? and in good time good things will happen. need an aquarium I also should build a base near here And Put a farm in it. as soon as I can build a farm the better because then I start getting like infinite food Its fantastic okay, let's get a cured peeper And that's all I can do with that. bladder fishes are good for the water. I shouldn't cook them And I'm at full food right now, so I don't need to cook any more of it, I guess Okay, I just released these babies back. Go fellers!! Nice look at him go all happy Giver of life, that's what people call me, ahh right Mobile vehicle bay fragments and seamoth fragments, the two things that I need to get Oh Baby here we go fireworks give it to me Wooooah FUCK JESUS Hahaha, oh it's so cool And then the wind and the radiation start hitting ya oh We're just able to make the radiation suit now Thanks, I guess fiber mesh and two lead, that's a fucking easy. I have one fiber mesh I think it needs you just go getting more creepvines Radiation suit here I come Actually, don't think I needed all that badly when I'm around here I think it's really get closer to the Aurora that I started exploding my face. You know Your face to start swelling up, and then you BOOOOOOM Face is a nuclear bomb You gotta be careful. You never know when your face is gonna be a nuclear bomb ooh I got a new thing How many creepvines do I need two three is it possible to be in the Aurora when it explodes That's that's something I would like to know drop you Cuz I mean, there's not that much stopping you getting in is there I? I dont know radiation suit go nice That's a very tiny radiation suit I Just have it now radiation helmet or rebreather Damn it technically I don't die very deep right now I don't know. I don't know do I need the full ugh do I need the full radiation suit on? Let's just do this for now let's put it away. Can't put you in there cuz you're too big That's the Aurora I know and love when it's all fucked are you too big to put in there as well get that creature egg out of there Nobody wants you creature egg. You're a piece of shit. Just like your father. Oh New message okay, and use of something else I'm supposed to do in here This is Avery Quinn. I'm trading ship Sunbeam. Aurora? Do you read over? Aurora's dead nothing, but vacuum These Alterra ships they run low on engine grease then send an SOS We offered to help they don't pick up. We're dead. Aurora. I'm out on the far side of the system It's gonna take more than a week to reach your position. Do you still need our assistance over? I'll try them again tomorrow Damn charters gonna have us blowing our credits running errands for Altera. See what the long-range scans pick up in the meantime Why didn't you just send those out anyway, also why am I health flashing? My health flashing at 99 what does that mean what's going on? What are you doing to me? I'm healthy right oh. No. Oh, it's not a new beacon okay, should we go through this one? No, maybe you should make a battery first Going to explore Going to explore hello big fat asses. I'm going to explore This is one all the way down by the actual like broken part of the ship isn't it? It's like a huge chunk of ship down here that I can go into and get a bunch of items out of I Know probably should have brought my rebreather for this one I'm going further away from the thing oh pretty Look at that that's gorgeous, and we're further away from the radiation now, so technically I don't need the radiation suit I Didn't need a radiation suit at all God 'm all stupid because I got the ocean madness. It's making me crazy That's why it's called ocean madness. Yeah Well my vehicle a fragment dog I can build that You bet your ass it is laser cutter fragment, that's good Now, I need is some more seamoth fragments and daddy is back in business Hello reef backs I hear you Okay I need three for that (chewbacca noise?) Look at them majestic babies Yeah that place oh God what the hell is above me oh It's just a fucking dark. Sky. They look so weird cuz everything else was blue around. I thought it was a giant thing (goofy laugh) Okay, so now this guy (another chewbacca noise) I love them Don't like that music though fucking freaky stop it Anything else in here besides the PDA Well, arse in a handbasket! Okay, I like that they read them out now. That's very very nice Ozzy's log. Its the day of the crash. I don't know what the heck is happenin'. I'm scared and I'm not going outside. There are shadows in the water under the hatch, but I can't tell if they're rocks or aliens and there's weird-looking caves nearby The Aurora was carrying everything needed to build the phase gate mobile vehicle Bay's Bioreactors propulsion cannons it had a cinema though. There was a zero-g gym my cafe. I I don't understand how we're here now. Don't know why no one's coming for me Okay, I'm just gonna play devil's advocate here a zero-g gym That would be completely fucking useless. How are you gonna workout in zero gravity? You're not you've no resistance Or. Do you mean it's a gym? Yeah, and that place fucking sucks from what I remember or doesn't I know I forget everything should we put a beacon there? I? Think so Billy beacon go Edit beacon name I want to call you big old titties, bud cave system Every nice. I hear you your shits go away from me Okay, it's really really nice now that they have voices Like actual spoken dialogue for the PDAs because before you have to just read them and you were stuck in the menu So it's nice that you can go off and do other things. Can I-- wait Can I turn on subtitles for them though Because that would be really nice if I had subtitles for What they're doing? I know technically subtitles in the actual PDA But I want to be able to listen to them and read them well the reading is more for you guys because when I'm able to listen to them now but Game audio has to be lowered for the videos If you know I mean Okay, mobile vehicle Bay. Let's go see what's needed to build that titanium ingot lubricant and a power cell Very very doable. Power call needs two batteries and silicone rubber Okay creepvine seed clusters, that's that's my first and foremost Whereee--ah, it's fucking dark. I can't remember where I'm going This direction Always use Henry and the Aurora as as like Landmarks, so you know where you're going I know that the creepvines are opposite the Aurora from Henry. You see? Using my brain Hey wait I No, no. I needed this for silicone rubber I was going to say I have lubricant I have all the Lube that a person would ever need I Am a Lube factory Actually, no. I'm more of a Lube storage A lube factory would be producing it constantly, but I just kind of hold on to it. Oh look at Henry. He's so cute What was the I? Don't know what to put I'm afraid pressed buttons in case I mess up my recording But there's a button where you can turn off there the hood the heads-up display And I want to be able to do that because it's very pretty Oh, what's that? powers about to run out is power about to run out my little--my little seaglide right here? Oh no fucking problem Splizzamo! hundred-percent power again. I am prepared. Oh the oxygen shit I Need to make some batteries actually need to make power cell, but I need batteries to do so Oh, wait. I was able to make a power cell already Did the batteries have to be full to make a Power Cell, that's my qu--oh, god. I was a big boy And some lubricant which is in here Well Nice ooh We're doing it we're accomplishing great goals That's a big boy that takes a lot of time Thanks, okay, I really need water soon that'd be great, but I wanna deploy this this mama Should be in water to deploy--okay, fine. HA. I jumped on top of a fish Yeah, that's the shit right there Vehicle seamoth ingredients unknown they're-yeah-it's-what I expected hello hello fellas You guys are my little friends. My little drone-y friends. so seamoth fragments. That's a thing I Think that that's a thing we should go for Found a third laser cutter fragment hmm might take me a while to find the seamoth fragments Because I don't think they were all in the same area. I think they were all Just scattered around the world so it'd like encourage you to explore actual areas of the game Oh Man I am deep down in darkness oh no the fucking needle pine things Whoa what's up above... WOAH REEFIES You cool dudes. I love the reef backs This is where I needed my rebreather. Oh hello fortuitous. Glory. Ooh, there's a wreck here. Yes! That a sea--a seamoth fragment? baby 30 seconds just Give me two seconds, and I get this Ok reefies, I'm coming up to you That is beyond cool looking Reef backs you're fucking awesome Woaahhh, I came a lot out o' da fuckin' water. Reefbacks are one of the heroes of this game. No one gives them enough credit. Well. You actually have resources on you. That's cool Um wait, where was I? Okay, I'm over here. Reefbacks, you got me all turned around cuz you're so awesome Can I just find a third seamoth fragment like right here It's right around here, that'd be great wait what a fuck are you? Bioreactor! We're getting a lot of good fragments. Well. I guess it's cuz I know where to look Oh Big boy Hey Need to get my laser cutter to get through here, which is funny because you find laser cutter of fragments battery charger Yes yes yes yes That's something that Jack very like Jack like a pretty baby okay from Henry we go Northwest okay got it oh There's a lot of good shit down here. I'm gonna go get me a laser cutter and come back and that's that. You can't stop me. To make the laser cutter, I need two diamonds What the fuck what the fuck Richard Aw, man. That blows. Okay, I know where to get diamonds All right, that's not a problem. I know where to get them because I am the lord and master of this game That's just how it is I am the king of subnautica right now boy also Thanks Cyndee, I also kinda don't want to go there because we have to go over to that mountain I Mean, there's probably diamonds somewhere else, but that's like a surefire area to get them from what I remember put this on and put the nuclear one back in here Okay Yep yep yep, yep, yep, Oh I've new messages let me let me listen to them Uh hi. We just picked up a massive debris field at your location. I didn't know how bad How many of you I? Didn't know yeah, fuck you we're now en route to your location We're gonna bring you home Sunbeam out yeah Cut off the radio, maybe after a certain point. I can still hear you. Um, not instilling confidence there boy Okay To the Island we go I guess I I mean if i have to go back here to look for seamoth fragment. Oh wait. No. I can't I Have to go to the islands. I need to get diamonds. Oh, but diamonds are a girl's best friend What am I gonna do I'm gonna make them my best friend We're gonna make a laser cutter-outer but there's also very very bad things down by the mountain And I'm not really protected against any of them Mainly warpers and leviathans and that's just a bad time. I don't know about you. I don't wanna go near them Oh a wreck right here if you could just give me the seamoth now that'd be great That'd be swell The only other place to get them is in the aurora from what I remember Hey, that's just chunks of metal and shit. what are you? a scanner room fragment. See, a lot of this stuff I'm probably just Perusing over what the fuck what the fuck get away from me, and I'm not letting you bite me to Salvage ah Fucking pins and needles. I don't want it. No no no - I said whoa whoa hard to hit a moving target. Isn't it? So you never know what's bits of what's Jacksepticeye 2k18 -- "you never know what's bits of whats guys." You just never know. life pod 6. I wasn't at you yet whoa ultraglide fins Nice radiation detected oh god. No get away I'm not that close to the Aurora. Am. I maybe you're just radiated from coming out of the Aurora. Oh God I was deep down. You know realize you're just flying along and you'll see you later gliding along. Oh, it's night time I'm very turned around. new PDA Life pod six here we go I Need you to stay calm we're not in immediate danger Where are the rescue teams the Aurora didn't make it? So where are the rescue teams? *Jack in a scottish accent* "the rescue teams." They're dead, ma'am. we have rendezvous coordinates, But the routes are radiated. so what are you going to do? I'm head of human resources ma'am This is not my expertise, but the PDA says if we can find some lead we can make radiation suits Out there?! I am no setting foot outside this life pod without the proper protection. Don't worry I'll go oh Did she die? Is that another thing down here? Oh no, it's the same thing Radiation detected. I am that fucking close okay back up back up back up back up back to where which direction is That's all on irradiated over there, man So I need every single bit of my radiation suit to survive that Fucking sucks, okay. I am not comfortable being out here at nighttime This is very very uncomfortable to be out here with no like protection or light or anything Fucking hate it Just gimme the seamoth fragment please. That's all I want Oh Yes, oh, yes, is that it oh baby a triple oh my god fFFUUUU--goawaygoawaygoaway I just wanted this Seamoth is getting ready to be created What is that over there? I see a light. you see that light over there? What's that light Oh? everything's changing What is that oh It's just a big piece of this That's not an anything well, I mean it is but I don't need that right now. This is great hmm. I thought I was going to have to get the diamonds to make the To make the laser cutter to get into that to those places to get seamoth fragments but now that I can get the seamoth without that it means that I Can actually go over to the island to get the diamonds and then after that we can go into these wrecks Soon after with the laser cutter. Okay. perfecto Probably gonna have to farm a lot of materials out to get the seamoth Please just be stuff so they can get around here titanium ingot, power cell, glass, lead, and lubricant! lead and lubricant I already have and those would have been... well, lead would have been the most difficult one to get Nice, okay, so I need to get--do I need to get silver, or... more copper. titanium ingot Not a problem. I got this I think I have it I think you have the materials to I/o please oh, please oh, please oh, please I need lead Why did I not see the lead before okay, I have lead I Have led. Don't worry. Oh wait. I did see lead I said that that was going to be one of the harder things to get. I just didn't put it in my pocket Yes, yes, I'm excited haven't seen Sally in so long Sally Cindy, fuck off! Sally is good for my whole entire life Look at her majestic beauty oh Thanks I missed you oh, oh I like the little icons down here in the bottom right now very very nice Fuck yeah, Oh feels good to be back oh Look at you drift look at her drift babies Did I just call you babies? *laughing* I just don't know why--I'm excited! Okay all right Well, I'm gonna leave this episode of subnautica here. We made some fantastic progress in this episode We built the mobile vehicle bay, this exploded. We got a bunch more materials.

jeez my name is jacksepticeye and welcome back to ducky-wucky literature club we're right in our second home so it should be like the third day for something I hope I'm in the same place anyway I just loaded it and I'm here again with my xx ings and AFSA Cream Ale poem and work off the last time see if I learned anything through my writing skills I don't know if me picking things will actually change any of that but a tip that I got from people in the comments in the last time I'm trying to avoid the comments as much as I can I still want to read some of them because I like reading the comments on you and getting feedback but I try to avoid them on this because I didn't want to get spoiled but one thing that kept coming up from people everywhere was to keep the game files open as they played the game so on my second monitor here the game files are open and I'm assuming it's one of those games that starts putting weird shit into my game folder every now and then which I'm excited about seeing I don't know what it's gonna be but I don't know that's what people told me to do I'm gonna listen to them and move off still I still have no idea with you what the game is about but I'm just gonna try my best scarers okay say or ease into this I still wanna impress URI I still think URIs my girl even though she or he's probably they're the better option because I think URIs theory might be a little bit messed up yeah she likes explosions of course she does hurt me death okay say or he likes this one maybe you should start writing stuff that actually makes sense time okay I get it maybe universe this is hard to actually go together at tone yes definitely massacre atone for your time universe Massacre with some romance alone you like alone alright on ending happiness inferno we pick it out the easiest word sadness oh man they're going to go hand in hand it's easy pick Natsuki stuff because she just likes kawaii Valentine eternity passion dammit philosophy determination again undertale contamination masturbation hurt ok heaven-sent fire was disaster misfortune frightening and last one graveyard ok so think we picked enough suffer for yuri but another day passes and it's time for the club meeting already i've gotten a little more comfortable here over the past couple of days and during the courtroom the usual scene greets me hi jack yo say Orry or should I say say yo Yori looks like you're in a good mood today ha ha I'm just still not used to you being in the club that's all they see three simple things to get you in a good mood well I guess it's always the simple things we see you anyway speaking of which I'm kind of hungry you come with me to buy snack um no thanks huh hey that's not like you at all I have my reasons why don't we take a look at your purse say Orry hey wait that all of a sudden no reason really I just wanted to look at it ha ha see already nervously retrieves her coin purse she's fumbles with the lachen gets it open then she turns it upside down and lets it its contents spill onto the desk only two small coins followed ha ha ha ha I knew it I can see right through you say Orry you're a ghost that's not fair how did you even know simple feud enough money in the first place you would have bought a snack before coming at the club room so either you're not hungry and want an excuse to take a walk or are you plan to conveniently forget that you spent all your money so that I would lend you some but there's one more thing you're always hungry and so that leaves the one option Wow I give up don't make me feel guilty if you feel guilty that means you deserve to feel guilty ha ha ha ha ha Yuri suddenly giggles yeah I didn't notice that she was listening in her face is in her book as always ah I wasn't listening or anything it was just something in my book Yuri how jacked oh let to let me borrow some oniy that's don't get me involved like that say Ori besides you should only buy what you can responsibly afford and frankly after pulling a mischievous little stunt like that your suffering is fair enough retribution did I just I I didn't mean that I get too absorbed into my book oh I really like it when you speak your mind Yuri doesn't happen much but it's a fun side of you that's there's no way you could think that you were right though I did something bad and now I have to express accept my revolution a retribution that still coming from you say Ori I guess there's a little devil inside all of us isn't there Yuri you're saying things that make me not trust you haha don't let her fool you see already knows exactly what she's doing after all she told you guys she was bringing me to the club before she even told me but but you wouldn't have come if it weren't for the cupcakes so I have to trick that ski into making them come on give me more credit and that's a Orie yeah someone hit her yeah I don't know her something smacks you in the face and tumbles onto the desk Oh always a cookie sure enough it's a giant cookie wrapped in plastic so Yuri glances around hey is this America that's because I paid my restitution retribution actually that one almost worked I was gonna give it to you but then I heard you blab about the cupcakes it was totally worth seeing your reaction though haha that's a key that's so nice of you I'm so happy so you already hooks the cookie geez just eat it see already rapidly tears they open the wrapper and takes a big bite huh sure good mmm suri suddenly clasp her hands over her mouth I pay my comp you're going through a lot over just one cookie that ski takes a bite of her own cookie ah your Zac sweetie go to NAT ski can I try it geez beggars can't be choosers but yours is chocolate yeah what do you think I give you that one fine still I'm really happy that you share this one with me ha ha Suri gets out of receipt and goes behind Natsuki than rats her arms around her ah jeez I get it I get it cookies soon hunt that ski reaches up to nuts aori off of her Oh see Ori suddenly leans down and takes a big bite out of not skis cookie hey did you seriously just do that mouth full say or he trots away to safety see she is Sasha brows Yuri and I laugh as well jeez you're such a kid sometimes Monica can you tell say Yuri yes let's get glances around Monica isn't in the club room where's Monica anyway good question have any of you heard anything about her late being late today not me yeah I haven't either hmm that's a bit unusual hope she's okay of course she's okay she probably just had something to do today she's pretty popular after all huh you don't think she she has a I wouldn't be surprised she's probably more desirable than all of us combined that's true excuse me suddenly the door swings open sorry I'm super sorry ah there you are Monique huh glad you could join us I didn't mean to be late hope you guys weren't worried or anything huh Monica chose the club over her boyfriend after all you're so strong-willed but boyfriend but earth are you talking about Monica quizzically quizzically glances at me never mind though what hold you up anyway ah well my last period today was study hall to be honest I kind of lost track of time haha that makes no sense though you would have heard the bell ring at least I must not have heard it since I was practicing piano piano I must know where you played music as well Monica I don't really I kind of just started recently I've always wanted to learn piano that's all cool you should play something for us Monica but Monica looks at me maybe once I get a little bit better I will hey that sounds cool I'd also look forward to it is that so and in that case I won't let you down jack what is this pose Monica smiles sweetly I didn't mean any pressure or anything like that don't worry from practising a whole lot recently and I've already I'd really love the chance to share once I'm ready they see in that case best of luck oh yes thanks so I didn't miss anything today not really I chose to leave out say orys mischievous escapade I'm sure Nats key will end up complaining to her anyway it looks like everyone has already settled down C or e somehow already finished her entire cookie because she a beast yurina is back to her book and that's key disappeared into the closet hey Yuri [Music] I certainly notice that URI is reading a different book from the one we've been reading together oh sorry I didn't mean to interrupt no I was kind of just waiting for you oh well if that's the case where do we go ahead and get started yes let's actually I have a request do you mind if I make some tea first not at all URI it is what you do thanks so very much if there's one thing that can make my reading time here any better it's a nice line of cocaine not to mention for yourself as well here he stands up and makes her way to the closet I follow and watch as she retrieves a small water pitcher from the shelf the kind with a filter inside could you hold this for a second sure URI hands me the water pitcher and also fetches an electric kettle I'm going to poke this in at the teacher's desk and then we'll get some water she walks past me and sets the kettle down on the teacher's desk I simply watch her movements like a creep to my surprise the way she moved really contrasts are speaking mannerisms she's so well-spoken and calm and collected but she a freak in the sheets especially because of her long legs URI appears elegant and methodical okay may I have the water pitcher Thanks I'll be right back ah I might as well walk with you yeah why not shall we go then yeah who are you two off to we're just URI was going to make some tea so I said any case how weird it sounds to explain it to Monica we're just filling the water pitcher okay sorry I was just a bit curious that's kind of a one-person job isn't it that's a well put Monica please mind your own business for once or do you want me to tell you want to tell me there's something wrong with helping involve jacking club activities my mouth Gabe's I I suppose there's nothing wrong with that hmm then let's go Jack ah Yuri quickly exits the room and I follow take that Monica once in the hallway she suddenly puts her forward against the wall I spoke without thinking how could I say something like that Yuri I I just something about the way she said that it made me feel so irritated what's wrong with me no Yuri I think you did the right thing I wasn't expecting it but it's also night not right for Monica to judge people like that Jack how come even when I do something bad you're being so nice to me because Yuri nothing that you do is as bad as you make it seem in your head also it's probably because he's a he's a young teenage boy and you have big boobs pobody's nerfect see we have emotions and we can't always hide them away but you always amplify things in your head your mind turns a light rain shower into a hurricane ah no wouldn't you hate me for something as terrible as that why would I hate you I cannot hate someone for having emotions what kind of friend would do that friend you say um Yuri lifts her head jack I really like being friends with you hahahaha thanks Yuri I like being friends with you too I feel kind of awkward saying something like that but I'm doing my best to help you feel better anyway that yeah shall we go yeah Yuri and I walk to the nearest water fountain once he fill up the water pitcher we return to the classroom nice is a moment Jack do you like long tea I'm a bigger fan of a short tea if I'm saying but uh yeah anything is fine really very well you reset the temperature in the capital to 200 degrees oh yeah Fahrenheit and all that would that make some sense our system works so much better zero degrees is freezing 100 degrees is boiling it's so easy now it's time to get the teapot you really do this properly don't you of course I shouldn't do any less when I'm making tea for others even if I'm not an expert on tea or anything hoo hoo hoo in that case you'll only be even more impressed ah perhaps I will Yuri fetches the teapot begins measuring the tea leaves to my surprise she even starts humming a little to herself you must be in a good mood now is that so I was letting it show and you noticed I was doing a bit of thinking and I decided but I will try expressing myself a little bit more it turns out it's not very hard to me to do yeah unless you're a robot when it's who's around anyway ah [Music] that's great Yuri don't push yourself too much you're always worrying about me jack it's very endearing let's hurry wasn't kidding I don't even know if I can keep up with this i watch Yuri pour a cup of tea for each of us Jack I have another request can you play darude-sandstorm do you mind if we sit on the floor today oh why is that it's a little bit easier on my back I can read with my back against the wall rather than bending over at a desk huh sorry I didn't even realize no worries I just have back pain fairly regularly so I do my best to manage it so that's so I wonder why that is it's mostly likely because my my your your posture right it's because of your posture it's not because you got too big melons hanging off your chest always hunched over like that while reading right yes I have terrible reading posture that has to be it yes so that's why we should sit on the floor fair enough I'll go ahead and get the book that was some awkward at all ah I've some chocolate as well it's a bag full of it's a bag of small chocolate candies that I kept hidden from Satori's candy Raider I take it since it'll go well with the tea Yuri and I then sit against the wall teacups at our sites as if in sync we assume the same reading position as last time each holding one half of the book except this time our bodies are even closer to each other I can't see too well Oh Yuri slight scouser until our shoulders are touching am I supposed to focus on reading like this Yuri always was always kind of cute but when she's being less apprehensive it's almost more than I can handle are you a us at son dare your teacup Yuri hands me my teacup holding it with my hand that's not holding the book I end up in a position that makes it even harder to focus I'm upside down now I can't read upside down because now I need to worry about making sure I don't accidentally touch her chest I have to make sure I don't exactly I accidentally touch her bad posture meanwhile Yuri hasn't noticed a single thing she wears her intense reading expression and I can only presume the world around her has faded away he used all of my willpower to focus on reading after a few minutes I finally managed to relax a little I put the tea cup between my legs and fumble with the chocolate wrapper please don't put the tea cup between your legs that's hot water near something that hot water is not supposed to be near ah sorry I briefly let go of the book to finish opening the wrapper you can have as much as you want that's that's okay I won't take any huh are you are you sure well if I touch it then I might get smudges on the pages ah you're right I didn't even think about that my bad no need to apologize I'll hold the book okay are you sure I could just stuff my face all I want and you hold the book you're you're all right of course oh damn you reopens the book with both hands she holds it so that I don't have any harder of a time reading from it but as a result her left arm is practically resting on top of my leg in that case URIs already totally focused on reading again I take a chocolate candy and pop it in my mouth then I take another chocolate and I hold it up to URI she doesn't even look away from the book she simply hurts her lips as if this situation was completely natural you guys I'm sorry okay it's getting hot in here I'm at half-mast but that means I can't stop here oh Jesus I apprehensively place the chocolate in her mouth just like that URI Kouzes her lips over it you're his expression suddenly breaks did did I just URI looks at me like she needs to confirm what just happened jack that's sorry was that weird yes I guess I shouldn't have done that that's well you were just helping that's something that friends do right I mean not really in this kind of context but yeah but Miss Holly why's friends sexually in you endlessly placing things and other people's mouths it's otherwise yeah then you don't need to stop or anything oh my god I would say get a room but you have one but I see the situation has gotten really tense oh you couldn't tell by this music you retrace returned to the book but I can tell just by her expression that she can't even focus now my heart is pounding they nervously take another chocolate between my fingers but this time Yuri's eyes meet mine how did it even come to this Yuri doesn't have hurt her gaze I noticed her chest rising and falling to the rhythm of her breaths you know like every human I raise my arm like before Yuri hurts her lips but it's different this time I take the chocolate and place it in her mouth I feel her hot breath on my fingers Yuri jolts back sign to share poems check you can help you reap put away the tea stuff right hey yeah of course no problem okay thanks the spell is abruptly broken ah I'll take care of the cups yeah you do that oh I'll just be over here masking my giant erection Yuri picks up the tea cups from the floor I pick up the bag of chocolates in the end we hastily clean up without so much as a word between us I get the feeling this is something neither of us will have the courage to bring up yeah it was a little auks I must say we should go straight to Yuri Rick it's so awkward let's see what you've written for today Yuri stares at the poem with a surprised expression in her face deep do you like it Jackie this one might even be better than yesterday's how did you even pick up on this so quickly just yesterday I was telling you the kind of techniques worth practicing who do you see Yuri this game is basically an anime and I am the protagonist which means at the end I'm gonna have to use all my might to have an anime battle that is all written in poetry I would be so down for that can we make this an anime or at the end you're reading out your poem but it's like a bunch of like different camera angles and when I like say the last line of my poem to kill my bad guy just like the the Xin comes over glasses oh man I saw one I want to be in this game I want to be an anime character maybe that's why you did a good a job at explaining I really wanted to try giving it more imagery Yuri visibly swallows even her hands appear sweaty I'm not used to this used to what I don't know it's fine take your time Yuri breathes and collects her thoughts I know that Yuri likes to think before she speaks so I offer that patience to her yeah just being appreciated like this I guess it probably sounds really stupid but seeing someone motivated by my writing it just makes me really happy are you saying you've never shared your writing before really I don't believe it I really only write for myself and besides people would just laugh at me do you really think that again Yuri nods huh even your close friends you read it and respond to that I wonder why anyway do you want to share the poem you wrote today yeah I do if it's with you the raccoon it happened in the dead of night while I was slicing bread for a guilty snack my attention was caught by the scattering of a raccoon outside my window that was I believe the first time I noticed my strange tendencies as an unordinary human I gave the raccoon a piece of bread my subconscious well aware of the consequences while aware that a raccoon that is fed will always come back for more the enticing beauty of my cutting knife was the symptom the bread my hungry curiosity the raccoon an urge the moon increments its face and reflects that much more light off my cutting knife the very same light that glistens in the eyes of my raccoon friend I sliced the bread fresh and soft and neat the raccoon becomes excited or perhaps I'm merely projecting my emotions out of the newly satisfied I am an amino the raccoon has taken to the to following me I could you could say that we've gotten quite used to each other the raccoon becomes hungry more and more frequently so my bread is always handy every time I brandish my cutting knife the raccoon shows me its excitement a rush of blood classic Pavlovian condition I sliced the bread and I feed myself again Yuri what the fuck is this I was a little more daring with this one than yesterday's I can see that it's a lot more metaphorical I don't know if it's my fault but I can't begin to imagine what this form as a bone that's right it's a bit closer to my preferred writing style you know all over the place our making no sense using the poem as it canvas to express vivid imagery and conveying emotions through them yeah if I take it at face value then I can't even figure out what it's supposed to mean well I think it's something that different people can relate to in their own way I wanted to express the way it feels for me to indulge in my more unusual hobbies you know eating bread and feeding raccoons it's those sorts of things I'm usually forced to keep to myself so sometimes enjoy writing about them where do you keep them to yourself but because they're embarrassing and people would make fun of me okay a little really weird vibes off you brandishing a knife sounds a little little strange you're gonna be brandishing your knife to me don't you have anything like that check well yeah yes I do I feel like everyone is a little something like that yeah everyone has a little knife brandishing weirdo inside them the best we can do is respect each other in our individuality even if it's difficult sometimes and some things make us uncomfortable after all if I hadn't learned to embrace my own weirdness I would probably hate myself that's a good piece of advice I might be renting a little bit now but I'm glad that you're a good listener you're good at a lot of things writing listening feeding me chocolate like a weirdo there really aren't many people like you check but that's exaggerating a little bit it's it's just how I feel I never thought I would feel so comfortable sharing my writing but now I almost feel like I look forward to it it's just a really nice feeling and your to thank for then it's it's nothing really you reach smiles sincerely at me for just a moment her timidness seems to disappear okay that's that done I still don't get your poetry but okay alright let's go with Monica next hi again jack how's the writing going alright I guess I'll take that so this is not going bad I'm happy that you're applying yourself maybe soon you'll come up with a masterpiece ha ha I wouldn't count on that you never know I want to share what you wrote for today sure here you go I call this my magnum opus I give my mom to my mom tap Annika alright this one's good it feels like you're not only getting more comfortable with your style but the imagery is better than the last one I read just wondering but have you been finding inspiration in URIs writing style hmm I guess so you can't deny that she's talented yeah totally I think her poems are the most romantic that's the best way to describe it she's like a totally different person when she picks up a pen I noticed that too it's almost like she has a pen in her hand what she's talking about literature it's like a light turns on inside her sadly it's hard to get much personal conversation out of her trust me I have tried who knows what goes on inside that head of hers yeah Randy she likes to feed bread to raccoons and brandishing knives all the time let's just hope you don't mean that in a bad way no of course not I just meant that I wish she didn't keep so much to herself but still defending her like that you must be pretty into her yeah you completely misunderstood countdown kitty besides I'm pretty sure she's already got a boyfriend oh wait really yeah a fictional one anyway what I can kind of whispers that last part to me it's just a hunch but well there's really not and there's not really anything wrong with that oh well I know I was just saying but anyway you want to read my poem now I like the way this one turned out so I hope you do too all right let's take a look save me is a wake me up inside and here somewheres I'll save me the colors they won't stop bright beautiful colors flashing expanding piercing red green blue and endless cacophony of meaningless noise the noise it won't stop violent grating waveforms squeaking screeching piercing sine cosine tangent I like playing a chalkboard and a turntable like playing a vinyl on a pizza crust an endless poem of meaningless load me you hmm it's even more abstract than your last one huh I guess it's just the way I write I'm sorry if you don't like it no I I never said that it's fucking weird but hey plus there's kind of a thing I've never really seen before I guess I kind of like playing with my space and the paper she's in where and how to space your words can totally change the mood of the poem it's almost like magic the way I wrote the lines really short makes it feel like they're trying to speak over the noise I see yeah totally it's still hard for me to tell her what it's about though it's okay sometimes asking what a poem about isn't the right question the problem can be as abstract this physical expression of a feeling or a conversation with the reader supporting it that way that every poem is about something anyway here's Monica's writing tip of the day sometimes you'll find yourself facing a difficult decision when that happens don't forget to save your game you never know when you might change your mind when something something unexpected might happen okay breaking the fourth wall wait assistive even about writing huh what am I even talking about hahaha that's my advice for today thanks for listening okay I feel like that's the first lake here behind the curtain of weirdness that this game has to offer oh I'm into it okay if that's what you got to offer if you're gonna break the fourth wall and talk to me directly as a player I am on board that's my fucking jam hmm well I can admit that it's better than the last one it's nice to see that you're putting in some effort that's good but I still don't like this at all strength too hard to be serious mmm what do you mean by that poems don't need to be all keep cutting salad deep-sounding to express something better than all wrong your voice is hard to do I want to give you like a little a little like kind of voice but I can't do that cuz the register of my voice isn't high enough it's going to just sound like you're forcing it unless you really don't suck at it honestly don't bother trying to write poems like this until you're on URIs level that's geese up short all of a sudden don't tell me mm-hmm you're not you're not just trying to impress URI are you but why are you talking about and keep your voice down you know Yuri would love this kind of angsty just because she's a talented writer just in me I mean looks like I'm in trouble I somehow struck a nerve though what I did is beyond me I'm so done with you let's quiche of the poem I handed her back over to me take your stupid poem if you wrote it for someone else just don't show it to me ouch it's what I get for letting a younger girl stuff all up in my biz unless I was a mind reader I was destined to be in a world of pain from the start at least not Sookie wasn't really the girl I'm trying to impress in the first place so oh I don't even get to read her poem oh man okay so am I definitely like picking a girl then by doing this sort of stuff let's talk to say Orie oh my goodness this is so good jack hmm I love it especially after yesterday's poem oh you're too honest sometimes say Orry no really I wanna put this on my wall can I say Orry you must be seriously overreacting I'm not a good writer at all I honestly have no idea what I'm doing well maybe that's why because I have no idea what I like either ha ha ha ha ha jeez I'm sure your Ease opinion has to be a little more constructive than this maybe even Nats Keyes sure you don't like it just because I wrote it huh well I'm sure that's part of it I think I understand you better than a lot of other people you know so when I read your poem it's not just a poem it's like a jack poem a John a Jack um I don't know and that makes a feel extra special like I can feel your feelings in it so you already hooks the sheet against her chest you're so weird say Ori huh well I never eat I'm not very gonna figure you have poems are good or bad but that's why I just go by my heart haha it makes me feel things then it must be a good park I'm not sure if that's exactly how it works then again I guess conveying feelings it's a pretty important part of this whole thing yeah maybe honestly I don't even know what kind of writing you like in the first place yeah meteor look why don't you at least try giving it some thought ah you're right something for me that's so sweet yeah right but you're always thinking about other people you need to think about yourself once in a while if you don't you mind out might up get it might end up getting hurt at some point yeah well I don't you know what you mean but I try to keep it in mind well whatever honey let's see hmm I guess I like happy poems well that's why a lot of stuff kept matching with her because she didn't know what she wants wait sometimes I like sad poems too sometimes I like you a little bit of both there's a word for that right what's the word I'm looking for bittersweet yeah all right things that are happiest things that are sad happy and sad I can't see you liking something sad C or E well I like happy the most but sometimes an even little rain cloud in your head a side poem can help give the rain card a little hook I make a nice happy rainbow Surrey that's unexpectedly poetic huh it is maybe I'm getting better at expressing my feelings after all thanks jack I should go write that down then you could read my poem now okay bottles I pop off my scalp like the lid of a cookie jar it's the secret place where I keep all my dreams little balls of sunshine all rubbing together like a bundle of kittens I reach inside with my thumb and forefinger and pluck one out it's warm and tingly there's no time to waste I put it in a bottle to keep it safe and I put the bottle on the shelf with all the other bottles happy thoughts happy thoughts happy thoughts in bottles all in a row my collection makes me lots of friends each bottle a starlight to make amends sometimes my friend feels a certain way town comes a bottle to save the day night after night more dreams friend after friend more bottles deeper and deeper my fingers go like exploring a dark cave discovering the secrets hiding in the nooks and crannies digging and digging scraping and scraping I blow dust off my bottle caps it doesn't feel like time elapsed my empty shelf could use some more my friends look through my locked front door finally all done I open up an ink of my friends and they come in such a hurry do they want my bottles that much i frantically pulled them down from the shelf one after another holding them out to each and every friend each and every bottle but every time I let one go it shatters against the tile between my feet happy thoughts happy thoughts happy thoughts in shards all over the floor they were supposed to be for my friends my friends who aren't smiling they're all shouting pleading something but all I hear is echo echo echo echo echo inside my head that's fucked up Luke holy crap C or E did you really write this of course I did I tell you yes I was gonna write the best poem ever yeah but I mean I didn't expect something like this coming from you ha Monica thought me a whole lot bad I've been really in touch with my feelings recently I see that it's almost kind of creepy creepy well not exactly maybe because I'm so used to being you being cheerful well nevermind I'm thinking too hard about it point is it came out good so you should be proud of it ah thanks I feel like I feel like I was meant to express myself this way it even helps me understand my own feelings a little bit better writing is like magic you couldn't read pretty passionate about this huh I hope you keep it up yeah writing is the best I'm gonna keep writing it till I die don't get ahead of yourself the orys always had a habit of getting obsessed with something before dropping it no more than a week later owner if this is one of those times but seeing the passion in her eyes makes it hard for me to be pessimistic okay everyone we're all done reading each other's poems right I have something extra planned today so if everyone could come sit at the front of the room is this about the first of all Oh sort of ah do we really have to do something for the festival it's not like we can put together anything good in just a few days we have just end up embarrassing ourselves instead of getting any new members that's a concern of mine as well his fucking thing keeps coming up in-home streaming cuz my other computers on I don't really do well with less in the last-minute preparations don't worry so much we're going to keep it simple okay we won't need much more than a few decorations C or E has been working on posters and I've designed some pamphlets we can hand out during the event I keep looking over to check my files as well nothing new has gone into them okay that's great and all that doesn't tell us what we're actually going to be doing for the vein sorry I thought you heard about it already we're going to be performing performing um Monica yeah we're going to be having a poetry performance all Christ each of us are going to choose a poem to recite during the event but the cool part is we're also going to let anyone else come up and recite poems to see oh he's putting it all on the posters in case anyone wants to prepare ahead of time ha ha ha see oh he's been coloring a poster holds it up for us to see are you kidding me Monica you didn't you didn't already start putting those posters up did you well I did did you really think it's that bad of an idea well no it's not a bad idea but I didn't sign up for this you know there's no way I'm gonna be performing in front of a group of people like that I agree with netsuke I could never in my life do something like that imagining it URI shakes her head in fear guys no sirree I understand where they're coming from remember the NAT Sookie and URI have never shared their problems at anyone until it's just a couple of days ago it's like a lot of people it's a lot to ask for them to recite their poems out loud to a whole roomful of people I guess I kind of overlooked that so I'm sorry but I still think we should give it our best we're the ones responsible for the fate of this club if we start the event and each put on a good performance they want to inspire others to do the same and the more people who perform the better we'll be able to show everyone what literature is all about yeah smart expressing your feelings guys being into man with yourself find a new horizon having fun that's right and it's those reasons that we're all in this Cup today don't you want to share that with others to inspire them to find the same feelings that brought you here in the first place I know you do I know we hold - can you stop talking my voice is going to give out and if all it takes is standing in front of the room for two minutes or reciting a poem then I know you can do it that's keen Yuri remain silent say or he looks worried I guess that leaves me no choice I agree I don't think it's too much to ask I think that's a Oriya Monica I've been trying really hard to get new members the least we can do is help them out a little bit well maybe put looks like NAT ski doesn't have any arguments left oh okay fine I guess I'll just have to get over it get it over with I didn't read that right all right you think that's key what about you Yuri Yuri dejectedly glances around at everyone else's expectant faces I guess I don't really have a choice haha that's everyone you're the best Yuri this curve is seriously gonna be the death of me oh gosh she'll be fine Yuri but anyway let's see this is the thing I think the fact that I know something goes on in this game that the fact that people have prepared me for something I don't know what it is but the fact that people have told me that there's some sort of twist or shift in the way this game is I can't help but look into everything they're saying she talked to her brandishing a knife and then she said that this club is gonna be the death of me and then say or he said something about I'll write until the day I die but that can't be just a thing and then Yuri was seeing something a while ago like on the first day after poems about people dying or something like that I don't know I want each of you to choose a poem of yours we're going to practice reciting them in front of each other no way Monica this is too sudden well if you can't recite your poem in front of the club how do you expect to do it in front of strangers oh no don't worry I'll start off to help everyone feel a little bit more comfortable hey I got acts of course now let's see Monica flips through her notebooks at the specific poem she has in mind for herself she then stands behind the podium the title of this poem is the way they fly my name care begins reciting a poem her clear confident voice fills the room more than that her inflection is pristine she knows exactly how to apply emotion behind each line she recites bringing the words to life is this something she's done before or is she simply and natural I can surround me everyone has their eyes on Monica say or e looks amazed URI has an intense expression on her face that I don't understand finally Monica finishes the recitation the four of us apart Monica takes a breath and smiles that was that was so good Monica huh thank you very much I was just hoping to set a good example I ready to go next Sayuri but I'll go next ha here he's fired up all of a sudden URI clutches a sheet of paper between her hands and stands up keeping her head down she walks quickly over to the podium this poem is called URI anxiously conscious that glances at each of us you can do it URI if it's it's called after image of a crimson eye URIs voice shakes as she starts reading the poem just a moment ago she practically refused to do this where she's suddenly putting in so much effort as URI gets past the first couple of lines her voice changes almost like what happens in URI gets absorbed into her books recovering words transform into the sharp syllables syllables of a fierce and confident woman the poem is full of twists and turns sure that she enunciates with perfect timing this must be a rare glimpse into the whirling fire Yuri keeps concealed inside her head suddenly she's finished everyone is stunned Yuri snaps back into reality just like Eminem did under chef mom's spaghetti and glances around her as if she bewildered even herself I it's up to me to save this situation speaking of which save the situation just in case you never know if she did warn me again another reason why you think people are gonna die I'm the first to start applauding Oh Yuri that's my waifu everyone joins me afterward we give you the recognition she deserve recognition it's not that we didn't want to applaud for her but we record so off guard then we must have forgotten as we applaud Yuri holds upon her chest and rushes back to into her seat Yuri that was really good thank you for sharing looks like Yuri is down for the count okay I guess I'm next then Cirie hops out of a chair and cheerfully walks to the podium oh man falling in love would say Yuri more than Yuri now at this point she just such a sprightly lively bubbly personality I'm far more like just personality wise that's what I like more in people let's say anything wrong with the way the other others are acting it's just this is what I'm more drawn to this one's called my meadow ah ha ha sorry I killed ha ha ha say Orie a lot harder than I thought how did you guys see what so easily try not to think of it like you're reciting to other people by matching your reciting it to yourself like in front of a mirror in your own head it's your poem so it'll come out the best that way I see I see ok then see already begins her poem somehow it feels like her soft voice is made as a perfect match the poem isn't aimlessly cheery like say Orie is its serene and bittersweet if I were to read this on paper I probably wouldn't think much of it but hearing it come from say orys voice almost gives it a whole new meaning maybe this is what seorim and when she said she likes my poems it's like I get to reach more deeply into someone I thought I knew through and through say or he finishes and we applaud I did it good job say Ori ha ha even Jack liked it I guess that's a good sign what does that even mean it came out nicely say Ori the atmosphere at the poem fits you really nicely but it might be that other poems wouldn't work quite as well with that kind of delivery huh I don't really understand in other words I've seen poems of yours where that sort of gentle delivery wouldn't work as well they might need a little more force behind them depending on what you're reading ah I know what you mean that's uh well I've been practicing that kind of thing yeah it's just an embarrassing to do in front of everyone uh-huh then next time I'm going to make you pick a poem that challenges you a little more we don't have much time before the festival you know okay now who's next Natsuki hmm don't make me go before Jack it's not like I could compare to you guys anyway I might as well let's check lower everyone's standards a little before I have to do it hey that's key it's fine it's fine I might as well get it over with but it's not like I have much of a selection of what to read I'll just have to go with what I wrote for today I'll sign up and send it front seven front of the poem everyone has their eyes on me making me feel terribly awkward I recite my poem since I'm not exactly confident in my own writing it's hard to put energy into it you can do it jack maybe believe in you despite that once I finish I receive applause anyway oh sorry I'm not really as good as everyone else oh don't worry about it so much I think it's less about your abilities and more about your lack of confidence in your writing that's something that will improve over time though yeah maybe all right then that just leaves you Netsky yeah yeah I'm going let's keep it grudgingly gets out of her seat and makes her way to the podium the poem is called it's called when you are looking at me because you're presenting hmm anyway the poem is called jump that ski takes a breath once she starts reciting the poem her soul her sour attitude her soul disappears a little while she's still a little unenthused her poem has a rhythm and rhyme - it's not skis trademark style and I worked surprisingly well when spoken aloud the words feel like they bounce up and down as if giving life to the poem Natsuki finishes and everyone applauds she hooks back to her seat that wasn't so bad was it easy for you to say you'd better not make me do that again well do you at least feel prepared enough to recite a poem in front of other people I mean doing it in front of other people would be way easier I can put on whatever face I want for other people when it's just my friends it's just embarrassing I agree with that when I was in college and we had to do classroom presentations because I knew everyone in the classroom it was so much harder to do them because I felt like everyone knew me and was judging me and then they know if you're trying too hard or too little kind of thing but if it's strangers they don't know you so it's easier to just go that's a surprise Nats key I think it'd be the other way around for me well that's just how it is so well I guess in that case you won't have much to worry about for the festival Pat said I want to thank everyone for coming through it might be her but I hope that you all have an idea of what it's like now make sure you pick a poem and get enough practice before the festival okay I'll be making pamphlets so let me know ahead of time what you would be reciting jeez should we be fighting some other poem for a site and said that's fine too it doesn't have to be your own I'm already pleasantly surprised that you're putting in all this effort for the club every time she does this it looks like she's about to like fart in someone's direction it makes me really happy ah yeah no problem okay everyone I think that's about it for today I know the festival is coming up but let's try to write poems for tomorrow as well it's been working out really nicely so far so I'd like to continue that as for the festival we'll finish planning tomorrow and then we have the weekend to prepare Monday's the big day I can't wait I can do this I can do this all right I stand up there's no way I'd be able to find the same enthusiasm as say Aria Monica we don't do my best to get through it it it if it's for the sake of the club and impressing Monica then I'll have to do my best ready to go CRE yep look at you two oh it's going home together like that it's kind of adorable isn't it hahaha jeez guys don't make such a big deal out of it it must be a little nice though well it would be nicer with you really supposed to respond to that it's okay Jack you don't have to say whatever let's go already how about home it's a Horry once more even though it's only been a few days a lot of things have already changed but today C or E is being a little quieter than usual on the way home hey C or E sorry huh I was facing out ah no wonder um I was thinking about something from earlier I like how we get to eye I mean cereals with her words so let's just say that one day URI has to walk home with you huh why would you do okay the question is that kind of put me on the spot here hahaha [Music] I want to say that I'd walk home with URI but say Ori is captivating my heart I'm torn I'm like Mark Twain because I'm torn in Twain right now I really like say Ori a lot now she's cute and she's bubbly and she's Lively and I want to say it's still welcome at sea or because we're really good friends and we live like next to each other don't waiting so it makes more sense and with URI I walk home with say Ori say Ori you really think I would ditch you for URI huh but but she saw beautiful and smart geez I already see her in the club every day besides he always seemed to read you like going home together I wouldn't just ruin that for you huh you're so silly Jack you think about me too much sometimes Yuri was dessert if she wanted it so so Yuri totally made up my mind I really can't figure you out sometimes wait no I don't want to I can make a definite choice right now don't do this to me game let me let me play the feel of small bit sorry is ice the point is speculating something that's never going to happen the conversation trails off it's kind of a weird thing for say aura to care so much about that's because she likes you Dom Dom but I want to respect her and keep her happy too then again the price was only a few days away plus being CRE really good friends we've been friends since we were kids and I don't want to ruin that just over because some sim Yuri comes along who knows what will happen in that time okay we're back to UM doing our poem man I didn't realize had been recording for so long that single day went on for a whole hour well there'd be a lot shorter if I was actually like reading it and not saying the voice is out loud but that's what the whole point of let's play is I might just finish off this for now heartbeat oh God that's the first one I've ever picked the win with her swimsuit passion should we write a poem for say Ori this time this is that this is that type of game now we're picking a girl I think is gonna have way bigger consequences than just who you end up dating I I think there's a bit more to this than that I'm kinda sad that nothing crazy has happened yet she kind of just like poked a hole in it to a small bit talking to the player being like save your game because some things might happen that you need to do over again which I figured might happen anyway but for the sake of these games I like just going through them once anyway instead of picking different things okay I'll pick maybe both and we to see what happens oh shit frightening wrath determination these are all things that I know she likes defeat yeah pick the good one Massacre melancholy oh shit I'm going more towards URI this time it's also one of those things that everyone at home now is like no Jack stay with you early and here they're so like yes say Ori say re-embrace okay I'm getting it Doki Doki I knew that had to be her but I wanted to pick it because his name of the game after image shit promise yeah I kinda know the personalities now so no chance to pick if I was picking Nats key that would be the easiest choices ever I just like poppy raincloud she talks about rain clouds landscape yeah two more I have to pick I have to pick good excitement and tragedy oh I think I ended up more on her side okay I'm gonna save right here put in a bunch of save slots just in case I have to do anything over all right I'm gonna leave this episode here I don't wanna make the episodes an insane amount of time or insane amount of length um man I gotta decide they were not gettin to the good stuff but I guess that's gonna make it all the more worthwhile when we get there ah I'm into it I'm excited by this and the thing about this game is I don't think it's hugely long I think it's only like four or five hours long so it's gonna be a pretty short series so fine things gonna happen it's gonna ramp up pretty quickly and again it's kinda sad that I know something's gonna happen because I'm always expecting it now and I'm always waiting for that if you played this game thinking it was a visual dating novel like this it does a really good job of setting that up that that's all it's gonna be so once some things are happening that must have freaked the shit out of people for the first time they played it man it's awesome I'm really into it I'm really I like the characters I like the vibe about it I'm really excited to see more of it oh oh yeah hope you guys are enjoying it but that doesn't for this episode if you liked it thanks that I banana face like your boys and I face our own shh-shh but thank you guys I will see all you dudes [Music] [Applause] doki-doki 
*High fives!* Top of the mornin' to ya, laddies! My name is jacksepticeye, and welcome to a game called "Pogo Postman!" I decided to call - it gave me a choice to give my player a name, and I had to go with Pat. How can you not go with Pat when you're dealing wit a postman? Had anybody else had that show: ‚ô™ Postman Pat ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Postman Pat ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Postman Pat and his black and white cat ‚ô™ I hated the show when I was younger. I don't even like it now or anything. I like the song though, and I like the stop-motion style of it, but other than that... Eight-year-old me was not having it. So, this is a game kind of like uh... Ah, you'll see. I'll get in, and we will see. "Are your desires unfulfilled?" (Yes) "Please enter your wish here. Be mindful and your wishes will come true." (Ok, yes, I'd like to have a dragon and go to Hogwarts) Um... Okay. *Laughs* WHAT? Uh, I want to be spa- spoider. You say like a a person from Dublin I want to be spoider maan could aye be spoider maan lads come on Jaysus let it happen send wish What is happening!? Pick a wish you want to deliver and become true. I like gay I Want pizza. Pizza, BITCH! *Laughs* I want ta be a shark Okay, those are all great wishes. I love that it just goes from I want pizza ta Pizza, BITCH. Well well, sir. I want to go a pizza bitch. I want to deliver this wish. Oh, that's the online element! We're delivering each other's wishes Oh God so this is kind of like I was gonna liken it to the Pogo levels and happy wheels almost Which is kinda what it's like oh? Yeah, oh Yeah, I've had some fucking training me and Pete have gone a long way. Maybe it whoa God Almighty, maybe I should have called him Pete. How many people are gonna be mad at that now? He's a Post Man ‚ô™ Postman Pete ‚ô™ that doesn't really make any sense. Hey once again, it looks like a monkey a small bit Doesn't he? Okay, how the fuck do I do this? (You use your arrow keys to bounce on your pogo stick over things) Are these the only controls, down, left and right? oh This is bad Yes Oh, it's like a getting over it with Bennett Foddy kind of game I just wanna get out over that. I just wanna, ‚ô™ I just wanna live ‚ô™ huh, huh You gotta, you gotta gotta get your momentum going. COME on pogo, baby Yeah, nice. Yeah. I thought it could like double it. I thought I could be REAL cool like that Okay, hold on there. Hold on there and we'll be fine Get on up. Get on up now. Like James Brown. Go! oh don't fall back down Why are you bouncin' back this way? Who told you to come back? The letters go this way! We're NOT coming back with them! (Letters: Aww, but isn't there PIZZA, BITCH! Back there?) Oh my God, thank God for some reason I thought I had to go over those rocks And I was thinking to myself "How in the blue balls am I supposed to do that?" Boing Boing. Boing! *laughter* Yesss! Wohoo! Look at me go now! Fuck yes! Take that Bennet Foddy, and all your bullshit. Aw, now we have to go backwards. Aw, Bennet Foddy, I'm sorry. *gasp* A Postman died there! Wait did he actually die there? Is this like Dark Souls where you can actually see where people are dead? That'd be actually pretty damn cool. Okay. Get up get up get up get up Yes, WAHOO! HA-HOH!

(God damn it Pat, stop shitting everywhere) Okay. It's all about speed and momentum. Yes, you got to keep it going Keep it. What'd I just say?You gotta keep it going. That's not keeping it going That's keeping it NOT going! And a woo! And a fuck yes. How how am I supposed to do that one? Can't even fit in there. I'm a big fat boy. Are we doing it? No we're going back down. I don't want to be down here. This is further back. (We started from the bottom and we're at the bottom again) Keep it.. Go! I'm beginning to wonder if this is really the best mode of transportation for you to be delivering letters. I feel like everyone's not getting their Sunday newsletters now because of us. (What are you talking about? This is how all postmen do it!) Alright, this is a lot of pressure on me to perform well And a woopdee - fuck. What if I just keep doing this? Do you think I'll make it? *laughs* (Holy shit Jack best strategy 10/10) Why is that so funny? It's so dumb! (Meanwhile, Pat is having spontaneous sex with the pogo stick) I'm losing all the letters as well. Well, there goes Jennifer's letter to Connor. Mary's letter to Santa. There goes the deed to the house. (Never needed it anyway) Not going to be moving in now. There goes your fairytale. How did I get up there the first time? I can't even get to that Section anymore go yes, all I have to do is complain about it That's all you have to do just complain about it, and it will happen. Okay. Make this one easy oh god I could fall over there. I don't want that. Oh, that would be bad. Okay? Oh Oh, oh. I know - You fucker! *falls* ‚ô™ IIII hate this gaaaame! ‚ô™ Haha tiny Postman! Tiny blue shorts man.. Here we go. Come on, keep that mentality going keep that winning attitude. Alive! Don't fall down Please I know I know I am aggressive in my I Know I'm aggressive in my support. Yesss I don't trust that. That's telling me to go down there. I don't trust that Well let's just fucking do it, see what happens whoa no no no no No, no Nooo~ God that would have sucked Yes Fuck you postman! ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) I'm lucky that here, in real life, I don't actually have to meet my postman! Now I wanna kill him! Even though you're adorable Can't fault that part of you. Okay, okay, you need to keep that going you need to keep that going sir yes Yes, my boy Okay, no no *mumbles*what is this? (A plank) Noo! God, okay, okay. I get it, I get it. Hop, hop, hop. It's so cute *Giggles* All I had to do was go THAT way oh my brain my brain whyyy? It's fucking it up again I Can't do that one now It's impossible look that the door is down the dungeon is closed the keeper went home and took his children with him Okay, should sliiiiide to the right Dude, you look just as confused as I am Don't look to me for guidance okay, because I don't fucking have it (Well I've been watching your videos wrong) YES, that's what I needed okay, now saunter on down oh Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck That could have ended very badly for everyone in the parish bounce along gently ‚ô™ bouncing along, at the deep-‚ô™ Santa! YES! How do I get in? Okay, go that way bit huh huh, and then oh? No No, no no no. No. I'm very involved in this now. I want to see how the saga ends can you just What do we do mailbox mailbox yes, yeah *foot* *Jack looks at the foot admiringly, wanting to caress it's toes....and thinking about all the pizza bitches he will have at the end of this* *Trying to find the murderer in his house* Pizza BITCH! So did I, did I actually beat it? I was actually good at something for a change sub 10 minutes. I did it! I'm so proud of myself normally. I don't finish these things *Laughs* Didn't finish getting over it I didn't finish the chicken one this one I did you know why cuz I had to deliver this wish for Boinga. Boinga You you're the one that I wanted to see to succeed here. Not me It wasn't about me getting to the end it was about delivering your wish That's that was my end goal all along. I was thinking about you With the other games it was like "I don't need to finish them because that's my own victory". No this one was for Boinga He's not dead or anything. He's just flying Somewhere okay. Well that was pogo post man. That was actually a lot of fun I like that incredibly simplistic design, but the art style was really nice and the way the mechanics worked They actually felt conducive like I I actually felt the Momentum of everything that was going on all the failings actually felt like my own failings a lot of times these games can feel like They're just bullshit for the sake of being bullshit this one. Actually the physics in it felt good I like that a lot, and it's it's made by Paul Levitsky and Dominic Schneider and Patrick vacuo Vaca yak I am so sorry. I'm pronouncing your names wrong, but it was for the global Game Jam 2018 So that's really good. I like that a lot Really really simplistic, and I it just gets to the point and I like that it had a little bit of a story element to it that we're actually delivering letters to Santa I Mean not the best way of doing it bike car walking helicopter. Those would have been my top four options fifth one is a bit of an out-there suggestion wings while wearing assless chaps But I don't think that that's going to be possible at any time soon science and technology just haven't caught up yet when they do Elon Musk call me. I want to be first on that Okay But anyway. Thank you guys so much for watching this video, if you liked it. punch that like button in the face LIKE A BOSS and high fives all around!

which I wrote in the chat or in the description on the chat even if I wrote the chat you wouldn't be able to see me but I I was getting ready for that stuff when I had everything prepped and I have everything going on and we have people coming into town to hang out and just show around so I kind of messed up the scheduling because the the poly ball video had been scheduled for like 5 days I recorded that ages ago and I just kept putting it off because what the games came out like the last guarantee in VR and then super hot and that kind of stuff and then I kept putting it off because I felt like that was the video that could have waited let me just just just tell the gang there we go hanging out on YouTube right now a little link into the stream there we go taystee alright alright alright holy Moses straight UK people here hello hi how's it going I know it's late for a lot of people over this side of the world any of my European friends I apologize profusely oh god there's 30,000 people here now Oh heard palpitations what are you joking how's it going for this stream let's just hang out let's just shoot the shit let's get real bitcoin is it worth investing that's what we're all here to find out as you can tell I'm captain no fun and I'm here to just get straight to business and tell you I don't know I don't know if bitcoin is worth investing in probably a while ago it was definitely worth investing in these days and I know he's gonna burst is the bubble gonna burst I think the bubble might burst buh-buh-buh bursting bubbles bubble burst bubble bubble bubble burst bubble burst everything about that now you know how I feel say you can handle my love are you for real now don't go wasting my precious time get your act together we could be just fine take it away no one's singing it out there everyone's dead sing sing with me I'm from Cleveland that's that the lyrics who told you that that was the lyrics I'm gonna have to have a talk with them what's Bitcoin it is a cryptocurrency hmm basically basically a currency somebody made up and now it's actually worth a lot of money I don't actually know what it's at now but at one point it was like it was at I was uh it was at $9,000 for one Bitcoin and then I went up to $10,000 like a week later and then all of a sudden is shot up to $16,000 so if you if you got one Bitcoin from someone and we worth $16,000 I think hmm this has been crypto Jack with your crypto currency summaries Thanks okay let's get some Q's going on dawg it's getting some fucking Q's so I can a also get your free jumbo except the guy Sam plushies come on down wait come on down and get your free to accept the guy jumbo Sam plushie it's got eyeballs it's not going it's it's got green and black and blue and it's also got a little bit of white if you come on down the bots are replying to every single tweet within five seconds and everybody gets one you get a Sam you get his half except nobody gets a sound cuz it's all a fucking scam so I feel about them yeah yeah Tory the link actually worked this time okay if somebody asked why are you so beautiful well I'll tell you why because it's what's on the inside that counts you take that with you didn't even make sense well no final fantasies of me Hey Final Fantasy was ages ago okay what the hell is this picture it's picture of me but I look like Quasimodo did Robin do that in the video that's the thing so many times because what I do it like happens so frequently and I have to keep going and I have to keep videos going and everything I'd have no time for anything so whenever it comes to things that are in the videos that Robin has edited in I don't really have riddle it's also because I trust Robin I trust Robins edits like I used to check all the stuff he was sending to me but after a while I was like okay what he does is perfect so I stopped checking everything he was sending to me so now any time he adds something really weird to a video I see it after the video goes up so when everyone has said it's me and that sounds a little weird but it's so much fun because it's everybody like showing me their favorite edits that Robin did and I love them they're amazing right when I'm doing algebra homework just take that out here you don't need algebra homework how many times might use algebra in my life but you're in school and that's important so you probably should do that also I threw my hat or I'll be back I'm back I didn't go for very long I threw my hat away and then I got stuck in the cables over there and I was worried I'd start a fire

which I don't know am I excited for kinda it's been a long year so I kind of just need some time to just sit back relax kick up my feet watch a few movies drink a few beers you know have a good time I have my own Christmas but hookers blackjack hmm your favorite subject in school well see that's the thing I different subjects that I liked a lot for different reasons there was never really maybe English class I like the most because I liked my teacher actually kind of had a little bit of a crush on her um but at the same time I just liked using my words I liked being able to express myself with words and we used to have to go away every week and write an essay on whatever subject she gave us and then each week like if because I was what 16 17 I I did not want to write essays I did not want to write or do anything so all of our history was play video games so I would have asked all my essays and then one of my friends who was always this one of my friends was always this kind of like one-upper kind of person which I hate it's one of the least attractive traits a person can have where he would always try super hard in English class because then it was it was always a case of like all my stories are fantastic my stories are the best the teacher loves me the most so it was it like back then I got very petty about it because I just got sick of it well other people in the class was sick of it as well so I I gave him a taste of his own medicine and became that one opera person by I went away one week and just like cranked out this amazing essay you so many great adjectives so much symbolism so many metaphors Oh Billie shakes would have been quaking in his boots if he read it probably now I think it was about being an army man in the desert maybe did I write The Hurt Locker not gonna say the Kathleen Kennedy steal it off me that hey man lawsuits but I wrote a story she loved it and she said I was the one who had the best improvement that week in class and I was like ha ha oh now I'm the bad guy and that was the only time I ever did that but it was to prove a point which yes I I understand the irony in it who I said I hated that personality and then did that I was 16 what did I know ah somebody asking me the tech questions a question jack if you somehow read this I somehow do with my eyes that's how I read things what do you think about your interface the mg 10x you that's it's right here you can't see it I would pick it up at the cables we're all tied down and how do you like it so far and how do you record using it does it annoy you when chatting to friends and discord and they can hear your desktop audio well I don't have desktop audio going through it I I just use my motherboard audio what I used have a sound card but it messed up my computer for a while and switch between computers I just wasn't ours anymore so desktop audio just comes to my headphones it doesn't go through into my mic but I I have tried that out where you can feed game audio or desktop audio into the mixer and then into your headphones but when I went to record my mic then it would just record all the desktop audio on top of my mic so that was a disaster so I had to separate them all out again so when I record using it I Latorre just use line 1 and 2 line 1 is this bad boy and then line 2 is this guy the the lav mic that I use for HTC vive soft actually you'd probably be able to hear it if I hold on a second I want to see if this works if I okay I'm turning on the other mic I'm turning down this one so have you hear nothing that's supposed to happen that would help yeah this is the LAV mic that I use then for for HTC vive stuff but it's all coming in off the one mixer so then I could just turn this one down and turn my main mic back up so it's really handy that's what's the one of the reasons I wanted to get this mixer guys before I was using USB mics and they're fine they do the job but after a while I wanted more options and I wanted like a mixer that did compression and stuff live and just be able to mess around with stuff a bit more like I can well actually I'm not gonna go tweaking myself but you heard I can't do this kind of shit which I don't do often but it's nice to have two lines going in through this thing can you see it no just out of frame talking god dammit this is just the two XLR cables going into it and just different channels and you turn one up and turn one down simple very very very basic audio gear but it's nice to have because I can just switch between things and not have to worry about cuz with the USB mic if I wanted to switch to a lav mic which I used to have one that went into my or not this phone because there's no headphone jack went into my old phone and it was just a smart lav by Road and it was fine but it didn't sound great so I got this one and it sounds really really nice but we're having a USB mic and then I couldn't switch channels to a different mic immediately and it would I have to go into my desktop audio settings and that kind of stuff so and then audition does not like it when you switch interfaces if you have audition open and you switch to a different mic a different input source it will be like ah your stuff changed I'm out which is annoying cuz I want you to work so I just got this you just turned them up and down so it's all the one interface and has like four channels on it which is fan debido z can we talk about tank means she'll be asking the real questions what what tank mean do you want to talk about what's your favorite tank mean personally big fan of oh shit what up or you know dabbe on dem I I make fun of memes all the time even though I make a lot of meme references some of them I genuinely love there's some memes and some vines that I fuckin love cuz they're hilarious okay I play I play one of my my favorite vines just cuz it's off the top of my head okay you'll know it immediately sounds off no this is a crayon it's so fucking dumb it's so dumb but I love it some brains I detest because an any of any vines that are like like racial stereotypes or anything that's like cultural stereotypes um like that's just low-hanging fruit not that I'm a barometer of high quality comedy or anything like that but I know what I like and I know what I don't like well rip my sleep schedule you can't rip a sleep schedule a sleep schedule or not a phone book go blur own Toblerone and it's a picture of Zarya all messed up scaring me oh yeah another thing I wanted to talk about was one of the reasons I did this stream as well was cuz I wanted to talk about charity stuff that's happening I know I've talked about it a billion times already as I said I'm gonna keep spamming you with it because we need this to go well and I really really wanted to go well this is the first time I'm heading like a proper larger budget charity event like with other people coming in and everything and not just something that I'm sitting at home doing on my own this is something that has a lot of meaning to me and I wanted to go really really well but I left some info down in the description if it's not showing up you might have to refresh your stream boy again December 15th and 16th you can see it back here wait that's that's the stream December 15th and 16th that is still going strong but I'm I got times today I think we're starting at 6 p.m. GMT so 6 p.m. my time which is about it's about 4 to 5 hours away in 15 minutes will be 5 hours ago from now so whatever time zone you're in you're gonna have to calculate that out yourself so it's an hour after my first video goes up if if you're in tune with that or wherever you live because I thought it was gonna be 4 or to 5 p.m. but the the person I work with at Disney and maker Nicole who is my manager as well I guess we're always like are you my manager I don't know I guess I don't hire you but Disney make her dues but you do all the things and help me out so she she's like my go-to and helps me out with all this stuff and organizes everything and gets calls going and everything she's amazing she does incredible work but she she came down yesterday so she's coming down for the stream as well to oversee proceedings and make sure the court case goes well but she came down to Brighton today just to hang out and have a good time so we were showing around I know that was fun but she told me that we're thinking about starting at 6 p.m. GMT because it's it's more evening time it gives people time to get back from work who finished I'd like four or five you get to go back and relax and settle down a small bit over this side of the world but also for anybody who is in America it also leaves more time later in the day for you to be able get ready for different things like that just making it later but not too much later if you get what I mean just give us a bit more leeway and a bit more time but that's the time we're hoping to do it if stuff changes I will be tweeting out about it I will be posting it everywhere so keep an eye on that but that should be that's the most up-to-date information that I have but also I've videos like recorded until the 21st by now so I've been prepping all week getting stuff done so any videos you see from two days ago until the 21st I think are all videos that I've done a week or two prior so if any stuff that you were telling me tips and some games that are coming out like kingdoms and castles I reported three episodes of that straight so any tips that came out for that I didn't get to see them because I already had the episodes done before the first episode went up different things like that because I Robin an Ethan are coming in tomorrow so we're going to have a good time with them and they're gonna be here for all like before that and then we're heading out to do the stream stuff on the 15th and 16th as I said they keep saying well we're gonna hang out with them tomorrow and have a good time and then after that some people go home earlier some people don't but I I just I planned out a bunch of videos in advance just to get them ready to cover so when my friends are here I can actually hang out with them and have a jolly old good time it's gotta be fun I'm really excited I'm very excited to show them around Brighton pretty excited for them to just be here and hang out in person without a convention or anything surrounding us it's gonna be good time what are people saying sorry do you play a musical instrument you bet your ass I do I play some drums a play some of those old Bangi bongos bro those bangin bongo boys let's call me a bongo boy from now on that's what I am and if you haven't seen I did drum cover of Chop Suey up at the channel I am gonna do another one I still plan on doing more I was supposed to do it already I'm supposed to do a bunch more already but trying to figure out how to get over copyright and that stuff and then also having to set up that video and having all this other stuff going on at the same time it's just there's a lot of there's a lot of balls in the air right now and I love balls but you know I get on it eventually when we can figure stuff out I'm sitting here playing call of duty while watching this video nice are you playing the new one the world war two one I tried that out for a while remember that I was not able to play call of duty Ethan just messaged me packed my bag and I'm getting ready to hit the airport see you guys soon see you soon Ethan you know if you're packing your bags you're not watching the stream see you soon safe travels and I hope it goes smoothly we'll be waiting with dicks out solid solid solid message do you like kangaroos who wouldn't like kangaroos they got their own pockets look at their on the hoodie pocket do you think of one punch man season two well it's not out so I can't really say much but I'm very very excited about one punch man is probably my favorite anime which sounds like one punch man it's my favorite anime attack on Titan is the greatest enemy that is every lifted kind of thing but now I really really like it so I'm very excited for a season 2 and I kind of wanted to read the manga and get a bit ahead on that but I don't know I don't want to wait for the anime interpretations of that bubi your hair wrong on my hair it's all weird right now it's like super rainy here today in Brighton so while walking around anything that was in my hair all got washed out and I would just looks weird but it's brown I'm a brown coffee boy when will you dye your hair green I won't for the foreseeable future my hair is back to this color and I don't know what the fuck is going on here I don't know if we're gonna make it any other color I don't know if I'm gonna change it again not for a very long time at least because I like having it back to my natural color I think it suits me a lot more the green suited me as well it's just it's like you can always tell because it's green that it's not a person's natural hair color so it's nice to see it back to the regular when Detroit becoming human comes out will you play it and what happened to drumming videos are the answer it's the drumming videos thing but yeah when when becoming a Detroit become human becoming human I remember when that game comes out I will definitely do a series on it cuz whenever when heavy rain came out you know Detroit becoming human or become human is their new game by David cage that's coming out next year it's it's the same guy who made heavy rain and beyond two souls I think it is so I'm an Ellen Page in it and I meant well I played a heavy rain ages ago on my own so then going back and playing a series on it wouldn't have made any sense because I know who the killer is but then I was gonna do beyond two souls and still doesn't sound right but then I kind of just kept putting it off and putting it off and then didn't know if I was gonna play it or not so I don't know those are all the games that are would be fun for streams at some point I think or like to keep on the back burner if I ever really run out of ideas which thankfully I haven't I've already always find stuff to play I hope sometimes it's hard but I always find stuff to be able to play anyway and just make my mode make the most fun out of it so I'll go back and play those types of games eventually but now that I'm doing YouTube properly because when beyond two souls came out I was doing YouTube properly and I even remember being in college I had just started kind of dabbling in YouTube and I was in college and doing a project of people in the computer room and behind us a little bit across the way it was somebody watching felix's beyond two souls series and I remember thinking man how cool would it be to just do videos and have somebody in college watch your content and that to me was like the coolest thing in the world that was so bizarre because it was a thing that was so super niched to me and I didn't know anybody else who did it or anybody else who was into it too soon so to see somebody else watching Let's Plays was like holy God my people and now a bunch of people watching my stuff in colleges and in schools and at home and everything it's it's so cool so and now that I'm doing YouTube properly myself I will probably do that series feelings on tacos amazing food some would say some of the best food Mexican food in general is very very good Jack and just asking and in all the chances of you reading this are really low but what is the best gaming headset to hear noises or chat with your friends since I know you were a specialist technology well I don't know about that I don't know all the new headsets that have come out but this this is where I diverged from like the mainstream suggestions I've heard like turtlebeach stuff is pretty good but they're like any anything like that like Turtle Beach and razor and that it's all really cheaply made to try and mass-produce it and keep the cost low so like these these are super high-end headphones and I would not recommend these for anybody who's just casually listening to stuff I just love audio so I went overboard with these but like a good headset cuz you you want one that has a mic in it as well and I don't really know any good ones that have like good mics in them as well as having good positional audio i'd suggest like the EKGs or I don't know these have fantastic positional awareness but I mean I'd have to know your budget but I I mean turtlebeach seems to be pretty popular with a lot of people who play pop G and that's yeah of course that's because the sponsorships but I mean they're able to play well with them and they have mics in them as well so I don't know with me it's always been separate headphones separate mic so I can't really say too much on that but I appreciate you saying that I know technology that makes me happy what do you mean by doing YouTube properly I'm a starting / new youtuber looking for some tips oh I just mean that now that I'm doing YouTube as my full-time full-time thing myself cuz then the guy watching Felix this video Felix was doing YouTube like as his full-time gig and I was just starting out and I was just doing like bits and pieces videos and it was still very much a hobby and I was just doing it whenever I could but now I mean like I'm doing it twice a day every year it's it's the thing that consumes all my time any advice for the Leaving Cert the Leaving Cert is like you're over here or at least in ireland you have the Leaving Cert you have the junior certain the Leaving Cert so secondary school after primary school you go into secondary school and we just have six years we don't have like middle school high school any of that stuff it doesn't get it's not that confusing not that that stuff is confusing but it's just straight six years after that but an optional fourth year so in third year you do your junior serve which is to like prepare you for end of year exams and then after your sixth year you do your leaving cert which are the exams that determine how you get into college or how many points you get to get into college or where you're going or it's like I think the most important exams you take it's the last exams you take before leaving secondary school but with any exams like that I just say study and take it seriously because the junior cert III don't know the junior cert is just like a practice for the Leaving Cert so that you can be a bit more lenient with but the Leaving Cert is is a very big deal a lot of what's to come in your life after secondary school is based on what your leaving cert results are I wish it wasn't because the world does not work as a point system but like if you want to go to college or anything like that it's all kind of based around that and it's just it's a good thing to do well in and I know it's it's hard to study for some people I could not study I'm a very I'm extremely visual base when it comes to stuff so I can't read and take in information but I'm very good at reciting stuff I'm very good at I'm very good at reading stuff out loud and it going into my brain like if I ever had to learn lines for acting or anything like that I think I'd be very good at it because fact that kind of stuff I'm very capable of but when it came to studying for the Leaving Cert I just I had such a hard time especially with subjects like maths or science actually no I liked to science I was fine with that but like my geography exams because there was some stuff got to do with economics in it thought I just could not get my head around I just wasn't that interested in them so it's hard to retain that information and that's the key the key to gaining knowledge is to is to do something you're interested in and that's kind of why the school system falls apart because it's teaching you teaching you a lot of stuff that I guess is useful in certain ways put it and it's just nice knowledge to have but if you're not interested in it then it's really hard to learn it so if you're doing stuff that you're really interested in it's much easier to learn it but I I just say take it seriously take your time studying and just break it up into blocks what I used to do like for my English exam we had to learn we had to learn some poems because you had to be able to quote a certain set of poems they're like four poems and you want to get asked about two of them then you have to write some essays and different things like that so for the poems that would just sit out in my back yard now read them over and over again out loud reading stuff out loud helps way more than reading it in your head or just read it reading it out loud and then writing it down I think is for me was the best way of keeping knowledge inside my head but I'd say just break it up into chunks and don't take on too much at once because they get overloaded yourself and just forget everything and try and take it because it's because the Leaving Cert you know what exams are coming up I'd say study for like time it out properly break it up into blocks like do geography one day do maths another day don't do like geography for an hour maths for an hour kind of thing because then I don't think much will go into your head that way unless you're just really good at that kind of stuff I don't know I don't think there's any secret to it just hard work it's kind of how most success happens oh yeah somebody's reminded me of net neutrality actually that's what I'm going to change the name of the stream to what is it just hashtag net neutrality that's going around yeah not that this is gonna raise net neutrality there I'm just just so that hashtag is there it's the first thing people say net neutrality so many people are asking what's your stance on it I'm like what stance is there to have there's only one stance that matters when it comes to net neutrality and that's saving net neutrality and I think one of my biggest concerns with all of this is that people are hearing stuff about net neutrality so much and normally normally when a topic is going around like that that people are voting on you here the one that's bad the most or you hear like the name of the bill or something like that it's usually a bill named after it's like different things I'm afraid that people not understanding what the terms net neutrality mean suddenly here it's so often that they associate it with a negative thing that they think net neutrality is the thing they need to get rid of because I have seen some people get confused about that online but net neutrality I mean you've heard it to death by now do I really need to explain it again just saving net neutrality is the most important thing right now because it just keeps everything like if there's no net neutrality so many people won't be able to interact with me like this right now and that's scary because the internet packages will all be all over the place you'll have to pay extra just to be able to watch certain things or just to be able to access certain sites it's the scummiest of ideas to try and get rid of net neutrality but again money breeds scum and and I just hope I pray that net neutrality is saved and right now it's it's a very us-based it's all going on over there but this has such far-reaching implications that sure even if it's voted on in the US and net neutrality has gotten rid of it's still the same that like youtubers like me over this side of the world who didn't vote on net neutrality are affected by the people because like how much of my audience is American that's actually going to the analytics right now and check this is very important and I know it's been meme to death by now god I never check an Olympics I think there's no that's demographics by the way if you're curious my biggest demographic of age groups for watching my channel is 18 to 24 year olds followed by 25 to 34 year olds followed closely by 13 to 70 year olds a 17 year olds and then 35 to 44 year olds so anyone who's saying oh only 10 year olds watch your channel I mean the statistics are there then again people could just sign up with different things but anyway playback locations no that's the fucking traffic sources I have no idea how to check this shit ah geography there we go can I see a percentage of this doo-doo-doo-doo no it's cousins on the last 28 days that is mainly fuckin sense so out of the 17 million people who are subscribed to this channel 9 million of them are American 9 million of those people come from the United States followed by 1.9 million people from the United Kingdom and then followed closely by Canada at 781 thousand so a lot of my audience is American so if net neutrality gets destroyed then people who don't have the the entertainment package or whatever ends up happening if you need to pay extra to watch YouTube so many people are just going to be cut off the channel because they don't have the money to access the channel and then companies keep saying like Verizon a Comcast like oh well we're not going to do that we could but we're not going to it's like fuck off of course you're going to do it you're a conglomerate you're a coat you're a corporation all in all it takes is one person you saw even to a lesser extent what ei started doing the Star Wars that's basically what net neutrality being gone would do it would be the people who pay more would have better access to things and would be able to do stuff better than those who could not afford it and I like yeah while ago EA would have been the same mean like no it's not paid to win and then slowly and surely little pieces get dropped here and there and then it's like Oh suddenly it's all pay to win it's all paid to view that kind of stuff so it's just it's coming and there's so much more to it than that there's so much more to it than just we I just keep using YouTube as an example because that's what we're doing right now but it's it's way more than just that it also comes down to like data trafficking and just oh there's so much in it that's just so scary and if that ever happened if net neutrality ever got destroyed it would be a very scary thing to happen and it's a thing that should never ever ever happen the the Internet should always be neutral and that's why in Ireland we had like a law that I I think it's like broadband was a service it was like a basic human necessity to have the Internet and that's why that's what the internet needs to become everywhere it needs to become a human a human right a human necessity that everybody should be allowed have the ability to be allowed to have the internet sure infrastructure and poverty and those types of things play a huge factor in it but everyone should have the right to the Internet put it that way instead it's just people being like well I have more money than you so I'm able to watch Netflix faster than you were and you're at home it's like ah so annoying drive me insane that's why I don't see how there could be any other stance on net neutrality but a lot of people are signing up a lot of people who are like talking to their congressman's and that's the thing over here we can't do much because we are European but there are ways to help out I don't know them off the top of my head right now but if you really want to help out there are ways and spreading around awareness average is also helping out oh here we go somebody sent me a thing if you see this tell everyone to text resist in capital letters to 504 zero nine and pick Congress and follow instructions if not from the US just to sign this petition okay I should put this stuff in the description as well it's very very important man 1.6 million signatures that's awesome god that's a gigantic link this is a way of shortening this link down but I happen to have all this stuff in it because the thing is whenever you post huge links people are less inclined to click on them which is sad I think it's cuz I was posted on Twitter it added a bunch of stuff to it ah there we go so I'm putting this stuff in the description now Ezard work do and I was going to make a video talking about net neutrality and everything as well I made so I made a tumblr Paul was talking about or not a tumblr post I reblog some tumblr post talked about and I made a Twitter post talking about it as well but this stuff is it's very very important and the reason it's so important right now the reason I'm talking about it so much right now is because it's tomorrow isn't it that the repeal is happening there's still time after that because I think they have to take it - I don't know politics and law and all that stuff but there's still some time after that but it's very important to talk about it now mmm without net neutrality ISPs can choose what you see online favoring some sources are blocking others for example if someone launched a petition on change.org against a company like Verizon net neutrality prevents Verizon from blocking or slowing their customers access to our site so if you said something bad about Verizon on change.org or on YouTube or whatever Verizon could technically turn around and be like well we're gonna slow down traffic to that now because we can do that whereas if they if they're if the internet stays neutral they can't do that they have no control over that anymore so it's important to do this stuff right now so go sign I've already signed it pretty sure is it this one that I signed yeah and texting resist if you're if you're American as well super important and I feel like as a person who uses the Internet not not just a person who uses the internet all the time and love the Internet it's one of my favorite things about the world but as someone who uses the Internet for their job and is able to reach so many people and has been so fortunate to be able to do what I do because the internet exists the way it is like if we didn't have a neutral internet I don't know if I ever would have been able to start youtube and I don't know if many of the people you watch would have been able to start YouTube it would have been way different landscape but because of that I feel like I feel like I have a bit of a responsibility to try and mobilize an audience and to raise awareness about these types of things it's the same with the charity stuff I could just do YouTube and just forget about all that kind of aspect of and just keep doing my videos but I I really believe in causes like this and I really want to try and like reach this audience and use this audience to be able to change things in a good way I mean there's 17 million people on the channel or 17 thousand people watching right now if I didn't say anything about it I'd I don't know it's very very important so I wanted like it's it's weird to say that you want to change the world and I don't think I'm gonna change the world but if we can change one small part of it if we can train change our slice of the world you don't have to change the entire world just change as much does that's within your influence or at least try your best to change the world in a positive way that's within your influence that's kind of the mantra that I like to do YouTube with especially these days because the channel is gotten so big I know it would be easy to just go off and buy a fucking Lamborghini but would you really be happy with that I wouldn't so let's all gang up on that the FCC and let's save net neutrality I'm a rapper I'm like one of those rappers that comes to your school and raps about drug awareness you're like okay I need to do some drugs now just to stop listening to that oh that's cute Lindsey drew a thing for the stream I'm so excited I've tried to be there but school kind of sucks but I'll be there Sunday or Saturday thank you little Sam with the Save the Children whiteboard in the background that's cute thank you how long is treatment for I don't know another little while at least I'm going through questions right now we were talking about net neutrality in my mass communication class and my professor honestly thinks they're going to repeal it and there will be huge backlash scary stuff that is scary because the thing is it's one of those things that money and greed could very realistically win out today which is a very scary thing it the more I do YouTube the more I'm starting to realize that money and greed and manipulation and power are very scary things for some people to have because a lot like some people do not wield that responsibly but that that's why we have to fight because this isn't just this is it this is something like very very scary to happen and it's normally it's one of those things that everyone's starting to turn into a political left versus right kinda thing like fuck that who gives a shit about your political standpoint right now this is this is a very like focused thing like just all come together for this one thing you can all go back to hating each other afterwards but please put your side your differences for now let's all work towards saving our internet and keeping it the way we love it keeping it the way we want and a lot of people out there don't understand the way it is so if you do do not look at somebody who does not understand net neutrality and has nothing got to do it try and reach them try and educate them don't just see somebody who doesn't know anything about it no fucking moron how could you not save the Internet but that's a bad mentality to have you should be out there trying to spread awareness about it in a positive way that educates people and gets people interested in it and makes them aware of it and makes them riley's them behind it make them want to fight for it white chocolate isn't even chocolate yeah I know technically by its definition it's not chocolate because it doesn't contain cocoa in it or cocoa beans or anything but it's called white chocolate who cares it's in the shape of chocolate you eat it it kind of tastes just like a milky chocolate fuck out of here with semantics huh umm but I just love white chocolate so much ever since I was younger it was always the choc I love I love all kinds of chocolate don't get me wrong I'm not against milk chocolate I'm not against dark chocolate some dark chocolates are absolutely delicious and they go super well with certain like beverages but uh white chocolate is just so good even though it's the chocolate that makes me sick the quickest Susy I'm not fucking around right now go sign that petition go text this isn't one of those things where you just sit back and like ask somebody else to do it it's not an election it's like this is serious thing I know I'm fucking smiling when I talk about it but seriously now is not a time for regular human complacency and ignorance to kick in now is the time to educate yourself about these topics there's a lot of people out there as well who use the internet every day and then they hear something about this and then it's like after after it gets repealed and they're like oh well I didn't know it was gonna affect the internet that way these are the moments that you educate yourself on it these are the moments that if you don't know what it is there's absolutely no shame in not knowing what something means the real shame begins when you don't know what something means and then you close off your mind to it and don't want to know what it means especially something like this that's when real ignorance kicks in but so if somebody doesn't know something about net neutrality it's it's either up to them to research it themselves or for you to go out there and in a calm polite respective positive manner educate them on it and if you don't know exactly what's going on yourself educate yourself and then spread awareness how can I talk to Jack I think he's just answering comments or something but I don't know where help well Midna you just talk to me thank you okay a lot of stuff is moving very very fast so I'm trying to try to stop stuff hey Jack I'm planning to make a channel and I'm kind of gathering tips for you I must ask for the equipment so what do you recommend for screen recording and editing softwares so if you're going for screen recording I'm assuming you kind of want to do gaming stuff you didn't specify what kind of channel so I used to use bandicam I'm trying to think are there any like really good free ones I don't know because for me right now I use shadowplay Nvidia shadowplay and it's it's a fantastic piece of software but you need an Nvidia graphics card to be able to do it so if you don't have one of those then screen recording gets a bit trickier OBS is really good OBS is a fantastic piece of software actually I forgot about that one highly recommend OBS if you don't have an Nvidia graphics card I just use in video shadowplay being out of convenience more than anything but a lot of people swear by OBS it's very very good it's what I'm using to stream right now but it can be used to record too and as two versions it has like it has just regular OBS open broadcast software for the full title but it also has a studio version which has a bit more little bits and bobs that you can tinker with to help out and then like equipment and stuff I'd recommend any webcam that you can find any camera that you can get phones are actually a fantastic camera these days and almost everyone has one now everyone has some sort of phone with a camera on it so if you want to show your face they're a great option if you want a microphone I'd recommend I mean something like this could still do if you really have nothing let's that that's the thing if you're starting off YouTube you don't need this right I've accumulated all these bits and bobs over five years of doing this but I started off with nothing and I had to build it up but like a phone is really all you will need for YouTube these days to be able to go out and do it there's people vlogging off their phones and you can do anything with any piece of equipment you have you just have to get creative with it and try your best with it but if you want to get like a decent mic at a small price I didn't recommend the the Yeti snowball or they're not a Yeti they're the blue snowball and or the blue Yeti those are those are great mics I started off with the blue Yeti sign the petition good job Browdy yeah the the chat moves fast I'm sorry tried my best to get through it I love bendy and the ink machine I'm glad you do I do too check what's your opinion on therapy and stuff oh that's a good question sir I think therapy is way more important than people think it is because a lot of people seem to think that therapy is for people who are broken who has something wrong with them oh I've gotten through a trauma and then have to get fixed after that trauma or need their brain rewired or to come over PTSD different things like that that's not the case at all you can be perfectly fine and therapy is still a really good idea to go to because therapy well I'm not a therapist I really shouldn't speak for therapists but in in my head therapy is a good tool just for adults it's like what kind of analogy therapy is almost like cleaning your house you don't you don't just sit in your house and wait for the dirt to build up to a point where it's completely affecting your life you don't get to a point where it's overloaded you and you can't go anywhere without seeing the filth and then it becomes such an impossible task to be able to overcome that that filth on your own going to therapy is kind of like that it's kind of just like brain maintenance it's personality maintenance it's good because I heard a great quote I can't remember where I heard it from now dammit oh god I'm sorry I heard a great quote which was that therapy is good to go to because it it it helps you prevent bad habits from forming that might be that might be inevitable to form anyway whereas going to therapy after those bad habits have formed is a way harder thing to do so if you go to therapy when you think there's nothing wrong with you I'm pretty sure everybody could gain something from therapy because it teaches you that fools to be able to overcome stresses and strains and anxieties and depression if those things ever rear their heads which they do for a lot of people and to go and figure out how to deconstruct that mentality before it happens sometimes is more important than trying to figure out how to cope with it after it has happened so going going to it at all is just a really good idea and I know some people who could really do a therapy I myself I I'm gonna start going to therapy next year I think because there's a few things here and there that I think I could deal with a bit better in my in my brain I have I have I have a horrible in incessant stew try and please people which is why I think I do YouTube and why I think I'm so emphatic towards people all the time because I just want people to do well I want people to be happy I want people to be nice to each other and sometimes that happens to a fault and it ends up breaking me down because it's it's too much to handle sometimes or that sometimes I don't value my own opinions the most times I do most times I believe what I'm saying but sometimes I'm like I I start doubting myself and I feel like some therapy sessions can help me overcome whatever's going on inside my head and help me cope with these types of things whenever they arise and just make me mentally a much healthier person so that's a good question because I I feel like there's a big stigma against it startin to again overcome these days because a lot more people are opening up and it used to be the thing like even as much as what thirty forty years ago it was a thing that like oh no men had to be macho and had to hold on to their feelings and I show any emotion and women were the ones that cried and then as years have have gone by people are just so much more accepting these days it's easy to see the world as a terrible place and it's easy to see it in a way that's like oh we live in such a bad time and sure some things could be better but we live in a pretty fantastic time for a lot of different things like equality for for different genders is becoming a really strong thing which I'm very very happy about more countries are coming and like legalizing gay marriage these days like you can see like people aren't afraid to show their emotions as much anymore you can actively just see men crying all over the place women crying all over the place that sounds bad but you know what I mean people are people are less inclined to hold on to their emotions these days and like I told the story before how we went to after I recorded the bro average video we went to a Chinese restaurant me and Cena just get dinner and as we were waiting for the food to come out I was sitting down and I was just thinking about stuff I was looking out the window and I just saw two teenage dudes hoagie chowder and embrace each other and just like say goodbye to each other and walk away and I don't know if they had a romantic connection or anything like that I don't think they did boy they just embraced and back even as far back as ten years ago when I was going to school you could not do that embracing your male friend everyone would just call you gay and make fun of you all day and just in the space of ten years it's bananas to see how much has changed and like gender identities has become such a huge thing in like the last five years it's amazing the world is the world is progressing the world is having great stuff so let's let's keep it progressing let's keep it moving in a forward way and let's let's keep culture progressing and becoming a much more positive place than the garbage cesspool that it can be anyway moving on good question about therapy remember that check would he ever play with vanossgaming I played with him once but it was kind of a spare time can you think we played depth there shark game dahi and Louie were there as well and we just they would they were getting ready to play da he asked if I wanted to play and ba√±os was just there so I played with them in that regard but I don't think anyone recorded those episodes that I record that I don't know but I have played on since I mean I mean no rush to play with him he has his own thing going on I have my own thing going on where we share different spaces we like different games so I don't think it's gonna happen he's a good dude he seems like he he seems like just a nice guy how many monitors do you have I have two for the longest time for the first three years of doing YouTube I swore by one monitor and everybody else he was using two monitors I was like why why do you need two monitors you don't need that and then it was the more I started doing it I was like oh you can do that with the second monitor so like if I'm recording or if I'm live-streaming a game now that's on one screen and on the other screen it's like OBS that's so I can monitor like the frame and I can monitor frame drops and everything and then I can have the chat over here different things like that and right now like the music and everything is over here that I can flick through but what I normally do is if I'm recording a game for a let's play I'll have to gain here and then over here I'll have audition open so I can see my voice going so up here I have a screen on top of my camera I can monitor my face and if it's still recording and I can monitor the game with shadow play and then over here I can monitor my voice so I can see everything that's going on at once so two monitors is good might even get a third one eventually if I ever get heavily into streaming which I want to do next year I want to start taking streaming a bit more seriously and do it more frequently I might get another one I put it in portrait mode which is flipping it this way and it's long so then you could just put chat and different things on that I think that would be really helpful Seana I like your videos not because they are funny and then like games I like them because you have good quotes and then keep up the good work Thanks well that's sweet I was Batman telltale going I have no idea I don't know when the next episode is coming out if they've said anything about it I don't understand why communism is good dude you're coming to the wrong person to talk about communism too because I know next to nothing about it I mean except like basics but when it comes to that kind of stuff I'm not gonna start talking about things like that because I don't know what I'm talking about I'm not an authority on them I'm wondering when that's the case you can sometimes do more damage than good but then why the fuck would I want to talk about communism anyway even though it's weird because I have their hat the glory to arstotzka hat that looks like the one from papers please but it does have like a Soviet Russia symbol on the front of it I'm not a communist or a or in support of anything like that somebody just gave it to me as a thing for papers please and it just so happened to have that symbol on it are you going to be doing anything involving an T in the future I mean he's always gonna be there every now and then whenever I do stuff but I think I'm gonna take a pretty long break from it not that it's not that fun to do anymore it's still super fun to do but I feel like I'm getting a bit repetitive with it which is which is something I wanted to avoid and I feel like it's getting to that point so I'm trying to pull back now before it gets ruined still super fun still love people interacting with it a syllable of people coming up with theories and their own stories and everything but it was also a case of I wanted to keep the character ambiguous because I wanted people to make up their own theories but the sake of leaving it's so ambiguous and so vague kind of lacked a focal point for people so people didn't really know what to do with it anymore and in that regard he can fizzle out pretty quickly so I want to try and avoid that so instead of just keep doing and pumping it out and trying to just run their character into the ground I would rather pull back for a while and then next year I want to do like something really proper with it I don't know what that is yet but I want to like make it a much better thing but you can ties into the whole making 2018 the best year ever kind of vibe which I still fully intend on doing I keep saying that part of it is also for my own mentality to get into that zone of like just working because I turn down so many things because I'm afraid of it upsetting my schedule or just not having time to do different things or whatever next year fuck that I'm doing as much stuff as I can which might get a little weird there might be some things here and there that you're like what but we see what happens you guys know me I would never do something unless I had a reason to do it sorry I've gone I got distracted I was just reading people's messages I'm going through Twitter right now just to change things up and get some different questions from people haha today in English class we watched wall-e for an assignment are you jealous today Wally on this weird called him Wally said Wally I have that on blu-ray I can watch that anytime I want and I will what yeah I'm jealous that you watched it today I love Wally it's one of my favorite animated movies I was trying to pinpoint in Hawaii as well because some of my other favorite animated movies by the way are The Incredibles which the second ones coming out next year all my god that's gonna be amazing and full of wind I also love the Iron Giant oh god that movie so good as well but I think the thing that I love most about wall-e was but Orion did it made me make me cry but like if anything ever makes me cry it when I cry it's so many things it doesn't take that much to make me cry when it comes to like like fiction or movies or books or I never read books what I'm talking about movies or books or advertisements or anything like that or games but I loved the fact that wall-e is a it's a movie that like the main character doesn't speak other than his name and Eve's name kind of thing so that's fascinating and I just love how they they did him and how they made him look and act but the the sound design that movie is really really good as well it was the same dude who did Star Wars I believe you talked about therapy on the stream while I'm here on therapy right now is somehow it feels comforting that that makes me happy and hope therapy's going well for you because therapy can also be very scary because it can start to poke holes and stuff that you either didn't know was there cuz a lot a lot of a lot of our our feelings and the way we are and a lot of our personality is based on what our parents have imprinted on us as kids and moving forward a lot of that can stay with you and rear its head when you don't even realize it or it could be there and you could be acting a certain way because of something that happened ages ago that you don't even remember it's just kind of in your psyche or it can like therapy can start poking away at these things that you didn't know was there or you know is there and you don't want anyone talking about but it's it's worth getting through because as I said you can unravel that and try and figure out why you feel that way and if you ever go into some sort of spiral or get anxiety or anything from those those types of scenarios you can start building up the blocks again if like okay this let's not go into this spiral let's figure out why I'm feeling this way so that's also important but yeah it can be very scary so I hope it's going well for you did you draw this of me would save the internet on my chest or is that just a picture you drew or since a picture going around the internet that's awesome and they signed it also sent it to like almost all my friends that's awesome good job I know you've talked about this before but do you ever see yourself writing a book and if so what about well if I did think about writing a book I probably wouldn't be able to talk about what I'm gonna do in it it's the same if I ever think about doing a show or doing a song or I don't know I'm not doing a song by the way but if I ever had the idea to do them I don't know if I'd be able to talk about them because contracts and everything which is the main reason why all these projects get slowed down believe me it's hard but I probably will write one eventually I just have no idea what its gonna be about and that's the truth I'm not saying that because I don't like I can't talk about it I don't know what it would be about because a lot of people write about their lives I'd like sure people would eat that up people would spy it I could spam the shit out of it become number one bestseller somewhere but it's like it's not really warranted merit then I'd write I'd rather write something that actually means something to me or as funny or just has some sort of twist to it instead of just writing about my life unless I could find a good way of writing about it that that had some impact to it instead of just being like I started YouTube in 2012 and I made this video and then I made this video because I don't want to I don't ever ever bank on the naivety or the the trustworthiness of your audience or the eagerness of your audience because it's easy to just turn around and be like hey I made this thing go by it yeah thanks whoa just because you have the audience there to mobilize them to do a thing you should still do it responsibly I didn't even see Robins message from 38 minutes ago he just said beyond 2 souls more like beyond your ass ha ha no but I fucking love you buddy what are your thoughts in doing a house tour I'm not gonna be doing a house tour here ever sorry I I know people want to see the house and people want to see you where I've moved to and everything and just the way everything's laid out I get that I myself love looking at people's lives and behind the scenes the people who I look up to online or the youtubers i watch I'm always fascinated by what goes on like the grumps did their office tour and I was enthralled by that their office is amazing but here because this is my house and because I've had issues with people finding my address and just coming to my door I don't want that to happen again it's scary it gives you a lot of stress it gives you a lot of anxiety it gives you a lot of fear for not feeling like you're safe in your own house so I I'm not gonna do a house tour III don't want that happen plus it's not just for people doing that but it's also because I want like this is something for me like my house where I live for my personal time for my private space but I want to enjoy on my own without showing it off to other people and there's also that other aspect of no matter where you live no matter like if I bought a house that was 10 storeys a house that was one storey an apartment a box doesn't matter what you buy where you live what you rent people are always gonna judge you based on your surroundings how people are gonna look at it one way or another and either say oh he lives in that shithole or all he's doing well for himself I just I just want to avoid all that kind of stuff if I can it's just it's my house it's my it's my own personal treasure and I love this house and I'm so happy with it so I want to keep it precious and I know that the stream is still called hashtag net neutrality and I didn't I'm not talking about that endlessly and that's not the only topic that I'm talking about but I still wanted to be there it's like the first thing people see but again terney charity stream this weekend it's awesome too cuz I got the run of show I got the rundown of what we're actually doing for the - for our segments but the thing is well at 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday it's going to be two four-hour chunks so it's not gonna be a super long live stream but we are trying to do a lot in a short amount of time so I I want to like make sure it goes well as you keep saying boy I finally got what like the list of like challenges and games and ideas and everything that we're doing and it's got to be really fun there's some silly stuff in there as well and there's some surprises that I don't even know about that's gonna be exciting and there's something between the streams as well so it's not just those two four-hour chunks there is something between the whole thing so keep an eye out for that as well not gonna spoil it do you have any music recommendations oh my sweet summer child let me take you on a journey as listen to some fucking music dog first off the first playlist that's up on my Spotify right now is like a retro wave kind of spot of or like playlist retro wave stuff kind of like this yeah okay you're loud and then it has like oh fuck yeah that's turbo killer by carpenter brut wait for it wait for it wait for it wait oh it's gonna get fucking real it's so fucking good that kind of shit love that that's really good there's a whole fucking playlist of songs here there's like 60 songs that I haven't that it's actually the doctor disrespect playlist 2017 if you want to go look for it because he plays a lot of retro wave stuff at the start of his streams I love dr. disrespect he's awesome so I looked up as a playlist from him that was there one of the source I have my library sadly one of my favorite bands of all time do not do online music which is tool if any of you listen to tool they are phenomenal probably my favorite band ever and they were introduced to me by my brother Malcolm and we went to see them when I was 16 in Wembley Arena in London and it was fucking awesome but he thought her system of down system of down had a huge impact on me growing up as well also introduced to me by Malcolm but to will just make these really like psychedelic kind of songs and it's it's it's rock and roll it's heavy metal it's I don't know how you describe tool they're weird but they're so good and their drummer is probably probably one of the best drummers I've ever heard in my life I I like them a lot some other music recommendations old Avenged Sevenfold's stuff is always good waking the fallen city of evil albums and their self-titled just a fine Sevenfold album the color and the shape by Foo Fighters is really good ashes of the wake by Lamb of God is a fucking ball or album best album of all time or is it or is a tool album the best album of all time a lateralis might be a really good album of all time but so was toxicity by system of down awesome old Lincoln Park stuff Hybrid Theory and meteora rest in peace chester miss you there cause that that band had a huge impact on me in my teen years as it does with most people ascendancy by Trivium is a really good album the way of all flesh by Gojira is really good kochira are fucking nuts listen to the shin fucking drummer is a beast and his name is Mario Mario Duplantier they're French and they're his brother sings but the brother like obviously this is not gonna be for everybody cuz it's heavy metal and a lot of people can't stand listening to the whole like gruff vocals to me I think what I think what like dictates what music you like listening to is well first off it's all feel it's how it makes you feel if you want to listen to focus because it makes you wanna like bounce around listening to heavy metal makes me want to just like fuck and throw my fists in the air and that to me is my favorite type of music but I think what in flex a lot of what people like is what instruments you like listening to or like playing so if you play guitar obviously you're going to be more inclined to listen to the guitars in a song if you're a vocalist or if you don't play any instruments you're kind of more inclined to listen to the vocals and that's why I myself listen to drums way more in songs than I do almost anything else in them but with heavy metal it turns a lot of people off because they hear the gruff focus and like how do you listen to that you can't sing along to then first off fuck off yes you can but also I like I get it I get why people can't be into it but for me it just it feels so like primal it feels barbaric I wanted to learn this song but a tired wait phrase this part started coming up in certain cokes he changed the time signature ah god that's good oh good shit I like that that was like my that was my going to the store album for a while messengers by August Burns Red August Burns Red are a really good band as well how would you describe them I think they're more metalcore but my god listen to this this drummer is a fucking beast as well Matt Greiner Spacely I don't know like that gets me in the mood everyone else is like to fuck yes I'm well aware that this dream is gonna get claimed no I don't really care do I like jazz beyond the b-movie meme yes I do like jazz I was listening to jazz here just that's a very nice smooth move I'd never listened to jazz just as like my main go-to listening music it's more of background audio to me you should listen to babymetal funny story they actually came to me like two years ago and asked if I wanted to do like a brand deal sponsored type of like collaboration video with babymetal and at the time I was like I can't afford to take time away to do that but now I'm like why didn't I do that that'd have been amazing quit turning off the good tunes okay fine we're about to get into some fucking rad tastic music are you oh this is the best song ever created that song is so good that's called kuqali Khan by Ishtar and we found it will actually Cena found it because she found a video from Final Fantasy 14 of like a glitch that happened with the arms in the air and they're just this little tiny boy character flying around the map good and that music was playing I was like what the hell is happening oh it's hard to feel it's hard to feel sad listening to that this is what goes on in my head that's that that would be like my theme song for me walking down the street just in my head everything is just like birds and Disney movie oh that's just incredible I love that all right what other fucking bang and slamming tunes to be like listening to um I played recently recently played Oh Disney songs ah of course of course you got to listen to some fucking Kendrick Lamar can i I'm afraid to play some because he uses the n-word a lot as is the case with his music so I'm just afraid of repercussions technically he's the one thing and I'm not but why have that on the stream but Kendrick Lamar amazing music what an incredible rapper but his his album damn when that came out I listened to that start to finish about about six times every single day for about a week maybe an exaggeration but you get me nothing like listening to you that's the thing when you like all types of music it's hard to just like funnel it all down mainly heavy-metal stuff but periphery are good actually there it is right there when I went to search periphery is good if you endless into periphery Icarus lives oh so good pretty free you're fucking awesome the gent type of music that has that I do well you know gent you get it gentle music I said that's an insanely good song as well my my ex-roommate used to play that song when I went to college for music technology the guy I was living with in her second year was the guy who sang the songs on our our own music oh please some of that as well but he was he was really into like heavy metal too and he he showed me so many different songs and his name was Conan like literally his name was Conan fucking awesome but he introduced me to that something he would always play it and I'm like what are you what is that song put it on again and they made him played way too many times and he kinda got annoyed with it let me see hmm okay yeah I would put on this this is my music is me playing drums right now and all the guys in the band will like pain all the other instruments obviously ah such a simpler time I remember everything about that music but that's another song or another set of songs that I want to do a cover of as well but this is my favorite song that we ever made services and we thought we were so special with this song because we did a thing near the end of it like this thing that digga digga digga digga den turn turn turn turn we did a thing at the end of it where we cut the time signature I just went into the next part but then afterwards it matched back up again so and okay if any of you have ever recorded music you know or if you haven't recorded music if you know if you have a recorded music you know what to talk about but you use a metronome to record the drums and usually you use a metronome to record everything but you can't use a metronome to record the drums and then everything else has played over the drums the drums are the backbone of the song there it's what's like sets the time signature for the whole song and then the bass kind of adds to it and then guitars and everything and all the melody and whatever they're not gonna get in specifics and every song is different but when you play to a metronome it's like that ding-ding-ding-ding tick tick tick tick tick you know it's just a time signature and it plays and you have to play in time with that and that's how you keep in time with the songs but I had never played with a metronome before and I was like oh shit yeah I should practice that before we go actually professionally record these songs so the week leading up to these songs I was just sitting in my in the log cabins playing drums to a metronome playing these exact songs to a metronome over and over and over again and making sure I had it proper but this song the time signatures change and it messed up the recording and we had to figure out how we actually did that we we ended up doing it but it just gets a little weird yeah this is me playing drums I can convey this song a bit but it was a harder song to learn how to play I'm waiting for the part by the way like the time signature changes to the killer Diller chiller disability and that stuff till it at the political appeal Italy like it's still the same time signature you're still just doing this it's still just 4/4 time but as you're getting through it the beats are off so they're offset every so often so it sounds off so when you're head banging your head doesn't always land the way head banging works the reason you want to do this is because you're going with the bass and the snare so it's like bass snare bass snare it's good like anything so when when that's happening you're going with it and then it's like oh wait my head doesn't match up with the snare anymore and then it's all off so we were like oh that's cool and Conan actually came to me with this song and he came over from band practice one day and he was he went to college with me so he came up and stayed the night in the cabins and he showed me the song and he played it around and I was like oh that's really cool and then within a half-hour we had the whole song written he had the whole guitar parts written I had all the drums written and by the time the other two guys showed up to do Brian practice it was like okay here's the song we wrote now learning and then it goes out to the same time thing except this like have but they said this was her because it's diddily diddily diddily so you're doing triplets so it's like on your feet you're going like diddle it did it did it did delete delete delete for any proficient drummer that's not gonna be harmful for me at the time I was like um what am i how do I do so I knew what to do in my head I always know what to do my head but it's trying to get your body to do it is a different story but that was a foreign song so trying to get back in and learning that again it's kind of hard because I didn't have the muscle memory still but doing that I have no idea how Conan did that and sang this part at the same time because it's like the sound of it okay I'm gonna geek out for a second all your music heads out they're gonna love it everybody else bear with us because it's like diddle it to diddle Attila to diddle it did it did Allah to dilla Dylan - Dylan little Attila so each set of the triplets are extended and shortened so it's like it goes forward and it goes back and then at the end it just meets up in the middle again anyway so for me to just keep keep that in my head while I was playing it was already hard enough and he was singing that while doing that so I have no idea how he was fucking to an end like James Hetfield has some of the stuff he plays in Metallica while singing I have no idea but let's get to the end of the song I'm breaking down razed to the ground your freedom my burden playing on at home put on your cassettes and pinch harmonics those are this because the first time it goes didn't intent and then the next time it'll intent didn't I know it's hard described but this time it caught the beat off and then it would start again so we're like that's clever we're clever boys for coming up with that I know it just occurred to me that I've never talked about this stuff I've never talked about how the music came about how the music was made how it sounded like I'm fucking sorry I'm a band that's been touring for 30 years but I've never talked about how that stuff was like formulated or how we came up with that stuff but then you had this song called spit it out which isn't that a slipknot song whoever had to copyright that that never would have worked so this this stuff is very trashy like Metallica stuff kind of mix with some metalcore sounds but the speed of it was very trashy and I fucking love drumming to this song and this for any of you out there who listen to llama god or listen to the drummer Chris Adler this is the type of stuff that he does I was really into Lamb of God back then so I was trying to like incorporate some of his style into what I was doing as well as some like the rev from Avenged Sevenfold that whole like dupa dupa dupa dupa dupa was very what kind of music would that have been it's kind of emo it's kind of Punk it's kind of metalcore type of drumming and then this stuff like the ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting was very um was very Chris Adler he literally does the speed in like half the song the business disappear did it so simple sounding now it was just so much fun to drop but it's just such a steady lake the guitar tone was so nice I felt bad as well because when he was singing this song singing he it was so much because all the lyrics like are layered so you can hear him like cut into the end of the sentence to start the next one and then it would start the next one so when we did this song life he was never able to do the vocals properly without getting lightheaded because it was just a consistent like barrage there was no time for breath so our guitarist had to learn how to do that like type screaming I used to be able to do it but now I can't and my throat's all dry but he had to try and learn how to do it and he couldn't really do it so it sounded a little lame so whenever we did the song live he didn't have the same bite to it and we all kind of came up with the lyrics together but there's a part that I love in this song the solo by the way again I'll get to that in a second but there's another part that's very Chris Adler this base from here to get the present that death I used to love playing that beat haha oh it sounds so good even now the songs fucking badass but the solo good garden the harmonies okay a little background we used to have another band and the basis in the guitarist in this band lead guitarist in this band not the singer guy they were in the other band with me and we had two other guys and one of the older guys was an exceptional guitarist he could play anything he could play all day sinister gate solos from Avenged Sevenfold he doesn't play all the Trivium solos he was fucking nuts but he his hurt kind of wasn't into heavy metal he wanted to play more bluesy stuff more jazzy stuff and I was fine so we went we went away and played this other band but the lead guitarist in in our band for this song he wasn't that good back then he was just like a rhythm guitarist and he got so good when we started to play these songs and then he made up this solo and I was like what are you the same guy this is burry Avenged Sevenfold's because I'm in a second it starts didn't like harmonies maybe it already is harmony there's like two guitar thing at the same time for this solo so good because he has like the the kind of like the the bluesy like jazzy like lingering notes at the starts and then this parrot was all like alternate picking like a row maybe was finger tapping finger tapping like diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle and then the last part was all sweet picking fucking nuts oh man what a legend what a badass ah I miss doing all that stuff and again if you don't know anything but guitars music picking drums it's probably all gonna be lost but it's fun to talk about it anyway it's fun to share that knowledge cuz I like this side of me was something that I just didn't talk about a lot before until I started doing drums again and then everyone was like wait you actually can play drums I said yeah I don't just say these things I actually can't do them so and I just never really talked about drums and guitars and the music and I never really listened to the music properly because other than a live stream when was I ever gonna do that when was I ever going to sit down and listen to the songs she took her three days grace ha funny story there I hate everything about you song we Mimi and Conan did that song as a project for our school like for our college exams or a college project we used to take away at a scam recording equipment and we had to do a song so we did three days grace which he did most of the work but I did all like the technical recording aspect of it but because it was a we didn't put drums on it because we had to rent out their space and everything and set up a kid and all that and it was much harder to do but we did we did I hate everything about you an abridged version of it I don't think you're active right now while streaming but I just want to say hello because my stupid piece of crap phone won't let me comment on the stream alright go back to you go back in your way Thank You Katie thanks for tuning in is there any link to any of your music from when you were in a band yeah if you just search razed to the ground or a ised oh yeah the title of the band cuz raising something to the ground means destroying it but I think it's spelled or AZ e or like raising something to the ground raised to the ground razed to the ground which sounds the same as raised was a completely distinct word is defined by compact by the compact Oxford Dictionary as raised also raised were obtained down and destroy so to tear down and destroy something is to raisin so like arrays but or AZ e so we were raised to the ground but we were or a ised cuz you were raising to the ground we're like play on words we're so fucking cool so yeah Rai sed raised to the ground we only have four songs that we did we were working on a fifth but ours our vocalist and guitarist he progressed way beyond my abilities as a drummer he started listening to gent stuff like their periphery stuff I was telling you about and he started getting to really wacky time signatures but me as a drummer my my brain was not inclined to be able to play that stuff so he he surpassed me in time signatures in his own technical play and I just couldn't keep up with him so I try to learn some stuff he went away and he got some people on line to come up with some drum tracks digitally and he came back and I tried to learn some of them but even that it was like I I can't play these I'm not good enough and it sucked because I wanted to be good enough to be able to play them but my brain just my brain got so far with drums and just couldn't progress any further and we just we all kind of went to like some of the guys started going to college in different places so we all just kind of broke up and stop making music I hope those guys are still making music haven't talked to them in a very long time hi I just got back from dinner Ava welcome was it a good dinner welcome I myself should go get a beverage right now I'm going to go out and get a drink but I'm going to leave you with this me Vani Lucia amazing amazing yes I just got another bottle of water for those who are really into the jacksepticeye lore who want to know about what I am drinking this is a made it sound like I was making fun of people who would actually genuinely be interested that not my intention I'm just joking around I was got a pepper ami sensually peels off plastic sleeve from pepper ami hmm all right what are we talking about dudes I move off a little bit from the music talk honest people want to hear more about it if you have some questions send them my way i all ear holes please tell me that y'all are signing that petition yeah again very important the net neutrality stuff I talked about it earlier in the stream I don't bog down the whole thing again repeating myself but very very important I left stuff at the top of the description that you can go if you're American you can text resist to 504 0-9 and pick Congress as the option and follow the instructions and if you're not from the US you can sign the petition in the link below all those stuff that I went over at the start of the stream as well is that again this weekend in two days time on the 15th well it's a day now for me because it's past midnight but on Friday the 15th and Saturday the 16th they saved the children the children that stream is happening and it's going to be fantastic we're going to raise a lot of money for a really great cause and then moving into next year as well we were going to raise a whole lot more it's gonna be fantastic Jack what do you think about vine - is he really gonna call it vine - I know the guy who made vines and he's gonna make a follow-up which more power to him that's awesome but he posted a thing called V - and it was the vine logo but was just a square next to it please don't call it vine squared or vine - or anything like that I mean from a from like a America - bull standpoint that makes sense because people know the vine name but don't Twitter own that copyright won't make any sense what did the door say - the knob nothing it's a door good joke sorry I'm eating into the mic I'm him joke's on you - Piper rama's bitch but I'll eat the other one in a second hit me with those quest o's dog I ain't getting any younger not getting any older either I'm staying like at a perfect middle ground I have special eyes but come on give me some Christ rose to a I know a lot of you are giving me questions but I would also like some new questions a lot of people are asking and stuff that I've already answered at the start of the stream no I'm full of burps again hey you listen to Hollywood Undead I used to listen to him a while ago what was that big song they had that like first got them started I want to say that it says Undead at the start 2008 everywhere I go I don't know that is super popular song when they first started coming out and I really liked that song I've listened to man ages though I don't even have to do the same type of music anymore it'd be a little weird if they did no band is the same type of music year after year after year after year can you write sheet music um these days I wouldn't be able to but I used to be able to I had to learn well back when I was a wee lad about 5 6 7 years old in that timeframe we had to learn recorder in school and primary school and to do that we had sheet music with us with like the letters underneath it like the notes underneath it and then after doing that for a while I used to be able to just read the sheet music like by sight and just play the recorder that way and then going back when I went to college and doing music there I was doing music theory I had to learn how to play keyboard and everything for some of my classes which again wasn't my strongest interest which is one of the reasons I left but I I was getting pretty good at it back then as well I like learning my different clefs and the left different like the different and I can't even think of the name of it now oh you have like the different notes in different lines and the different versions of all that and figuring out like the circle of fifths and shit okay last plate and then I'm gonna finish eating there we go okay when the charity streams this weekend be posted in full to your channel I'm pretty sure they will be my intention is to do it because their Friday and Saturday the charity stream is the only thing that's going up both of those days because also I'd have to prep more videos if people are coming in but the main reason is because I don't want to dilute the the message behind the stream or dilute the cause so it's just going to be those things for those two days and it's kind of nice to just like take a break away and do something do something good and if I upload it like if we upload it on you what what am i playing lately I've floated if I uploaded a Hello neighbor or a super hot on the same day as I'm doing a charity stream it's a bit weird but I do have more superhot recorded I have one more Hello neighbor recorded I wanted to record more getting over it because that's the type of game that I want to be good at and I want to actually try and finish but it's just there's no point there's I've seen the ending to the game there's nothing there like getting to the end even after all that struggle still doesn't feel good you don't get any to quote EA any sense of pride or accomplishment so like the whole point of that game is the journey that you go through that like yes life has its ups and downs and sometimes you fail and sometimes you succeed sometimes it just fuckin makes you want to punch a wall but it's it's all just a thing that just exists there and it's up to you to do what you want with it so yeah sure you could spend your time getting angry at it or you could flip it on its head and just have fun with it and that's what I want to do but I've tried to get back to where I was in my spare time I'll turn on the game and then I'll be like okay I'll get past the lamp section you know those two lamps that are stuck there and I tried to get past then and I just can't I can't even get back to where I was naturally a well it's also because I'm not putting the time in to actually like get good at it and understand the controls so it's still all random for me when I get in I'm like okay get there in your own time and then start recording when you get to the section that you were at and then I started up I can't do it I spent 15 minutes trying doing it I'm like you know what this is just it's already agitating me so I'm just not gonna bother if something's if something's gonna upset me physically like at an actual anger level if it's actually gonna make me angry and frustrate me then what's the point it's not some fun to watch that it's not fun to play that it's not fun to be part of that's no fun to have that in your body because it's not just the thing you go away from and just go I'm okay now because it's just lingers it just makes you feel bad and I try and take it a little less seriously now so I probably still do some more videos on it just don't expect progress I've been other kingdoms and castles video recorded because I love that game it's so cute I love playing it and then after that I might go ahead and keep that Kingdom just for myself but then start a new one with like the dragons and the barbarians and the Vikings and all that sorry I'm just giving you the list of what I have recorded for the week oh yeah and then there's just a bunch of other stuff that is like once-off type gangs or the start of something so I won't spoil them you're gonna have to figure that one out for yourself but don't worry it's pretty good JSE ASMR oh yeah that ASMR in your ears or just do what everybody else does at ASMR and just be like it's me it's very realistic no I'm not gonna do I don't even like ASMR everybody's like oh it's Amar's awesome it just makes you feel so relaxed no it pisses me off like that sound of crinkling in my ears it's like I don't hear somebody whisper sweet nothings to me I don't care Oh Minnesota accent oh oh heck Oh garsh Oh for pete's sake sorry I watched Fargo and then that's the equivalent of what my my accent from the Northeast could be north northeast wisconsin minnesota why what the gosh what the hey Chi double hockey sticks I mean if Martin Freeman can do it I can do it ASMR gives me the chills if people say that is that a good thing is it a bad thing it feels like bad touch it feels a little like stranger danger just saying alright what's your favorite Christmas scent the musk of Elan I with the DES beats yesterday and I'm real burnt even though I put on sunscreen twice must be nice must be nice to even put on sunscreen and still get burnt but you come over here everything that'll burn you is the hot poker I have waiting for you at the door Pamela Pamela Pamela what am I gonna do Jay Bob's asked Pamela we must settle this argument by asking the person whose opinion matters the most okay wrong add Pamela Horton which is better milk dark or white chocolate which Pamela said hmm depends on my mood number one is milk second is white never dark I hate dark chocolate Obama those are all the wrong answers all of them the orders wrong not liking dark chocolate at all putting milk the highest oh the Hollywood and dead something you're thinking about is undead yeah I did say I thought they said undead at the start of it so let's let's see if we can find you it hollywood undead Undead very very clever title let's listen yeah wait for it they're gonna say it roles are gearing up that's a very cool song that day today today today that's a cool song I like that song I don't know if any of the other of their other stuff is like that but that song is just has the perfect amount of like like yelling screaming kind of stuff from the the melody super nice and that did it it it it it is really cool and that they just the tone of what if he's playing a guitar or a keyboard these days you never know it just sounds really really nice have you ever I was visited party oh no no Mon petit tiny person I have not my brother lives there but I've never actually been there myself I do plan on taking a trip over there at some point to hang out with him I just to see Paris it's there it's super close by now than live in Brighton would you consider video games a sport or is it not because that doesn't involve physical activity but it does involve physical activity just it doesn't require you to sit in a gym all year round to get into the Olympics or anything like that which is the old-school method of thinking about sports but it's I mean we have eSports it's it's definitely a sport League of Legends tournaments are becoming massive it's even being considered for the Olympics at this point so yeah video games can be a sport have you ever heard of the Hamilton musical let's not get down that rabbit hole okay so many people are gonna be mad that I still haven't listened to it I have a new nickname for you Sean William McLeod my toilet you just have to legally change it now Maddie what am I gonna do with you that's not my name it doesn't it doesn't live up to the the the austere vibe that I gave out you know hey is it snowing there nope snowing everywhere else in England but Brighton cuz we're coastal so we don't really get that type of weather down here unless it's extreme but no it's not I'm hoping it's snowing soon maybe I want snow I would like that that would be very nice and then I could roll around and it naked and say I died I know you've probably seen this question somewhere but how excited are you to see the last Jedi oh so excited because first off when I like making the new trilogy I was like ah okay I like Star Wars I don't know if they're gonna be any good so the force awakens love that it's a little safe as a movie but I really really liked it we actually watched it again last night means Cena for just prep just to refresh our memories and I wasn't super excited about the last Jedi I was excited to go see a new Star Wars movie because I always am and I just love going to the movies anyway so whenever there's something out I'm like yay movies but Star Wars I really like cuz it's sci-fi and it always has the cool visuals and sound effects and lightsabers there's a fucking past and I wasn't super excited about it but then I heard that Ryan Johnson Bryan Johnson is a tree in Orion he got his own trilogy after directing this one he directed the last Jedi and when it was finished Lucas Films turned around were like hey do you want to direct your own trilogy so then I was like wait he got his own trilogy after doing one Star Wars movie how the hell so that that bolstered a lot of confidence I had for that movie that what did the executives at Disney see that was suddenly like oh my god he did an amazing job for that movie to give him his own trilogy or either he has just some good ideas going on that they're they're really keen on and then just everybody who's done to the premieres everybody who's reviewed it I've just had glowing reviews about it so I'm very very excited about it trying my absolute best to avoid spoilers I still have a few days before I get to go see it he's actually going to go we were supposed to go see it tomorrow I bought tickets for me and seen it go see it and they but then the stream was built around this and it was moved and everything because the stream was originally supposed to be last week and then that was moved because of different complications so now it coincides with people coming over and the stream is happening so now I have to wait a little while but I can hold on going to sleep now got college in the morning thanks for making me smile thank you and good luck with college you do you ever get the gifts from your solo tour I didn't I need to get on to Brent about that they might have got lost in the mail which makes me sad but I haven't gotten them myself yet hopefully yet do you like any motorsports I love drifting and off-roading can't say I do my sister and her husband are really into forming the one stuff I mean I can watch it and get some enjoyment out of it but I don't actively look at it my brother my other brother not Malcolm he is he likes rally stuff and I used to like playing some rally games and everything but I don't actively seek out any motorsports look music is great movies are great you're great your channel is great Thank You Alexandra I appreciate that dude are you excited to have Ethan out there I am I'm excited to have everybody out here because they planned for the stream originally was to go to LA boi different complications with that and because it's a fundraising event and visas and just different things kind of get in the way of that so to try and avoid any sort of legal damage or repercussions we decided to just do it here and it was originally we didn't think Ethan was going to be able to make it because it was originally supposed to be the 8th and 9th and different reasons I'm not going to say why Ethan wasn't able to come here during that time so we had to like that made me sad and then I didn't think PJ was gonna be able to come because his birthday was around that time so he might have been busy and then it was just all kind of falling apart so the fact that this is happening at all still is a miracle and I tried really hard to keep making it happen and trying to keep it going so I'm really glad that it's still happening and I'm even more glad that Ethan's able to come now he's able to come over for this week and that Robyn's able to come over because Robin hasn't been here either so I'm excited to show them around and have fun with them and just sit down and watch movies and eat snacks and have a few beers or whatever it's just going to be a good time it's very very rare that I get to hang out with my friends outside of conventions noticed me before net neutrality dies please Oh something very very sad about that if your five-year-old self suddenly found themselves inhabiting your current body what would your five-year-old self do first probably climb everything at that age I was just wanted to climb stuff and play with my tractor's so probably just the exact same self except now I'm taller so I'd be able to climb everything do you listen to Michael Jackson doesn't everybody listen to Michael Jackson Michael Jackson is great what a legend to have existed outside of whatever rumors were going around but just from a musical standpoint remarkable probably never get one like it again hey when is the next Escapist - it's been so long since the last one I honestly don't even know if I'm gonna go back to it because when I came out I was super excited about because the escapers was one of those series that I've told the story before how I was just recording stuff for Christmas and then people adored it and it's one of the best series that I've ever done and then the escape was to came out and I wanted to do more of that stuff and try and relive the memories and it was going well and then deciding to do like the multiplayer stuff and then it all just broke and then trying to go back and I realized that the escapists games are just a lot of it's a lot of just waste of time there's a lot of time in it cuz you guys see the best parts but I have to record episodes for like an hour and a half just to get twenty minutes of footage because there's so much in it that's like Oh waiting around for each day and maybe get the item that you want and so much of it is RNG so after a while it just becomes monotonous and because it didn't change that much from the first game you kind of feel like you're playing the second or the first game again after a while I've ever muted or blocked to someone some people that are really really bad but usually no not unless they do something really bad but I pluck and mute every single one of the free jumbo Sam plushie things because I'm hoping that as soon as I tweet something I after I tweet something every single time I go underneath and I I block the the spambot so I'm hoping that that removes it from the chain and that nobody else sees it so if you see them just don't reply to them because I end up blocking them and if you're replying to them then your reply is just to no one if it actually does disappear I'm not sure if it actually disappears hey Jack I'm watching the stream if you see this please answer my question are you ever going to play tabs again I wanted to and then I looked it up and I didn't seem like there was anything super new in it like maybe a few factions or a few levels or something but then when I went in to try and play it my thing didn't update so I'm not sure what's going on with it but it yeah I'm up for playing more of it I love that game it's so silly your music flavor is like candy to my obnoxious ears glad I can help also I don't have anything to say I just wanted to do that makes me look smart when you pause the jacksepticeye stream and come back to this pleasant picture it's just me with pepper ami sticking up like a little penis what is your favorite Christmas Carol what's there that song that's like fall on your knees o hear the angel voices that one ornate divine o night divine yeah that's how it's so beautiful this song made me cry when I was younger because we would go to Mass every every Saturday but during Christmas all these songs would be sang by the choir and a lot of the songs were just like regular ol Christmas songs but for some reason this they sang this song one year and it just hit me that's like an 8 year old boy in church and it just it felt so powerful there's a specific section that happened that I was just like I don't know what happened my body just felt like there was something so much bigger than me and I was just like I was so overcome with emotion that I cried it's so beautiful this part other than Hawaii it sounds a little different here it's a boys choir singing that part but there was a specific version of it that I heard and just the words like fall on your knees and hear the angel's voices and to me it was just like it was like like like I could picture it in my head I was like god that's fucking powerful I'm so bizarre was a weird boy even back then have phone touch with my emotions I also cried watching Titanic when I was 9 are you gonna play accounting plus for the VR for the psvr no I'm not I saw the trailer for it and it doesn't look like there's much different it's like a super secret level that they talked about but there's not a whole lot to that game I feel like playing it once was enough you would play more Doki Doki and getting more endings yeah after the stream is dawn maybe towards the end of the year either no I might do a live stream where I get all the endings because to get the other endings you have to play the game like three more times and get the different parts with the different girls like say Ori Natsuki and Yuri so I want to do it I want to get everything that has to be done in that game love that game it's amazing watching the stream right now and have a question do you plan to do fallout for VR let's play soon or maybe just one video on it yeah that came out recently as well and I had high hopes for it but it was the same with the doom VR VFR let's call us I had high hopes for that as well I was gonna do that I was going to pee or fallout 4 i still do fallout 4 but the reviews have not been good people people are not treating that game well so I fear that it might not be the best are you gonna do more serious games don't get me wrong I love your silly videos but a whole other side of you comes out when you play those types of games yeah I will I just have to find the right types of games because it's very rare to find some stuff that is like that strong emotionally like I pray I played far from noise recently and that hit me hard and that's I think that might be the last serious thing I'm doing but if I did too many of them then the more serious Let's Plays would kind of they kind of lose their value and I also don't I don't want to do them for the sake of trying to force that type of commentary out because I know people react positively to that but I have to genuinely feel that way about it I genuinely have to react to the game instead of just doing it me like oh well people like when I get serious so I'll look for serious games sorry I don't want to fall into that trap either but fire from noise no far from noise is good I like that and though those more serious games are always the ones that like sure people don't watch them as much as the other games but I feel like they stick with people a bit more yeah I haven't done anything super serious and well I mean I'm always open to suggestions any games you feel like like hit you emotionally I'm always open to giving them a try but it's nice to change up the pace of the lets plays now and then instead of just doing the same all shouting le man any advice for a girl with a broken heart in a shattered world at this moment I really need it oh I'm sorry just time Hannah time there's a reason people say time heals all wounds it really does whatever you're in right now can feel like the end of the world or feel like the only thing that you can feel right now and I've been there I've gone through my fair share of heartbreaks and breakups and things like that fair share it sounds like I've been through ten of them but it really can feel like your world is crumbling around you but just hang in there so forget better it always does and then you're pregnant probably find a love or a sense of joy that you didn't even think you had or could find the next time around can you actually do a South African accent no like the actual legit South African accent I can't it's like the one that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't Blood Diamond it's like it's all it's almost like a New Zealand accent it's like what if min or it men kind of thing yeah that's the best I'm gonna do that's all you're gonna get it's over you need tall good holy garden from streaming for over two hours my Jesus also what's hilarious is that now because I've played so much copyrighted music in this stream now it's going to get claimed by so many different people and they're all going to have to fight over the copyright of it and the revenue streams so just sitting back in flames just being like how about it that's kind of funny check if they got rid of net neutrality tomorrow what would you do about the stream how would you approach it well that's the thing the repeal is happening tomorrow so that's why it's important to do it now so we can hopefully nip it in the bud and not have to deal with it anymore but there is a chance still after that don't wait around it's still important to do it now but if you if like if they repeal it tomorrow it doesn't take effect instantaneously they're still gonna be a bit of time there still needs to be laws drawn up and different things like that and it needs to go to court needs to go to something needs to go to Congress I don't know I don't know how that you the judicial system works over there so how was the disaster artist that was an amazing movie as someone who loves the room for just how silly it is and just loves the appeal of Tommy Wiseau cuz he's just such a bizarre dude watching the room or watching the disaster artist was incredible and James Franco did an amazing job of capturing what it was like to be Tommy Wise oh it was so good there was some moments like I I've never been to a movie or the audience all got in on everything together like when parts happened people cheered at the end of it people had a round of applause I've never had that kind of stuff happen before so really good he's changed a lot hasn't he what a glow up yeah the picture of me back in the the race of the ground days in the picture of me from like two days ago quite a different boy I've grown up a lot my facial hair now oh yeah game suggestion for you Robin is playing the last of June looks like a game you'd like he's her has absolutely gorgeous visuals yeah that's one of the ones that I have recorded that I'm I have started already based on it was a game that came out a while ago and I like the artists I loved it I thought was going to be another because it's one of those more laid-back games that has like a story just a story to tell and it's a bit more serious and but there's a little goofy elements in the here and there and I wanted to play it and then other games came out so I kind of put it on the back burner for a different time and then Robin started playing it and he said it was really good so I decided to play it based on his recommendation as well oh yeah this is another game I know this is probably repetitive but if you have to time check out the boss and honestly wonderful fanfare a lot of people put a lot of work into it and it has a great message please consider playing it yeah this is a somebody made a fan game actually I don't know how many people works in it some people made a fan game called the boss and people have been wanting me to play it for a really really long time I have seen the messages by the way I'm sorry that I haven't responded to any of them I keep meaning to but I also keep meaning to play the actual game so I might livestream that some night as well and have a little bit of fun with it I think I think that would be good and people have a lot of really great stuff to see I see it and Tumblr all the time people talking about and have very high regards for it so I will play it eventually remind me again I might not get to it until the start of the next year just keep that in mind there's some stuff that I kind of just want to close off this year and start the next year fresh and there'll be a couple of days I'm taking off towards the end of this year as well like Christmas Day Christmas Eve there abouts I'll be taking off just cuz I'll be here on my own I kinda just need some time for myself it's been a long year I kind of just need some time away from people just to recenter my brain and like get and get my plans in order and get my brain in order and just get rid of some demons take on some positivity make a plan and just start next year strong a good system I found I heard somebody talk about was that to come up with come up with what could be the best thing that could happen to you in five years time or a year's time or whatever make up a plan and see where you want to be in a year's time see what you want to have accomplished in a year's time and then also write down what the worst things that could happen in a year's time and well within reason not like oh I could die but something like if you didn't accomplish this one what would happen here then would you be happy being here and that gives you something to distance yourself from if you have the negative side of it drawn up cuz it's easy to just say well if you don't do that then this could happen but if you actually write down or visualize what is going to happen if you don't do these things that you could just be miserable that you won't be you'll regret not doing them all these different types things if you if you actually personify the negative then it gives you something to actually visualize to get away from and visualizing the positive also gives you something to grasp onto so I'm gonna try and implement stuff like that and just use some use some good tactics to get myself focused also maybe go to therapy and go to go to a doctor and try and figure out if I do actually have a DD and maybe get medicated for it it's just like focus down do you do stuff for myself after the longest time I've done stuff for other people and I still will always till the day I die I will always do stuff for other people but for a long time I've been doing stuff more for other people than for myself and I've let a few things rattle me this year and get inside my head and I kind of want to overcome those and do next year fuck yeah 2018 the year of Jack the year of us I should say what days are you going to be at PAX East if you are I really want to get to meet you you're a huge inspiration to me thank you but Friday and Saturday badges are already sold out and if you're not there I don't think I can spend that money I should be at PAX every single day I it hasn't come out yet when the signings or the panels are as soon as I know about them I will let you know believe me but right now I can't say for sure what days I actually have stuff going on and I absolutely apologize in advance if it's if either of those are on Friday and Saturday we don't get a lot of leeway with these things so apologies on that front but I should be at PAX all days and it's four days this year so I should be just roaming the floor anyway oh because I set up my mute and block people it's it's never anything like if you say something that sounds like it might be offensive to me or might be taken the wrong way I would never ever block or mute people because of that I'm talking about people who are like absolutely horrific to me or my loved ones or my family or anything like that people who are just like stalking or abusing or just saying insults and anything like that like none of you guys are ever blocked or it's just spam or like like porn accounts or anything trying to pretend to be me stuff like that it's never innocuous stuff and even if someone says like jacksepticeye use sock it's never anything like that I would never be that petty it always bothers me when people like mute and blocks people who don't agree with them on Twitter that is just like how insecure do you have to be that someone's like oh I don't agree with your politics it's like well fuck you I'm blocking you or if you say something that you believe in and somebody else is like you suck get out of here no one cares about you like sure that's annoying and it's not nice to hear that but blocking them out right is just I think that's an overreaction for that stuff it's like I'm a person here broadcasting my opinions and my tastes and my desires and feelings to people all the time i I just yap yap-yap and talk to you guys all the time and have my own opinions and god forbid any of you have your own opinions to say back to me right like if I say this stuff all the time if I talk to you guys all the time honestly truthfully openly about my own thoughts and opinions and if you don't agree with that Who am I to start blocking you because you don't agree with the things I'm saying how egotistical must I have to be or insecure must I have to be to do that I feel like anybody out there sure it's not nice to see it or hear it but I also think that it's again it's an overreaction to to block somebody else for what they're saying if it's legitimately upsetting you and making you cry and making you feel horrible then yeah maybe it's not worth seeing but then I'd also I'd also start wondering about how how Ben official it is for you to be on social media right now without figuring that stuff out for yourself first like do like I don't want to say fix because it sounds like there's something broken within you but do you first figure out you first before you start broadcasting yourself to the world if the world not being nice to you is legitimately gonna upset you and bring you down because the world will the world the internet will try and bring you down and it will it will try and destroy you if if you give it a chance and as soon as you show that door to it it will it would barge in and kick down all your furniture but I just think it's ridiculous for people to start blocking others because they don't agree with what they're saying or stuff say it's a very narrow-minded way to be I always like to think that sure I don't agree with what this person is saying but blocking them outright is like I would never under I would never figure out how to understand them then we were never coming to a mutual ground we will never get to talk to each other because I have closed off that pathway immediately before I have any chance of understanding what's going on it's weird man these are these are the types of things that have but doing YouTube and being on the Internet has taught me like growing up very quickly and trying to learn how you like wade through the waters of being an online personality or being having some sort of influence or recognition the strange world to be part of fantastic world though fascinated by it this year hasn't been a great year and I felt like I turned into a cold person but a few of my internet friends say that I remind them of you which is hard to believe because I feel like I'm a terrible person and you were genuine and humble oh we all feel like we're not the best person in the world every now and then it's completely natural and if you feel like you've gotten cold this year as a person then like that that's not an irreparable thing you can come back from that and you can try and work towards being a more open and more in person again so don't don't don't sell yourself short glad to see you taking some time off and taking care of yourself mental health is important and you talking about your boat talking about self-care is setting a good example for others keep being your wonderful self love you oh you're being way too nice but yeah I agree because I talk a lot about I talk about a lot of things but I also talk very strongly about mental health and anxiety in charities and different things like that and interaction with people and I feel like what's the point of saying it if I'm not actually gonna fall on my own example I feel like then it's just empty words so I I think it's I think yeah if I don't feel like I'm up for doing stuff completely throughout not that I I could do it easily it's not gonna be any sort of detriment to my health but why not take some time off for myself to figure things out and I feel like that's important a lot of people who do YouTube including myself as of like the start of this year feel like you have to constantly feed the Machine all the time because it's all you always start off gaining traction gaining subscribers gaining views and you're in that race and you're in that and you want to keep that momentum going and you want to do well and you want to progress and then if that slows down at all you feel like you're going backwards or you feel like you're not you feel like you're not doing enough for your audience or you feel like you're not doing enough for yourself or you feel like you're gonna miss out or fall apart or disappear and I've slowly become to realize that that does not happen you can do whatever you want and still come back from it well within reason obviously I'm not I'm talking about YouTube stuff now so I've tried to come over that every now and then it just takes some time for myself because it's important thanks for a nice dream but I gotta go now I'm seeing the last Jedi I hope you have a lovely evening I hate that you're going to see it before me but enjoy it I've heard it's really good I hope you have a blast and thanks for showing up sorry to bring up negative stuff but in the Instagram jacksepticeye community there's a lot of drama and people who argue and say nasty shit to each other and it's hard to get an influence to stop this because you aren't too active on Instagram any thoughts sadly yes Instagram is the one place that I could never ever try and set a good message because I I think it comes from Instagram being visual based because on tumblr on Twitter YouTube is different because I mean it's it's the whole experience but on Tumblr and Twitter it's very text-based and it's very like talking to each other based whereas on Instagram it's very visual based and people are very quick to judge based on appearances so in in some cases I I try my best but in some cases it's like a lost cause because Instagram Instagram also doesn't have the right tools in place to be able to interact with people in any sort of proper manner like on Twitter you can easily see who's interacting with you you can easily see if I'm interacting with you and you can easily see if I'm interacting with other people who aren't you it's the same on tumblr it's the same and all that kind of stuff but an Instagram it's not because it's all based in the comments because it's the picture first and then it's the interaction whereas here it's interaction first and then it's added interaction so it's a little harder to do on Instagram and I have tried but it just sucks Instagram is such like their it has the most vitriolic communities I've seen and people are so quick to start slinging mud at each other on Instagram before any other platforms that I've seen and that's something that is really sad to see and you're right I'm not as active there because I feel like I can't be in any sort of meaningful manner that I could put so much time and effort into it but people still it would just go over people's heads or people wouldn't see the interaction or it wouldn't set any sort of message so but if you are saying shit to each other if you are bullying each other if you are doing any sort of negative software toward each other then you do not belong in this community to begin with that is something that I have never stood behind it's always something that I've tried to fight against and I can't get to everybody I don't feel like at some point I can only do I can only do so much I don't feel like I should be the babysitter for the entire community all the time every single day I can only do so much by sending a message it's up to you guys to take that message and spread it among each other and for the most part you guys do do that and I'm very proud of that there are gonna be some people who get very aggressive with each other but at the same time please try and fight the urge to fight fire with fire please try and fight the urge to start slinging shit back at them or bad-mouthing them or talking about them behind their backs to other people in your community because you might think you're doing a good thing still but any sort of gossiping any sort any sort of shit talking any sort of bullying of an e-form any sort of thinking you're better than each other is completely unacceptable and I do not stand for that and I will not interact with people like that and I will always fight against that type of stuff might not always win but that doesn't mean I should stop trying because anybody who anybody who thinks they're better than somebody else because they either got noticed by me or they think they know more about me or they think they're just better than other people in general have such an off moral compass that I don't think I don't think what they're saying has holds any more weight than what you say and we're all created equal role on this big ball of earth and water going through space and at the end of the day we all reach the same destination so use that time that you have right now to set a good example and to be better and to contribute something within the society I know it's easy to say that and sometimes you might not feel like you're contributing anything worthwhile and it's very easy like even doing this stuff even even doing YouTube sometimes it can feel like I'm not doing enough but as long as you're trying you are definitely doing it so just keep that in mind but anyway I think I'm going to leave the stream here not only is that a nice place to stop off but I've been streaming for two hours and 40 minutes so and it's 1:00 a.m. here and I kind of want to get some more stuff done before bed and because we have a long day ahead of us tomorrow and the preceding days as well so yeah but thank you guys for joining this I want to talk about it again one last time before I go tomorrow is the repeal it is tomorrow right the repeal for net neutrality if not it's happening very soon pretty sure it's tomorrow but the repeal for net neutrality is happening and it's very very important this is this is a thing that affects everybody all over the world I'm sure it's affecting the US more immediately right now but this could have far-reaching consequences that we should all be aware of I don't want anybody out there to be like well I live in Europe so it's not really happening to us right now still does not mean that it's less important you should still fight for your neighboring people the people in this community are all from all over the you should still be fighting for those people to have the chance to still remain in this community and still engage within this community fairly openly and neutrally because if net neutrality goes away a lot of these people a lot of people in this community a lot of people together who talk to each other online right now your best friend might not be able to talk to you anymore if this goes through because they might not be able to afford the package or some Verizon or Comcast can shut them down and stop them or just not allow them to have high-speed Internet for that website so this is very very important I have left some stuff at the top of the description if you are based in the US I don't know if it's only the US or if it's Canada as well or if it's just North America South America but if you are somewhere that this will work you can text resist in capital letters to 504 zero nine and pick the Congress option I myself have not done this so I don't know the steps involved please look it up if you if you have to and then if you're not part of the US you can sign this petition which I've left a link to as well very very very important this stuff is very serious and we should all be part of this together and we should all be fighting this together and I really believe that this is a cause where all other past grievances push them to the side for a second just for a week just just for a day anything at all just take enough time to push that aside and come together and reach a common ground on this and let's fight this all together and let's keep Net Neutrality going for as long as we possibly can okay good um also we are doing the charity stream on the 15th and 16th Friday and Saturday the the plan right now the most up-to-date information I have is that we are doing it at 6:00 p.m. my time so as of now it's 107 a.m. for me right now so on thinks it's seven hours ago basically that this will happen seven hours ago from now in your time zone is when it will be happening on the 15th and 16th that sounds confusing but it's 6 p.m. my time UK time so whatever that is for you please please keep in there please keep that in mind and I will be tweeting out about it as time gets closer anyway and we'll have a really great time because we are so we have we have some matching donors for a hundred k there are some surprises in store that i will talk about when the stream is going on but it's going to be really great time and i'm counting on you guys to help out with this i'll be helping out as much as i can myself personally and we will be helping out as much as we can on the streams and raising awareness please try and help out when this happens i'm please if you cannot help out financially please just be on the stream anyway watching the stream itself will also bolster the numbers which will also add to it being discoverable by other people but also please send around the link to the stream when it's happening raise awareness for it with other people who are your friends family anybody at all strangers on the internet anything can help and we can do a really great thing and make a really great dent in society at the end of this year and do a really a really good thing so I hope to see you guys there but for now I am going to go thank you guys for hanging out for what was an incredible stream I had an absolute blast doing this it does not feel like I have been streaming for almost three hours I got to talk about music I got

Ummmm, wait, where is his office? Counselor. Here we go. Yeah. *imitating Mackey* "I hate children, m'kay?" Yes, sir. Look how fuckin' ridiculous I look. Oh, I actually have to go take a seat. Okay. No. Oh! That's kinda cool! So they actually have an "other" option. That's pretty neat. Good on you, South Park. Umm, umm, Imma pick male. Just so I could be Jackaboy Man. *laughs* I didn't know you could pick this. That's pretty neat! Ummm, I mean, I- I kinda wanna pick this option just to see where it goes and just to see what the dialogue options are. Let's do this. I'm- I'm curious to see how they handle this. *laughs* *laughs* He didn't do anything! I picked it cuz' I wanted to see how the game actually handled those topics. I mean, Not- Not a whole lot happened. But, umm, it's cool that they actually have those options in there! I didn't- I didn't think they would. Tha- That's at least nice to see some representation. Yeah! More thinking. Positivity. And Mr. Mackey has always been the dumb character anyway, who doesn't understand anything, so. *sings along to game music* Why is the music constantly playing now? Locked. Okay. Well they are called lockers, so. That would make sense. Is that music supposed to be still playing? Did I break the game? "Can of Ass Body Spray." M'kay. "Actual Boys' Penis Size Poster." Oh I got a yaoi poster! *laughs* Oh my God. *laughs* I actually haven't watched that episode with the yaoi stuff in it. Oh, something's goin' on. Oh Jesus. Are you serious? Okay. The music's still playing!! The music's still playing in the background, I think I broke the game. Also, I'm- I'm pretty sure I saw that no matter what gender or what sex or anything you pick, the characters will always show up and be like, "Oh, we got a cisgendered boy," or "We got a trans girl here," and they ALWAYS kick the shit out of you anyway. Ummm, okay. *reads ability descirption quickly* Yeah, I'll use this one. HUP UNGH!! Nice. *laughs* "America: love it or get your ass kicked." Yes, we can do this. WOOM!! WOOM!! Aw yeah, here we go! *reads ultimate ability description* Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. SWEET JESUS!! *clap clap clap* OH WAIT!! YEAH!!! *laughs* This guy in the front it gonna die soon. He- He's super hurt. And I'm gonna knock you back into Jimmy. NICE! They should be all dead now. Okay. They're not all dead yet. Umm, let's- let's make it happen. Let's make that happen. Hup! NICE!!! SWEET!! WE WON!! YEAH!! TAKE THAT YOU FUCKIN' RACIST BIGOTS!! *sings along with background music that has been playing ever since meeting Mr. Mackey* That music is so annoying. *laughs* "Buy me a taco..." Kay. Music's still going. I'm gonna have to restart. Hold on a sec! Hold on! Did it work? Ahhh. Blissful silence. No more *sings music from before* *laughs* It was gettin' annoying. Kay. Let's steal everything in these cars and- Hmm. I guess I can fight you douchebags. Kick the crap out of you! "Defeat the Chaos Minions." Okay, how many of them are there? Four. 4 vs. 4, we can do this. Ummm, Imma do this and a little bit of that! You're immune to fire?!? "Time to break a leg, yours." Ummm, can I attack this- okay. HA HA! I'm invisible so you can't catch- OH WAIT! IT'S JACKABOY MAN!!! Sorry, I keep forgetting to get into combat mode. Cuz' to me ALL mode is combat mode. You guys suck!!! *laughs* Okay. Can we- Can we heal Craig? Can we? No? Okay. I need to heal you as well anyway so C'MERE! SHINGG! Nice. Noooo. STOP punching me! You guys are dickholes. Umm, 34 damage or 26 and a knockback. I'll do a knockback cuz' I think you'll go back to hit your friend. AH SHIT. Oh I can hit both of you with this!!! Oh, because it's the knockback, okay, I get it. I love how he's all bloody (?). "Topsy-turvey time, twerps! Are you supposed to be Irish? Nice. (x3) NICE! Okay. Now he's still safe. Ummm, SHIT. I mean, I can attack you but you're gonna die anyway so.

AH HA HA!! That's awesome!! Did we win? Ow. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!! Are- Are- Are we okay? Is Jimmy still alive? Oh! So if one of them dies it doesn't matter. Okay. *imitates powering down* Powering down. Nicce!! Okay. We're almost at level three. Oooo I get an artifact slot in the next one! Tasty. Right. What am I even doing? Ohhh use the alley to get to Raisins. Ohhhh this alleyway. Cool. Now we're in this section. Ummm, let's head down to get Mosquito. Ew, this place sucks. Because everything went down here last time, didn't it? How do we get to Mosquito? Where is he? Jesus Christ, calm the fuck down. It's showing that he's off over there somewhere. Oh well. Got'em! What is this? Oh. The 'Member Berries. *laughs* You guys are, like, eight!!! It's so creepy. Oh. Sorry, I hit F. *laughs* Oh I see. WHAT THE FUCK?? Everybody's against me. Fine. Do you know where Mosquito is? There he is. *laughs* He has ketchup all over his his chest. I have to fight them? Aw Jesus. If- Okay, first off I get it. The Raisins Girls are supposed to be, like, the kid version of Hooters and South Park is always about the kids being in adult situations anyway, but this is canonically fine that all these girls are workin' in a place at 10 and, like, the chef in the background was an adult. Anyway - Jackaboy Man: here to kick some ass!!! Oh shit, he's charmed. OH SHIT, he's confused! We have to hit our own guy! *reads info bubble* Okay.

I wanna use this one. AAAHHHHH WOOHAH!!! Nice. Aw, that would've been awesome if I could hit them all in a row. Shiit. Okay, I can take her out. *laughs* Oh God, I'm so sorry. *laughs* OWW!!

Ohhh baby... Ohh yes, haha! We're in! We're in to win! whoo okay! Top of the morning to ya Laddies! My Name is Jacksepticeye, and welcome To "Last Guardian" VR Demo! Full disclosure, I had no idea this was a thing and I should because I love The Last Guardian so much, and The the Team Ico games are my favorite games ever made like the Shadow of the Colossus. I've talked about this a bunch of times.  And when I played the Last Guardian I gushed over that endlessly and I can't wait to see Trico up close but Until, was it the Game Awards recently or the PSX event they were talking about a Last Guardian VR demo. And then everyone was tweeting it at me saying Jack! Did you know this is a thing? I had no idea, it came out today, as of recording this, it came out like right today. And I downloaded it last night, and I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about having to record it today, and I'm so excited so it's a PSVR experience and It's not the full Last Guardian game, by the way, It's just gonna be like a 15 minute demo where I get to interact with Trico. And I don't know if it uses a controller or if I have to use the move controllers, but I think it's just this one Whoo. And I'm so excited. I can't wait to see Trico up close again.  Ohhh. Okay, give it to me game. Give it to me game. Wh-What are my options?... turn settings. Okay, I need to- You know what?  I think it's gonna be fine. I think it's gonna be good. Just give me Trico! Hold to reset view, turn, action, okay, so it is with this. Ooaah! I missed the Last Guardian so much. I wish I ha- I wish I could play it again for the very first time. Oh, yes... Yes, oh I see his tail! Trico!!! Where are ya?!  Can I move?  X to move. Okay.  Oh! Hi Trico!!  Hahahha!  My god! It's so weird. It's so weird to see this world's like to scale!  God it's huge! Trico, how big are you? Come on baby, come on, baby!! Oh haha!  Oh my god, you're fucking huge! Jesus Christ! Oh I want to pet you! Ooh!  I really wanna touch you. (hehe) Oh Jesus! Oh haha! Oh this is awesome!! Oh! There we go. There we go. I'm petting you I think, I don't know! Can I use the controller's? Oh, I really want to figure that out. Aww so cute!! You are gigantic! Like even bigger than I expected you to be! Ok!  Do you want to eat?  Right, what can we do? Ok, I'm gonna move over here. Trico! That's my little Derka-Der. Ok, let's go over this way, I have a barrel. Here we go!  Trico, I have a barrel!  Do you want it? Ok.  Uhh, Let's throw! There you go! Eat the barrel You got it? Oh my god!  Hahahahaha! Oh, you're so cool! Oh, look at the little butterflies everywhere! (so pure) Jesus man! Whoa, that's high up! Oh God!  Oh God, Trico! Whoa! Cause you play the game, and you obviously know Trico is bigger than the boy, But you can't see it from the boy's perspective. And now to see just how gigantic Trico is, is kind of scary. You're terrifying!  But also highly adorable :) Okay, there you go! Nom nom? You had nom nom? Trico.  Trico, no!  Here! That's a bad Trico! Hey!!  Trico!  OoOh. Oh... Oh! Oh! OOOHhH!  Oh-ha-oh! Holy shit, you're tall! Fuck me! (hehe) Whoa! Okay, here you go. Whoa. Did I do that? I'm a strong boy!  Ok. Yes! Hahaha! It's like feeding my own giant, dog, cat, bird! Ok, you want another one?  Here. Yeah, Trico, yeah! Whoo! Haha!  Eat up, boy! Ok. Do I get to do cool shit? Like hold on to you as you fly around the environment. That would be awesome Ohh! Trico, I missed you so much! :,) Oh, haha! That's so cool! Oh, to see your eyes light up like that right in front of you is really creepy. Ok... oh? Ok, Trico, I'm going this way! Trico! Trico! Ok. Let's go down and entice him. Let's go over- It's a shame that you can't walk around... normally- but I get it, VR experiences are kind of clunky. Ha hi! So, you can't really just walk around as the boy naturally, you need to have some restrictions, but this is still awesome. OAaaaaAaAAHhHhh!  UGH! Trico! Everything went dark.  Oh, there we go! *sounds of awe* Jesus! Whoa! I'm trying to put it into perspective... it's like standing Like, I don't know how it looks from your point of view, like watching this video. But, from my point of view This is like looking at It's not even the same size as a bus This is way bigger! it's even bigger than a double-decker bus. It's - so huge! Trico's like 20 feet tall! I want to grab your tail! Can I - Can I grab the tail?! Trico?! Trico! Oh, can I get on your back? Oh, yes! Oh yes, let's do it! Wait, I want to get on your head! Go! Ya deh wea! Trico!  Yi di diti. Are we going? Whoa! Oh! Oh, that's fucking marvelous! Oh, dude! Trico, you're the fucking best! Come here! Aaahh. Oh, I can actually call you anytime I want! There's your butthole! *giggle* (quality content) Where we going? Whooa, dude! Holy shit! I am so excited about this! Oh, dude, I want to cry!  :,) To think- ha There was a time when I was afraid this game wouldn't even come out, in general. And now I'm sitting here in VR in this world, looking at Trico up-close. This is- this is like a boyhood dream come true. Oh, man! Oh!  I wanted to do that! :( I wanted to give it to you! (hehe) Fine... huh Yih dee oh! C'mere!  I want to pet you! Yea dih tuh! Yeah! AaahaAaHhaHAwWWw! You're so soft looking! Ok. Oh Jesus. Oh, I remember this part! This is the demo! It's missing some parts, but... Oh! Ohahaho!  OOoooH No!  OOohH! Let's just say, I'm glad I'm sitting down. Maybe I don't need to sit down for this. I thought I did, but I'm just sitting down for- The ease of comfort. Oh my god! I'm just gonna take all this in. *fear of heights sets in* That's really high up. Ohhh, I hate that!  I love it, but I hate it! Oh no, oh god. Now I got the willies. Oh, Jesus! Are you gonna go across there? Do it! Do it, Trico! Do it! Go! Whoooahahaooo! Uh oh!  Uh oh!  Uh oh! Trico, I gotta go- I gotta grab your tail! Eet beeck! Can- can have I help? Oh Jesus. I forgot, I don't grab your tail. I grab- I grab you.. Okay! Okay... Oh! Jesus Christ! Oh my god!! No.. Uh, Uh! Catch me! Catch me, Trico! Trico! Woouhhoh! Ahaha! Oh, pick me up! Put me down!! Oh, sweet Jesus! Holy fuck, that's scary! Oh, thank you, boy! Whoa God! Oh God, ok! Ok! Ok, you do- you do your thing you You do your thing. Whoa! Whoa, that's scary! I mean, it's scary in the regular game Where do I go? Onto your back? I'm ready! I'm ready. I shouldn't yell, cuz I'm right in your ears. And you have ver- Oh Jesus... Ohaho! Oh, this is so cooool! Oh, dude! Haha! Do it, Trico! Do it! Do it, Trico. Do it! Go up! Woohoo! Oh, fuck yeah! Ok, I-I legit teared up at that part. I know it's stupid! - But this means a lot to me! AaaAaaAHHhHhhHhHHH (nice, Jack) I'm right there with you boy! Oh my god. I don't even know how to- I don't even know how to commentate on this, because I'm just in awe. Ok, I'm sorry, hi. Alright, come here, I want to pet you! Oh, no!  Is that it?! NOoOOoO!!! Oh, I was just getting started! Oh, now I'm sad... :( Oh, man! Whoo! Ok, that was marvelous! That was everything I could have hoped it to be... Oh, that was so cool!! Cuz I had an idea in my head -before I played it- how everything would look, and the scale of it and everything It was way better than they could have imagined. I legit teared up at that last part going to- going across the thing. because just being on his back for the first time, and being able to see all around and see what the boy was able to see in the game Cuz when you're playing the game, you want to be that boy- Well, kind of, you don't want to do the treacherous things that he does- but, you want to be able to like sit on top of Trico and see what it's like to be able to witness the world all around you, and that's just so cool. And that's one- that's the thing that VR I think does best. Is selling the scale of everything. And, if it's- if it's a game built for VR from the ground up It's kind of hard to get that sense of scale -well obviously the sense of scale is there- But what I'm trying to say is that having played the Last Guardian- normally on the PlayStation, and then seeing everything the way It was, and having it in your head of how you think it would have looked if you were there And then to actually be transported into it and definitely see the scale of everything and how it was to be there is mind-blowing And it's a shame that the game is kind of just like point and a thing press X to go to that thing and then having limited interactivity around that um- I get the limitations, VR is hard to do especially for a game that's not designed for VR, and then you just cram VR into it and this is just a demo to try and show off and sell the VR feel and, it was- it was- even- even this was just really really damn good. And I'm highly impressed with PSVR Like, I play- I play HTC vives as my main VR platform all the time And that's an incredible platform to be able to play VR games like the resolution and the the tracking and everything feels very good the controllers are very good, but this is damn convincing! If- if you're- if you're out there looking to buy VR stuff, and you're like. Oh, I don't know about PSVR Because it's- it's a lessor platform, and it costs less, and you think that it's not gonna be as good- It's very, very good. If you want to get a sense for what it's like, every time I play these VR games- if you want to get a sense for what it's like to play like a HTC vive game But you can't afford that. This is a very good option, and it definitely sells the sentiment it's not Perfect it's not the exact same But it definitely gives you that feel of what it's like to be in the VR games like the way I play them all the time. So if you're if you're looking for a budget option. This is the way to go and There's a lot of games coming out of this and Sony are actually Sony are giving a lot of support to this like with stuff like this This is just a demo But they're making a lot of games for this and they're really trying to sell it and make it go Make it go places and a lot of the experiences aren't Amazing, but a lot of the experiences in my HTC vive aren't amazing either like they're still just games or you sit down and you Interact with the world coming towards you a lot of the time. It's it's very It's very few and far between when you get something like superhot VR and sprint vector those types of things where you have complete and direct interaction with your environment, so Don't don't feel bad. If you have one of these and you if you're looking at me play HTC vive games going Oh that must be so much better. It's not that much different It's some stuff is but I-I mean There's a lot of games out there that are still just gimmicky and you're still just sitting down and like shooting waves of enemies coming At you so it's not that different. We're still yet to see people fully adopt that sort of stuff. But anyway, back to the Last Guardian... amazing It's so fucking good, and it's free. It's just a demo right now I don't know if they plan on doing more with it I think this is just kind of like a showcase that they were doing So I think this might be all we ever get with The Last Guardian VR It'd be cool to get more, but I don't really know how much more you'd get out of it I-I would settle for a whole game of just going around on Trico's back? That would be marvelous I'm just happy that I get to go back into that world, because I miss that game so much. it's one of my favorite series that I've ever done on the channel and it was one of those series that everybody on the channel got behind and that that almost never happens these are like The miracle series that really stick with people and this is a series that I'll remember forever No matter how long I do YouTube no matter where I go I always remember what it was like to record that series because it had such emotional Weight to me it had such emotional impact to me. It was a game I was waiting for for years and years and years, and we all thought it wasn't gonna come out And then it finally came out and to some people some people didn't like it The controls were a little clunky the camera was all over the place, and yeah, I agree but I I just had so much emotional investment in it that I looked past those and I was able to enjoy it anyway and then to think that you're sitting there in a VR experience just looking at Trico next to you is just outrageous, I never ever thought that that day would come I never even thought that that was a day that could come and now to Have it here in front of me. It's just spectacular Absolutely blown away. I wish there was more to it I wish I could just do more of this type of stuff, but it is what it is I'm just glad I got to play it at all But anyway, thank you guys so much for watching this episode, if you liked it, punch that like button in the face!!! LIKE A BOSS!! And, Derka-Ders all-round!!! *Whoopsh!! 2x* But, Thank you Guys! And I will See you Dudes , IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!! Outro- I'm Everywhere By Teknoaxe Derka-Der!  Yah deh wei! 
hello welcome to Streamy time Junction we're playing some Shadow of the Colossus because I wanted to and you can't stop me and I'm my own person I'm not gonna be like running around in the environment or anything anymore on aggro it's literally just the Colossus fights and we're going to beat the crap out of them because we're going to do time trial mode so we have to be pretty fast with this so when you finish the game you can go back and time trial all the colossi if you just go to all these like little areas here - there are statues and it'll show you what the time is to beat them to get like unlocks cuz in here how do I actually access it in here yeah items so here we have a bunch of items that were able to get so if you finish 6 colossi in normal time attack mode you get a mask of strengths which gives you strength I guess I don't know mask of power you have to defeat 12 but then if you just come down here if you defeat four you get a cloak of force misses for in hard mode you get the sword of the Sun you can get the Queen sword which I think is the sword from eco and get whistling arrows for two in normal mode which sucks they're terrible the harpoon of thunder is pretty damn good I like to harpoon of thunder you get a lizard detection stones there's a bunch of them that are crap like stuff that I don't really want or care about or need boy a lot of them are really good like some of these swords and some of these cloaks and everything like the cloak of deception lets you hide from the colossi I think a bit better so we're here to do this it's been a while since I've done any of the the time mode so this will be interesting come here ya big bubbeleh can I actually hit you nothing I hit you oh fucking lag oh no this is gonna be horrible okay not off to a great start we can do it did did do dude okay okay less of the shakes last of the shakes more of the bendy Downy's there you go there you go get all the way down there sir you might think two and a half

tick spoon ish crap my bucket health bars okay gonna have to change that in a sec I was just getting ready to stab [Music] normal mode is usually fairly nice with it's times then a minute and 20 seconds that shows you how quick this game could be done at the end of the day okay his hellfire is gone now so now I can't like there somewhere I know you know what would bring my face down to there so it's nice to flush with that whatever that happens world-record pace here we go speed run y'all you're about to see a master in action three and a half minutes for this one no problem John Cena's

Colossus is kind of bent down if you go with a grow really fast you can leap off and like land on its head you don't even have to do any of that stuff it's crazy okay let's go get our second item this should be this is this might be good the cloak of force by wearing it thou shalt be able to inflict more grievous injuries upon a colossus so these ones are really nice these types of upgrades because

legend wonder her mother of Christ like I expected to see like half the health go down or like a huge chunk of it go down I did not expect him to just die that was a rageous oh now we're doing water boy 9 minutes even 9 minutes to do this one that's also the thing when you do them you kind of don't really realize how long each of them take when you're just doing them naturally it's when you have a counter here and then you're like whoa that actually took me a lot longer than I thought it was going to so maybe this one actually takes a lot longer than I'm thinking it is nice though that as you're progressively doing this they give you the Wow Oh should have been wearing rubber gloves they give you the stamina bar that you'd naturally have why here because if when you defeat Colossus colossi you get a gradual bit of your stamina bar increased every time so we haven't sushi tonight y'all oh shit I didn't get it wait what you're not coming up again what's weird normally he only goes

almighty we had some laughs we had some tears we had some screaming saltiness but we have done it we have made it to the end begun thought [Music] nice we kind of broken Oh F's for malice big F's from harlots first try everybody oh man that was a lot more tedious than it should have been again it's also the lag of playing through OBS from the PlayStation to a capture card through OBS instead of just playing it directly so a lot of the times when you lift up the sword you're about to press squares it's a tiny bit of lag and then you're gonna hit it but the games already moved on since then but we get our final item from normal mode what we our item come here what you get is the last one map who flash arrows there is a flash arrow that arrow exploded though may be able to injure a colossus without aiming for the vitals yeah let's do this you've defeated all 16 class a normal tack mode you haven't locked the brown steed code for aggro I don't need no Brown steed I got my black stallion and that a stallion bud yeah I want to go out for fight one of the other colossi I want to go fight the second guy because I want to see how much damage we can do right now so we have this is exes own flash arrows yes I don't want whistling arrows on there crap I guess you can put them on to let you hear and increase the amount of damage increase the amount of damage they seem like the exact same thing I still don't know the difference let's let's try out some of these arrows leave the whistle ones that's what the whistle ones down what sound like [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh mommy I don't know if you can actually kill the Colossus with those ones like the Thunder poon and these ones do damage to the Colossus but I don't know if you're actually able to kill them I think you can get down to a certain point but eventually you have to stab them less duties let's see what these do not a whole lot whatever if I can just do this then straight away ah that didn't count ah boo I thought it would so this guy should be able to take more punishment then then the first one Oh God so while we do more damage now I don't think I'll be able to shrine shot this guy if I get one shot this guy then I am Opie I need to be nerfed next patch Jeff please well you got one hit oh my god [Music] I forgot that you and two glyphs so I can't technically one-shot you but that was one hit the

*High fives* Top of the morning to you laddies, my name is jacksepticeye, and welcome back to Subnausious so last time we didn't get a whole lot done I didn't have that much time to record an episode and Subnautica takes a very very long time to record usually they're like two hour episodes whittled down to like 40 or 50 minutes yesterday's was like Almost an hour, and then it was whittled down to like 16 minutes so apologies on that front, but the the beauty of daily subnautica uploads is that you don't have to wait Too long for the next one, so I'm taking pepper, and we're going back in here I want to see what happened to the sea Emperor anyway, but I need to get back to my other base And I need to go start getting like nickel and stuff, and I kind of want to bring Maria back I kind of want to take all my materials and head back anyway Because that base is pretty much useless to me now. I wish you could build these I wish I could build I wish I could build a warp gate of my own So that I could just bring it to my base Have one right next to my base and have one here. I mean I've studied enough of the aliens by now I should have the technology Is the sea emperor still gonna be here, or she gonna be dead oh? Oh no She's still moving a small bit Oh No She's hurting guys Hi oh She put up such a good fight She's been alive far longer than any of her other buddies have been You did a good job. You helped save a whole planet Rest easy my love. My love? Oh God, can I even get out of here with pepper? Oh god? I didn't think about that So I still don't have the damn Jump Jet upgrade. I had the stuff to make it ages ago, and then I goofed it all up There we go that was perfect Okay this might be tricky well yeah, I'll have enough oh look at her It's so sad She did a good thing though She helped her baby survive and she helped me. She's a hero. Okay. Wait for it wait for it wait for it. Can that reach? Ya Attagirl pepper Best Now this might be awkward. I'm stuck in everything No, no, we're not at full boost We need our boost Launch yourself. That's the shit right there, or did we make it we didn't fucking make it Why aren't you able to lift yourself why is nothing working? I'm just trapped in this fucking hell Okay, I need to grab the roof then Cuz you have a certain amount of momentum And then the jump Jets don't really work outside of the water as good as you would like them to Come on come on come on pepper I swear to fuck if we're stuck here If we're fucking stuck in here, I will flip a shit. What are you grabbing there for? God damn it Otherwise I'm gonna have to go the long way around again and get the whole ways of the island with pepper I'm not fucking doing that Hey get the angle get the angle get the angle motherfucker Yes baby That's how you do it. That's a good pepper right there. This is the pepper I built Thought you were some fake imposter pepper for a while, but no we're good And I know what you're thinking jack if that's pepper. Where is salt? Salt is all around us. It's the ocean oh oh Oh, wait no that wasn't a thing up there. I was gonna say we had an easier teleporter to come out through I didn't have to do that. I could have come out to teleporter at the top forgot about that right now this fucking This is going to make or break me this could be the end of your good pal Jack, okay Save it right there, so save it right there We had the sea dragon left I couldn't even find them again anyway. I lied I lied. I just heard him Where are they though oh the warpers won't affect me anymore. Oh that makes it so much easier. Oh, I like this now. This is gonna be good. This is gonna be a nice time Hey war-pees Yeah, you turn to look at me, and you're like is that is that a bad? But it's not no he's a bad. Oh fuck Oh, Durgan Oh big Durgin boy The fuck out of here Get a little bit of Monica in my life Sound like a, sound like a the fuck why the fuck? Go away I don't like you oh wait, where's my exit? Wait I think it was over here? Uh-oh it better be over here. I can't remember how I actually get out of this area. Oh look at that the max reach oh it's over here woohoo, thank god Ooh it's so scary I feel like they're louder and more aggressive in this version of the game What the fuck what the fuck that's unfair okay? Your head's through the ground. That's not nice! Oh, God do I need the Jump Jet upgrade to even get out of here? No, no no no no no no no grab grab grab fuck Well That's a shit on my salad right, I'm gonna get out and heal you Yeah, yeah, yeah, I still don't have the suit, okay. I don't have the blueprints for it. I can't build one. I want the heat-resistant suit, and I want the still suit? Still suit would actually be very very helpful this one- a being down here is not that bad. If you're just efficient about it There's a lot of things I can get in the game actually a lot of stuff that I can get that would probably make life a lot easier, but At the same time. I don't really need I still I still get on fine without them You know what I mean. Okay? Wait here for my boost to come back. So how are you? How's it going? My boost doesn't go up as fast if my feet aren't touching the ground. Oh, Maria I'm so close twelve hundred meters close, but I'm so close I'm almost as close to Maria as I am to everything else. I'm almost as close to Maria's as I am to my fucking Henry Jeez, okay, when we swing out? There you go there you go start to get that lift start to get that lift lift those butt cheeks lift and commence Nice right, what do I actually need for this? next piece of alle spaceship alle rocket Nickel aerogel and wiring kit aerogel and wiring kit easy peasy. No problem. Probably have a wiring kit somewhere. I just need some nickel. Are you nickel? Your silver eh you might be handy anyway. Wait do I have anything in my Do I have anything in my inventory? Nope I at least have enough room for this There y'go! Thatta boy me Let's get that silver yeah, get it get it pepper Okay, that's enough I'm done. I'm bored um I mean I'm not a doctor I have no patience Titanium titanium would be handy, but there's a titanium deposit near my actual thing right I am completely fucking lost right now. I know where my things are, but I need to find the actual exit out of this area. I need to get back to where the lava castle is And actually if I can find out where those dragons are I have a fair idea of where I'm going right now I am pissing in the wind Fucking Jesus that scared me Is that the lava castle? Sounds like it fucking would be Oh It's so much nicer that I don't have to worry about warpers anymore I have no idea which direction. I should go I'm just running around in the wild and I'm probably gonna die I think it's around the other side of all this I hear ya- why ya roaring so much you guys don't use echolocation like the Reapers do you? I mean you might when you enter this area the lava castle is on your right or your left Can't even speak simple shit anymore, it's only on your left So yeah, I think we're doing good. I want to scan this skeleton. I feel like I haven't been doing that enough Get away from me. Get away smelly stinky stinky smelly boy Seriously fuck off Okay, I just saw the dragon over there Uh where's my scanner Yes Jack take your- take your fucking time trying to get shit together Reaper Leviathan skeleton Reapers are ill-suited to high-temperature environments Suggesting this creature was forced down into the active lava zone by conditions outside its control Trace muscle tissue remains on the bones indicating the specimen died in recent months burns and other physical damage fuck off Wait now I don't know where I am uh oh I think it might actually be that way still Um burns and other physical damage to the skeleton structure like became pray for something bigger- oh God so the dragon Killed it like became prey for something bigger You know like it just became prey for something bigger like totally cool I just want to get out of here. There is a big fat dragon fuck off I hate this I hate this I thought the exit was out over there, maybe it is I'm so fucking turned around I've never come into these areas enough to figure out my way through it. Well at least not coming back through it I normally go the other way again Oh fuck me I'm in the wrong part of Scranton Fuck fuck fuck leave me alone. Just just okay. This is the way out This is the way out that dragons not where he's supposed to be that dragons a bitch dragons a fucking douche I mean the oceans bad enough being down here is just terrible enough as it is without having to deal with like prehistoric fire-breathing tail waggling tentacle loving big face fish fuckers You know? You feel me? You guys still in still you guys still instill a lot of fear in me Even though you're perfectly cool now there you go you guys are awesome They're one of my favorite creatures in the game as well just because they're not actual like full creatures what am I doing? The fact that they're kind of like biomechanical as well It's pretty cool. I like it a lot Also once I get out of this area and get back to Muria and everything I should never have to come this far down into this whole area ever again unless I need kyanite for something But that's why I'm grabbing a lot of it now even though I think I still have a lot of it back on my base So I don't know talking very fast cuz I'm very anxious down here. Uh- Oh Um I don't- I don't think I am where I think I am you-you're not supposed to be there This could 'tentially be very hazardous to my health And I just got insurance You know how hard it is to get insurance on a planet that you're not even supposed to be on With no other people on it. It's very difficult okay, but I tried my best and I finally got it, so I'm not gonna let any ghost boy Steal that from me Where am I? How do we get out of here back to safe haven? This shit is all- I got further away from you guys Biscuit tits Okay survive pepper pepper survive pepper survive, please I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I'm out Is this the f- No this is not the place. I was before I mean I'm out of lava, that's that's a plus But I think it was a case of like one step forward two steps back maybe Should've just gone the long way Long way would have been better. I would've got there faster. Are you you're not the thermal plant are you? It is Okay, I went all the way around that area That was fucking obnoxious, but okay That means I'm safe now that means I know my way back to Dorothy. Oh look who it is Look where I am you guys I'm back home There's my base. I'm going in the wrong direction. I would like to go forward, please where is she where she I could see her name, but I can't see her face I need to see her face, please. Maria? Oh Maria I missed you, it's been so long Oh that was an arduous journey.

I have everything a man could possibly need in life! It's fine gonna make me some aerogel. I picked up some nickel Did I pick up enough nickel? Uh- No, I need one more nickel, and I need a wiring kit Do I have any of that around here? Please say we have another nickel Mmm. That's, annoying okay, recharge all you bad boys Feel like you're all starved right now, Except you. You're kind of fine Um Dump all you back in. So I'll probably be taking Maria and everything back out of this area. Oh glorious! Glorious filtered water! I haven't been back in so long that you just had a stack of it waiting for me. Nice. Nice! Oh, and the food! The food is so good! Alright, I have probably had more nickel on Maria, right? I don't think I took everything out of her when I moved Uh, Nickle! Yes! And then all I need is a wiring kit. Do I just have a...? It would be great if I just have one of those laying around, right? If I just had a wiring kit? Anything at alls? Wiring kit? No I don't fucking have anything. That's a lot of copper and kyanite! Jeez ums See some of this shit now I don't need anymore. Like stalker teeth, uraninite Crystals. Uraninite crystals you use to make your nuclear reactor work, but I don't have any of that shit. Also, I'm very curious to see if Maria can go through a warp gate That'd be hilarious to find out What do I need to make a wiring kit? uhh Just two silver ore Why do I have a feeling that that was back on Maria! it's not in Maria. It's in pepper I-I got a bunch of silver with you, didn't I? I almost forgot that, and that would have been really fucking bad Wait would you have...? Wait you don't carry silver you carry gold Umm, wait you do carry silver! I'm dumb, never mind! I'm in the process of moving everything over Because I want to leave I wanna go home Is that son of a bitch on the front of my thing? I'll kill him. Um right, start dumping shit in then Hopefully I have enough room for everything I mean, shit like this can go Silicone rubber, maybe Lubricant can go 51 percent charge battery can go. I'm just going to dump that shit! Cause I don't need these, I can get these back where I am. It's the stuff that I can't get that I'm worried about Is that three silver right there, and I didn't know? Oh my god! I'm gonna go fucking crazy someday! Wait I need to dump some stuff. Wow! Look at that! I dumped so many! well base It's been fun. It's been absolutely real, but I have to leave now. I'm not even gonna deconstruct you or anything. I'm not gonna deconstruct any of these things I- What was even in you? I can't remember. What was in the thermal generators? Magnetite, aerogel, titanium. All stuff I can get. All stuff I can get at a later date Um, and I have plenty of all. I don't think... This is my fear. Because I don't know what the next part of the- I don't know what the next part of- "building the thing" is, of building the rocket is. So I'm afraid that I'm gonna leave and then it'll be like oh yeah, you needed this thing that's actually back down in there, and it's just for take me forever to come back Gold, I mean can't hurt to carry it, right? Thanks Maybe nickel if I need more nickel to be able to build more of the ship that might be a problem Because I can only get that down here it seems What are you so? I'm gonna try and just pick up what I can, you know? Silver, whatever I mean if I have to come back It's not the end of the world. I can g- I could even come back here with the seamoth and just swim down and try and get some stuff but... Other than that I just want to get back and start building again Open wide for Jack-Jack! There ya go! Everybody's in and ready to swim Would really like some ion Power Cells still but... Oh wait, maybe I have to stuff to actually do that now! I'm gonna build a fabricator in here Because I just removed the material to be able to do it so I might as well just put it back in ~What did I need for the ion Power Cell? What did I need-~ An ion cube! I don't have any of those with me, do I? Are you... serious? Everything is just out of reach Every time! Because I haven't organized shit! There's no ion cubes in any of this Because they're all back at the other place *chuckles* Just my luck. Right! We're ready to head back. I think but- what the...? Hey! What are you doing? There are no free rides on Maria, okay? God dammit! You're not part of the Instant Chill Pack! Get out of here! Get outta here ya damn freeloader! Go back to your mama! Tell her Jack sent ya Thanks, Maria Okay, 67% energy That should be enough. I think most of that was just getting Pepper back together Okay, okay. Be very, very gentle, gentle, very gentle Can we turn you here? Now *this* is gonna be a process! Trying to get out of this place. You saw how hard it was even get into the fucking place. We are in safe hands Because Maria you were with the number one cyclops pilot on this planet, okay Nobody else on this planet right now is able to drive you as good as I am and I'm taking that with me. I'm literally the sexiest man on this planet right now But do you know what that means Maria? You're the sexiest submarine That's good, right? Excuse me fellas, excuse me Coming through. Sorry, excuse me Comin' through. Thanks Appreciate you making the gap guys. I never scanned this I kept forgetting "Sea dragon skeleton. The semi intact skeletal structure of a Leviathan class predator." We know what they look like now! They breathe fire at me! "Head trauma. There is clear evidence of massacle-" massacle! "Massive physical trauma to the head. The damage is so severe it was likely the cause of death and must have occurred somewhere nearby Damage is consistent with a high-speed collision with a solid object." So I said before that inside the thermal base that was just over there to the left that the sea dragon literally just slammed its head into the side of the thing trying to get it eggs back "Something in the environment has helped to preserve these remains, but calcium decay suggests an approximate time of death 1,000 years ago. Bone growth suggests a creature was in the egg-laying stage of its life cycle." So normally, I'm not a fan of storytelling like that like you have to go around and read all the story But this this balances environmental storytelling with legible storytelling really really good. Like you go around you see these alien bases and you don't know what they are and you're trying to figure it all out, and then you find little clues here and there. That stuff I like. So you can basically take in as much of the story as you possibly want But you don't have to! You can just go about your business and do whatever the hell you want I would like to scan the giant skeleton, that's out here, but the ghost Reapers out there. Can I scan this one? All you ghost weeds. You pieces of shit that would just vanish on me for no reason! But I got you in the end. We healed this earth together Okay can't even scan it. That's, that's just fine. What are you? Are you titanium? Yeah ~I don't like the deep down sounds of the ocean pure~ I'm gonna make a Subnautica musical All right which way do we want to get out of here? Over to the right again I'd say Just take it nice and gentle. Don't even need to worry about a thing. We're calm guys! We're calm. We have our positive mental attitude, and we're part of the Instant Chill Pack So that means nothing's gonna get us down. We're just gonna get through this area nice and gently and calmly. It's the freaking out that the game wants you to do! The game wants you to be on edge and have a lot of tension and anxiety We're not feeling that today. We're feeling pretty damn good It's just a serene experience with Maria. I'd rather- I wouldn't want to be down here with anybody else Maria just you. I mean you have a Pepper inside you but... that's our child Hey easy does it, easy does it. Watch this, watch this. Pure. Clean. Precision. The surgeon of Cyclops maneuvering Jacksepticeye You know you guys really should have to pay for a master class like this Okay, well you just ran into me that one doesn't count Also, sorry! Come on guys! Big, big ship boy coming through! You should be able to see me! Maybe it's because I don't have my lights on. That's why. Ya see? You got to keep your lights on It's the same way if you're driving the car People can't see you then they're gonna crash into ya. Can I go up from here? I think I can I think I can, I think I can. We're not snagged in a rock behind us! That's just I have special techniques for Maria to help her go, uh... straight up I call it "Vertical Maneuvering". May seem like a simple, easy, obvious title for it but, uh Fuck you And we're out! Nice. It's time to head home boys... and girls Aww Sea Treaders. I'll miss you guys. You know what? We've made some friends along the way We made some bad bastard enemies, but we made a lot of friends It's my number one friends right there! Hey Reefies! And w-we started off a rocky relationship with the Warpers We weren't really on a first-name basis. We were kind of on an insult basis and terrifying scream runaway basis But they're near and dear to my heart now The Reapers can go die in a fire. That's all I care about with them. Ah Henry! It's good to see your little, tiny face again! Okay, we have arrived! Now I need to remember what I need for this Two aerogel, three nickel ore and a plasteel ingot. They're all downstairs somewhere Pretty sure. I don't know where buuut somewhere There's my plasteel ingot I need more nickel and my aerogel. Where did I put those it's all titanium? That's copper, kyanite. I actually named this one Aerogel and Nickel ore! Nickel-ore-deon huh? Yes! All the pieces. Now I get to make jet boosters dawg! That shit's gotta be tight! I'm excited for this one. Now the last time we just built a platform and the elevator. Now we are actually building the rocket! Like these pieces, are the actual rocket Construct, oh Jesus! Holy shit, you're a big boy! I'm gonna call you Ronny! All my other vehicles have had a name. We've had Pepper, Sally, Maria. Sub-Maria, Pepper Prawn and Seamoth Sally. You're gonna be Ronnie the Rocket! Wow! Okay, what do ! need next? Crystalline sulfur, ion power cells and kyanite. Okay. I got a lot of crystalline sulfur So that's good Woah Woah! Oh that's gonna be so badass! Geez men Okay, yeah, you should be in here now. Yeah, Neptune fuel reserve. So we have another piece then after that Plasteel ingot, a crystalline sulfur, kyanite, ion Power Cell, okay Little annoying, but we should be able to make it. I have three crystalline sulfurs, and I need four! How absolutely annoying is that God damn it! I had one in Pepper But I don't think it's still there, I think I emptied you out. I knew I should have picked up more of them! Especially since I couldn't get them anywhere else. I should have just stocked up on that shit when I was down there Which means I'm probably gonna have to go back Damn it all right let's do this mr. prawnsuit You're gonna go back at the deep down dark deep down But it's okay. We're veterans of it at this point. We don't care no more. Nothing scares us down there Okay, it still scares us, but I'm not afraid. Crystaline sulfur. There's some right outside the gate Would you look at that So I'm gonna go around and collect a few more Because it would be easy to just be like oh yeah, I got it That's all I need but what if the next part needs a - oh no I forgot about you I think we have all the parts for the next bit I Hope so, I think I just need to make a plasteel ingot and the we're good Come on come on come on yes Now I don't know what I need for the last part yet. I don't know what I need until it actually Until the next part gets real- oh that's so fucking cool, so I think there's one more bit after this this's the fuel reserve so you've power Fuel, and then we're going to have the cockpit up top. This is really freaking tall Oh my god that's large and in charge. I need to make the top part though Can you tell me what I need? That's so fucking awesome looking though There we go a cyclops shield generator Oh hey little buddies, why do we need a Cyclops shield generator? Plasteel ingot enameled glass. Oh, thank god three parts are easy. What do I need for a cyclops shield generator? Don't be like really awkward parts Cuz you know what this means as soon as we build that top part I think we can leave Unless I have to do stuff like fill it full of fuel fill it full of electronics or something Cyclops shield generator ingredients unknown What Oh don't do this to me I'm so close really wish I  had something faster. I really wish some stuff got a speed upgrade that wasn't determined by heat even though I think that this I think sally moves just as fast as the Cyclops does in full speed So there's a few wrecks back this way that I haven't checked I think there's one in the Sea Treader's path and I haven't checked the one that's down by the crab squids in the deep grand reef And it's gonna be a thing I'm too- I'm too lazy To like bring the Cyclops all the way over here again to go searching. It's just gonna Take me forever even though I know I'm gonna get here and then the sea- the base is gonna be way too deep down And it's gonna fuck me over anyway I Don't even have a laser cutter with me Haha, are you it please be it oh please by random chance just be it Cyclops decoy tube no I saw cyclops and got happy I have that Give me the good stuff, I want the good stuff. I also need to heal you because you're dying now So close so close yet so far whoa whoa Its a Sea Emperor whoa it's one of the babies growing up already Holy shit I didn't know that happened. It's underneath the- the floater oh fucking christ Okay I know you're not attacking me. That was just an accident, but oh my god. Oh that's so cool. They actually are in the game. They didn't disappear. They just grew up and moved moved out of the house I love that Because I was curious to know if there were going to be in any other parts of the game Oh Joyous day There still kind of scary though because they're so big Oh sea treaders path hi dude. How's it going? Where'd you come from need to find more wreaks. Well. I think I found the one that was over here Is this his little butt? I hear you wow look at that one You guys are so big I love the, the- that sound that they make you can really hear like they're hitting the ground with force You guys are cute Right so I need to find this base, that's down here somewhere And I honestly have no idea where it is I kind of just explore around until I find a hole and go down into that And then I can find it Now I'm all turned around cuz I followed the sea traders I'm close at least What what you're making it sound like you're right beside me that's scary Those are crabs squids. Is the base in this level, or is it down further? I never know Go away go away. I've heard that light scares you. I'm not sure about that. Yes. There's the base Cool You get all the way fucking down her now and it won't do anything. Oh shit Swim to surface. Oh god fuck off Jesus okay, okay, this is happening this is happening to you Hit him Excuse me oh That's fucking scary no man, Oh Framerate oh please please be swim charge fins These are all things I don't fucking need this is Bart and Marguerite this is where they said we should not have gone deeper This is the deeper that they went Please stop fighting and listen We're Sick. What? How? You've been coughing right feeling itchy blisters Yeah, the biometrics would have warned us if we were sick it's something new It's not in the database Come on, then what's it gonna do? Turn us inside out? Dissolve us into jelly? It's an alien bacteria It's everywhere every organism on this planet Its altering our genetic code How are the creatures surviving if they're infected? I don't know yet. Want me to cut some of them open for you find out what makes me tick? no Just tell me what you need son materials equipment just Can I have some quiet? I need some time to think I wonder what happened to the higher parts Here we go boy. Go away. Oh my god you're much bigger when I'm not in the seamoth Please please Cyclops shield generator, baby. Yes Oh that makes it all worth it so I'm glad I came down here now because I forgot to come back and now we're getting like better story elements I have had it with you risking our lives Oh stow it chief  the kid can't kill this disease without fish to study. I'm just bringing them home Bart tell her. Tell her I'm right. You're both wrong. Marguerite I can't find out how they resist the bacteria if you slaughter them all It ain't always they oblige  in coming in alive He means your being reckless father the outcomes no better if we hole up in here and don't go outside we have to find a middle way. There is no compromise Not while she's on my sea base your sea bass. I'm going outside Bart Torgal has disembarked the habitat Bart come in. Its dangerous Dammit boy I know you can hear me Chief chief get off the radio and put on your helmet. What? Brace Oh Shit So is that how they died then and how he survived he actually got out and went back to the To the island to do his thing and they died down there That that's the Degasi ship Th Degasi came before the aurora and got shot down and landed on this island as well. Uh planet not island And they were doing a bunch of shit that was other stuff we found in there the mountain that time There are little bases that were up there But only three of them survived Only one of me survived, but they went through some fucking hardships, man. Hey reef-ees Okay, I just have a small bit more farming to do And we might be just done with this We might be ready to get off this planet. We might be able to get to the end of this game Aw I'm excited, but I'm also really sad. Oh my god. Is that the last piece? No way Oh and a computer chip wait I picked up enameled glass where did it go? Had enameled glass in my inventory Oh this is regular glass, there's the enameled glass. Okay and a computer chip something something I built must have a computer chip in it that I could just take out yeah the modification station But I didn't build that again did I? no I didn't sorry I should have a computer chip in one of these then No No, you got to go down the line check them all no No The copper wire in there. Yes, I knew I fuckin had one is that it as those pieces We're about to build the last piece I don't know what happens after this I don't know I don't know if I need anything else Oh god my heart's beating There's no way I can just leave is there You're gonna tell me I need another piece aren't you Come on finish Neptune one rocket online yeah, baby Okay Ronnie the base color is going to be I have to match it. I have to match it my stripes they are going to have to be blue stripe two you are also getting the blue treatment And name, you're gonna stay as white oh Jeez dude oh lets turn off the hood. Oh look how pretty We did it, holy fuck Am I going home Oh What am I bringing with me if I am a whole bunch of shit Wow Legitimately my first time ever seeing any of this what are you auxiliary power unit? We've storage oh no way Communication systems are reactive. Oh you sound so pretty Pressurizing hydraulics Dude Dude Wait what is this? Life-support system time capsule primary computer is that all you Dude we're going home We're going home Primary computer systems active wait time capsule Wait I found a time capsule before Image oh, I don't have any images f11 to take screenshot ah I Oh I Could put stuff into it like about an entire sea glide in if I want So does that mean the time capsule I found was from somebody who built the rocket and left, and that was their time capsule oh? What would be useful to leave people some rubies some magnetite some gold crystalline sulfur Or just the sea glide I feel like you can build the sea glide pretty easily but these are like late-game items that I can give people I can give them a laser cutter and a habitat builder Or should I just give them all Useful gear yeah, let's do that give you the scanner And then I'll give you some stuff that you can use earlier on like two gold One gold and one thermal blade there you go, yeah I needed a name right title oh good Positive mental attitude I Hope you enjoy these items and Love this game as much as I do But now I must leave Take care of the planet for me Dude time capsule ready No way Rocket, not ready why? All systems are go for lift off We're doing it. I'm actually gonna leave ready to launch on your command captain Goodbye everyone Goodbye Maria bye Sally bye pepper bye Henry One Time capsule jettison we're doing it This is so awesome Portion approaching orbital debris, that's why we needed a the shield generator. Oh shit oh Fuck orbital debris field clear Performing gravity turn manouver Wow Confirm destination coordinates nearest interstellar phase gate Engaging ion boosters I don't know why I'm crying Oh, man Can't believe we did it What is a wave without the ocean a beginning without an end They are different, but they go together Now you go among the stars, and I fall among the sand We are different, but we go together That's so nice. I Can't believe I actually finished subnautica after all this time Holy fuck Did not expect to finish it in this episode. I don't know why My god I didn't think I'd even get emotional at the ending Jesus Wow I fucking love this game It was so good This game is amazing music is amazing Scott special tounge huh Oh production babies Production babies are when you have a baby during development oh It's me No way Oh, I didn't know that that's so nice Welcome home to altera Permission to land will be granted once you have settled your outstanding balance of one trillion credit. Oh Man dude! I'm so full of emotion right now. Oh My god what a fucking awesome game? I've been playing this game for like what three four years now It's such a huge part of the channel, I can't believe I actually got to the end of the story it was so good I Love this game so much When I first found this game it was like Brand-new in early access and I remember trying it out because some people recommended it to me And I thought hey that looks kinda cool. I've never seen an all underwater survival game And I got in and I immediately fell in love with like the technology in the game Where you had the fabricator laser cutting stuff and giving you the items that you wanted and all that kind of stuff And then just exploring around and seeing this like crashed ship in the distance cuz I'm a huge fan of scale From like the minut details and then stuff scales up and up and up And I saw this lay I was in this little escape pod, and I saw this giant ship at the distance It was like that's awesome and originally it didn't explode. It was already like that and Then they started adding new and more stuff to it just going around the ocean everything was terrifying And I didn't realize how scary it would be until I was actually playing it And you realize like you can't see the bottom and you go down you didn't know what was going on and Stalkers would get at you and it would kind of freak you out and then in my head I kept thinking man this place on my fear of like there's somebody finding a giant creature in the ocean someday We just can't get down that far And I was just exploring around I'd say the aurora after I finally Went over in that direction and then all of a sudden I saw this tail wisp away in the water I was like what and then the fucking Reaper grabbed me and shook the shit out of me and terrified me and What was that was it, holy fuck What is that thing oh jeez oh no Oh my fucking good What was that fucking thing Jesus Christ? But those are the moments that I immediately thought this game is gonna be something special Cuz it was like us. It was like a pseudo horror game You don't think it would be but just such a unique cool experience to have in a place in people's fears and Then some update started to come out were and like getting the seamoth and everything was all it's just super awesome being able to build your own like submarine and going around and that was the best and then They started adding all these updates. They had like their coffee Update or something coffee and lava or something like that and you were able to go down as the lavas zone They started figuring out geez there're secret Islands here that I didn't know about Good lord that's cool. It's not even that far. Why have I never seen this before oh? It's so awesome. Yay new stuff. Oh god. I'm a lot closer than I thought I was so what's underneath it. Oh That is creepy And then you get for this base where there was like a giant alien structure You didn't know what was going on and then a gun shot down the Sun beam that was coming down Breaking atmosphere in 5..4..3 What is that? No the RED spike. HOLY SHIT Fucking hell that was cool And you go deeper and deeper and just this story started to unravel and this lore started to happen and what was once just a really cool survival ocean game Turned out it to be something that had a really cool backer and a really cool Story to it as well And they they took so much care and craft into making it the people who made this game Are so unbelievably passionate about it and they put so much really hard work into it And not only are they some of the nicest devs that I've ever gotten a chance to talk to Or some of the most hard-working and dedicated devs, but they had a really clear vision And they let people in on the entire development cycle, so you could go to this thing. I think it was Trello They used this website where you could go, and you could follow development every single step of the way And it was show like logs from the developer saying oh this bug was in the game yet. This is fixed now I've added this this this and this and all the team that were on the game could go in and like check it and see If people were meeting their quotas and what they were supposed to be finishing, so they were incredibly transparent And they just they believed in what they were making and I'm so glad they got to turn it into a fully fledged game Cuz this would go down as one of my favorite games. I've ever played not only on the channel, but just in general Definitely on the channel this has been such a absolutly monumental part of the channel over the last few years And I'm so glad I started playing it. I'm so glad that I got a chance to even like Like be part of the game as well like the little septiceye actually being in the game to be part of something that you love so much as well I Think that's why the ending got to me Because like it's a fairly standard fair ending just leaving the planet and everything kinda what you'd expect but Just because the game means so much to me that it just made me all emotional Can't believe the story's over I'm not gonna stop subnautica here. I'm not ever I'm not gonna stop here and never play it again I am gonna continue playing it maybe not daily. I don't know Maybe I will just cuz I like it so much what I want to start like Going around and fighting the stuff that I didn't find and just exploring the game and dicking around with it a bit more Cuz this the start of the series bringing it back. I just wanted to get the story I wanted to get to the Parts I need I just hit all the marks that I needed to to get to the points. I needed to and We made some insanely fast progress going through this Because this takes quite a while to do this is what like 16 episodes of almost an hour each and This episode alone I've been recording for two hours right now, so it's a quite a hefty game If you get this you're in for an absolute treat cuz there's so much more stuff in this game If this full release series is the first one that you've watched of anything ethically with this game There is so much more to this game that I haven't explored there's so many different areas that you can go to and see I tried to hit as many of them as I could going through it now and See as many of the creatures and everything I think I pretty much saw them all But I tried to show you everything I tried to show you all the cool bits Thank You subnautica And thank you developers Not only have you made a really great game, but you were just so super nice to me all the time oh I don't know what else to say Because I've talked about like all the mechanics and the sound design and everything as I was going through the game So I don't think I need to like review those again But it's paced very well the final version of the game is paced very very well because you started figuring out things Incrementally and originally that was the case But because it was early access some stuff was just kinda like thrown in and there was no connective tissue But now when you're going from piece to piece you get a little bit of information like all the life pods have their own voice acting now and You get a little bitty piece of information like oh this other life pod is over here And then you get for that life pod, and you get some information that oh There's a base over here you get to the base and it tells you there's actually more over in this direction just to tell you outright, but you can't have to explore for yourself and Because you explore these regions because the game naturally flows that way you start seeing some of the really cool events And like the sea Emperor talking to you telepathically You get to actually you can't play this game without ever running into a reaper Or you can play without ever seeing like a ghost Leviathan or anything like that or seeing a warper which is cool They've placed things in very very good places, and it's just a it's all-around just a very well-designed game There is a lot of farming in the game But I feel like the world is so interesting and the technology in it and their vehicles and everything are just so cool That it's worth it a lot of games are you have to farm for supplies the world is just so boring and dead and lifeless and Going around the world as a chore going around this world Gives you anxiety, but it's a good kind of fear because you want to explore you want to see what the game has to offer Just outstanding Can I cannot sing this games praises enough, but I'm gonna stop here before I gush about it too much I think everyone knows how much I love the game now at this point But that does it for the story we reached the end thank you for being here and watching this series, and thank you for being here for all the subnautica episodes and Just supporting not only the channel, but the series in general The subnautica is the first daily uploads I've ever ever done on the channel. No other game has made me upload daily But this one was something special I really wanted to get all of it as soon as I could and I didn't want to stop playing it so I'm just really happy that I got to do that and I'm really glad people supported it as much as they did it's like one of the most It's it's some of the most enthusiasm I've seen on the channel in a very long time and that's so heartwarming it gives me so much energy to try my best with each episode so I Just love this so much more anyway. Thank you guys so much for watching this adventure if you liked it punch that like button in the face LIKE A BOSS!!!!!! and  high fives all around "high five noise" but thank you guys and I will see all you dudes...IN THE NEXT VIDEOOOO! What is life after subnautica I guess we find out 
*Wapoosh*Top of the morning to ya laddies, my name is Jacksepticeye, and welcome back to: *Funky dance music plays* Welcome back to Fortnight, the game that I am getting ever incrementally better at. I've played a few more rounds in my own spare time I've changed a bunch of settings around in the game. Now it doesn't look as pretty but it runs a small bit better I've changed my sensitivities, I've changed some of my key bindings. I'm ready! I actually got into some rounds and consistently got like four kills each round! For me, that's a lot! I didn't win, but, kills are kills. *narrating* 'And far, far away-' Screw all you guys falling down here! I'm heading to Tomato town. That's my favorite town in this whole game. I like Tomato town, I like the the motel.. Tilted Towers can go away Everyone there is so mean to me and kills me real quick, and I don't like that. I'm coming in here! I'm coming in here, and I'm coming in hot. Oh God. Oh, no! Did he get it going? Oh shit! Oh my god, what is wrong with me? What is wrong with me? I almost didn't even do that. But hey, what up sucker? Give me that goopy juicy jelly, baby Also, one of the things I changed in the game is the color blindness mode. Because I don't know if any of you know this about me, but I'm ever so slightly colorblind So, if you've ever watched me play a game, and I'm saying- "Oh, I should have picked up the green thing- or the red thing, or the pink thing" or something. It's usually like changes in shades and You're like "that wasn't that color." That's why. That's why I am the way I am So there's- there's your solution, there's your answer. So I changed the colorblind mode, so now stuff kind of pops off the screen a bit more at me Which I like! It makes it a lot easier to pay attention to what's going on. See that expert move? I learned fucking tactics Tactics man, tactics. I got this! Ooooh Big goopy goop! Get rid of you, for you, even though I don't really like the burst fires. I hear someone, someone's close! Come on out baby boy! How close, though, is the thing. I see a player! Uh, uh - Player 307? Um, good call outs. Good call outs. Thanks. Thanks, roger roger. Right there, right there. Hello dotted man I need to get a move on though! Shit's closing in on me That guy's too far- Ooh, hi! Hi! Are you fucking serious? Am I fucking serious? It didn't even really have anything, what was going on? I mean, uh - "Two kills! Two kills for Jack!" *mind-blowing trumpet skills* That's the, that's the trumpet of defeat. Mister dotted man, are you over here? Hahahahaaa!  I mean uh- * victorious trumpet sound effect over actual trumpet sound* Okay, yeah, I should probably pay attention, instead of dicking around like this. Ooh, someone lost that shield! Wait did you? Did you lose all the shield? Go away! I'm just gonna say it now: burst rifles - not too bad. Eagle eye view, eagle eye scout's view. Hello! Hello, I see you again! Oh, please, come on out, come on out boy Ah, let me kill you, let me kill you dead! You and your fucking barriers. I'm down here! Oooh! Daddy like *other special effect trumpet sound over real sound* That is the horn, the trumpet of defeat and it rings for you, friend! Um, okay, let me have this. Ooh, jump pad! I've never had a jump pad. Ooh, scar (?), yes! Okay. See? Four kills! Hahaha! Now I'm getting into the- nearly into the top ten, without actually just sucking dicks! You're still alive and I don't like that! That's fine, you can survive that one, for now. This is a bad idea, because I'm gonna fall and die, if someone shoots these from under me. I killed a guy like that once, it was awesome! Ohh, come on, stop moving! *metal gear solid exclamation mark sound* What the fuck? Dude! What are you doing in here? *trumpet sound effect* Okay, I don't have fucking time for that I have people over there that I need to be killing. I need to-  I need to be getting up higher. I need to- Ah, god. I'm all nervous! Oh, hello! Ooh, that was close! You smelled that, didn't ya? Stick your head out, stick your fucking head out. I need to get out of here Ooh sh- WHAT?! Oh, I'm so pissed! Oh, that was so embarrassing! Oh, can we get a- can we get a sad trumpet-? * the trumpet sound of failure *   I feel like that went okay! I actually got kills that time, and came fifth! The last time I came fifth I didn't do anything! So I'm proud of that one! Ooh, need to get that aim better though It's- the trump- the trumpet of victory Has still not sounded for thee. As soon as you can drop, get out of this fucking van. Get out of this hippy-- Oh you idiot. I didn't wanna do that! Shit! Did you have a similar idea? mister friend Okay Okay, I get it. I'm going over here, though I like this cuz I learned the map in this game a lot quicker than I did, uhh- Pubg, or games like that Okay Has he left his fortress of solitude yet? Is Superman coming down to play? Shit. I didn't get any materials for this did I? Ooh, I got a chugachug! Nice. Is your stuff being destroyed? I think that's my friend! That is my friend! What's going on buddy? What's going on? You want to get shot? Oh, he does Ohh! Oh your plan was to grenade me? Well I'm sorry, buddy, but * happy trumpet sound * That is the trumpet of defeat for you. I shouldn't really be acting this cocky, that was only the first kill and I almost died to it Fucking shields Hahahahahaa See I took it on board, I crouch now when I shoot. Oh wait. I mean uh-- * no edited trumpet sound effect this time, just jack trying to play it * Victory toot! - Oh, a boogie bomb! I've never actually picked up one of those. I want to make someone dance! Wow that's cool! That fog is awesome, I've never seen that before I like how dynamic this game is. Ooh, I should be taking the goop I'm just in the circle, all the time which makes me very uneasy I need to be careful. People will come from Tilted on that side. There's someone in here with me. Ooh.. Oooh Woaaah, woah woah woah! I see ya, I see ya Asshole! Woah, he just got killed! Oh, man! I'm so screwed if you have a shotgun. Oh, yeah! Oooh, mama! Oh, wait, wait, wait wait wait wait. * cow sound effect * I forgot to do the horn of, uh- defeat! So there you go That guy has a serious advantage over me. Really hope he's not like, on top of me right now I need a shotgun, and a good shotgun, not this piece of crap. Hello! Anybody? 'Aight, they're busy. They're shooting each other Time for me to make a break for it in his blind sight. Oh, that guy's coming towards him, though Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep fighting, keep fighting Get'im, get'im, get'im, get'im, get'im! Fuck!!

I still forget to put down cover. No matter who I'm fighting, no matter when it is no matter, what's going on, I always forget. I just start shooting and everything else goes out the window! I need to think! Alright, do we have any babies who have fallen- fallen out of their cribs? Any babies at all? I'm gonna start trying to pick off people who are coming in from that circle Hello! You are way far away though, there's no point shooting at you. I'm just gonna draw attention to myself Oh, and yo! Well, you guys are already fighting!

Good job, jacobmedsovs! * victory toot sound effect * You deserved a victory toot that time Okay, well that does it for this episode of Fortnight. Getting very slightly better. I actually- well I- the last episode I did I was getting like top five as well or top eight or at least top ten But a lot of that was hiding. This time, I'm actually able to fight back I'm able to actually bring the fight to them and I'm getting a bit more confident with the shotgun and everything so.. Ever so Slightly, but surely, I will get better But thank you guys so much for watching this episode, if you liked it, punch that like button in the face! Like a boss! And, high fives all round! * wapoosh, wapoosh * But thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes, in the next video! Maybe that's why they called it Fortnight! Because it takes you a fortnight to get good at it! 
So we'll give you a little glimpse of what we kind of show you... Hi, I'm Jonathan Eusebio. I'm the stunt coordinator one of the stunt coordinators on Black Panther And this is my assistant Matthew who's on the fight team with us and today we're going to kind of show Jack an abbreviated version of how we kind of break down fight sequences, and how we train the actors to do them, so Today like if Jack you just kind of step over here, so we might yeah, so I'm just gonna stay back a little bit But basically we'll kind of kind of like show you like the fight piece, and we'll teach you little pieces of it. Okay. So I say Matthew comes in, I'm here. All right? Okay, got it! All right? Let's do it! So we try to go through that but we'll make it simpler version of it, okay? How did you do that? This is all practice- how long have you guys been doing this? Oh gosh, like last page 18 years. It's so awesome. Yeah But well you'll do the flipping today all right, so what we're gonna Do today is well usually when you do a fight piece will base It around a kind of a single piece of a choreo or like a concept.Today we'll do basic off that wrist throw you saw me do to him last, right? So basically, we'll start with basic wrist lock Right? So we'll start here, right.
Right now I want you to do basic wrist lock where you're holding your two thumbs, the two thumbs in the back of his wrist. Okay. In real life application, I'm gonna do wrist lock and I'm almost like trying to break his wrist where I'm applying forward pressure, all right? Now The only way Matthew can alleviate this pressure. He gets to roll out of it. Yeah, you like so... Okay, so right now. I got teaches that kind of the real world application of it, (Yeah.) And then we do the and then we'll like kind of build around it. Okay. So, let's start with I just want you to feel this. To two thumbs in back of this, right? Yeah. and then just apply this pressure, so wherever I'm applying this pressure, my my toes gonna point. So we start what's called a "neutral position". Mm-hmm.
Feet-shoulder-width. and I'm just gonna kind of point my toes when I'm gonna throw him. So he's gonna twisting it as I'm doing it. Okay.
and he does the same.
So every movement I do, he does like an opposite complementary music movement. So, I go here Twist. So, right now.
I just want you to feel that pressure. Okay. (Okay?) I'm sorry if I hurt you. All right, so... Here, step, turn.
There you feel that?
Oh, yeah.Good, all right, so yeah. Yeah, so what happens is...There's a point where he doesn't it doesn't move anymore. The only way he can kind of alleviate that like where it doesn't move. He's gonna roll out it. Yeah.
So I want you to do it nice and slow. Just nice and slow, to the point where it feels like he can't hold on anymore, and he's just gonna roll out of it. Okay.
Right? So you just kind of feel him roll. So, here. Yep, and then nice and easy and then roll. There, you feel that?
Yeah. So that's when we get to others. So, do one more time. (Okay.) So, here. Alleviate and then go. Good, all right. See- see I kind of like- you're kind of overcoming like you- you He falls and you're off balance?
(Yeah.) Keep the same pressure that you do, right? Like, so your your your balance your head center. (Okay.)
and they just kind of follow him down. So you can go "whoop" and then let him go, right? Okay!
One more time. Good, alright. So, for movies what we want to do is... In real like real fighting, is kind of different from movie fighting. Real fighting and everything's nice and tight and compact. (Yeah.)
Movies got to make everything big, so the lines have to be bigger, the arcs have to be wider. So, in this case. That's kind of single direct attack like I'm going straight, so what I'm gonna do here is, I'm gonna make everything wider. So I'm gonna dis-approach it like you're the face of a clock, I do the two hands and I'm almost gonna go at five o'clock. Like this, right? Now all that does is it's gonna to let him know, I'm gonna throw him. So he knows what's coming. So, when I do this. I kind of said, give him a warning and then I'm gonna go all the way around like counterclockwise back to five o'clock or almost at this 12 o'clock. (Okay.) So, I'm gonna go around. Here,  right? (Yeah.) So, when you grab this wrist. I want you to go present it and you can go all the way around him and he's gonna go a little higher, because now he knows what's coming . So, he goes... (Jonathan flips Matthew over.) Jack: Woah. (Giggles) Alright? Alright, (Okay.) so Presenting tips- (How cool is that?)
Yeah, yup. Here we go, so five o'clock, and then go. That's it Good. Now, don't beat it like- Right now, you're going something like really slow. (Yeah.) It doesn't have to be fast. Just everything in constant motion, so he can just kind of go with it.So, present it to me and then go. Good.
Now, start using your body. Right now you're just kind of using your arms. So, you're kind of off balance.
Use this and then twist and I almost like, don't go to a knee, but kind of squat a little bit.You're doing a lunge, like this. Yes, try to go with him. So present it to me, five o'clock, twist and turn. That's it. One more time, and he's gonna go a little sooner.
Ready? Good. All right, one more time. Alright?
Jack: Do you get dizzy doing this? Matthew: No, I'm used to it. Good. All right, good. So, when you're doing this thing. Keep in mind like, if I choreo. It's like it's a dance, but it's a it's a language between the two people.
Yeah. That one, you're really close. Yeah, I mean. So, I want you to like get to a point where you feel comfortable like almost like you're on with the part. Like this, just in case you have to know what kind of factors are like what you can get hurt with, right? So, in this case if I'm doing this. What's coming out of if his legs (Jonathan hand gestures as Matthew's leg.) So, you want to make sure you had a pretty good distance. Where I know he's going, that's the plane he's traveling. So, if you're really close like this. It gets pretty dangerous. Yeah.
So I want you to now do it again, right? But I want you to maintain this, like I don't need to be too far but split the difference and we're how we hold like the distance you were before. 
Okay. Okay, so...
(So about here?) Yep, and then present it and then throw. Good. Now, it's better. See how much more balance you add. (Yeah.) Okay, so let's say. That's the beginning, alright?
Let you all are gonna begin. Let's say, that's the the middle, right? That's like the throw. (Yeah.)
We're gonna teach you what happens after he hits the ground, (Okay.) okay. So, do so once Matthew hits the ground, your hands are still connected, right? Basically what we're gonna do is. I'm gonna take a step with my right and then my left. I'm gonna pull him to a stomach Alright? (Okay.) I'm gonna sandwich my knees together, and on the same thing, I'm gonna apply for pressure without applying it. In real life, I'm making sure he can't move his arms. and I'm really pushing here, so he can feel that. So, you want to make it look like it's hurting him without applying any real pressure, alright? (Okay.)
So, if it does. He's gonna tap and you kind of know when to stop. (Okay.) But a lot of this stuff is like looking like you're playing pressure without applying pressure. Right? (Yeah.) Which is a skill you kind of learn. So, right now. I just want you clasp your knees together. You can kind of stop. (Okay *giggles*) So, while we go from Matthew's on the ground already. So, you have to keep throwing him. Start with the two thumbs on his back of his hand. So you've never changed positions. Take a step, take a step back and pull. (Okay.) How violent I want to make it is how hard I pull him. (Yeah.) Right? And then a lot of it is him acting. Alright? (Very good.) Yeah, so take a step with your right. Then left, yes, and pulling him up and then put your knees. That's it. That's good. Yes, so you don't want- you can feel it when it gets like it, doesn't move anymore. Yeah.
So, once you kind of feel it kind of firm, but like don't apply more pressures. See the look. It looks like it hurts. (Yeah.) In movies like hardly we know it hurts, but sometimes it's up to the guy selling it. (Yeah.) So he can scream all he wants even he had no pressure on it. Okay, so these like all realistic moves from martial arts. Yeah, it took a lot of-  a lot of the choreography. It should be based on something real, so you're- the application has to be something real and so that the body mechanics are real. Yeah,
You know I mean, right? (Kay.) So, That's why it's like, you can still beat. You still do moves solo dance, but you have to be based off something like a real world application. Yeah.
So, again. Let's go from the wrist lock, alright? So, we're slot.Right, five o'clock, throw, pull step, back step back. Yes, nice. Good. As- (We got you Mat, you're mine now.) Now, right. I am the superhero. Oh good.
Let's see how that kind of works. (Yeah.) Okay, so one more time. (Okay.) Here. Good, and pull. Nice. Good, alright. (Cool~.)
 All right, so yeah, you see how that works. Yeah. There's so much in it.
There's like a little intricacies stuff. (Yeah.) You know how complex I make it. It's like what I put in the beginning or what I put at the end, but we're working on that throw, okay? I'm gonna conceptualize around that throw, (Yeah.) it could be an abstract concept or it can be something physical like that. In this case, we're doing something physical. Which is basically the wrist lock, so I'm building around that so let's just say that's our ending. (Mm-hmm.) So now we'll work towards the beginning. Now don't worry about the flips and stuff, but let's do this. (Aww, I thought you were gonna teach me how to flip.) We'll do the behind the back thing,so we'll change a bit. So, he's gonna throw that straight cross like this, right? All I'm gonna do here is almost like I'm protecting myself like this, so let's see if there's a center here. He's going for my shoulder. I'm just gonna put this left hand up. Just like I'm protecting myself, almost I'm doing this okay? So I put this hand out, and I'm gonna scoop it and I grab his shoulder. Right? (Mmm.) Again, so I'm gonna... Scoop it, grab the shoulder and then almost like I'm gonna throw a knee. Like this, but I'm not gonna touch his body. Right now, I'm just gonna fake it and cheat one side of his body. So, he buckles down. Okay, then we're gonna do is called reverse wrist lock. Same thing put your hand here, and I'm gonna hold it up this way. (Okay.) Okay? All right, so... We're gonna combine it so. So, here you're gonna Go just left hand, yes.
And you're gonna scoop it in like a circle. That's it, then we're gonna knee right here.
Good as he goes into- That's it, and then here. Good. You're kind of parallel to the body. (Yeah.) Good. All right. (Cool.) All right, do one more.
(Flow so naturally.)
Yes. So, here. (I forgot.)
Just scoop in like a circle. Scoop in a circle grab with the "Yep." You grab with your hand. Then, knee. Now, that's it. Good. See how you're in reverse wrist lock. (Yeah.) Good, one more time. (Okay.) Alright. Go. Nice, good. There you go. Yes. (Knife!)
All right. Now, we just go forward in a little bit right. So, that's say that's our beginning. Yeah.
The beginning can be anything one. It's like if I did with Maddie again. Do the whole thing, just do the whole tough bro..
So, let's just see Maddie does his his uh his kick here. (Matthew's Badass Kick.) Might I might ride this one, bass is one, duck. But I scooped it, and I need... cement it to this. So, I can make their prefix as complex as I want. All up to him too - so right now I just want you to like, it's here. Just go from the scoop. So, right now I'm just gonna start from like a left hook. Have you box before or did any kind of so?
(Not at all.) Basically just go with what's simple bob and weave.
So, if he throws himself a left hook. I'm just gonna kind of duck it. So,  basically I'm gonna turn my right shoulder and I'm just gonna kind of skim it on I like the top of my head, so I'm just like Bob like your name says I bobbed underneath it, and I pop back up. Right? (Okay.) So, we go. One I come out of it, and then he punches. I scoop it just like you did, then knee. Wrist-lock. Okay? All right, it's a lot if you pick it up. So, I want you here. So, he's gonna throw a punch. So what happens here, we do counter movements. There we go, and then bob him with it. Good, and then scoop it. Neat. Reverse wrists. There we go.
Nice! Alright, that's your prefix. Right? (Yeah.) Now. We have to link it to that throw, right?
Okay, so add one more piece of the puzzle. So, I'm in a reverse wrist lock, so what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna face the Black Panther emblem here, so keep my right hand, right? I let go of my left, I turn, I pass it behind my back. (Okay.) And then I come back up look around, (Ohh, okay.)
And then I throw him. (Jonathan throws Matthew to the ground.)
Pull. Right?
Yeah. So I can make it as complex as I want it, right? The simple way is I just go right to that throw. But I'll give it a little pizzazz a little bit ,right? So, on this one. You did the reverse wrist like you have it you have at the beginning. You have the end, so let's get back to that throw. So I go reverse wrist lock. I'm gonna let go of this hand, my left. and I'm going to turn the face like the Black Panther poster here.Grab it behind my back, right? Yeah.
And then I'm gonna turn back. Two hands, five o'clock, throw. Okay? (Okay.)  Listen simple. Then, we're gonna try to put it all together.
(Okay?*Giggles*) Okay, so start reverse wrist lock. Right. You're gonna let go your left. Yep, turn and then grab it behind his head. Yes. Oh, so. See where it is? How is ended?
 When you grab it, grab it. So, your thumbs are in control of it. (Okay.) So from here, So when you turn back around, fingers up. (Okay.) (So, you were like...)Yes, so go back to your, go back to the beginning. (Oh.) Alright? Now, turn. That's it. Like this. Right, turn around. Yeah, (Oh.)
five o'clock, throw. Pull. See Right. But ye-, but maintain that position. So, the most important thing is you know that lock. (Yeah.) I can throw that lock from any position I want. (Okay.)
But right now, like maintain that lock. So walked out again, and it will go from beginning to end.
(You just want to do the wrist lock one again?)
Yes, do it. Just right here. The turning one.
So, turn. Pass it. That's it. Turn, throw. Good. See you're understanding a concept. Good. (Poor Matthew, begging.) Good, right? I hurt him good. Yeah, good. Good, good job. So, all right, so one more time just like that. Turn. That's it. And then go, good. Nice, pull.
There you go. So, the whole point of some stuff like this is like how fast it gets or how dynamic it is.
It's up to you. It's your interplay with your partner. (Yeah.) Right? So,right now. I'm just saying this is good. You got the motions, the motions are good, right? I turn like this. You almost as soon as you turn out of this, you almost want to get to the throw. (Okay.) As opposed, so now breaking it down. We go, okay two thumbs. I'm going five o'clock. (Yeah.) But right now, just to keep it safe. I want you to do that, but keep in mind like as you get more comfortable and your more reps you get. everything gets tighter, you get less time in between in anything. Right? Let's set up. Yeah.
Okay, so- (I get ya.) Yes, so let's walk that one, one more time and then let's walk through the whole thing. Okay. All right,other way.
Oh, yeah.
All right. (Thumbs up.) Behind the back, that's it. Yep, and go.
Pull. Nice. Yeah, alright.
Good, alright. So, now we're gonna go from the duck. For the knee, right? Scoop it, right? Now, the whole thing with these two is... Like fight choreo  with two is the reason why I do with the partner. So, you understand like distance, your distance and timing to each other. Yeah.
So, it's just like I said earlier. If you're too close, right? Or too far. It doesn't work. Yeah.
So, you talked to your partner, usually for something like this. I'm going like his hand stuff. I kind of wedge around my homes, so I know if I take a step forward, have a step. I'm gonna hit him. Yeah.
So, I know here. I can at least stick- extend my arm and same thing, to there's some kind of a safe distance Now depending on camera, I can make a hit depending it like that can be far away from him this far and still make it. Look like a hit on camera. (Yeah.) But stuff like this or it's tactile, it's still kind of a dance. So, once you kind of measure out your distance, you can go faster and faster. Yeah.
All right. So, let's just go very slow from the very beginning. Yeah, (Okay.) right so you're gonna... You're gonna go in front you're gonna duck, scooped, knee. Yeah, really slow. Yeah, and almost like wait for him.
So, when he turns. You turn. So, he turns, now duck. Good, now scoop it with your left. Knee past them, good. Wrist lock, good. Behind the back. Throw. Good job, pull. Wow, look at that. See. 
(I'm a superhero!) You go through the whole thing, right? Yeah, okay?
So,- (It's when you put it all together it all just flows naturally.) (It's almost like you designed it that .)
Yeah, well-
Well, yeah. But like it's a most choreography or and there's different ways to doing choreography. I could teach you moves, (Yeah.) and then you have to find out, like where the camera is, it has to flow for camera too.(That's true, yeah.) So, there's- there's a lot of factors that involved when you're doing this stuff, so it's sometimes. It's not just about fight moves. It's about like the flow of it the direction of the energy or direction of the or the choreography goes. So, sometimes I just play to wherever the camera is. So, now see now you're going like it flows our natural right? So, it's very intuitive like if you're taught right habits, you'll do the right habits. You already have bad habits the bad habits come out. Yeah.
Kind of interferes with the good habits, (Yeah.) right? So, why are we trying teaches you from scratch? You know where to put your feet. You know where to put your hands. So, that helps a lot right? So, let's walk it over again. All right, and then we'll have Maddie doing flips in front of it.
(Oh, God.) Right? Okay. Yeah, that's it.
Scoop, knee. Reverse wrist lock, turn. Yes, pull. Whaat?
Okay. He, ready now, right? But you think about it. That's all it is. If I build around it and you have a good dance partner like, if this is someone else. He knows he's done tons and tons of fight scenes. Yeah.
So, he knows how to adjust to you, so it kind of works in your favor here. You have a good partner, it's smooth. If you don't have a good partner, it's not smooth. That's true.
You have a, there's a language between you two there. You have to have kind of have. (Yeah.) And he's done it so many times. He knows how to adjust.
So, now. Let's add that, let's add his attack in here.
Right?
He does like it, so he's gonna do like he does a kick. So you almost, just want you to kind of step back. Right? You know it's coming.
Now, this one. Yeah, and then just gonna bob and weave. I want you to scoop it. Knee. Wrist-lock. Turning throw. Pull. Okay.
Right? So, I can add on and I could keep adding on to the end if I want.
So, the only thing we're adding now... He's just gonna- he's gonna kind of flip and kick at you. So, now he knows where the distance is. All I want you to do is you follow that foot and you just step back. It's like, reality. (Jonathan moves back.) Right?
And they know this is coming, duck. I scoop it. I kneed. Then, you already cut him in here. I can talk through the whole thing of that one.
(Jack giggling.) That's how comfortable I get, and if you want to end it. See, sometimes you just stomp it on the head. (Yeah.) All right, now. Just stay with this, okay? Good, right,?
(So-so much work, and it's all done in like 10 seconds.)
Yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot, but we've been doing a long time.
So, yeah it helps it like we kind of know how to break it down for you, but we can make you as complex as you want. Just depending what it is.
So how do you go about like? Choreographing that, like where does the idea come?
The idea always comes from the director. (Okay.) So we talked to Ryan, he tells us kind of what he wants. He already has a good idea what he wants, and then he kind of tells us in, he lets us play with it And we'll keep showing it to him, showing to him - he goes okay. That's it. That go that direction. Yeah.
So a lot of it, starts from our director (Okay.) and then me and Andy Gill the other stunt coordinator. We kind of take his ideas, we collaborate on it, and I take it to the team of guys. And we just keep... We keep playing with it, so it's always a game of collaboration with everybody. Do you do you keep this sort of movement consistent, then throughout the movie?
Yes. It depends on the style. So ,it depends on the person what style we're trying to make. So just depending on what the character- who the character is, what the character does, how he moves then we design. Whatever movement around them. Yeah, so now going back to it.
Okay. You're gonna go with. So, basically is the same thing. We go slow. I just want you to watch this kick and where it's coming from and you're gonna react to- I'm looking forward to see him kick me in half. Yes, all you have to do is step back.
Right?
So, yes. (Jack giggles.) All right, here he goes. Boom, good now. Duck, nice. See how close you are.
(Yeah.)
See you can already feel it, scoop, knee. Good, turn, behind the back. Go, pull. Woah... There you go. But you see what I'm saying like, we just find a middle. Yeah, that's a prefix and a suffix to it. Yeah.
Right?
You're making a sentence, right? So, same thing. So, now use- put some energy, now your game relax. You know what's gonna happen, right? You know the distance, go a little faster. But he's, you only go as fast as Matthew.
So, don't you just react to what Matthew's throwing to you, (Okay.) okay? Alright, let's do it again.
Ready and action. Duck, yep. That's it. It's alright, I see you now.
You can you feel it, like you're uncomfortable. But see, see your distance on that. Yeah, so you gotta adjust your distance now. What is the difference on that when you ducked?
You're like really close to him.
(Yeah.) So, when you duck sometimes it's a two that you can step back,
 (Yeah.) or Matthew when he throws his punch. He makes the distance away from you and usually in the case of it's a it's talent or a our actor/actresses. I make the adjustment and some man adjust to them, so you see your thing saying he's gonna swing overhead. He's gonna adjust the distance, so he's not so close.
Right? Yeah.
Okay? (Okay.) All right. (We'll get there.) Yup, you'll get there. But it's like it's good for you to see it. (Yeah.) Okay. Ready? and action. Take a step back, duck.
Good. That's it.
Scoop, knee, reverse, switch. That's all right. Pull,  ohhh. There you go-
(I hurt him too much.) but see you, like see how like, when you start going to the performance speed it, changes a lot. Right? Did good though. That's a lot. That's a lot to learn, alright.
(Couple more times.) Yeah. Couple more times, alright.
Ready and... action! So, it's like swayback, duck! Good.
Scoop it. Knee. Nice, good. Turn, throw, pull. Ohhhh. Look at that, good job. That's very nice Right?
(Man, that takes you out of breath really quick.) 
Yeah, it does.But when you start going fast, It just becomes like, that's the language of it, like now I just taught that to you in like 20 minutes. (Yeah.) Imagine if I had like a month or two once with you. How crazy it gets now. Now it just gets simple because you're doing a one-on-one. (Mm-m.) When you start fighting with two guys, three guys, four guys, it changes a lot. You don't know what direction to look at, Right? But it's just it's an easy thing because right now, the camera is just facing this direction. But the more you do kind of things like this, you have to be aware of certain things, like where the cameras placed. Like where you're acting beats are, there's a lot of stuff other variables involved. (Yeah.) So, the moves are one thing. But then the acting and where the camera placement is and playing the camera that's another thing.
(Yeah.) Right?Like, but, you learned that pretty fast. (Yeah.)
So, that's pretty good. That's like, that's pretty impressive. Right? So, let's see that one more time. You see if you remember the whole thing. (Giggles)
Damn, I thought I just had to do it once and I was good. Yeah, you did good.
Alright. Ready, set... Alright and action! (Matthew acting wincing.) Good job. See, right? See how winded you get?
(Yeah.) Good.
Let's see you one more time, get three in a row. Three row, that's number two.One more. 
(Get a hat-trick, so I can go home.)
Yeah, hat-trick.Good job, right? Okay. You ready and action! Go back, duck. Good, scoop it. That's it, knee. Good,twist. Good. Beautiful, good job. See?
All right, excellent.
(Nice dude. Awkward, okay.) See? All right, so...Was that- was that number two, or is that number three.
(That's three.) Huh, that's number three?
All right, Matthew needs to stop too, but see- but that's one saying like- that was pretty good.(Yeah,) (that was awesome.)
That's like basically, we built it around one throw. Right? And we built the the beginning and ending around it. So, I can make it as complex, or simple as I want. (Yeah.) You learned that pretty fast. That's it's really good.
(I had a good teacher.) Ah, haha. Who taught? It's Maddie.
Good teaching, here nobody. He-hey, everybody.
Very very good. Basically that's kind of a... That's kind of like the process we kind of do. Yeah, so is that an actual like part of the movie?
Uh, in the moo... in the movie? Yes, there's a... We do a casino scene and in a South Korea, right? So, all kind of a like a... denies character Lupita's character and Chadwicks character all fighting in there. So this is- this is more kind of the style that would... Lapita would be doing. (Yeah.) So, you see the elements of that wrist lock in that drag there. (Yeah.) Right? I just changed it for this purpose, like the beginning and ending of it. Yeah, so what you just did is what we we taught-
(The actors themselves actually.)
Oh, yes. We always train, you always try to train the actors do 95% of it, if not a hundred. The only like, the only thing is like they're just big crashes or whatever. Maybe the stunt double will do like taking the big bumps. But these guys can all do like, 98/ 99 percent of those fights themselves and they did.
You could see it in the movie, it really it's on their faces the whole time Yeah, heheh.Yeah.
That's awesome.
Good job, man. 
Thanks guys. I had super fun. Let's just stay here all day. QUEUE THE OUTRO! Now we learn how to kill a guy. 
Top of the morning to you, laddies. My name is jacksepticeye, and welcome back to the ittle-little, bitty, teeny-tiniest of Nightmares not those big ones that we've all heard so much about not big dreams not anything like that It's just little nightmares.

Why else wouldn't let me do that Did you do anything? What Don't know if that does anything but the eye is moving Wait is there anything through here?music slow around for a second, Oh broken doll Okay very weird So is this lady basically If it's anything clearly. It's a lot of stuff in this game is inspired by Ghibli like spirited away I said that when I played it first as well, so she just stealing people's souls or essence to keep herself young Put something in there hello? it me So I can move these things go a little bit faster there now You're not gonna move back. Are you because the fucking movement of the bolt all the books have eyes on them as well Where am I going? Huh, that's not gonna work Hey, I didn't die that makes a change doesn't it normally. I die all the time. Okay. I'm going back out to this leather I'm just exploring around cuz I want to figure out what to do And this is one of the bigger environments that I've actually ever been in--in the game Normally the environments are a lot smaller, but this one is fairly damn open this is getting louder oh oh, if I take you is that light -- is that thing gonna, okay, let's just test Yep Yep, oh Jesus the whole place is coming down Oh No Oh, No put it back put it back &gt;:^( Okay well remind me not to fuck with that room.

Okay that thing What there's lots of eyes in the walls Okay, we have to put a light somewhere These stupid things don't move though or maybe you have to hit the button each time Okay Okay, there's eyes on the roof And there's an eye down there, so I have to get it into one two three four different places Maybe So this moves different parts of it Whoo Okay, so you have to get it in three of them. I thought that one and the right was one of them as well This is it right I'm a clever boy that didn't do anything Oh, that's much handier. Hell yeah Alright the eyes are all turned off. I wonder if that did anything down here if there actually is more to that light puzzle I Have a feeling the same things gonna happen here again Yep, okay, okay, I'm sorry my bad The hell did this puzzle up here do maybe it's not maybe there is more to it wait if that can I Oh shining another light Oh God uh creepy Oh, No Are you a statue, are you real oh? This is the room of horrific atrocities All the things on the wall There's pictures like in center left and center right and stuff some of the creatures that are going around to chase me and then on the left was like a girl and The janitor dude is up in the top left There is one that just looks like it has a brain for a head Oh Some of these pictures are so creepy Can I show you a light in this door I know okay, what happens when I push these buttons My controllers vibrating, why are you doing that? Oh, god? This is so creepy that one's my least favorite oh? It's like a sequencer geez I'm gonna be here all day trying to figure this shit out Okay So it's one side versus the other side it seems if I push the ones on the left Maybe if I go opposite each other all the time Shiny happy faces Huh, so I can only put on four Do I have to guess which four there might be a hint somewhere Ok so wrinkly old, man younger dude, and then that guy is right there And the curly-haired one so maybe some of the people who are here are the ones that I'm supposed to turn on So you're not there Can I hit you again? You were there, and you were there and you were there oh You were there as well though shit, I think they were all there I'm a smartypants. Those are the ones whose pictures were up on the wall back there Are these ones that I recognized? Oh? It's very cold in here my breath is all showy oh This is gonna do a thing again, Oh God Easy anything imma stay right here Okay is there anything over on the right that I'm supposed to be getting oh, I need to go behind the statue you Don't fucking see me here There is no way my shadow us is showing was it Damn it Okay, let's peep out this room before I do that again then What are you is there anything over here worth getting ooh teeny tiny hole With a beat on underneath Getting is getting some of Daddy's juice Let me find Does anyone want to turn up Turn up for what I Think this is just secret hidden collectible area All right Need to time this better next time I need to get out over there Go go go go go go go go. Oh god. That's not a lot of time Ah You see me oh God I can't go The switch oh No did I need do I need to turn up ah fuck ah Fucking pointless trying to do it like this. I'm just gonna go get it oh No, I'm frozen petrified. I'm just gonna go get it bring it out and put it near the door. I guess This is agony man, just let me take the statue and go wait I can't actually use the turnip Really So do I have to use the statue At least you changed faster the same, oh mama Okay do I need that statue yes, oh? God I got caught in the fucking wall. That's the thing I hate about the controls in this game Pick it up. Oh fucking god Okay there we go I never want to enter that room again Something's making noise Oh, it's so unnerving You see that at the bottom right something ran no god. There's no babies here Okay No nope Dang it that was my bad shouldn't it falls off Okay you start me right here. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you Do you have a triangle slot in you and in the room down in the bottom, right I Think there's like a circle slot and another slot on the ground So mayhaps, you're a key to something, but I want to figure out how I get the one in the top left then If that is indeed a one that I need to get See there's a circle slot here and then there's a square slot, so This is the square one Okay, so I can't shine a light in its eyes Huh, it works Haha got him fooled them Nice one So don't know where the circle doll is though Lose the door back in that other room though on the left So I'm curious to see what that does and I'm also curious about that globe Don't trust it. Maybe something will happen, but there's a triangle one right there. Oh shit oh Oh Then how the hell do I get out of this room with this doll That's a predicament now that I'm just gonna say that that is a predicament See this room here how do I do that? Shit I thought I could pick it up and go faster, can I stand in the slot? No It's just gonna come down to crush me, okay, okay? Right so we're no further than we were That was all just a dream oh There's marks on the ground here Do you move You look like you should move Seizures like drag marks on the ground. Maybe you move from this side No Maybe the book is supposed to go back in Yeah, you know what maybe not oh My god I was about to turn around and go back does that actually work oh? I get it These books all have a place to go Do you go here, nope you go over here Okay, I'm assuming those click click click click is a good thing No you're not a book that goes in there Wow You need this special box are you a special book? You can't even see what's on you nope you're a supremely non special book Okay, these are all normal books though. Ah That's why I was able to go up there there's a book up there as well No one starts to make sense after a while, but when you entered the rooms it's like what what do I do I Also saw more of those like little run around II kids and I don't mean my little Ronnie Do is that my little mushroom heads those guys are cute? Okay, I am able to survive this right I Survived it but I walk off my ball once Okay, maybe now it works because that thing moves over there for sure Uh-huh, uh-huh listen here whoa another doll It looks like a square doll again are you oh? So you can put the square doll back into slot, and then I can get the triangle doll back Okay, I get it, but then I still need a circle doll Where does one find a circle doll quick check Amazon and eBay to search up circle doll and see what you get What does that mean Is she gonna come after me oh god my breath tired looking her own adult all day Oh Spooky scary sounds oh no, what ever will I do perhaps dude Please don't tell me I have to dodge this lady As it's been so long since I played the original little nightmares The non DLC parts that I can't really remain remember the sequence of events The de bell ring is she now gone because she's gone off chasing 600 oh god. Oh god. Oh god Those are the babies now are everywhere oh? And they laugh and giggle Wait I want to see is she gone Yep, she gone. Oh, there's one of them in her place What are you?

Oh Weird my first thing to nation is to come towards the screen like that Oh No, we've a fight on our hands here people It's like it's like playing Alan Wake again except. They don't get a sweet-ass revolver to blow their faces off Music clicking no faces Okay, maybe you have to keep moving Move move move move move Go Go Shit Keep your beepers beep oh I see it I see it no no backlight stranger danger Okay grab the switch, what are you doing ? Grab it! Are you fucking serious, I trapped myself in here and now the chair is moving on its own. Oh my god, so broken Why are these things allowed to happen to me I'm stuck again. I can't move Okay No you guys are the worst actually no the big lady is the worst Which I'm assuming I'm gonna have to fight her eventually this is how you beat her as well right I had to use the the mirror and the light and stuff back there My inclination is to try and kill you before you try and kill me I Don't care who shot first as long as it's me Okay, there's a light in here. That's good This way No don't fall off. Oh, that's where he was at the start I Was literally holding grip that entire time and I just fell I Guess I needed to get closer right depth perception. It's really hard in this game You don't know how close or far away. You are to everything No Maybe you're supposed to do that there we go What's in that Oh God What are you conjured up from What bowels of hell did you come out of? Okay here we go nice shiny happy people yes. Yes, yes. Yes, yes die die die die die Mother fuckers wasting my time I'm a very imp-important person in this game, okay The name's cool long hair boy remember it Okay salvation is through that door Oh God look how many of them there are oh god no don't jump at me What! When did my light turn off?! Did he fucking run out of batteries or something?: Never has that once happened and then all of a sudden it happens at the worst moment Okay now go now. Go let nothing stop yet Attaboy we'll play some sick Elton John music on that piano Okay, that's actually kind of cool There's the mall like that's the thing we're on Okay, there's obviously something important with that piano, but I don't know what it is. Oh? Circle doll Okay, I have you but I have no way out What what what do I do? Are you shitting me I Found that by accident I was ready to jump off and grab the handle at the sight of the thing to see if that were close again. I Know I know where I would have to go through this Something's different something's different her face looks brighter in that picture all of a sudden Oh Elton John save me Hold me close young tony danza Solid solid rock and performance Whoa boy So I'm assuming what this lady's face actually looks like is ugly as all hell no She is oh Yeah Gross Usually that's how it is so she's stealing their essence to keep herself young or keep herself alive Literally a Ghibli movie Oh No Uh-oh Cuz I had to be a reason why she was breaking all the mirrors just want to look at herself There's a Dorian Gray vibe Is it Dorian Gray that can't look at himself oh Oh, oh oh That's weird Excuse me lady not a fan of you EEEEWwwww She also looks like one of the sisters in Kubo check she looks like Kubo's mom I made that reference Oh Oh Oh Oh run little boy I'm just a tiny boy Why door? Oh No, oh fucking Jesus Oh, No Oh shit... Do something! What happened? I am a little runny dude Is that what they've been all this time? They've been other kids? No way Oh, that's the banquet hall down below that I ran past So that means six ate another child Do I have to do this again. Oh, you're so fucking gross Oh, but they're not trying to eat me this time because I'm not just a regular child, I'm a mushroom head Dude this is messed up I mean I'm cute Okay, I'm just going to fall in this hole No! I'm the one she ate?! I am aren't I That's messed up So the Kubo's mom goes around stealing their essence and Turning them into the little runny dude mushroom heads To keep her self young and beautiful, maybe that's usually how these Tropes go it's the same in the Eco the the queen Sucks the essence out of the princesses or the young ladies to try and keep herself young and keep herself alive and then again in Ghibli movies as well It's kind of like that too And then I went back and I'm Cuz that is what happened I remember six got really hungry, and then you went through the area you saw the sausage I was like ah eat the sausage nice You What Cuz I was like Oh eat the sausage good, I'm not gonna be hungry anymore, and she ate the little mushroom head guy so she ate the kid that I just was I Still don't know why the the Ugly queen lady, whatever Kubo's mom I don't know why she turns you into that though Why is that the thing you turn into when she sucks out your essence? Unless it's just that's just the way it is, but if there's like an actual reason Cuz again, it's been so long since I played the original little nightmares like chunk, and then the space between all the DLCs And I plays so many different games in between and everything without getting a refresher course That it's hard to remember if there's a reference to something here or there that I'm missing So if there was a reason for why I turn into that Please let me know in the comments, but I don't think there is a reason. I think it's just that's the way it is And then six ate the boy That's weird... oh I kind of like that though I kind of like that ending to it I Feel like the DLC, the DLC as a whole Didn't add that much to the game. I feel like it was kind of more of the same It wasn't until like there that you get a big sense of like oh That's what they are like you get some sort of answer to some things, but the other parts It was like oh you just got to see a different section of the mall basically And you didn't get a whole lot more information as to why things were they way they were like I think the whole DLC could have just been this episode this part I Don't think the other two really added a whole lot more to it Other than the fact that it's more little nightmares, and I like little nightmare so from a gameplay standpoint It's nice to just have more to play where from a story standpoint I don't think the DLC Beyond the last what ten minutes of this one actually Added a whole lot and it still had some of the frustrations of the main game like running into walls Where there were no walls and getting caught in little bits of the environment and everything But they still just need to tighten up a small bit, and it would be Gameplay wise it would be Really really damn good, but overall. I love this game it has such a cool atmosphere and such a cooler aesthetic, and I like the lore behind it and just as a cool vibe I feel very very nice I like that it has its own world and it's a world that you kind of want to get to know like I'd watch Like a movie about this one. I feel like I have watched movies about this again spirited Away is a lot like this if you want more Kind of story, that's like this go watch spirited away. It's a very very very good movie um But I I'd love to have like a comic of this unless there is a little nightmares comic most most lore and games and everything Kind of have comics these days even dark souls and stuff of comics about them Which is just really really good I like this game I'm glad it did well I'm glad people responded to it favorably, and I'm glad a lot of people had a lot of interest in it And I hope it's sold well cuz I'd like to see them go on and try something else Because they have a very good Sense of mood, and I think that they could create another really cool game like the guys from Play Dead when they made limbo and then they went off to make insight it went from like great game to Fantastic game at least to me I liked inside a lot more than I like limbo just that a general atmosphere and this game reminds me a lot of those So I would love to see them go from little nightmares to like the next big thing for them So I hope that they do well Anyway that does it for me. I'm gonna leave this here. I don't think they have any other DLCs planned I think this is it for now Maybe there would be more DLCs in the future I don't really know what else they could add But whatever I play whatever they have cooking up But for now, thank you guys so much for watching this series if you liked it PUNCH that like button in the face like a BOSS and High fives all around. But thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes....in the NEXT video! Wow that was not an outro at all was it oops

I basically just fucked my own guys. :( Oh maaan! :( MEDIC, HEAL! MEDICCCC! No, that's not fucking working AT ALL. Oh no. NO they destroyed my barrier! Okay, let's start again. Let's clear our units and lets just... Snipers! &gt;:D Snipers! Oh my god you may still have your dicks in your hands. Oh my god. The little legs go everywhere! That's horrifying!!!!!!!! :O Okay, let's just fucking do this... GO MEN! FIGHT! KILL THEM ALL! Aw that's not working very well now is it? :( Okay, this site is doing pretty well, but they have a lot of guys left over here COME ON! &gt;:( (hello from a random person doing captions) UM, do my guys have hands of asses or something, is that what's happening? They fucking suck. Let's put in three rocket men and see what happens. Well... Okay, let's let's maybe do that again? But have you suck a little less dick this time. There's a small bit less Here you go here you go, NICE. These are the good chunk of them, though! :D I'd say that's about 60% to 80% coverage I need to fucking figure out what I'm doing. This one's gonna work! I believe in this one this one has the potential for your lads! YOU HAVEN'T EVEN KILLED ANYONE YET! Whyyy is my accuracy absolute garbage when the blue teams is fucking amazing? &gt;:( I, I have no idea what's going on watch this my guys. Start shootin, My guys all shout at once, hit nothing! Wait wait, let let no let's just look at that again. Watch this! They literally hit NOTHING! Ye little red bastards! I'm gonna create a wall That's what I'm gonna do and watch this shit We're gonna have little like splices in the middle of where we can go Maybe that'll protect my guys, maybe that's what I'm doing wrong I want to put down like the rocket guys and see what happens I can put down three of them And then like one of these One of these, I just want to see what happens Let's see that in an instant replay, let's see where your Rockets actually go. OH NOWW they hit some guys! Wait Do you literally only have one rocket? Well you guys are fucking useless to me. This is disastrous for my for my reputation and my name. Okay, Ok here we go! Doesn't that look like a fucking squadron that wants to win. Why is there a big load of books back here? OHHHH you're playing toy soldiers, I get it! You're playing as like a child Man I would love if you guys could fucking HIT SOMETHING! Please please please for the love of fucking holy goalie! Yes, you're actually gonna win this one! Jesus Christ the first shots literally do nothing I don't hit anything with them. I'm still not hitting anything Praise the maker! Okay moving on. Oh no they have defenses. Wait I only have 200? Ohh but I have 4,800 of this Mmm Okay Okay, what if they just put a bunch of rocket men behind this, okay... But I can't afford a whole lot now can I? Just go, I just want to see what happens... OH wait I have to walk towards you guys! Okay, okay Those weren't a bunch of snipers that come in handy right cuz I'd be able to shoot you from further away than they'll be able to shoot me Or not What's the point of having snipers. Oh they have snipers, oh that makes sense, Ehe heh Okay, as long as my guys. Just stay here and keep shootin. Fellas no don't move up. No just pick them off one by one You don't even need to try that hard . It's literally just aim and pull the trigger This sniper over here though, I was worrying me he's gonna, he's gonna perk up eventually. He's gonna start nailing my dues boy I'm hoping that I can take out all of them, and then by the time it comes to him I just have all my guys. That's how it should work I'll see you back in 15 hours when this is done. I like how the medics are just kind of like looking around like what do we do? What do we do what can we do? I'll tell you what you can do lads nothing you can die in an honorable death if you want! I really, hope you guys focus your attention on that sniper Before it's too late like you keep shooting these guys. He's able to shoot you cuz sometimes that happens, and I fucking hate that There you go, man. There you go man destroy them, DESTROY THEM! *Evil voice* I got you in my sights. *Normal Jackaboy* I am surprised that this worked No, no, no, this is what I was afraid of Kill him and now focus your attention on that sniper! Oh, my guys are gonna die aren't they? Cuz he has a  fuckin block in front of him! NOOOOOO! SHOOT HIM! OH YOU GENITIAL WARTS! Oh both snipers are down and I still have cannons! Oh, Fuck yeah, my dude Okay, cannons now and the cannons cannons cannons. Can you fire? Yes, tell us to go to a whole load of them. I still love matchstick men coming up the back YAY, this might work this time! Cuz then the cannons took draw away from the sniper so my guys could take them out Then you guys are going. Oh Jesus mother of fuck! Ive, what what I'm hearing is more cannons, that's what that was always needed, but now we should work as the snipers are dead so okay? See you get no 15 hours, I guess One by one the soldiers fell one by one they fell to gun pity they didn't fall faster, though That would be nice huh Oh Chuck my fucking ears shoot dem damn shoot ah Shoooot, okay. Medic is down. That's good, MEDIC. We need a medic for the medic Well, you know you need a medic when you're dead okay, if you could destroy this it would make life a lot easier for you Keep those shots coming there you go now, it should be clean sailing Land each shot, okay, you missed cuz you suck go back to sniper training nice nice What's the music in the background *Jackaboy sings* Like fuck I was born at the start of playing this game. Oh, that's neat you can put sleepers up on top of the things ah clever Okay, I might do that. Can we just replicate what they did? Think can I copy your homework. It's like yeah, but just change it up a little What the fuck happened over here? and Is is there even a delete is there even a delete? like Probability oh I can just do this I guess Okay that works Are you actually physics based oh sweet Ponytails It's fine you fucking work with what garbage you're given, I guess uhm... Let's put some Sneapers (Snipers) in there I'm gonna put three in mine. Okay. Let's see how this plays out at least No walking. Why are you do the walk? Well might fucking Canon tried to hit the Titanic out in the Atlantic. Oh mother of God one cannon shot and we are deadzo! And another cannon shot and, oh we're still alive. Could you Oh for fuck's sake can we actually delete delete' cell unit OOH well that doesn't fucking work now because I okay at least now I know I can do it I had another cannon Don't know where it went, but I didn't get the coins for it so let's let's restart and wait restart and keep units I, I, I restart and kept units but they're gone! I LOVE THIS GAME! Alright. I have no idea if this is gonna work but we'll try it out anyway right is my cannon dead already. No. It's not okay. Go. Go. Go. Go good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yes Okay, they still have a lot of guys over there though. Ah where's my cannon shooting What are you doing are you guys literally just shooting the fucking wooden blocks? That's actually a thing that can happen is that you just shoot wooden blocks okay? Hopefully the fucking snipers can take out this douchebag Come on come on he's going to kill you he's going to kill you dead Shoot him Sham oh Why why did they attack the block I mean, it's a good movie, but why do you attack the blocks? The blocks are not combatants. Oh, don't tell you if you fall oh my fucking Jesus oh my god you really like you're rid of that get rid of that and get rid of that at least this way if you'd come off the Edge, you won't fucking die there. We go. Maybe this Lord who even knows at this point. Why guys attack blocks? They don't know shit is not working Okay, they still have big cannons the cannons are the problem hit the comments here the calyx I Will murder you He's just talking fuck honorable to the face to do anything about it oh I know you're shooting blocks oh You didn't even get killed by the can you got killed by the cannon block, and then to kill you Can you can you kill it kill it? Where it's a little too late for that now isn't it captain This motherfuckers gonna, you know let's just do this It's representing a bunch of riflemen to distract My hope is to kill all of these guys At least the cannons and these these four You need you need to be taken out the cannons. Don't you listen here captain. I'm getting very very angry oh Nice you hit the block and he killed him, okay, I need just one sniper alive if I stop shooting blocks were you gone What technical advantage unfair? Okay, can you can you can you can you deal? Can you deal deal or no deal fellas? Wait I think I'm for my flag Wait is that a thing you can do Um hello No. No. NO It's just a world of hurt right now, okay, I wonder if if stalling my guys will work actually If I just start laying blocks everywhere Maybe they'll actually just attack the block and not me, okay good :D Happy happy happy campers And then I have 900 back here for just for 800 DAMNNNN &gt;:( But a last sniper back here now go see what happens Hoping this distracts and Like okay snipers are all day. That's very very good Now if you can take out the cannons yes Take out that can take out that cannon don't take out my snipers I need them Come on my yes that is the shit oh, my fucking god they died Okay my snipers should just be able to take out the rest of it Okay, why did they die and you guys didn't make some fucking sense? See guys just keep attacking than the blocks that they put down there the biggest enemy You know when people are talking about World War 3 happening It's it's never about how many nukes someone has it's always about how many blocks they have Good job But I should win now because I have the upper hand and distance Ie love that the cannons hit the blocks and the blocks go flying and kill those guys That is sensational one more counter block. Okay fuck off then One more cannon one more cannon do it yeah? That my fellows is what smell it Throw that that's what victory smells like okay Right we leave this episode of wooden battles here before I pop a blood vessel in my head and just not want to continue anymore Kind of frustrating some of the mechanics of it a little all over the place and the way the way the AI is work It's not as good as taps But tabs was the original kind of game that inspires these types of things but oh Still a fun game to play when you actually figure out how stuff works And you get everything to flow nicely it does feel very Satisfying so I might come back and play more I might not I don't know you you guys let me know but for now THANK YOU GUYS so much for watching this video of it, if you LIKED IT, PUNCH THAT LIKE BUTTON IN THE FACE, LIKE A BOSSSSSS AND, high fives all around, *WAHPOOSH* *WAHPOOSH* THANK YOU GUYS AND I WILL SEE ALL YOU DUDES, IN THE NEXT VIDEOOOOOOO *Dancing Sam Outro* :D English subtitles done by Lol_Lakitu, and other random people *Jackaboy sings* 
Top of the mornin' to ya laddies my name is jacksepticeye and welcome back to Hello Neighbor! So I did the first ep - I did the the first level in the first episode And then I did a stream going over the second episode And that should be up at some point Somewhere so apologies for the quality of that the streams always end up looking worse than actual videos But I'm back doing a regular video for the third episode because I love messing everything up And why not so let's get in oh I thought it was gonna be all cool at the start. There we go that's what I wanted to happen When we left off last time I didn't even get to watch all of the cutscene that happened here Because hey my eggs are still knocked down oh These are the best eggs 'cause you can't get them off the frying pan GET OFF World's strongest eggs, but with me and my eggs we can accomplish anything Now we're all grown up we're not the boy anymore, we're not the boy that I used to know We're a grown-up man now, and we're gonna move into our house apparently still the same character, but let's listen to some music How about you take out the actual game music and put in this one when I click this Ah, What are we watching, "To be Dane the seed b-" what? Oh someone's at my door! Back I have eggs *HUP!* go eggs get them! Eggs, you're fucking useless GO EGGS Yay shit eggs you ain't gonna mount to nothin. What okay. I got me a letter. Don't freeze this time. I can't actually pick it up there we go for some reason it wasn't working I don't know what that says I don't speak Russian or whatever language that actually is. I didn't see if it was Russian - wasn't it Russian before? I'm sad which apple am I going to eat. I know I'll put my apples in this suitcase! I'll move away! I'll take my eggs and I'll go, I'll make eggs elsewhere! Future eggs. I'm also going to get into this fridge and take this apple. "THIS is the apple I'll definitely eat, not those other two apples" But just in case I'm gonna put them in my suitcase and bring my apples with me So story-wise, it seems like something happened to him when he was younger with the neighbor and now growing up Jesus leave the bird alone, I don't know what the, the letter said, and I don't know why he's moving back but he ends up going back to the same place when he's much older... and the neighbor's still gonna be there? I guess I don't know this is the cutscene that we used to see a bunch in the, the alpha betas. Ah, here we are home sweet Oh my god This is what I'm moving into??? A fucking cardboard box would be better! Jesus. Also the neighbor has no house right now I'll get you in a minute phone ringing. I have some business to attend to. You got mail? Ah, I was hoping I could get his subscription to Zoom Magazine Hello neighbor, maybe that's why it's called that. *deep noise* The demon's back! *intoxicated voice* Oh guys, I don't know I feel a little weeeiiird... Three there is too much... *chuckles* Okay, so we won't go into the, the house lined with LSD because it just makes us hallucinate all over the place And then we start seeing the freaky demons. That demon was in the original game, or the *pfft* "The original game" It was in the - the betas or the alphas at some point, and you could just see it very briefly All right, all right, I'm coming, I'm coming. I need a key, is the key in my car? I don't know, is the key in my ca-there's the key. Hello! Ah, dump sweet dump! It's nice to be home and contract a venereal disease So it's still just the same house that demon's still out there! That's not there Who's ringing my banana phone? There's only four buttons on it! *laughs* You're doing a lot of gasping. You might want to do some exhaling to balance it out. The demon's just still out there just - oh now he's gone. Curl up on the couch into a ball, that'll help ya. That usually makes ghosts go away. Who's that? Timmy, did you fall down the well again? Hey my house is fine now What're you doing? You having some trouble with your mail-order animatronic bride doll? I think so. Never buy off untrusted websites. What did I tell you about those weird Russian websites? They're untrustworthy. They seem fine now, but my house is fine. Am I actually just asleep - I swear to God if this game ends with "It was all a dream..." I'm gonna throw a child out a window. Ah, just like mama always said, when you move house bring your glue and your apple. Hey! Do you want DOUCHE BAGS do you want an apple? Here eat a fuckin apple! Okay, no need to run away. I was only joking it was just an apple. Am I still breaking into your house? Is that still a thing - wow, look at all the stars! Hi, hi, what? WHAT? I HAVEN'T EVEN DONE ANYTHING, I JUST SHOWED UP! I gave you an apple. Also, I don't know why all the... all the regular named products have Anagrams of their names like, "glue" is "Elgu". "Milk" was "Kilm", Like milk is not a copyrighted trademark or anything like that. You're not gonna get sued by saying the word milk. God those that 48-inch vertical leap is quite astounding here drink your glue Hi, it's me your long-lost twin brother son Okay, he doesn't want to talk he's not a very talkative, man.

I still have no idea where I'm going, or what I'm doing, or where the fucking end of this stage is! Yeah, I don't know. Please let me know what I did wrong, or what it did right, or where I need to go in the comments because I have no idea right now. I'm so at a loss. I trying to do that shopping game just got too tedious, so I gave up on that. I think I know how to do that I just need to take the time to do it I don't know how I go in and hit that button. There's still some stuff up on the roof that I need be able to do. Maybe I need to go to the very top and throw myself into the windmill and that's the end of the game. That'd be nice. But anyway! Thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face like high fives all around *woosh, woosh* thank you guys and I will see all of you dudes...in the next videooooo!!! Oh Gee 
Top of the mornin to you, laddies, my name is jacksepticeye and welcome back to more slave aspire this game is horribly addictive As soon as I finished recording the last episode I didn't even record for that long all of a sudden I was like an hour and a half later into the game. I was like oh god I'm being so Unproductive because of this it kind of gets its hooks in you it has enough mechanics in it to not be overly complicated But also it just makes you want to play more and more and more, and if you excuse me i'ma turn on a fan Right now cuz my legs are on fire in this room, so I have I had this guy, but I unlocked a new one umm This went in the silent so what I was trying out this character It was pretty fun cuz this guy the ironclad is able to heal at the end of each Combat phase which is good you get six health back This guy at the start of each combat draw two additional cards and when I was playing as him I'm gonna try him out now just for the sake of variety what I was trying them out they They find look cool. As well. They were able to Have like a lot more turns if you know what I mean But I wait, then I trade this person out in the last episode. I can't remember ah anyway Greetings She was a card enemies in the next three combats have one HP. Oh-- Obtained a curse choose a rare care to obtain this one might be fun I Could get a really good card But I could also just do this and power my way through the next three fights Which would make it very very easy to get certain ways alright, which direction are we going? We have to get the despite we have to get to the top of World one I do two have different names. I don't know which is the easiest route This one up here is not that bad If you go up here on the right-hand side here because these are the big guys, but up this way you don't fight big guys And then what 1/2 and if that's a bar guy 3 1 2 3 Yeah, I'm gonna go that way imma fight these motherfuckers they were saw dude I can just go dead Okay Powering through here we go Pick a card. What do we want deal 8 damage? Next turn gate. Yeah, these were these ones. I really like that's what makes it really fun There's two of them It's nerds can't read. It's thirsty a really fun when you're able to Get more energy and that's what I liked about this character when I play does it See these kinds of things Block and damage is good though especially if you can get both because that you start off with through earth is it for energy at the start of each fight a Strange blue humanoid heel. I don't need to heal remove a current from your deck and Originally I thought with the hill where they want to remove a card from my deck, but people are mentioning to me that You kind of want to have less cards because that means you get really good cards, and you can cycle through them more So the more like strike Karin's you have the regular attacks. I'm not gonna do anything right now. I don't think I really needed The more regular attack cards you have the more convoluted. It kinds it becomes the more diluted your deck kinda becomes Alright gain for block to Dexter, dee I don't know what dexterity does yet? Can't buy any of them why deal seven damage apply one week That's not that bad actually choose an exhaust of the three cards in your hand no Do you tend damage to all enemy and gain to energy that's what I am about to do, I'm gonna do that one Wait so how much energy do I actually start running three? So with this character I was getting into like eight energy in some rounds, and it was awesome. I loved it Okay, you guys are still Pitiful that's good now. That's gonna wear out Today deal 5 damage gain 4 block next turn gain 4 block. Oh hell yeah Beef myself up right we're doing well cuz I haven't had to heal yet, so I'm gonna Smith some cards I'm upgrade you So now I guess 13 and 13 Very very good card. It's gonna. Help me out a lot when I get up to the spire The guys are so cute, okay for fuck that's a lot of dams you guys are getting ready to do Shit I can't even block it all three damage, or just do six I Would do six I'm one of you now, you're half dead oh This is gonna hurt a lot. Oh shit No wait, I don't have a block one. I thought I did God Almighty stop Wow Fuck me That's what I get and again Okay, here we go gained 13 block and deal 9 damage You're fucking dead screw you gain 4 block and next turn game. Ah shit I Ran out of energy on that it's ok I have enough to block this at least I Like this. I like the mechanics in this game a lot Because you don't accrue block originally I was like oh he's so much nicer if we could just keep my block and keep stacking it But it's cool that each turn is completely different So you're discarding all your currency you have to make you have to maximize the cards that you're using Okay, I can't kill any of you, so I'm just gonna just gonna negate the damage So you're constantly trained it like each Each fight you go into each round of battles that you go into is completely different each and every time do your worst? now Okay, don't do your worst. That sucks. Okay? This round is not going so well I have gotten to the spire and I have beaten it already Just playing it myself Shit But I thought that before and I didn't use it what a dull ass Damn it But I have I have gotten past world one before and actually each time I was doing it again I've been passing it so this is not a Good show for me little gremlin dudes weakening me all the time Cuz we can you do 25% less damage and I'm three times weakened I don't know if it's stacks actually give you four and deal for y I Coud your for damage to all enemies twice which is a deal eight damage to all enemies We're gonna rest now oh It's just a rule Don't be a fake yes you Gain energy on the first turn of each combat. Oh, we are doing nicely I Hate these shitheads I don't have enough to block all this But I can do this and get more energy next turn thank God I had four now this time instead of three ow We do have enough to block it all sweet Shit heads wound me Steel 13 damage and get 13 block very nice Stack that up now. I'm blocked completely so as you can see the thing I wasn't getting when I played the game the first time until like the second round through is that you can see what they're about to do So you send me attacks he's gonna do ten damage And you know he's gonna do an attack next and they're gonna do an attack next His enemy intends to inflict a negative effect on you and tack for eight damage So they wound you and then a wounded card can't be played? Taystee so as long as it's like a game of chess really kind of in a way Who I can gain to energy and see this is the thing right now if I gain the to energy? It's not super helpful because I can't kill him on this turn anyway and gaining eight more block isn't gonna do anything Because I negate this anyway and gaining more block would be pointless because it's just going to go away in the next turn anyway Because the carrots all just disappear So it's a cool game. I like it a lot okay none of you are about to attack Which is good so I can do this He's gonna lick me you stop it What does looking to gain 25 percent less block from your carrots from one turn okay? That makes sense, okay? You're about to start doing damage to me So I need to do this and choose a care to discard the wounded one please cuz it does nothing for me Do your worst? Haha, you're worse sucked hey And dead Dead is dead And there ain't no more who a fire potion Deal 20 damage heal 3 HP at the start gain 2 energy ok. I'm gonna get rid of this and I'm getting a fire potion more damage Please deal 12 damage whenever you play a card this turn targeted enemy loses 3 HP deal three damage 5 times So deal 12 See the Fucking math I need a calculator to play this game deal 12 damage so outright you deal 12 damage Whenever you play a card this turn targeted enemy loses 3 HP So I can do 12 damage, and then whatever energy I have left over The targeted enemy will lose 3 more HP for each card But you cost to you also cost to but you do 3 damage 5 times. You're guaranteed 15 And I gotta go with that one, I like guaranteed damage rather than all the other ones guaranteed 12 Actually, it's almost guaranteed 15 as well Right what are we doing? I have a lot of cards so You're about to do 11 Which I can't block or can I guess I can't Can't use this now though shit. That's the new carry got you for damage to it ok 8 damage to everybody That's a good card and now they're all forced to go into that which is annoying, but it's good to get it out of the way I Say like I know what I'm doing Is I still don't really know what I'm doing? Every time I make a play I'm just logic in my way through it to be like I'm basically thinking out loud and be like yes. This is what I'm doing because this yes Ok kill anyone with this Whoa, haha That's a lot of block where did we get so many I got 13 and 5, I thought I'll take it man Boom and boom we eat, so I'm saving these for the boss Energy potion again at the start of your turn out of shift your hand this one. I like deal 8 damage twice glass knives knives Damage is lowered by 2 this combat Ok gain 4 block next turn game for 1 so I have this one. I'm not gonna get a second one This is one. I like because You played this For one and then the next turn you get just a free attack every single time, which I like. I like this carrot I'll skip the potion so we have enemy's bonfire enemies bonfire, so I'm hoping I can get two I Want to get to a bonfire and upgrade some cards and then I also want to heal at another one right before I guess at the end I Can't remember what you do on death play is vulnerable to you for 2 turns Okay, you're gonna do 6 Always pay that character the cost 0 and this oh That's nice damage, I think there was a better play there that I didn't take What are you doing strength need to kill you first then Wait why am I getting I'm getting more protection from my thing than I should be Gain five block, but when I played it, I got nine I Don't know why I must have something something's going on that I'm not aware of but I'm very very happy about it. Okay. You're dead Yeah, oh Shit I forgot the strength so you're actually doing more damage no crap I could have blocked that Deal nine damage draw one card discard one card gain ten block deal 10 damage. I like that okay Now do I wanna I'm gonna Smith at this one and then maximize next time, so where is that card? three damage five times deal for damage five times Okay, we get an extra fight. That's good Imma go with that it was either that or the one. I just got that I can't remember already ah good Feel like they shouldn't get to steal it if you're blocking you you know Good now. We just look the bonfire, and then we have the boss I Can do this deal 5 damage apply 3 poison whoo? all enemies lose 6 strength for one turn deal 7 damage by one we can i'ma get this one all right what you got I Fought you before this guy's splits in half So he's about to do nine So I want to I want to do this for sometime in straightaway. Okay what I'm gonna. Do is just throw these Cuz what's good about this guy as well is that if I get him down to half health? He'll cancel out his attack. I think and just split in half I'ma save this one cuz he's going to split in half, and then I can do more damage I can do this. I'll take I'll take the for damage What did you do draw one mascara for two turns off fucker Okay, now. We just know what he's gonna. Do I would just block up just in case. I don't trust him What are you doing always preparing? Oh, I've more rather they keep my thing. I don't know what's going on, but I really like it oh My god to do 35 damage Okay, just do this Yeah now he's interrupted. Okay, good now. He should split in half. I'm not letting him do 35 damage to me That's a lot of fucking damage You're about to do 16. That's okay. I'm blocked now, and I'll weaken you Yeah Is there drinking this I stop licking me shit. I hate that it scared used to be so good. I'll take the hit I'll heal back half of that my next turn anyway. Oh come on I Blocked less I do less damage now. He's fucking sock King you're not doing any damage this turn oh And you get smaller again Stupid lick or I wonder can I interrupt that? Shit No he's about to do a big old swing of fuckin 16 damage now you guys are licking as well. Oh Christ Aha that's a big hit fuck you he's interrupted he's about to split in half To kill you This is not going well, I should be able to get to the end of it But it's hurting all right you Are dead get out of here? I hate you Kings every block and do seven damage. That's that's good enough for me Now poison one of you shitheads And all you guys are gonna do is lick me so bring down my armor again, but it's okay cuz you're about to die I'm about to kill you You're damn it. I can't play this card says the person with like a a goats Skull on them and a knife in their clothes like I can't believe my cards guys It's okay one's dead Tuesday we did it We defeated the top of the mountain Whenever you play a skill deal three damage to a random enemy Flick the whole round Do 13 damage to all enemies hell yeah, and it only costs one energy to use What do we get what do we get obtain three curses and three relics? I don't want that Obtain one potion gain 30 gold raise your max HP buy five obtained one carrot upgrade one random card Grating carrots can make them more powerful card story. Oh hell yeah tiny house Hell yeah tiny house oh And I got a good one to upgrade what do you do game one artifact I? Get more carrots do the six damage for each attack played this turn oh? This one's good, I like that sick So we did it we got past world one Now we move on to act to the city This games fun man right which direction are we gonna go? So you don't afraid the big dudes This way it kind of goes up you can't I can dodge the big dudes out here and out here I usually die in act two like I can never seem to get oh Fucking hate these guys They do so much block Negates 3d buffs block is not removed at the start of turn this enemy intends to block on its turn So it's just consistently blocking so technically as 60 health Whittle them down oh Yeah, I can't poison him because he D buffs They get 2d buffs okay deal 11 damage and next turn gain energy Okay, it's all attrition. Oh shit. He's about to attack. Oh crap. I didn't see that Holy crap that was awesome And now I can attack your life points directly yeah That was so cool I was about to take a lick in that time cane fight block draw two cards play for poison By two week gain twelve block. Yes. I like the blocks Mike wants to give me lots of block. I have too many cards now though Or was it you I hated It was you I hated because you gained 14 block at the end of each turn you have played zero attacks, so it actually Scales with it Does enemy intends to use a buff and attack for 10 damage, okay, so I'm gonna drink this what artifact it again It gets one debuff Let's start of your turn draw one shift. Oh Yeah, because that's my other thing Okay, I mean use this cuz I get four block Nick oh, that was the thing I was getting four block from that every turn then I get it, so if he tries to debuff me with whatever he's using I Guess not These enemies are tough This is good and then That's very good. I love that attack so then when you break his shield. I think he goes down one Gained 13 block yeah, so now he can only get 13 blocks so it's constantly whittling him down and down and down Okay can't block everything, but I can't block some things and the more I attack him in his state like this Doesn't get to block as much anymore now. He's down to 12 Hahahahahaha, that's one of my favorite card sees. That's awesome And full block for me Look who's about to lose more health. It's you Look who took no damage It's me I also have two thumbs, and I'm awesome Nice big smackeroos big big one So you can't hurt me and I get four more at the next turn such a fun game The constant like preparing Then working out what you have to do next I love that this is house of horrors the horror shop barbershop quartet Little house horse little house in the Prairie. What are you about to do tens to a powerful negative effect on you, okay? Do that That's a straight damage Den deal six damage More And then you're just gonna negate that Whatever I need to get a merchant man, I have so much money Yes There he goes down. He didn't even get a chance to block on easing again this turn your next skill is played twice By for poison cost one less energy for each card discarded this turn Deal six damage three times. Whoa this costs all my moves, though Costs one less energy for each card discarded this turn Not fully sure what that means in my head that means that each Tower that I've discarded it When they go back into my deck that cost one less next time that might be useful card that I can use whenever somebody is Okay, I should go as a merchant whatever somebody's about to not attack me. I can use up all my energy to do that at X random colorless cards into your hand whoa my two vulnerable If I'd okay these ones I know whenever you are attacked deal three damage to the attacker. That's a good card I can get both of these I kind of want that just cuz it's cool for a 3-carat due to energy you play six poison one pickup upgrade to random skills Forget it. Why not I probably gonna die soon. Anyway. Oh fuck I Don't have their golden idol in front of you sits in order to have forgotten God atop the altar sits an ornate female statue with Arms outstretched she calls to you demanding sacrifice gain five max HP So I got to ad total but lose 19 or become cursed unplayable at the end of your turn take two damage. Oh, no oh Christ I mean, I'm about to rest now anyway, but oh no God I almost killed him in one turn from 50 down to 12 Damn, I got some beefy cards that first round. Oh yes. Yes yes I'ma take some big beatin here oh God If he was allowed to do that twice I'd be dead now boom and boom 1 oh wait you should die to poison though, right yes 16 health left that is bad scourge your hand then draw that many cards Truckers eg-6 and that might be good it cost zero as well put him in a situation where I have very very bad cards LamaNugget113 is amamzing i love yu jack!! Like somebody's about to do a hundred damage a night. Oh god. These guys are very strong Confusion when you draw a carrot randomize discuss oh yeah this can go really well or really badly Because some of your blocks can end up costing like five They never cost five they've got three or four or something like that or you're really good cards Can cost zero So all that damage for zero cost As well as this my god, I did a lot of damage, but you're about to leave me with one hell That's bad you will do eight damage Me shit all costs weird things now I Know can I not kill you? Fuck Draw three cards exhaust, ooh Yes my saviors and this cost zero I think I'm barb black oh that was perfect I've won health man. Oh, that's so bad kill him kill Him kill then kill then I don't ever want to see him again. Get him out of my face Can we just have a health card? The ironclad guy gets a lot of health care is gambling shipping start of combat scared any number of cars then draw that money That's something I just get to do Okay, I brought you race. I'm not going down without a fight This guy's hard enough on his own This is not going well. Okay. I can kill you and then negate your attack I Guess but I am feeling this is where we die Considering f3 health of no way of upgrading anything There we go there's some stuff and my turn I guess Fight if you want to take me you're gonna have to really work for it oh fuck Well I'm dead Take me You may take my physical body, but you'll never take my stamina and will of being I'm gonna need a new map. I'm gonna need a new nap Yeah, new unlock what did I get? Whoa Herod's unlocked enemy loses all poisoned deal damage equal to twice the amount lost to all enemies Jesus double enemies potion exhaust poison exhaust Dublin enemies poison exhaust, I can't read dealer seven damage if the enemy has poison deal seven damage again Wow So you get them if you go through the game, they're like cards that are now in the map I could never get to the second one I Need more practice All right, why do I need this right here such a fun game. I know it's not for everybody I know it's not everyone's cup of tea and some people find these types of games kind of slow and boring Normally, I kind of do too But there's something about this one that when you get into it like you start figuring out the mechanics and then stuff flows really nicely and you start getting into a rhythm of things and when you blast past the first world it's just super fun this and Was it darkest dungeons I got that recently for my switch that I've been playing and they're just so addictive So just like constant like go over again type of games like over and over and over to try and see how far you can get ah So much fun. Anyway. Thank you guys so much watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face like a boss and highroad But thank you guys, I will see all you dudes... HIGH VOICE.

That's- Oooh is This one yes, that I have to go to that actually as well the cave system But I don't even know if I can get into that because it's It's so far down. I might actually rupture something by trying to go down there Sealed door break into that's sealed door. Hopefully these things actually work properly now Cuz before when we were trying to break into stuff sometimes break it would break through the door and then the door would still be there and yet to break through it like three or four times before it would get through I I mean i'm pretty sure it's fixed There you go, I like, this is an animation actually going around the whole door Oh that sound is cool sounds of this game are all cool.

Found it and ooh I found a bunch of bad babies Don't like that just give me two copper. That's titianium I don't need that. I don't--not only do I not need it I don't like it go away. Go away. Go away. Go away go away ooowwwww (you) hurt my face-- COPPER BABY titanium no way did I pick that up? COPPER BABY--oh oh a lot of them a lot of the boom babies SUCK A DICK I can't put it in here? WHAAT-- do I actually have to make a base module I guess we're making the base okay, new message, who's it from Cindy. I don't like her signal coordinates corrupted approximate transmission origin recorded to databank Okay, I've already been there life pod six was that one that was down near the radiation area that I asked wait I've been here before right Turns out I had been so You know that's cool--right habitat builder I don't know about making a base, but at least then I can keep my lockers in there I guess--I'm just gonna build like a very basic thing down here Just so I actually have an area That I can store more stuff in and I can build my shit You know...well like and at least give me a good area for it I'm building a base. I'm not building a shack at least want it to look good Can i put  it in here? Put it in here and keep it secret keep it safe No?-- oh yeah, they got rid of that for the final build of the game originally when you were allowed-- when you were putting down Areas of like foundation or whatever you were able to put it-- Can I move you or anything Jesus You were able to put it in Like something like that and then it would auto adjust the land around you Just put it here. Whatever it would auto adjust to land around you to figure out And it would remove bits of the land to try and figure out where it was supposed to go-- That's cool But because that started breaking the game. They had to get rid of that which I am all in favor for because That's what that was one of the reasons that the game started to run like garbage was-- oh okay Was that trying to build something and have it  remove pieces of land messed with the way the game Sorted out files and different things. Oh  just need quartz. I don't even need the glass What The hatch is glass on it. Normally you had to make the glass and Then that was how you made the hatch. No you just need the quartz and one quartz at that that's really nice I like this a lot-- OOHH BOOMIE BABY ANOTHER BOOMIE BABY   AWWW my boomie baby boomie ass That hurt O SHIT 9 oxygen! oh Fuck fuck fuck fuck no no DON'T YOU DARE BLACK OUT (character in game coughs and splutters) Yeah, I'd be coughing up last week's dinner as well if I were you sorry. I didn't know I thought you were fine. I thought you're a big boy. I guess the boomers took a lot outta ya All right put a hatch on it, put a donk on it. yay! forgot about that yeah i can build my Sam and now at least I can just put this on the fucking wall So I'm putting this stuff here for now I don't actually have any batteries for it Later on I'm going to dismantle all of this and bring it somewhere else with me So this is just here so I can put down a battery charger But I do need to put like a solar panel on you or something two quartz and a copper ore lads that shit is far attainable I like where your head's at I like where this is going. I like this game Making me feel good in my head likkkee, bizatee bango? Are you gonna work there. Are you actually getting sunlight? Where you are? That's good sounds Goody- goody-goody water prove lockers not empty can not pickup And now you come with me if you want to live you're going in here Wait can I even do that indoors Nope oh crap Okay, well I can at least just put you here At least now I know where you are. I know where you are where you were before anyway. You know what I mean Okay titanium, I'm gonna use a lot more and the quartz So I get rid of the lithium because I'm not gonna use that a lot Table coral I had for a thing and then didn't even need it so Get out of here. I don't know what you're all thinking Jack can you please get to the good stuff Jack? Can you finish the game Jack? Can you show us all the really cool shit? We'll get there my babies don't you worry Jack's not gonna Just leave you like that. We are definitely gonna get to all that stuff Eventually, but right now we got to build up our resources before we can actually do anything and right now I'm a battery making machine. Okay. That's what I do it's what I'm built for I have a battery charger batteries are what I make, I'm gonna sell batteries To the black market of this game, and then that's what's gonna get us off the island None of this like building rocket ships and building blah blah blah no, I'm going to build us a System and economy also to figure out what else I can make. 'can make a flash light, but I don't want to pathfinder tool why do i need creepvine samples for that? that's weird Propulsion cannon, a wiring kit. I don't have silver ore left I think I do, but I don't think I have enough of it. oh bother I need to put batteries in this thing anyway Hello battery charger -boom-  actually no. I don't need to put them in there. They're all full Place you Replace you And replace you Nice and boom-boom-boom are we to say well oh? We're on to it, we're doing it, and I'm gonna put a little Sam. Can I, can I rotate you? I can! Wait which way are you facing I don't know Sam HIHIHIHI HI SAM!! It's so cute. I love him! Wait can I put you somewhere else I like that you get all your materials back I like games that do that some games is like well You built it now. You can't get rid of it Kind of thing but I like games that just let you build and take apart and build and take apart And I like I said- aw wanted to put you inside Henry Can I put you on top of Sally? can I put you on top of this? No WHAT? oh my god, okay, that was the sea Emperor She talks to you at the start of the game?! what the fuck?! that was scary you could see her eyes and the tentacles and everything I had never heard her voice before or did i I cant Remember now we heard her voice Ooh, that was scary that was was scary scary mojo business Was fucking cool though, I like that a lot, okay, I'll put it in a little desk And Sammy boy is gonna sit on top of it Oh look at you. You're so cute Sam *MWAH*. Love you buddy! Sally let's go on an adventure well we've already been on several but-- hey reefies We're gonna go over here and see what damage we can do is this area. We're gonna put our mark on it and just Walk up, flap our fists on the table and be like hey. What's up? Any pieces that I can scavenge is that forklift? Oh, sorry? go away you shitheads I don't care. You guys are like bad bullies Just running up like yeah, eyy what's up? What's up? You wanna go? Like no, leave me alone Hey reefie You're my favorites. I love those guys mainly cuz they don't try ta kill me. They sound cool They look cool, and they don't try kill me an absolute rarity in subnautica Yeah, Jesus these guys are far away I must say performance going through these areas is impeccable It used to be so much worse Even loading into the areas there's a small hitch but, Everything's everything's popping in nicely. Nothing's really being slowed down I love it not only is this place absolutely cool looking This place looks Fucking awesome. Well. There are so many electrical shitheads floating around down here Ohhhh, so many oh, I don't like them Okay, I'm right above it. Can I actually get to it? If I just dive Are we in a radiation zone, yeah fuck Damn it Take out my rebreather because my oxygen is gonna evaporate once I start going down here Okay I'm going I'm going Don't tell me what I can't do Suzy Okay, whats that? repulsion canon, I have that. ---yeah yeah yea Whoa! Jesus Christ fucking thermal vent (voiceover in game) new blueprint aquired. Whoa that scared shit out of me Okay,I'm coming back. I think I got everything (voiceover in game) intergrating new PDA data AHHHHHH!!! this area sucks! Okay, bye, oh, man Right what's that new PDA data, I got Well it's annoying when I don't see this Oh Is it this?  no that's what she just said Wait isn't there a lifepod section Cyclops seamoth, where do we get the things? Aurora survivors lifepod 12, okay "(man in recording) Im... not really a doctor. I know thats what my ID says, but I never have been, I cheated the medical exams what does a doctor these days need to know about manually resetting bones? when was the last time a top surgeon actually cut someone open?! that's what the robots are for! doctors these days read diagnosis off of computer readouts for that, I'm perfectly qualified but what good is it when I'm not connected to the main network? I'm bleeding. I've got glowing green pustules growing on my hands, I run a self-scan and it tells me I've got 'skin irritation'. the only thing I studied in medical school was how to lie convincingly what the hell do I know about how to treat an alien disease?! I think I'm actually going to die down here." and die the man did I mean that is true in the future how much will humans actually have to do How much will you actually have to be trained, I actually read an article about that recently, about how-- Oh it's another vent Okay, I'll get back t'that in a second, but these vents are really cool. I like these kind of littered about the place Because it hints that there's more going on They've done a really good job with that Especially with the sea Emperor talking to you it's kind of like You you you start getting a feel for a bigger picture so to speak and but yeah, the article I read talked about how Because robots are able to do so much of the the work that doctors are supposed to have to do that doctors are being acceled-- Accelerated through their training Because they don't have to do some of the tasks that the computers have to do and the robots have to do but because of that they're not getting the knowledge they need to be able to do the things that they should be doing I I found that really interesting Don't know if there is anything else in there that I can get I'm actually just pick up my my beacon and go *creature makes a threatening sound* Lads again, I hear you. Oh, there's a spooky. Yeah, you guys terrifying I Will leave okay? Flash the lights and blind ya What is this message playing for me? Dudes no! 39 minutes and they're gonna show up at the oh there it is sunbeam landing site dudes That's bad I- I'm not cured. I don't have a solution also. I'm building an aquarium That's just what I've decided to do. That's how I handle my anguish ah Man you can't fit in here oh Man you can't fit in here Okay, Sam you're gonna have to come out for a sec. sorry. i love you Want to see if that aquarium fits I'm very keen on this aquarium She's not gonna fit lads what a suck uhmm maybe if we, turn it, angle it here? No, I need a multi-purpose room for it, but I can't build one of those. I don't have the ingredients Boo! I wanted to build an aquarium because it looks cool And I could probably put fish into it and then have kind of a little bit of a farm uhm Okay, I wonder if it will work on a just a bigger Section If I have a section kind of dedicated to it. I don't think it will but if I just have enough length Or is it the height that's messing me up. Did I just run out of materials for it? no Okay, okay, it's the height that's messing me up Shit. gonna head back to this cave system. I know oh god. I'm gonna hit him I know I probably can't go into it I Can get close to it. I do have my rebreather though, so if the seamoth can get close to it Then I can just at least hop out and go down But I want to kind of go over and scan for wrecks over in this direction. There are some over here Just past this area creepvine forest I just can't remenber where it is? It's pretty big one close by here Because this is where the lifepod was yeah, we can go a bit down into it we can go a good bit down into it. Oh it always creeps me out. Oh Jesus. Oh, this is where the snakes are the snakes of the two teeth on the front oh The jelly shroom forest! nyahhhnyahnyahnyah I came down here at one point Ohhh, is this place full of good, so that's why I came down there was another base down here that I got some materials out of No no go away shit oh shit, I'm 43 damage Sally is  gonna explode if I'm not careful Okay, okay, okay, okay? I'm gonna change to my rebreather no radiation down here Do  I see another base area over there. I don't know I'm going down here. These snakes freak me out, man They're so creepy-- Oh hey my first chest Guess my second chest I already have one on my body Wasn't there some sort of information or some sort of Material or something that I needed out of this area. I I remember finding it Cuz in the the playthrough I had I was looking for something and then this was the area I had to come to you to get it and then I found it and it freaked me out And I was all scared and I'm still scared to the fucking snakes aw they're so gross shit shit shit Sally I'm have to go on my own for a sec Over in this direction do whatever the hell this is over here some more materials Yeah, cuz I didn't come down through here before I came down in a completely different section Come on man you got nothing for me That's so cool I need a prawn suit, that's what I need oh god *ominous creature sounds* oh God that's two creatures mixed with each other sounds scary Could I just like make a bolt over here I Know I know I know, but I'm gonna come out of it in a second.

Okay, okay little by little That's that's the the rule of subnautica little by little is anything else over here look around, make sure we're okay I'm really fucking tempting fate here, aren't I there's another base over there I think this is the one I got too isn't there a way out yeah, there's like a hole over there i remember--I think this is where I came in The very first time I came here Okay, what surprises you have For senoir jack-o Oh oh oh don't hit those they hurt Are you thing? I can scan what a filtration machine? Yes, and then we can actually make our own water Was that where came in for before I don't need a  fucking swivel cherish I need the PDA Bart's log okay, I'm going to get to that after this (voiceover in game) inputting new PDA data Don't hit me don't hit me don't hit don't hit me don't hit me I'm a nice boy What did you give me something I already had really you gonna do that to me at this state of the game? yeah yeah spotlight.

I don't care about the cosmetics All they care about is the stuff that actually helps me Anything up in here observatory Okay, you were gonna have to scan a lot faster because I don't have a lot of oxygen left And I need to get the fuck out of here very quickly Come on (voiceover in game) new blue print aquired Okay, okay, okay, don't panic panicking is how--I'm stuck (voiceover in game) integrating new PDA data Panicking is how you end up dying You're way further away than I thought you were!

2017. What a weird year, what a completely all over the place mixed bag of a year! A year that felt like it went on forever. For me personally not the best year. I'm just gonna go out and say it It's probably the worst year I've had on YouTube since I've started making videos, and I'm not saying that to exaggerate I'm not saying that to over blow it or anything like that it has been Such an emotional roller coaster of a year for me personally. If you had a great year, I am more than happy for you I'm so glad that you had a good year, and I hope 2018 is an even better year for you But me personally I can't end this year without shaking some really weird feelings without shaking some really weird mentalities and demons that are stuck inside my head, so they just kind of need to get out there and Leave them in 2017 and move on into 2018, but let's let's go back through the year and let's go over some of the good things that happened the first big thing that really happened this year for me was that I Moved I'm in a completely brand new place. I'm in my own house. I was able to move across Across the water, it wasn't that far But I still managed to move my entire life from one country to another country And that is so huge for me the only other person in my life personally and closely who had ever done that Previously it was my brother my oldest brother Malcolm. Who I love dearly and who was giving me so much great advice over this past year And it's just since I started YouTube he's been so encouraging But he was the only other person I knew who kind of did that and who I knew on a personal level who did that and It seemed like the scariest thing ever to do, but I finally did it myself this year! I I always wanted to move I wanted to go to a different place. I did- I didn't feel like I was gonna stay in Ireland forever and moving was a really big deal for me. So that's that's such a huge positive part of my life in this year another really great Fantastic thing that happened to me this year was that I was asked to co-host the d23. Disney thing that was going on, convention? Exhibition? They did a gaming site of stuff that they they do every year But this year was a pretty big one because we got to show off the new spider-man game We got to show off the new Star Wars Battlefront game We all know how that went afterwards But and then we also got to show off Kingdom Hearts 3 which was a really big deal! and it was something that I was so excited to do and so excited to challenge myself with because I've done some hosting gigs here and There but this is a really big one and there was a lot of pressure involved But it was such a nice challenge to be able to get my teeth into and just sit there until 2:00 a.m. In the morning talking to these people back and forth and how we could craft the show into a cool thing and Just giving in my own thoughts and receiving their feedback and everything it was a really cool experience And I'm really grateful that I got to do it and I really want to do more stuff like that going forward And the fact that we got to like Kingdom Hearts 3 was by far the biggest thing going on me personally Spider-man was the biggest thing I love Kingdom Hearts as well, but a new spider-man game made by insomniac is a really big deal So getting to do that was a really cool experience. It was really good practice. It was really good knowledge I'm just I'm so grateful for that opportunity. I also got to go on tour twice I got to go on my own personal tour for like three shows just to test out and see how it's going and going into 2018 we're gonna rock that baby hard and we're gonna really go full force at that and tour it around all over the place so Keep an eye out for that But getting to do that was a really cool experience because I again I was so outside my comfort zone I had never done anything that I had like written material for that We've worked on and had a structure to and a theme to and all these different types of things There's a lot of pressure to just get up on stage on my own and carry a whole show for an hour and a half and it was obviously a lot easier to do because all of you guys were there some of you guys were there and Just knowing that you guys were out in the audience and you were there to see the jacksepticeye show really eased my nerves But I was still very scared to do it, and I'm so glad that I did and I it's again It's another challenge that I overcame this year And I'm very glad I did and I it was such good practice because also right after that I got to go on the ready player three tour with the game grumps all around Europe and very rarely do you ever get to tour Europe in general just as a facet of life but here I was doing it because I played video games in my bedroom one time and it ballooned into this huge thing that I'm here now talking to this gigantic community of people and It just blew my mind. I think it was when we got to Norway. I was kind of just walking around the fort and We visited a fort by the way I Was just walking around I turned to the people I was like isn't it weird that we all just loved video games And we started making videos on them and all of a sudden now We're touring europe and we're here in Norway like I never thought I'd ever got to go to a place like Norway ever and It was just such a surreal experience, and I'm so thankful to Be able to do my own tour, but to be able to do that tour with those guys as well I Have grown so much because of that I have gained so much knowledge and so much experience going through those events That I will likely never ever forget And I'm gonna be able to utilize them going forward into the tour's next year and They were just such a cool experience to be able to do I'd be able to meet all you guys and be able to be Part of something that would meant so much to so many people Blew me away And the last really cool thing that we got to do this year was the charity stream that we did a couple of weeks back There the jacksepticeye holiday special. I think, was that the full title of it? I think so we did the charity stream for Save the Children and that was an uproarious success That went so goddamn well, and I'm so pleased with that I'm so proud of it and so thankful for everyone who was involved in that I made a vlog talking about this already But I'm so thankful for everybody who was involved in that I'm so thankful for my friends who came out to be part of it And I'm just so proud that this thing that I had an idea for Came to fruition and it went so so well I I really wanted this to do well, and it blew away my expectations you guys were phenomenal thank you for being a part of that and for being part of such a memorable thing and Literally changing so many children's lives and going forward. I want to do more stuff like that as well, but That really was a great rounding off to what was already some really cool experiences that I had this year, but This has been the most trying Year that I've ever gone through Why (don't cry Jackaboy) The most trying year that I've ever gone through Mental health wise there's so many things that Happen this year and so many stuff so much stuff that goes on behind the scenes and so much stuff that you don't get to see or I can't talk about Or I wish I could talk about but For certain reasons here and there, it's just it either won't go down well, or it won't sound good Or I don't know lots of different things that go on that Just have really worn me down this year, and I didn't even realize that it was such a bad thing until Recently we're over Christmas. I decided I was going to take some time off for Christmas I wanted to take time off for Christmas anyway. Just because I don't know it's Christmas time. It's it's a time for just relax Rest and relaxation is what I'm trying to say and I wanted to just take some time off for me And it was the first time that I'd been properly alone For a really really long time and when it was by choice a lot of people said that it was really sad that I was Home alone and that I had nobody at Christmas, but I could have gone back to see some of my family I could have gone with her to see her family and everything, but I think I needed some me time Because as I said so much went on this year that I feel I felt like that I needed to just sit and Think I needed to be alone with my thoughts for a little while and then planned on being like a two-day thing I planned on just not uploading videos on either 24th and 25th or the 25th and the 26th. And then it wasn't until I actually got into taking some time off that I realized how much I really needed it. That I took some time off earlier in the year to go on tour, but that wasn't really a break It was just it was still doing Work to a certain degree because you were still out performing for people you were still out meeting a bunch of people and I didn't really get some time alone to myself and I value my a long time I hugely value being able to just sit and Reflect on my own thoughts and work some stuff out in my head when I was here alone And I wasn't making videos I as I said I didn't realize how much I needed that until it actually happened because So much stuff had been going on this year, and I don't think I realized how much it was wearing me down until I sat and thought about until I just had nothing else to do to distract myself with because Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a workaholic knows that I pour my absolute being Into the stuff that I do into the YouTube videos that I make and sure a lot of people would argue well They're just Let's Plays But you don't realise how much effort It takes to be able to do this twice a day every single day at the exact same time every day to keep up that sort of schedule Because while you might love doing it, and I do I love it dearly I absolutely adore doing what I do It does take a toll on you after a while. It's some sort of mental exhaustion some sort of With so many people talking to you all the time with so many people pulling out of you all the time in so many different directions and if Whenever I'm making my videos. They go up, and then you guys Obviously get to watch them and that's such a cool experience to be able to see the feedback from you guys immediately some of the best parts of doing YouTube But when the videos are made and when I stop recording them like my day doesn't end there well I Afterwards any stuff that I'm trying to do with like Disney or maker or any projects that I'm doing with people in America That's when they wake up Is when I finish making my videos so then all it is it still work hours like after that That you have to talk to people and you have to get into meetings you have to get into calls and you have to organize all this stuff and go through emails and everything and Believe me. I know that these are the most first world problems that a person can have There they're very good problems to have in a way, but at the same time with so much of it going on all the time It did wear me down and because each day whenever I woke up When I had nothing else to do when I wasn't making videos or when I because normally when I wake up I just go straight into my work. I go straight into making thumbnails or making videos or something But because I didn't have any of that to do my mind my mind Just started racing and started wandering and started doing all these different things that for the first time I think ever it started to scare me because I I started to peruse over all the things that had happened since I started making YouTube videos and all the stuff that I have either Neglected or that I've turned down or that I feel like some opportunities have passed and that I can't do them again or It's hard to put into words it was hard to just get my head around it at all, but all this stuff Just started to I sat there, and I was like wait. What the fuck is going on why am I thinking this way? What's what's happening, and I got very very emotional for the first few days And I kind of just sat in a slump, and I got to a point where I started to the thing I'm like man I'm like do I actually have depression at this point am I actually that upset am I that lost am I that confused about what's going on and As I said because I didn't have videos or anything to run away to and I didn't want to either Because it felt like something that I actually had to confront for the first time and throughout the year I had kind of felt it I kind of felt like Some of the stuff I was making I Don't know I felt like I could have been trying a lot more. I felt like my mental health was just deteriorating over the year and and it's also because I always try and stay so positive about everything I tried to stay so upbeat I tried to stay so I tried to see the good in everything and I tried to see the silver lining and all these things that are happening and I don't know I think I was just putting too much pressure on myself to kind of do that and I wasn't giving myself any time to think or to breathe or to just Absorb and reflect on what was going on and over like the course of the year I felt like it was getting worse and worse And then I think when I actually took the time off, and I didn't have anywhere else to run to Because normally I wake up and I do my videos immediately, and I just get straight into work, and I work all day when that didn't happen I Started to just feel so lost and my brain started to go into overdrive and started to think about all these different things And that's the first time that that's ever happened to me Normally, I know exactly where I am. I know what's going on. I know where to go I know what to work towards, but this time it's it was the first time it actually started to scare me because I Started to doubt my own self-worth I started to doubt so many different things that were going on with me I started to go over situations that had happened during the year and started making them all my own fault in my head and how to fix them and Different things it was it was weird, and I started to worry then that I wasn't the same person anymore This is stupid! (Plz don't cry Jack :(  ) Because I've always tried to be upbeat and positive and started and tried to look at the best in absolutely everything and try to Give off that energy to you guys and pass on that sort of positivity and I felt like this year I wasn't trying my hardest to do that because different things inside my head started to get me down That's where this comes in that's where let's make 2018 amazing comes in because I Am so fucking done feeling like that. I'm so done questioning myself I'm so done worrying about so many different things because all these things that I've turned down and all these things that I've Not pursued to the best of my abilities or I've kind of held myself back on I've just either been worried about how people take it or I'm worried that I just don't deserve half the stuff that has come my way or all this stupid nonsense That doesn't really matter at the end of the day that in ten years time. I'll probably regret not doing them so Going forward into 2018. I am ready to kick the absolute shit out of this year I am ready Taking this like time off has completely reinvigorated me. It's completely Given me some sort of motivation and drive. I think not having to do something for a little while has kind of sparked some sort of passion back into me and Trying to get over this stuff, and I'm not of course. I'm not fully over it you don't just get over stuff like that, and I'm definitely gonna seek some sort of help for that stuff next year to try and Get my brain in some sort of working order, but I felt like it was such a good thing to take that time off now Getting ready to go into next year because I feel like my brain is in a good place to actually start working fully properly and in a much more Productive and positive way again when so as I said at the start of this video so many great things happen to me this year And I need to focus on those I need to going into next year I really need to just focus on the good things that are happening make even greater things happen not just for myself But for this channel and for this community. I'm so motivated to work so hard the hardest I am I have ever been willing to work doing YouTube because this year has been such a wake-up call Not not only like for my complacency with everything But also just I feel like I can do so much better going forward And I will and YouTube this year just in general has been a very weird place to be part of it's very Dismal it's very dour It's a very sour atmosphere going around in the platform now because of all the ad pocalypse and the demonetization stuff and everything that's happening. I'm not going to get into that wholly But everyone's kind of just down and I kind of saps your creative energy and everyone's just feeling the brunt of it at this point and if if you do YouTube and you do it long enough when you do it so regularly It's it's very hard not to attach your own self-worth to your channel Because at least me personally you put so much of yourself into what you do I put so much of my own personality into the videos I make and then if YouTube turns around and it hammers down in this video That you've worked so hard on you've put so much energy into it It is hard not to separate that and not to let it hit yourself personally But you can't let yourself feel that way because some of this stuff is just out of your control sometimes these things happen and sometimes Yeah, stuff's not going to go the way you wanted to but that's no reason to not still try your best There's still so many people out there who depend on you depend on you and look up to you that trying your best It's still gonna affect them greatly so I try to remind myself all the time of you guys out there Who watch this content who watch this channel who watch YouTube in general that All the stuff that's going on behind the scenes that it doesn't really affect you all that much it affects the youtubers You're watching, but at the end of the day. I still want to try my best to make You proud and to make good content for you, and if stuff like that does happen I'm gonna deal with it and we can talk about it when it does happen, but again. I'm not gonna let it stop me from trying my best going forward, and I'm So Goddamn ready. I'm so pumped for this year. I have so many things in the works I keep saying that but I'm like everything's kind of in place now And we're ready to start getting moving on it the tour is one thing. I have some other projects that Fucking really wish I could talk about But I don't want to jinx them, and I don't want to ruin them either so I'm gonna I'm they're they're going to happen when they happen And I'm trying to make them the best that they possibly can be and I think you guys are gonna Be really impressed with them, and you're really gonna like them as well, but my god. I am going to give this I'm gonna give the fucking energy of the Sun back into the world this year I'm gonna be such a beacon of positivity for everybody out there involved I'm gonna try and motivate myself motivate you we're all gonna make this a fantastic year you out there as well all of us together Are gonna make this such a good year? This is our year this year is gonna be my fucking bitch I'm gonna kick the shit out of everything that's happening this year and the most positive and most glorious way possible I'm gonna move forward into this year leave all that sour garbage behind me and just Make this a fantastic Year for myself and for everybody out there who is joining me on this journey as well who is part of this wonderful fantastic community who has given me so much over the years, and I'm trying my best every day to give back and This year, I'm sorry if I let you down in that regard (Never) I am going to try so much harder next year So I got four pillars moving forward four pillars that you need to remember going forward into 2018 We're going to focus on the good We're going to keep that that mentality going that the littlest good thing that happens to us We're gonna focus on that and let that be the spark inside us for this year. We're going to keep our PMA We're going to keep our positive mental attitude going forward this year Sure some stuff might get us down and it's okay to feel down. You don't have to be a hundred percent Happy all the time nobody is nobody's perfect. You're allowed to feel sad, but just remember that Let's keep focusing on the good after that That after we get sad that there is still some light left in the world that we can work towards also self-care That's something I've been neglecting from myself for so so long and As evidence from this vlog and this year and the break. I just took it's so incredibly important You need to take care of yourself not only physically through exercise and eating well or any of that stuff, but also in here This is probably the most important thing that you have which is your own mental health, and if that starts to deteriorate Everything else stems from that and that will deteriorate as well, so you got to work on that whether it's personally What do you sit down and you work on yourself and you find some sort of Positive thing that you can work on even meditation I think they all sound cliche they all sound dumb, but they work And if you need to get professional help, then look into that as well Because and I'm gonna be doing that this year. I'm definitely gonna start going to see a therapist this year Just because I think it's important to be able to do It's better to be able to figure out how to overcome hard obstacles when they happen with the tools necessary rather than having the higher things happen and then trying to unravel it afterwards because that is such a harder battle to overcome and Maybe you're there already it's still worth seeking because just like just like you clean your house Just as they say in Rick and Morty just like you wipe your ass Looking after your own mental health is Such a good cleaning Mental process to do so take care of yourselves out there in every way shape and form and the last thing that's on my list To keep focusing on this year is working hard working more working in such a productive way I'm not gonna so many times I'm like there's deadlines coming up or there's a convention coming up or there's all these things that I want to do But I'm so worried about my schedule or something Everything's everything's off the table this year or everything's to play for I'm just gonna work So super hard in the most productive way that I can in the best way that makes the most amount a sense for me So there you have it, that's that's 2017 over and done with Let's make 2018 amazing. Let's make it a fantastic year I'm sorry that this video is so goddamn long, but I had a lot to get off my mind And I have a lot that I just want to leave behind and let's move forward into the new year and let's rock it Okay, let's anyway.

*WAPSHHH* TOP OF THE MORNING TO YA LADDIES! My name is Jacksepticeye, and welcome back to, Cuphead! My misery, The game that's gonna make me pull all of my teensy-weensy little hairs out. So, last time I tried to fight the clown, stupidly cause' I keep forgetting that I have a fucking dodge attack. I need to get the good dodge attack I need to get the disappear-y one which I don't have enough for right now, but I'll get it later. I take less hits then and I'm relying a lot on my hits right now. I don't fucking know, but let's try something else. Let's try something else lets try... "Baroness Von Bon Bon." I Don't know. This is one of those games that I'm gonna record for an hour and make zero (but in a french accent) progress Oh wait! Oh God, oh God what are you doing to me? I thought this was one. AAAH! Didn't you say that this was one that.. -AAH shit I'm not paying attention- That was for planes? I'm being a stoop. Ooh I'm supposed to be hitting you! Well aren't I a fucking, candy corn. Okay.

Doh it's the waffle. dahhhhhhhhhh! Don't kill me I'mma do this Okay, just stay away. (x3) That's easy. That's easy. Why are- Oh I'm missing not the dodge attacks Fuck you!!!!! Okay there we go there we go two down two down how many to go fuck knows I'm gonna die so quick. Doh. It's a little Gobstopper Doh, shit there's too many thing going on! *PAHOO* Fuckityfackitfuckitfuck! But hey I got more than halfway on two attempts, that's good I should be passing this in my fucking first try FIRST TRY!! And *does a wierd shriek* Die die die die die in a fire in a fire. DIE IN A FIRE!!! Okay *laughes* Oh God you're new you're new and you're gross Hey! K so he does that- Ahhh. It's time to come all the way here yeah out of my house get away from me! I don't want nothing to do with you! this guy, it's this fucking guy, it's this fucking guy!! Ahhh. It's time to come all the way here yeah out of my house get away from me! I don't want nothing to do with you! this guy, it's this fucking guy, it's this fucking guy!! I dont like it I dont like it!! I'm not even getting any fucking shots off on him. Please just kill him. Please just kill him yes, baby What's up lady, what's up? What you want? Oh man this isn't even that hard why am I dying so much. Yeah fucking waffle. oh oh oh oh! that bad thats bad! Ohhh!! DAAAA! Fuck it! *laughs* I got trapped. You suck lady. Oh gum ball man. Haven't seen you in a while actually Okay, okay, okay, okay? Hey stay over there, please... Okay, not so bad not so bad, ooh What are you sending after me, this fucker. I don't really know what to do with you sir. Fuck it!!! I changed my fucking attack!! It shouldn't be this difficult What does it fucking minimi Gobstopper over here? Huh? Can you die? there We go? He's dead oh? I know what to do, but this this boss rate has like a billion phases, and they all come out at random ah shit So I'm not getting used to any one phase. I'm having to fight a bunch of them all at once What does it fucking minimi Gobstopper over here? Huh? Can you die? there We go? He's dead oh? God oh god. He died a lot Get out of here lady no one likes you I hate this one What the fuck now you're up there what I'm hitting you I'm dead I'm dead I'm dead I'm dead I'm dead Come on When did she start showing up what the fuck is that? I know... Man I need different attacks I need the homing attacks( I get really lonly writing these...) That's what I fucking need and yes, I know I still have a dodge attack But I don't feel like it would help me much here. Cuz I just I'd end up scooting my boot into something else faster. Oh I got to a new phase. I did it I did something. What the fuck eww eww what the what the fuck what the fuck lady?! I need better upgrades. I bought all the worst upgrades. I very much do not care for that. NO! I bought like the spread shot when I technically don't really need it either. I should have bought the horseshoes I need better upgrades. I bought all the worst upgrades. I bought more Health when I didn't need it. I bought a triple shot. I bought like the spread shot when I technically don't really need it either. I should have bought the horseshoes Because they're the homing ones that they come back So now. I have to do is keep shooting in a level and then worry about dodging Then let's see how much it costs, and I don't have to dash through so now when I dash I'm still hitting enemies chaser Need four for them and three for this though damn it Great coverage with average damage aim backward for maximum range. I don't know which one is which That might actually be the horseshoe one Need four for them and three for this though damn it Alright I finished that other level I finished the first level again and got all the coins in it which I only had one Left against which means I can now afford smoke bomb your first party move doubles is a damaging ax attack Jesus Christ Goodbye Alright, we're gonna get this scarred. I'm not I haven't done anything this episode So now I won't have an extra heart But I will be able to dodge better, so I'm gonna see if that makes any sort of difference Oh no not this way And I could go to simple, but then you can't finish the game Is that it's just try try try try try try try try try and after a while my patience runs thin so Try try trying turns into ow ow fuck it And I could go to simple, but then you can't finish the game Okay, I need to remember. I only have three shots now See that now I have an invincible dodge I just disappear and reappear nice Well now I only have one hit for the entire rest of the fight Oh Shit I want to die! okay. Nut sack. Did I get close not even a little again fuck I want to die! okay. Ok got it under control... for now No!! Ahh fuck! Yes!!! Oh give it to me!! Oh I feel good Man I'm all shaky Jesus Christ oh It feels worth it whenever you get it done. It feels worth it Baroness Von Bon Bon more like Baroness Von Bye-Bye oh Those are balloons full of bullets how does that make sense how's that fair. whoo? Oh Jesus. Scuse me, sir. I don't want that could you do the magic trick where you go away? Can I bounce one you? I can! Those are balloons full of bullets how does that make sense how's that fair. whoo? Now I'm up here! Fuck hey come out of that area at least fuck off Dark Magician go back to Yu-Gi-Oh Don't want it. Don't want it. Don't want it. Don't need it. Don't even like it. Oh sweet Jesus I didn't even get that far It's on like Donkey Kong Fuck hey come out of that area at least fuck off Dark Magician go back to Yu-Gi-Oh Okay, okay Ta-Ting I don't know why but okay. This area right here yours gonna come in handy? A fucking dodge Ohhhhh what is happening Hahaha, that's what's happening. I didn't even get halfway, okay Fuck!!! I got hit by a stray bullet at the end keep on dodging and nobody can- ahhh! This area right here yours gonna come in handy? A fucking dodge Just like that Just keep on dodging Fuck!!! I got hit by a stray bullet at the end keep on dodging and nobody can- ahhh! Nobody can take it away from you That's what I was gonna say, but then life got very sad Oh, oh god Shit now I know why the targets are on them, okay, okay, I get it I get it I get it I get it Jeez he died quick, should be able to get through this without getting any damage Okay, I'll be careful. I'll carefully can you all fall please? That's great Nice Okay, what else is going on what else is going on here today, BESIDES A BUNCH OF BULL SHIT!! Oh shit Oh shit what are you doing to me? I heavily dislike this Sirs and Madam's Lots of things trying to kill me in this game. Why did I do that?!(x2) Ok I got past him Now what Oh I heavily dislike this Oh God what the fuck is that with the yellow goo. Oh I've been shot by a hotdogs. So close Alright Tre' very nervous right now Life just keeps give me opportunity after opportunity, and I keep just spitting in its face YA I DID IT!!! It took me 20 minutes. I would love to know what's causing all of that, goopy goop sick fucking vomit and shit Tre' very nervous right now Am I getting close to the source yeah, it's a big fucking hot dog HAHA take that you fat bitch YA I DID IT!!! It took me 20 minutes. Oh A C I don't care C for luck C I did it    oh man And I five coins now, which means I can get a new shot if I want it Oohh is there a dudas in here I'm gonna go back, and I'm gonna get a different shot. I don't know what one to get though Dudududududududududududu the chaser one would be good because I think the super on that puts a ringer them around you and that means that smaller enemies won't be able to hit you and you have a little bit of a barrier I don't know That's this one, but this one is also the loopback aim backward for maximum range Great coverage with average damage and this is below average damage, so I make it this one Charge radial barrage hold attack to increase damage. No rapid fire so precision is key Goodbye Um all right, so I want to see I'm not getting rid of my regular peashooter Because I feel like that that's where be the best thing that I have can I can we retry a boss Yeah, I want to just retry this with the other shot just to see what it's like oh Man oh man look at this Fuck yeah, dude kick his ass So I have fuck all range this way, but if I fire backwards then I have a lot of range interesting How strong is it though is the question, probably not that strong is it? I don't know man seems pretty strong Well I guess you can't fire that up, it's confusing that there's seven fucking shots on screen None of these are even hitting that dude I mean I haven't taken any damage it is nice though because there's constantly shots on screen *laughs* I walked right into that Ooo that's cool, ooo it stays on screen that's nice. Stupid Me liking this attack I can't really see an instance where that would have helped me in some of the fights that have already done though Maybe chaser is the one to get oh, but I think I need... I think I need like a lot more coins to be able to get that three more coins And I don't even think there's that money in the levels that I haven't That I finished already, so I don't know At least it's nice to have another attack if nothing else All right, why don't I leave this episode of cup head here at least we made some progress I still have two more bosses in that other area to fight that I Had last time and I think it opened up a new area to another boss so There's a lot of this game left and I think it just gets harder as time goes on but... Just take my time. It took me an hour just to do that small little section. Anyway, thank you guys so much for watching this episode. If you liked it, cup that like button in the head! LIKE A BOSS! And highfives all around *wapossh wapoosh* Thank you guys and I will see all you dudes in the next video! *outtro music plays Oh, my voice is back IN TOP CONDITION! 
*WAPOOSH* Top of the morning to ya laddies! My name is Jacksepticeye and have you ever been scared of a video game? And I don't mean scared in the sense of like "I'm playing Amnesia or I'm playing some other horror game", I mean scared in the fact that you don't know what's gonna happen when you start this thing. I don't know what will happen, I might have to murder a child after I've played this. We never ever know if it's ever gonna resort to that. So I got up to fight a train... And then right after that is uhmm Uhhhhh - Mr. King Dice! Mr. King Dick, ha! Got 'em! Erhhm, right, I don't know - I've seen the train before but I don't know the phases.

Do you know what "hitting him" looks like? You're supposed to- you're supposed to actually hit him! Okay, ya fucking bendy hose! Okay, that actually works out.

Feeling good about that one! Whew, A-! That felt good, oh my ass is rock solid right now! Ding-ding choo-choo, Let me through, goodbye to you! Alright, we're moving on to King Dice! Get- uhh, worried about this one, uhmmm. Eh, charge shot maybe? "Inkwell Hell". *gets worried* So I have to fight King Dice before I fight the Devil, right? Oh! Oh, bad! Oh, that's a bad sign! King Dice- there's only regular, and I think that's why you're not able to get this far unless you get all the regular... contracts. But it's bullshit, but you know what? We're in it. We did it. "Well lookee here. You actually pulled it off... but you've made me lose a bet! And for that, you ain't seein' the boss just yet. We're gonna play a little game first!" Is that game called "put a gun in your mouth and die"? Oh god, what? WHAT- oh, oooooh I have to pick! Oh okay, so- oh my god, look how many bosses I have to fight! Okay, so I want a 1. 1, 1, 1, 1! So I fight a boss, but I get my health up, right? Ah okay! 'Cause I- I heard some people talk a bit about this, but it never really made sense until I've seen it. Oh Christ! *talks gibberish* Oh god! I don't like this! Oooh, fuckaloo! Fuckaloo-la! Fuck-a-loo-la-ley! *many "oh" noises* I like to restart the whole thing over again. *inconclusive laughter* Well! Okay, we're gonna be here all day folks! Strap on your big-boy strap ons! Okay. I'm gonna get a 3 this time, 3, 3, 3! There we go. Because you can't get a 4... okay, and each of these are different bosses. Hi sir! Oh god! Oh god! Oh god, what's happening? Oh Jesus! I've played enough of your fucking friends to know what shit is going on here, buddy boy! AAAAHHH, shite! Fuck this garbage! Oh, and I had FOUR health! Oh, that would've been so good going into the final phase! Final phases*! I can get more health back though, right? Okay, I have to get a 2 then, oh crap. 2, 2, 2, 2! Not 2, 3! I can't count! Oooh, oh Nellie! (is this a friend of this "Sally" you spoke of?) Oh god I'm fighting a domino? I really like your pizza! Okay, okay. There is no way that you're as hard as regular- bosses, right? *sees progress* OOOOHWWW! "You set them up, I'll knock them down." You just did. Okay. I need to change way for the charged shot, I'm not good with it. Can- Can I- Can I leave? Take me to the map, and I'm out, I'll be back! Okay! 3 was a- 3 was an easy enough fight. The cigar, right? 1, 2, 3, 4! *makes weird King Dice-esque vomit sound* Why are you swallowing me, dude? Well how kindly is that. He's cool-looking! I like him! *sings along with the music* I just jumped right into that. Where is it- oh charge shot does a LOT of damage! That took WAY longer than last time! Oh, god! I might be in a predico here. And you s- You keep your one health, so I have to go for a 2 now? 2, 2, 2! Ooh, safe! *exhales* Okay, I can go for a 1 again, 1, 1, 1! *realizes he fucked up* NOOOOOO, FUCK! Oh, it's a fucking plane one. Oh god. I don't know what's happening! Oh god, there's guys coming from the bottom! Okay, I even think I fe- I didn't realize I kept those as well. Okay mind the ghosts! The ghosts will come from the bottom. Oh god! I can't even see what's happening. Oh god. Oh my god! Thank you! Ooooh, I got so fucking lucky! So technically you can take a hit in most of these fights and come back and get more health, except now I need to get a 1 and then I need to get a 3. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1! I need to get a three. Oh my god, there's a start over?! Okay, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3! NOOOO, NONONONONONO NO NO! Oh Jesus Christ. What are you, sir? (well that's rude, Jack.) Okay, okay, okay, that's a lot of balls! Uohh! I don't know what this is! FUCK YOU! *in a Russian accent* "Ah-ha! You've noticed that my style is very Russian!" I get it, 'cause she were rushing! :D Alright, back to square NUMERO UNO! This guy's not so tough. He's just a bunch of poker chips, and he comes at varying sizes. Oooh, okay, so I need a 2. 2, 2, 2, 2... 2! And then I need a 2 again. 2, 2, 2, 2, nooo- I almost jumped over it. Fuck. Oh, it's a new one. Oh, that's a mad bastard. Okay, okay, I get it, I get it, I get it. Okay I get it, okay I get it, I get it. I'm not into it, but I get it. And just dash out of that. Okay, I'm just gonna go for the 3. 3, 3, 3, 3! That's a- oh, 2 is safe as well, okay. Yeah, you can look it all you want. Can I just kill him here? 1, 1, 1, 1. Nice, okay. Back at full health! I don't like you. I don't like you! You do that very differently each time. Oh, I can- Oooooh! Oooh, I didn't know that! Okay that makes- that makes that a lot easier, and where are these fucking balls going? Wew. Oh, where was I?! I didn't even realize I was over there! Oh, I'm gonna get hit. Oh, thank god! That was a- complete and utter waste! Alright if I can get a 3 and then a 2, I'll actually be able to finish this! 3, 3, 3, 3! DO NOT get a fucking 1! A 3 or a 2! 3, 3, *sound of hesitation* 2, 2, 2, okay! Oh god, oh god. What the fuck? WHAT THE FUCK?! Oh, shit man! I have to parry all his fucking cards?! Sooo uh- "So clever, so dapper, ya betta' believe this dice is loaded. Hi-de-ho!" I have to do it all again. I have to do it all again. Oh... Misery, thy name as fuck. Alright, I need to start right now. Which ones are which? Okay, 5- 5 is the rabbit. Okay, hold on, hold on! 5 is the rabbit! I'm writing myself a little cheat sheet *Sans flashbacks* Okay. I need a super going into King Dice. I need to get a 2 and I need to get a 3. Alright, 2, 2, 2, 2! TWOOOOO! I'm into this, I'm into this, I got it! The drums are with me *imitates music* 3, 3, 3, 3! Okay! Okay, I have to find out what boss number 9 is then I can write that down. I only have two of them written down so far. *soft laughter* Oh shit, it's a new one. And it's a plane one! Oh god, oh stop! Oh I can just parry all these? Okay. Ahhhh! Is this a matching game? Come here! (Good job Jack. You just wasted your super :D) Okay, is that that one? That's not that one. What happens if I match them? Oh go-, okay, I have a match. There we go. Oh god, why does matching you get you harder? Oh god, was I not actually doing any damage until now? (yep, life can be rough sometimes.) Oooh, that would be the suuuckiest! That'd be the worst Christmas present! Okay, okay. Can I take any fucking damage on a cymbal banging monkey? Okay? Okay? Okay? You are here? Yeah! *in a Russian accent* The game of memory! Okay, just fucking die! Nooooo! I took a dam! I hate this monkey! Finally. Yes, mash your own face, see if I care. I shouldn't have taken any damage during that! I was doing so well! Okay, so now I need a 3. A 3 year old- 1, actually wait, that was number 9. 9 is monkey. Ooooh, thank god. Oh god! Fuck you dude. I hate this! *with legitimate anger* I hate this. I hate this so much. Oooh, I've never fought you! I don't like new things. And you've one hit left as well. What the fuck is happening? Why are all these fucking shh- snooker chalks coming out to kill me? Oooh, thank god! *monkey knocks himself out* Wha-what happened? Did I- Did I just break him? Wha-What happened? I don't know but I'm happy about it. Okay. 3, 3, 3, 3! I DON'T KNOW HOW! (Goodbye Jack. You and your sanity will be missed :'(. Oh wait, there he is again with a coke. Phew.) I'm back and I brought myself a nice little coke, a nice little beverage for myself. Just- just to sip on, so I'm not that angry. Okay, so: while I was away, thinking about it, making myself a drink, I was like "How could I beat him?" 'Cause I'm terrible at parrying, and after looking at this, I just realized that maybe I can go the - uhmm - fuck, that's probably not possible, so say, maybe I can go on the other side of his hand? Ugh, I don't know. Okay, the health is on 2. I don't know what number two is. What's number 4? I don't know what 4 is either. Okay, let's get 2! 2, 2, 2... ... that's a 3. Oh, I took damage. Oh, I'm dumb! *coughs* Oh-oh. Oh god! I don't know how I did that. Bad idea! Niiice! *chuckles* He's kicking himself in the face! Okay, that was number... 4! 3, 3, 3... Nooooooo! Could you die? Die for me? Die, die for me! I have one health and I'm supposed to be able to get to King Dice like this. What's 9? 9 is the monkey. Oh wait, I have to do 1 and 3. 1, 1, 1, 1... 1! Okay, phew. *imitates King Dice* Fuck you King Dice. Why is there a 5 in your head and not a 6, huh? Not good enough for the 6? 3, 3, 3, 3... 3! Okay, hopefully we can break the monkey again. So the most health I can have going out to King Dice is 2. Oh man... Too bad, little bang-bang man! It's all over. *talks with weird accent* You didn't even hit me once times! Okay. Here we go. 3, 3, 3... That's a 1, 1 is good enough. 3 or 2, DON'T give me a 1. D: 3, 3, 3... okay! Uh-oh. Oh oh... Okay, okay, okay, can I do the thing? WHAT?! You fucking - That's unfair sir, that's unfair sir. You're changing up the hands. Uhhng... Every other single time I fought him, it's been right-left-right-left! This time it's just like "Ah, I'm doing this side twice! Hope you don't mind." This is the most amount of bosses I've fought in this fucking thing so far! Need 2 or 3. 2, 2... Fuck, fuck, FUCK, FUCK!! It's not even halfway! I need to figure out better shots! 3, 3, 3... 3! Oh my god I can have 6 health?! Wha-What the fuck? This is the monkey right? Yeah... I can have 6 health?! Okay! Okay, okay, okay! 6 health. What the F? The most health I have ever had in this game. Okay... Okay. 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3... 3! Fuck, I've already down less health! Okay, I just have to use this here. Oh fuck you! Yes, yes, yes, okay! *deep exhale of total concentration* Come on, get lucky, get lucky, get lucky - YES! Come on... OOOHHH GOD! COME ON! *shrieks* Yes, yes yesyesyesyesyes! My heart is fucking pounding right now. Oh oh. Okay, that's fine. That's fine, that's fine. It's a war of attrition right now! YAAA-HAAAS!! OOOH, I NEVER HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR CUBE DOME AGAIN! WHEW! WHEW! :D Haha! Whew! Whew! Five minutes! Five minutes per attempt! Been recording for an hour and twenty minutes, and I defeated the train after the first half-hour. I've been trying that for an hour. Excuse me, if I'm not just the least bit excited! Oh, oh it's over! Never ever ever again do I have to look at that cubed motherfucker! Sorry Robin, I know cubes are your thing but I'm lightheaded... Ooooh maaaaaan... Rarely am I that truly exciting to have anything happen in a video game. This is like Dark Souls or Bloodborne of- actually, this is stronger than that! Because the Dark Souls and Bloodborne stuff, I'm like, "okay, I'm getting it", and then I start getting better and better and better. This game's full of bullshit. It's only because I had 6 health going into that that I was able to do that. The fact that I'm able to even get 6 health was the only reason I'm able to do that. Ugh, next is the Devil. I'm gonna leave him in an episode all of his own, because that's probably gonna take forever. It'll be funny to know the Devil turns out to be the one that I finished the fastest. *laughs* Anyway, THANK YOU GUYS so much for watching this episode! If you liked it, PUNCH that like button in the face! LIKE A BOSS! And, high fives all around, *WAPOOSH* *WAPOOSH* Thank you guys and I will see all you dudes in the next video! Thanks for turning on the subtitles! I worked hard on them! All subtitles have been provided by a Dutch fan of Jacksepticeye. Cheers everyone, hope to see younext time! :D 
Top of the mornin' to ya, laddies! My name is jacksecticeye, and welcome back to Subnauseous! How are we doin', Sam? wait wait no do another one, you can't just do a high-five Sam- "LIKE A BOSS!" There you go Thanks. It keeps me going in the morning. Also my kitty *Kissing Sound*  there you got to give them a little smooch before you go, so I'm taking this off the wall I know crazy plan it's gonna make sense in a second even though I explained my plans last time I still have all the materials for it so what I'm doing is putting it into my big baby Maria over here What's up girl? How are you doing? You're doing good? I hope this is still a thing I can do Cause the best thing, one of the best things about the Submarine, about Maria is that she comes with built-in storage, so I have a lot of lockers already there I can build more and just technically never need Henry ever again. That's the That's the end goal to never ever need Henry again to just be able to put all my stuff into this and then go What are you? No vehicle docked You're the vehicle thing here Whoa that's cool. Oh you shoot the decoys I thought I'd just shot them myself Oooo I have an upgrade module for you oh, I shouldn't go anywhere yet, oooo very nice Yes, okay, and there's a fire extinguisher on board very nice So this thing has always been here this little like circle thing, that was never there before and I got blueprint to be able to get a creature decoy I didn't know that I needed to shoot them from this thing interior modules This bad boy, yeah Okay, I have you centered right now Maybe not the best idea because what I'm gonna put some stuff over here as well, so this would be like my my manufacturing station in here and the goal is to get enough power cells and put you back in so I don't have space here and We actually just bring a bunch of stuff cuz I'm heading to the island we said that last time we're heading to the island You should drag you over closer, but Maria. You're a big gal I can't drive you that close so I want to put the seamoth into it as well see months should be fully charged where it is now because obviously the Power Cells in my Submarine are gonna get used up like that Cyclops engine efficiency module that is very very useful, none of this stuff is useful out on the road That's all stuff that I'm gonna need At a different date, so just let's clear out all these things Let's make sure, you don't go on a road trip without being prepared. Okay. Is there anything even left in this thing? Oh some things Okay, Imma just take you out and move you around So I just have Oh you're still charging my battery, wondered what that sound was so we're on its own, so you're you're the one that's not really gonna go anywhere I don't think anything is gonna come in here and push you a fish might come and push this one And then I lose it, so I don't lose all the materials. I once had And do I have anything in here? I really don't think I have anything in here. That's useful out on the road fire extinguisher? We bring some purple tablets and ion crystals Just for the rare occurrence that cuz when I get to this island there might be some places that I can Open up there is a warp gate on the other island that I didn't get to, remember the place with the giant gun that shot down my Sunbeam RIP on beam f to pay respects On that island, inside the caves, I didn't actually go in there You there's a warp gate in there that you can use a crystal for to get into I can't remember that warp gate brings you I think that warp gate brings you back to... that don't make any sense Where does it fucking bring you? Oooo! Nice so we can actually put my sea moth upgrades in here So don't actually have to bring it back to my vehicle upgrade bay That's neat okay, give me two seconds, Maria, and we'll get you moving. I know you're aching to go you're aching to bake and These things oh yeah upgrade module Because the thing about the energy efficiency module is that it uses less energy to drive around Within my power cells are already charging themselves so Engine efficiencies have 300% So technically I should be able to hold on Technically I should be able to go Forever now with this. One more power cell would be nice just to fill up the Oh, she's moving she's moving for the first time in a long time an extra Power Cell would be nice to be able to fill up the Just the charger, and then we'd have two on the go every single time. I take out two, put in two, right This might not be the best way to go around this. I can't go that way Because when I do I get stuck Ooooo I mean these are in the game already before, but it's just I know man, it's nice. Please be able to determine How close you are to things because you when you're in the, when you're in the cockpit? Or as I like to call it the jack pit It's hard to see what's underneath you. It's hard to see how close you are to things God it's still hard to see how close I am to things Careful now, easy does it you know on the beach Maria It's exactly what I'm gonna do and the only reason I came this way because I was too lazy to reverse and go back the other way Which is by far the easier method to do because the oceans are much deeper over there. Well once we crest this ridge We are fine Sorry whatever that was I don't really care cuz now that I'm in Maria Everything is go, all bets are off Okay, Maria. Is your arse clear? Well clear okay. We're gonna go down a small bit umm. What's the depth you can go to? 500 meters, okay Still not great because a lot of the later game stuff down by the sea traders path and all that stuff you're getting into like a Thousand and twelve hundred. To get down into the lava zone Where is going to be a thing that we need to get to eventually that's very very deep hey reefies And for the people asking- no you can't kill a reef back They are like the one constant. You can't kill them. They can't kill you, they just flow it around. They're the best They're my best friends in this game And oh wait, I don't need to go up to see where I'm going I can just do this Wait where's the island oh I'm all arse way hahaha You used to be able to build bases on reef backs as well But they took that out of the game before I even got a chance to try it out Which is annoying because I would have loved to put a base on a reef back Put a little like, put a little beacon in there and see where they See where the base actually ends up, very easy lose your base though, hold on a minute. It's my energy efficiency that good? I'm still at a hundred percent Well what are you? Okay, maybe if I sped it up, let's see how fast she goes Is that a reef back? Jesus Okay, so aww we're down to 99% the reason you don't go at full speed most times is because you make a shit ton of noise and Here, that's when Reapers are going to start hearing you But right now that doesn't really bother me because there's no Reapers between here the, safe shallows Wait that can happen oh, that's what this is it's So regular speed you can't you can't actually overheat, but with this ah So as it says that's emergency speed I guess you don't use that until you actually need to to get away from something Okay, there's the island Still immensely creepy Where's the beach? Where's an area can actually get off? For some reason whatever you look at it straight, it always looks smaller than it actually is But it's pretty big okay, here we go and don't forget the floaters so the only reason this island is actually in the air, the other one is I get it The other island is actually like cemented to the ground like most islands in our world but This island is only floating because giant floaters are underneath it Which I think is cool I do not have nearly enough water for this trip Balls to that man Okay, I could have just come over here in Sally Would have been better actually to do that, but I love my Maria! Look at her big beachy goodness, okay, we need Surface You can be Another type of orange so when you get them all different colors, ooh You can kind of see the island in the distance, see there on the right Where the clouds going over? If I turn right though it starts to disappear haha Weird oh fuck it's almost nighttime All these stupid headcrab things are here Okay, okay, okay do this quick Ahhh I hate them, start scanning everything here Fuck off! This is an important island, you saw as I came in that there's a base up on top That's my plan to get to there. This is beautiful. Oh, I got a message Um Well Jack's not home right now, and there's the other one Jack's not at home right now, so thank you for leaving a message I will get to it when I get to it. Okay. There's a base right here lantern fruit You edible? Nice so the best edibles are the ones that give you back water Some edibles don't do that so God you take up a lot of space I'm just gonna eat a bunch of these so my water gets high cuz I'm very low that but it's nice to know that I Have a source here, and then I might be able to actually pick some up for later to be able to plant them Okay yeah, here's the here's the grow bed Exterior crow bed no. I don't want one of them Chinese potato plants These are the best Did I scan you? Oh I didn't even scan this one. I only it's got the other one okay I don't need an exterior grow bed. I need an interior grow bed. I have the stasis rifle stuff Oh it's very very quiet ahhh! Jesus I have to scan the bulkhead? Stop it, go away. This way it brought med kits with me, and you know what you know what we're doing Here Okay little shits, where are you? Who's near me? Come here What did I pick up? I don't know I picked up, picked up a fucking rock Where are you little shithead? Come here Here's why, come here Come here thattaboy thattaboy bye! Have fun on Mars Oh God freaking out Ow! Come here Come here little shitbag bye! Okay, I need be careful though I'll run out of power with this thing if I'm not careful um You have a flashlight and a PDA. I know I'm missing some PDAs as I'm going around the game. I don't mean to Just sometimes to get caught up in the moment and I'm very well aware of how much food and water and oxygen and stuff I have *Voice Log* Son, I said wait for the storm to pass Your life's more valuable  to me than a plant patch You stopped being in charged when the ship you were captioning sunk I'll stop being in charge when you take charge of yourself say chief, cheif What? You know how to drain those grow beds of 40 tons of storm water or how to conjugate? From the air. I know how to prioritize I'm just saying if that's so what's your boys life worth today if tomorrow You're gonna be so hungry you start wondering what it tastes like... Let him go deal with the plants Son, go deal with the plants Interfere with my family again and when rescue arrives I will leave you here Do you understand me? No rescue coming chief , not in time I'm not staying here neither this rain keeps falling sooner or later this place will be buried the only choice We got is whether to get buried with it *Jack* So yeah Bart Torgul was the guy who did all the plant stuff I believe *Log* Chiefs log 5 weeks since the crash. The only other survivors are my son, Bart... (Jack- this one is before the other one) After days drifting in the lifepod rain hammering on the roof the weather clear then we washed up here I had made a service that the Ghazi rec Said not to finding as a stable source of food His education is paying off sooner than that anticipated our only problem is meter she says the weather's going to turn I Say, she's finding excuses to risk our lives Imagine she snuck on a weekend our life the her physical altercation, and she's itching for a fight In every judgment she makes things go from bad to worse If she had my experience. She'd have more faith Humans have spent millennia specializing and had a shackled nature to our will This planet won't cause us any new problems Now what task now is to keep us alive as comfortably as possible until the insurance company arranges rescue And this power of space that could be months or even years *jack* Great I'm just gonna hang out here then Wall planter I guess just scan what you can Can I get in, down here? Yay. Oh, there are purple artifacts here, okay What is that thing? I don't know I found it outside in the sand part of another ship I've ever seen it's not even scratched Don't fool around with that it might be worth something stand down chief Then we're gonna crumble to dust it would have done so when I picked it up. It's glowing We're not the first people to come to this planet people maybe Could be aliens could be the damn sea monsters for all we know one thing for sure we ain't gonna find out by staying here *Jack* So they're talking about that the purple artifacts. I just picked up Okay, I think that's everything in here It's already light out, that's cool. Can I cheat the system and get up here real fast? There's two peaks on this island one up there it has a base and one over here has the other base And where there are bases there are lots of very good Things to scan in it, don't fall off Don't fall off, it's tryin' to claim a hill in Skyrim or something The rocks are all fallin' apart, Lets do a self-scan, we haven't done one of those in a while Nothing? Okay, this is actually the way up. Why is my scan returning nothing? That's weird Okay, this is scary. I don't like climbing these mountains. I never have but hey look at all the pretty shiny water all the shaders disappear up this far I Should have I should scan them before I do anything you never know. They could be poisonous I never liked poison in my body it hurts Okay a land-based fungus species with harvestable spores inedible fuck ya then God the Aurora's far away from here Speckled rattler, can any of you things have an aerogel? I forget where I get that A brittle land plant containing large spores is generating a Characteristic rattle when the plant is shaken this may act to ward off predators, or even encourage pre Predation as a means of spreading the spores Okay almost there. Yeah, show me what you got, okay? That's why the Chinese potato plant is so good because it lets you pull so many off of it And then when you eat it, it actually gives you like a lot of food and water So I just need a couple to be able to There's the other place Fresh food, no building materials nothing left of the ship, and your kid says we're gonna starve without more grow beds Speak up kid. It's true father The natural growth rates are too slow to keep supporting us. I'm saying is oceans got us, surrounded No use hiding Sooner or later. We'll get our feet wet The rest of your life may have been a fight mater But I've made my decision you want to forfeit your emergency paid to take a swim go ahead believe me I'm thinking of it Man, mutiny was ripe wasn't it? a little bit more Technically, I only need one to plant and then I can take bits off the one that grows and then just plant those so This place was not that useful Always nice to have spotlights and shit, though So all that stuff before like spotlights and everything I think they were just in your Inventory or they like you didn't have to get blueprints and shit for them Don't hurt yourself oh Oh, oh is this gonna kill me if I try go down it a A long time ago when I played the game I think it was the first time I actually came to this island there was no fall damage in the game So I could run across this whole place and just leap off as much as I wanted and I never took any damage Was fantastic I loved it There's also some caves in this area, I think Maybe that's where the warp gate leads Maybe each warp gate goes to each Island That'll be handy except if I did that now I end up leaving all my stuff behind which I don't want Okay, give me the good stuff. Give me. Give me something amazing That's not amazing, ooh Water Maybe water is pretty good This is bad after all that time in the deep I've been dreaming of it Now I'm back here I'm finding it hard to enjoy alone father. Was right So deep They do not want us down there despite my best efforts Ill-health is taking hold of me The visions are getting worse Margaery and father are now part of the ecosystem of this incredible planet It's reassuring to know that when I go I'll join them until then There's always the view Man, that's scary so you guys never left this island or that was your plan to never actually leave it? I mean the view is nice and all, but it's nice no fucking it's nothing amazing Oooo indoor grow bed that's the shit I needed That right there is the whole reason I came to this island That is going to save our asses That's what's going to keep us alive if I can get an indoor grow bed going So you should pick up some of these as well plant them If I can get an indoor grow bed going and a water filtration system, then I never have to worry about that stuff again drink this water Nice Okay cool. I think that's the main part of what this island has to offer I think anyway Should be able to just head back to my submarine now So next on my list after this well, I should come back to this island again and explore more of it anyway Because there's a lot to it as I said there's stuff inside the island At least that's what I remember inventory full, okay cool Wait how did I get here? I came through a hole Somewhere out this way Next of my list is to build the prawn suit I need to go out and get some aerogel I think that was the only thing that I didn't have so far that was needed all the other stuff I kinda I can find bits and pieces of it everywhere My best source of stuff like lithium is the other island Lead and all that stuff. We can kind of find around, look at that beautiful baby Alright, there's so much going on in this game all the time as well That it's easy to just be it's easy to bounce from thought to thought Begone tHOT Really hope I can actually just plant this stuff in here again What if they remove that ability? Oh yes, what do we need four titanium? I don't have four titanium? Seriously, that's all I need? That's amazing let's head back Here we go Maria. We're kicking off again, but before we go *heooooOoonk* Haha, Oh engines are on wait while I'm here. Let's go down Oh, fuck this, man Because this is where we are now is near the grand reef And these areas are all super important Like down *stutters* We're going down those holes later in the game Right now we can't I've actually got Maria down until one of them at one point And I was so afraid that I could never get her back out again Really wish I had the depth meter here in front of me now. Oh, I see a shiny Yeah down into these holes is someplace that we are going later on We're at 194 meters? I can take Sally out in that Okay wait no no no no no no actually. I needed to be down there hahaha what am I doing? Okay, here locker boom boom no no no Fuck sometimes, it's left click to move stuff back and forth like the charging stations And then sometimes it's right-click and I keep getting mixed up every now and then and Messing it up so I eat a bunch of stuff as long as I have one of each I'm fine You're a bioreactor right Oh a thermal plant I have that oooo I can get the four pieces of titanium if I scan stuff that I already have Didn't think about that Now I'm thinking about that and that's the thing I'm going to see down the fucking down into the devil's anus It's so fucking horrible. What are you? moonpool fragment. that'll do Wait I was here You really shouldn't have your lights on anymore if I've gotten you oh Yeah I was here Boo Did I go in here though? Yeah, I think I did Goddamnit. Well there was not a fruitless endeavor we did get our titanium So now we can build the grow bed. Oh, that's great I love how fast he climbs the ladder build you right there You're not getting much sunlight in here, that's fucking crooked and that's gonna piss me off but it's done who cares Give me things Do not left-click them keep in mind pay attention Nice nice I'm so goddamn proud of this series so far we are making such amazing progress This is the type of stuff that I wasn't doing until way later in the other series I mean obviously because I was taking way longer to actually figure shit out And I was trying to figure out where all the places were and stuff just wasn't in the places It was supposed to be so now. It's easier to find schematics and blueprints and bits and pieces of everything because it's It's it's just better made floodlights Switch those bad babies on so we can see where we're going- they did not really help. Okay keep your eyes peeled it is kind of sad that- ooooh It's kind of sad that there's nothing really left in the game to surprise me monster wise Like I've kind of seen all the creatures that the game has to offer And I would love if cuz I'll never get that feeling back of seeing a Reaper for the first time again, which Scared the shit out of me Because it was it was that thing where you got into the game. You're like "are there are crazy creatures in this game?" "I don't know" and then you actually got into it. You're right. "There are crazy creatures in this game!" This is the grand reef right? Where these things are? And then somewhere, there's holes to go down further. I'm seeing electricity Is that electricity? That's a wreck Oooo ooo ooooo Wait is that the one I went to? I don't fucking know anymore I don't know where I am Stop it music you're freaky. Um wait what depth are we at? 194 okay Sally can go down a bit more, look at my baby's growing! Te he Imma proud dad So cool so so cool I fucking hope so that's where I left them Moon pool fragments What are you? You just quartz? okay You are just quartz Is this the one I came to? Nope cuz this isn't harvested yet, what are you? Cyclops depth module Oh, baby a triple! What are all these things? Scanner room fragment, I have that. thermal plant, I have that. membrane tree! scan him! don't have one of those! Okay you have a lot of talk on you, and I am on the clock right now So I'll come back to you in a little bit Okay, Imma bring Sally all the way down here Because I can and she's going to be my rescue if I ever need to get out in a jiffy just remember Sally is the yellow one Sally is not Henry me remember that this time yet fucking gone doogal This is another part of the thermal plant fragment isn't it yep? Okay, I don't think this place is of any use to me. Don't get shocked okay Anything do I have you I'm pretty sure I have you I did not Oh and the grappling arm fragment or the grappling arm upgrade is one of the more important ones for that because That saved my ass getting around the place Not just because it got me out of danger. I think it just saves so much time when you can grapple everywhere Otherwise getting around to the prown suit is the most tedious thing in the planet oh, no this was the ship that caused me issues Cuz I remember cutting through this door like five times And when you have to do that- What are you? Have you already don't I yeah? When you need to cut through the thing like five times you start wasting all your oxygen trying to stay alive So it was just annoying Oh god where am I? Okay, I just got you PDA "Torgal Corporation is a long-standing, family-run clan that operates almost a dozen mining and trading operations. The company share price hit an all-time high on the announcement by a Mongolian cabal of their intention to construct a new phasegate utilizing Torgal materials. These plans were put on hold when Bart Torgal, the intended leader of the new mining operation, disappeared along with his father roughly a decade ago." A decade ago?! So they were on that fucking island since a decade ago?! yeah, tho- those people by the way, the people in the The abandoned base that I was just in, they're not like part of the Aurora ship They're not part of my mission. They- they came long, long before me Um... Just make sure I got everything, can I open you? No. okay time to head out. Not yet Cyclops docking repair module That's new isn't it? Oh, shit how do I get out? How do I get out? I can't remember how I got in. okay down here. Oh god That's the scariest part. When you can't find your way back out again Okay Maria and coming home wait a sec Okay, Maria, I'm coming home. a repair module for the Cyclops For like the actual Bay so when I bring my thing back in here it not only charges it but repairs it That'll be pretty cool. It tells you how long ago how long they are to grow Neato burrito okay now we are definitely heading back to Henry because I need to I have some upgrades that I want to see if I can build some stuff for the Cyclops Upgrade modules depth modules that kind of stuff and also that repair Bay Might be a pain in the ass to go repair or that or not repaired by farm all that shit, but what are you gonna so? Sorry! Geez! I'm not even hitting anything you hit the smallest fish That sounds like a nuclear wars going off inside you. Hey reefies! I wonder if this still work, okay? I want to get close enough this used to be like a little Easter egg thing I did it before Okay shh Okay you've already made your noise, let's see Don't know sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't Okay that was just coincidental, and that's the thing I don't know if it ever actually was an easter egg That's just floating. I never knew if it was an actual Easter egg that they responded or if that was just a If there was just a coincidental thing like people pressed it, and then they respond. I was like they respond God I hit a fish oh Wait shit is this the sand dunes This is the sand dunes. That is a motherfucking reaper right there? Oh? Peace no no no no go away. No Good good good fuck Okay exits camera easy Gemma. Oh wait are we played? Okay emergency speed I'm out I'm out. I'm out Am I am I breached is this the thing that I should be fixing repair to repair tool The glass is fucking leak and I don't like that that means it's not fully repaired Okay, just go just go back to Henry back to Henry we go Okay, have a bit of Health gone But it's not letting me repair the crack. I don't know what to do. Hey Henry. How you doing buddy? Doing good? Everybody everybody good. Everybody happy. There's my one-legged moon pool okay, let's Let's pause you right here for a second in Today is he or she not fix any of you am I doing is that just gonna stay there Or is there a hole somewhere else so they can fix Because that's what used to happen Hey Sally It used to be a thing where holes would just prop up and then you'd fix them and it would fix the whole ship But maybe it doesn't work like that anymore. Oh wait wait wait. I need to take Sally out You see if there's any upgrades I can build Those a successful adventure, ooh Nice okay use planter they could put Two more in and then just eat these Okay because that's fully grown I'm gonna take that one out and eat this Sweet Whoo very very good very good very proud of myself Very proud of our adventures everybody that's you included we all did this Okay you go for one bed to another Thanks feels good to be back now. Let's see if any more stuff propped up that I can build On sook rappeling arm and promise you drill arm seamoth modules, okay, so maybe Maybe the other stuff. Then is in here here we go Depth module mark two, I need mark one first, ooh They can make it thermo blades or why not wait where do we get mark one? There's no place to make a cyclops module mark one It says I need that Where do I build that? Either way I need nickel ore which I don't have I don't need kyanite and kyanite I know exactly where to get kyanite down in the freaking lava. Isn't it? Gosh dang it All right well I'm thoroughly confused whoo here. We go here. We go. I forgot I Forgot to give you your name base color Hell yeah name that will be black interior white I guess an exterior will be blue There you guys match Big Maria and mini-me yeah, I got a message didn't I what's this message say play Jesus Carrying high priority passages, I feel like I found that place already All under the life pods. I just found randomly as I was going to like the Aurora and stuff. Oh the fucker no Okay equipment I Don't think new I can make anything worth making It's the air system in the pipe and everything is such like basic level shit Having a stasis, rifle, I guess And did magnetite for that. I don't have magnetic oh Yeah, fluid intake would it be a good idea, but you know what Cindy I Need I I have a job to do first and that job is to be the world's greatest habitat builder no wrong buttons Endora crow bed can I put you in a corner somewhere? I? Don't just put you in the middle of the floor Nice So now I have to I need to go get some stuff off Maria and put it in there, so well, Maria I'll be making a bunch of them. I'll also have a spare back here, so whenever I come home I don't have to waste the ones that I get in Maria You know I mean it's called tactics I still have a bleeding hole in my fucking thing lantern tree Did you make one fruit Are you just a thing that stays and keeps making fruit, I'm okay with that I'm down with that that's pretty cool Drive me insane. I need to fix it so don't have some duct tape then it fix it up real nice I Think now that it says Sally When I get away from Maria it says Maria ha ha For anyone who's new here by the way the reason they call it Maria is not because just I like the name or anything It's because it's it was submarine sub-Maria That was that was the thing it was very very clever on my part I Need some bladder fissures to get the water in my body because I'm gonna die right I'm gonna head to lifepod 13 in a second But another very vital thing that I want to make inside Maria That's going to be another thing. That's the lifeblood of my whole game is a fabricator so If I have a fabricator on the move, then I could just come in here and build all the stuff. I want so if Per se I'm out at an island, and I start gettin thirsty And the only way to get water is to either go back to a water filtration system I've built, wonder if i could build one on Maria or Another idea is to go back to Henry to the fabricator, but now the fabricators here So if we just take the stuff in the storage on Henry and in fact if I oh I could make a radio here but with the radio here and take all the stuff out of storage on Henry I Technically never need Henry ever again. That's just the way things are Eat one of you and 4e two of you and plant three Measure twice cut once Where am I I'm all turned around have no idea where I am Maria I'll be back to you now in a second. Don't you worry oh, it's getting daytime nice I was gonna say I need to go to bed as well So boom boom boom, Nice Do I have any copper laying around I surely do There I can build my radio now on Maria Henry, I'm sorry okay? Wait can it oh you can't deconstruct that one you can't deconstruct any of these things Don't have room? Hell Yeah, I do Everybody Say goodbye to Henry Henry we have loved you Henry you are the best of us that water over there looks really really cool with the moon rule, but Henry we love you, buddy But for now our time must end Even though I'd be coming back here because my moon pool, and everything is here on my base technically here But I never ever need to go back into Henry ever again The sad day It's a sad day when you're in friends up and leave isn't it This shit is so cool as well the fact that you can just store your Seamoth in here or your prawn suit. It's cool shit Put all you guys in here Yeah Why do I have an acid mushroom? I don't know. The battery charger now is another thing I need to uninstall and bring up here and then radio put you right there This is all coming together I'm so proud all righty, and now I should have put the battery charger next to the battery charger Whatever you can go in the corner Efficiency of space is also a thing, but Other things I did Desk I can put you in nice Are we gonna dismantle this thing eventually but Little Jack could go with us little Sam And another thing I have oh not in here is my little Aurora ship And you go whoo capital Aurora ship why oh? I can't place that anywhere, but the base Well that fucking blows alright, so let's Kick it let's head on out. Where are we going? We are going this way? That's a thousand meters away Well whatever I wonder if there's any speed modules you can get for Sally She's a nimble Beast let's go through the tunnel Through the tunnel of love Sally through the tunnel of love look at that lovely lavender glow Aren't you happy I brought you out here Sally. Isn't it wonderful majestic whatever But you're only 175 meters down, and it's faster if I just go there in Sally and then come back Really think I've been here, but if not we might get some tantalizing lore details Now I'd already know what I'm doing next I didn't say I was gonna put the prawn suit Guess I need a lot of stuff for that I might dicken with the alien stuff then after this Really do need those depths modules though The depth modules are really really important because you can't progress the game unless you get the depth modules for all your gear The prong suit can go the deepest quite default out of all their vehicles that you get But it's still not enough to get to the the endgame zones. Yeah, what are you hate? You're shoving stuff shut your mouth oh? Hey courier the second mushroom forest It's a nice place. It's a good place. There's also an area around here that Wasn't so nice. That's not like a little girl screaming. There's an area around here that Think you can go down into and there's like a secret precursor alien vault and Then also it was the first place. I saw the electrical doodads and also the tree life is here Always gotta be near as a tree life Okay, I have not been to this one Whoa this is gigantic Holy balls Hey, do you have any scannable x' How did you guys get interrupted huh? He's got a big hole see this Hole was blown out which means something happened in here to get you out, but you had a fabricator. Yeah a little fabric a egg whatever Entry planetary atmosphere I create as the cherishes and sustainers of worlds give me this day my daily pleasures as I give to those who? Seek pleasures from me External temperature approaching critical levels Show me the path in life truth and love of mine is the power I am the one Universe plays with itself I am done playing as this bundle of flesh Well then I guess we knew what happened, but again this exploded from the inside out Maybe he was the Hulk maybe he Hulk busted his way out. That's my running theory Are you a thing are you just lithium oh? That lycium hanging out on top yeah there the air. This is the first place. I went that I ever saw these creatures And this was like way late into the series as well. I had never seen them before that although I think they weren't actually in the game Much before that I think they were added later on And they freaked me out. Also we have yet to find I did say the reef backs are my favorite big just in general because they've been there since the start And I just love how they sound oh they were the first creatures that I heard had like that And I just loved those sounds shit we're almost at our max depth This is where I went into prawn suit shit gets scary down there, man Let me tell you something for nothing, but we have yet to come across my second favorite creatures Which are almost my favorite creatures, which is the crab squids? So think some of them actually dwell down here and the only reason I like them so much is they look weird and They look scary, but the sounds they make are the best sound in the whole game And they did a really good job designing the sounds for them I have an angel singing in my ears. What the fuck is that??! What is that the ghost Leviathan Holy fuck Whoa that's cool have I seen one of them, did I see one of them in the lava zone Dude this music is baller god, they're fucking scary You're spazzing out there though he okay yours like all over the place This music going along with this is so cool Come back closer, so we can see here shiny shame does the shine turn offers it just cuz I'm far away from them Oh What am I doing tempting fate like this? but he doesn't have any like grab her hands on the front like the other Reaper to come up and like attack me I Want to follow him I want to see his glory shine And he seems to be swimming away instead of getting closer. Yeah, it is just cuz I'm far away Or. Are you luring me to my death? What sounds do you make? That's what I'm most curious about sounds are a big deal to me What's happening? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh God? Oh? This is a mistake wasn't it? Hi-hi big beautiful boy oh Are you are you coming are you coming forever oh? What's coming for me. Oh it's coming for me. Oh shit. Yeah, fuck okay? I didn't know if you're actually coming from me there for a minute. Oh my god. I'm at 49 health already Okay do not tempt fate fate will come back and bite you in your hairy ass oh But that was cool He was awesome! Okay, don't go too. Deep because I'll buckle my own fucking ship As soon as it got away from creatures. I need to get out and heal oh Man Yeah Well just an after saying. "Oh, there's no new creatures in the game. There's nothing left to scare me" boom Subnautica slaps you in the ass You're never safe around subnautica. It always has something up its sleeve That was so cool. Hey reef fees Alrighty, well I'm gonna leave this episode of subnautica here also great progress than this episode. We finally got to the island and God Pretty sure I got all the information. I need to get out of there. I will go back to the island eventually To get more stuff now. I just need to figure out The next episode is an annoying episode because I need to figure out how I get all these upgrade modules I need to figure out the stuff needed to make the prawn suit all that kind of stuff and that's all like farming type stuff, so More of it might not be huge progression But you know who knows maybe we'll find a place to go that we can see some cool shit cuz this episode I didn't think I was gonna see the ghost Leviathan that was pretty cool. I like that Anyway, thank you guys so much watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face Like a boss! And high fives all round Thank you guys and I'll see all you dudes In the next video! The only true constant in my life at this point is you Sally and also Maria, but mainly you Sally 
Hey, hey shh, hey come here! previously on Subnautica You ain't goin nowhere you overgrown hot dog. This land is mine This sea is mine! Whoa a Sea Emperor! I do wonder if i could kill one of them arhh I'ma get ya. ding-ding said the ref, the round is a go. No way. No way! I killed 'em Bow down bitches I am the king! *Whipish* Top of the morning to you laddies. My name is Jacksepticeye And welcome back to our adventure in the deep down under waters of subnautica We escaped the dungeon. Hell is now behind us and we are out into the open bright clear waters with our friends. A WARPER THATS NOT INTERSETING We still have a lot of stuff to try and kill. I might even try and kill one of you later on but you guys are my friends now See they don't care. they're good. They're bros he just went off to buy me a pack of gum which I really really appreciate but game's acting a little strange I don't know if because I start killing some of the creatures in it but when i come up here sally or cindy or suzy started give me the... the four one one, on the location that I was in again. Saying that there was deep fossilized remains down below us which, I've gotten already hey reefies So I don't know why she's telling me the same stuff again Uh I don't know what's going on with that hopefully I didn't break the game. I probably did So don't think you're supposed to kill these creatures but... somebody gave me very nice detailed instructions on where I could find some more cuddlefish So right now, that is my plan of attack, that is my plan of action I have the mushroom forest warp over here. So I'm heading over in that direction to try and figure out what's going on over there also the world keeps loading in all weirdly I think I might have broken the game I am not sure So I need to go over to the big bad tree over here. That's not, it isn't? Nope that's it. Look at her I keep thinking I hear reapers maybe it's cause their cries of damnation or stuck inside my head after I've murdered them all! Yeah, it's probably it. So I think I have to come over here and go inside the tree? I want to give me more cuttlefish, two cuttlefish is not enough Okay. Sally thank you very much *Mwah* appreciate ya.you'ra-you're a good bean but right now I have to go on my own. awhh... there's a section in here. grue cluster like despicable me. uwhh Its all... purple gross okay here, here, here, cuttlefish there you are! yay another one another little baby. Okay I need to think of a new name for them as well Right now we have Kevin and Karlee and i'm keeping with the "K" consonants so it has to be a name that starts with a "K" No, not cunt! We can't call a baby that. That's not right Ummm Kevin, Karlee I'll figure it out I'm ma rescue another baby while I'm out here I just want all the babies. I'm gonna go to the sand dunes. I'm gonna find this last cuttlefish if it's the last thing I do Doesn't really make any sense but I'm gonna do it. Watch these skills See how fast I can go. I wish Sally could go faster I want a speed upgrade for Sally. Owe god, that wasn't my fault. The tree did that. The tree was... stuck his arm out. Ah fuck Woohoo bye *Laugh* That's never gonna get old man. Its so much fun Anything got to do a wacky physics I love Right I need to find me a sinkhole. I don't know where it is. *Gasp* You're there all a long? I am so blind. You were just sitting right there What is wrong with me? I thought I had cuddle fish senses I'ma bad father guys. It's okay I can redeem myself. it's so nice to go around here and not have to worry about reapers people were also saying that they respawn. I don't think they do I think, I think once they're dead, they're dead Did you see how dead I'd deaded them? They're so dead Have I said dead enough? DEAD hey what's this shit! Owe Oh, oh, oh Ohhh! Dope! It's been 47 years since I've seen the sunshine It's nice to see it again See this is what I like. This area all kind of green and then you turn to the right and it's all kind of blue That type of lighting is really nice man I like that lighting I want that lighting for my house please Ooohh Fuck yeah. Look at me go Oh look at me go! The best! Seamoth pilot. This game is... I think I do have a horn here somewhere, is this it? Oh christ! Ummm My bad. beep beep Henry! Henry! Henry! The particle son has returned I am... o, ohh, oooh Who's making a lot of noise here? Hey! Hey, get out of my house. swim away Thats...Ah fuck *Cough cough cough* Ooh god, not only is it noxious, it smells bad but it's bad for me Hi I'm home. Wait its honey I'm home. Not hi I'm home I'm not a home That's not what I was trying to say, anyway into this place we go Hello my babies umm Right now, I have more babies, two babies in here so I'm gonna drop you little babies in here, now, for now we don't have any names for you yet And Kevin and Karelee are outside and we still have time for them to adjust They're still not... altogether with it If you know what I'm... if you know what... I'm saying So I'm gonna leave you guys in there for a while and when you are born I'm gonna let you guys maybe, you know, get to know each other in there a small bit Maybe make some more little cuddle babies. I don't know if that's actually what you can do but I want a whole army of babies Imagine how terrifying that would be All right it's about time I organized all this shit Because it's getting a bit ridiculous at this stage so what I'm gonna put in here is... mmm a... I-I don't know... rocks Crystallized sulfur is kind of a rock that's just sitting there, you know... Ummm this one is going to be... Metals? Maybe you should give them a better name like resources or something like that Now you know why I haven't organized yet. I don't want to and it sucks Okay, there you go salty boys look at that, as if there wasn't enough salt in the ocean already There we go, Rock Metal like the name of that just because it sounds like music and that's my favorite genre is rock metal Hell yeah, I love it when a plan comes together umm See the problem with this is that once I start organizing them, some of the lockers that are gonna end up being empty because I can't just stuff everything in everywhere you know? Lifes hard all-round Over on this side then are any of you guys empty? Oh my god, more fucking rock metals Okay rock metal, there you go you're gonna be that one as well. Are you almost empty? not really So you are going to be... ion cubes That's your new name. I hope you use it well. I hope you like that name, I gave it to you Y-you better like it um There's a better way of doing all this, isn't there? Well see these things I don't really care about like, okay, let's call this one electronicsss Electronic, can't put in anything else. That's good. whatever Umm it's when it starts spilling over into more than one locker that starts pissing me off though because I like everything being everything to be cleeean fire extinguisher is not really a electronics But it's going in there anyway because it's my home and I can do whatever the fuck I want okay salt ... I don't need no salty boys okay, you need to just get out of here sir Can I plant a deep shroom Plant more of these it's looking good. it's looking nice. I had an extra scanner runes, scanner runes scanner room range upgrade, that I can just stick in there. People said they stack so... guess we're gonna find out if that's true Umm, I'm almost finished with my lockers. I have rock metal, rock metal Umm rock metal, probably should move you guys around *Sigh* I already did all this. This is materials so this is like glass, rubber, fiber mesh polyana links. I didn't where the fuck to put that. ummm Consumables, that's where like water and food are gonna go. You are going to be... you're gonna be miscellaneous So everything and anything goes in you ummm just, like tom's sister. hahaha she died?! *whisper* my bad.. fuck okay Pretty good everything is organized. Everything has names. Everything good good good We can change it around as time, later on. do?... change? *Laugh* I can't fuckin' speak for this episode! All I want to do is make good things I just want to be a real boy ummm okay, do I have to assign you to a thing? then put the... fuckin, these items man! Why do, why? Why does it allow me to change items and shit? There we go, I have a cap so proud of that cap That's the best cap, I love that cap ummm and I have a poster that I can put down here I want to open up my favorite posters of the things that I love back home. You know? when you get stranded on a..on a...big planet like this then you're like. oh I miss home. W-what can I put up here? Oh I know. favorite video game of all time natural selection And then next to that because I miss home so much I could put up my picture of the aurora that's... actually just over there and it's crashed I-I don't need a picture of the aurora right, its-Its over there it's You get it. Did my babies hatch yet? Nooo but soooon Soon you will grow into giant babies and I will love you forever *Cough cough* Not enough space to sit, not enough space to sit. Are you saying I'm fat fucking game. I'll show you who's fat I'll show you who fat when I take apart this chair and put it down again That'll show ya. okay, I'll put you... There then? Is that enough? Ah look I can sit down now, but how am I supposed to grab my tea or my coffee or something? I'm like four yards away from the freakin thing stupid... It looks stupid as well. You know what? just putting down in the chair whatever way I like Why you allow me to put it here if I'm not allowed to sit in it That's the real travesty of this game Only let me put them down if they're far enough away. Now you're not even telling me that I can't sit you're just... sitting there taunting me I don't even need to sit I'll just stand and look outside Oh it's beautiful. Got me a bunch of glass so now I want to figure out where to put it all There's one right there. it's not telling me stuff anymore, like oh your building is about to collapse. please don't die It's just being like, yeah we can put that in, that's no problem. ooo a little glass right there hole strength is now six. okay, thank you. At least you're telling me something *singing* lots of glass everywhere I want my place look cool where else can I.. put some glass. Can I put it on this? No you can't.. cause it's already made of glass *end singing* Can I put it over here? ooooOOO a little windy Hello I'm in here I'ma put windows everywhere umm I don't know what kind of window I built here Did I discover the secrets of space travel? What is happening to my window? Why is it like that? What's going on? Are you not, are you not fully finished? oooOh,ho-oh oh! Aw, I kind of liked it the other way. It made it feel all cool, it was all space and sci-fi like Okay, lots of windows everywhere in here now. look at that! feels all open Just, don't come in here naked cause everyone can see what even is this room anymore? This room is just like a waste of time now. I didn't do anything with it. there's nothing here Mean looks cool look...360... but It could be better should I make my bedroom two stories? I don't know, I don't know if I should, as I start already doing it I'm gonna add another floor up above Cause I think that's gonna be awesome. Thank you. Umm, oh I need a ladder Oooh, I need a titanium. Its okay I have two. I remember having two should have just got more when I was out What are you gonna do? You go out and you get eggs and milk and then you come home and you realize you forgot the bread That's just the way it is but it's okay because I have an organized filing system now cause I just go rock/metal Oh of course there is titanium in there, it's in my rock/metal section It's kind of confusing to people who come in for the first time cause they're like oh I want to listen to some music, i'm gonna go to the rock metal locker easy-easy mistake to make. Uh probably my fault actually, but... shut up umm right yes, problem Mister bed, you're gonna have to come out of there Oh, my picture frame I'ma put you up again, don't worry boom then we put the ladder... Here. Ha, ha, ha, haaa upstairs is where the bedroom I, umm. Can I put another plant wall up? ooo I can. ooo I can very very, nice nice I'm liking this umm And then the bed is going to go.... right What? That's stupid Why would anyone do that? What. It's just in the middle of the room This is cool though. This would be a fucking bad-ass room. Don't I...? Okay. Okay, we're gonna fix this because what I'm gonna do is put a... can't... put it...

Alright, there we go, look at my family So cute Hope you guys are all nice to each other, by the way it would be so cool if you guys like proliferated Or you did something else besides swim around and let me throw crackers for ya Maybe in a future update you guys will actually be able to do things then we can dominate this planet together I'm doin pretty good at my own though. I've already like killed everything so Domination would be outside this crater. dead zone think about it. I need to go find the dead zone again Need to go to the dead zone and I need to see if I can scan some adult ghosts leviathans As of now I have only been scanning the baby ones. That's not- well killing them as well Shooosh, don't tell- don't tell any of the adult ones Actually there's only two baby ones in the whole game There's one off over by here the blood kelp zone and then there's one all the way down in the lost river put them what do you get? a big old loser. so I need to go down into... the actual deep down dark deep down let that pussy, deep down dark deep down where I can actually survive. I'm talking about the water where nothing survives for everything's dead they even call it the dead zone the deep down dark deep dead honk honk We are very fortunate that our ship crash-landed in the crater Of all places like the aurora actually landed kind of on land surrounded by sand sand land, land sand uhh, just coming over here makes me feel uncomfortable Makes me all I curl up because I know what's down here now shut up oh, I hear another reaper Okay, let's try and avoid that cause I don't want to actually get near a reaper We need to get near the other boys Even though I don't know if I can go down there. See my plan is to take out my stasis rifle And try to and get them that way but I'm probably gonna die. I'm probably not gonna be able to do this I'm just gonna try. Try or die that's basically what this is And Sally can't really go all the way down to them, I don't think. oh, it's so gross Okay yeah, you can go to 900. You-you should be okay I need ta. I need to arrange my things You be in two. You be in three just in case and you be in four oh ho ho oh I don't like it Being down here, what do these fuckers feed on? whoa ho ho, I don't like the darkness *Whisper* This fuckin sucks All right here we go no no no no no. Take out the right one! You fuck! Ooh shit, oh shit, oh shit well I'm gonna fucking die Took out the wrong thing Can I even hit you? I can! oh, fuck yeah Okay, no wrong one. Ghost leviathan, scan scan scan scan scan scan scan scan there's going to be more Okay okay Okay okay, nope nope Nope, nope, nope I'm out! I'm out. I'm out. I really wish I could look behind me. Ah, fuck! I don't like it I don't like it. You only have 20 health left please don't chase me, please don't chase me oh god, oh god, hopefully this works Ooh god I'm trying to-Ooh please I'm trying to wait to use my perimeter defense system. Didn't work, I don't know Fuck! Sally! I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am. Aaaahhhhh I don't like it! Okay okay, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna do this. We're gonna do this uhh I don't know what else to do. This creature is approaching the size limit for sustainable... ohhhh nooo I want to read it organic life-forms and has been designated leviathan class adults... of this species have been encountered exclusively around the edges of the volcanic crater Which supports life on this part of the planet and react with extreme aggression on approach Oh god, i need-this is the only way I can do this without dying kurtal a cartilaginous extensions of the creatures skull form a hammerhead which protects the ghost leviathan as it performs devastating ramming attacks okay, while fully capable of tearing through the flesh of any creature in range. I'm down to fuckin 20 health all evidence indicates that mature ghost leviathans feed on microscopic life forms in the waters around the edges of the inhabited zone they're vicious attacks on interlopers to their domain are not predatory in nature but territorial a creature so vast requires a huge expanse of water to satisfy its daily calorie requirements Oh god its muscled interior body is surrounded by a translucent outer membrane suggesting adaption for deep low light environments when threatened it can ten- it can tense its entire body before lashing out with incredible speed life cycle: a probable migratory behavior this specimen was likely born far from the area where it was encountered extreme threat avoid the crater edge Okay, we did it. I'm ready to die now. Cause I want to go back to my save file where.. Sally is still alive! Oh its still scary okay, last save six minutes ago. Yeah, that's fine *Laugh* Take me away Oooh, at least we got to read it Umm it's not gonna stay with us But we got the knowledge. All I know is that they are terrifying and you have to stay away forever and ever and always. Good okay, well thank you guys so much watching this episode.

(Whoopsh!~) Top of the morning to ya laddies my name is jacksepticeye and welcome to a demo of a game called "Once Upon a Coma"! This is a game being made by the same guy, if you remember the game. "Pinstripe" that I played, the game that I was in, I did a voice for that game. And I streamed it and did the whole game in one sitting and loved it It was an amazing game, and I got to work with a very nice man called Thomas Brush on the game And this is his new project that he's making It's it's a brand new game that he's coming up with and I'm apparently in this one as well apparently I have a character. But we'll get to that in a second. But this is a new game that he's trying to kick start and get crowdfunded as well. And he's just such a nice genuine dude, and I want to just I wish nothing but the best for him. So I want to play his games, and I want him to do well. And I want him to succeed so this is his new thing Again, this is just a demo for it the full game will be out whenever it's out! I don't know the release date for it yet, but I'm excited to play it it looks really cool. The artstyle as always,  the stuff he makes the artstyle is always super nice and the music is always super nice. Yeah! Hey there I am! God I'm super cute! I mean this freaking house is terrifying, so I don't know much about the game like the story and that kind of stuff. But it's it's very very intriguing. It's definitely reminiscent of the artstyle that he had for Pinstripe I like my little walk cycle.. Hello I don't know what that did okay? It's very cozy. Why am I like the size of the flames in the fire? This place is gigantic! [baby crying] Do not like that sound Z ah z is to jump. Oh okay that makes a lot of sense I was Wondern' why I couldn't jump before ring-ring on the telephone hello Hello? Time to wake up sleepyhead... Okay. I have no idea what I'm doing.. This is a lot creepier than I expected me. Oh god. What's behind the curtains? so am I in a coma then? and this is all happening oh okay, so there's a sequence to it? Maybe or maybe they just don't open let me let me explore around a bit first, and we figure out what's actually going on It's so weird to see a version of yourself in video games, it's awesome Perfect Pete bashed his skull and bled upon his baby doll Why would you cross stitch this? Oh yeah coma Oh shit? okay time is going backwards Not sure how I feel at all god, there's a ghost at the window Okay stuff is starting to get weird Is that good okay, that one's good oh god fucking weird stop go away Believe That's written in blood ehh this one was good, right? So D E I did A last time D E B A Oh God Oh god oh Jesus Okay, I did not know the game is gonna have spooks and shit in it ehh It's weird creeping me out with the baby crying in the background Wait is this the same yeah now can I go down? ohh kay Oh I can't move I'm just gonna assume that that's good that that's very good. Let's play some piano Wow I actually can Okay, I'm guessing I need to figure out some sort of password mechanism thingy. Oh! I didn't think I would go further there for a second A mirror you look super sexy I mean I wasn't gonna say it game, but it's right there proof is right there It's in text its legitimized in a video game now that means it has to be true Look at that beautiful green hair. I don't have it anymore, but Inside I'm still the green boy. Okay inside and still the green bean. This is just a cover up You do really do look stunning Congrats Oh Thomas Wait no gah oh, yeah Whoa okay, um this kind of reminds me of the ending to pinstripe actually there was a bed inside the house Reddington Park, oh, it's beautiful out here Let's just say out here forever and never go inside ever again. Ah this is delightful inside was horrifying dude whole town to explore Well, maybe these are all locked Oh. Oh hi other person locked Locked as they probably should be you shouldn't really be able to just walk into people's houses never mind Occam's Barberi I Get it Occam's razor Occam's Barberie. That's clever BAC Is that the the key to the piano Missus is written on the mirror read BAC Heat don't forget about our favorite place Lily Seems important, okay, I'll go back and try your BAC eventually So if I am in a coma then are these all just like memories of places that I've been to or that I know This music is lovely also, I like your drawing of shit The only time that you can actually say hey, you're drawing shit, and then be like thank you. Yes, it is Haha, I can't believe it's actually you Pete What you think about my painting? It's a portrait of you Nice! You really got my whole aesthetic down Look at that beautiful color one day.

I've been doing a lot of like snowboarding and skiing and all that kind of stuff in Steep But not for long tiiiimeeee on bike I'm a sexy biker boy Yes, yes, give me leather jacket. Please. Let me be part of all the groups. That's okay. I'm I'm, I'm hurt. Woohoo! The Highlands. Know them well. It's where all me family grew up Are those bales of hay just coming down the side of the mountains? As they always did in Ireland. Bales of hay, which just rolled down next to all the sheep. And you'd have to dodge them as you were running through the fields as a wee little lad Okay, so I don't know really what I have to do. Get two near misses okay, that seems like something do-able *bang* oho! That should count as a near miss right? I - I near missed death just now okay, just go over that easily WOOO! Yeah! Okay, nothing too hectic so far. That's fine. I can handle that yes. Yes YESSSS FUCKING SICK!!! Okay, oh OOOOOOOOH Shit I'm running out of lives, I only have four lives guys! I'm better than most people. Most people only have one, but I have four So this is an early access game so a lot of stuff in it isn't finished yet But it's really fun! The soundtrack and the feel and everything of it so far are really good. Oh god. I went oh I went sideways. Oh Jesus Okay, I haven't near missed anything I haven't even found anything to near miss, and the end is right here There's one... Oh? I finished anyway. I don't need to do that. Oh God. Where do I want to go? Do I want to go into the Mellow Curvy I thought that said Mellow Curry the Mellow Race or the steep straight stunts? Steep straight stunts. I don't want to be in a mellow curry. I only like very hyperactive curry. All right herpy berp. Let's fucking do this. We're not gonna get attacked by bales of hay again are we? Woohoo Ah, fuck! Aaahaha My bones! and organs! Right we only have to stay in the air for five seconds Well you're just straight-up dead now. Ahh, *chuckle* rekt thats... Whenever I die I'm gonna have that put on my *hehe* my tombstone. It'll just say REKT Oh, no! Now it's steep curvy stunts. I wasn't even able to do steep straight stunts aw man Though I am quite curvy especially around the hips so I can do this. This is no problem Then a top speed of that okay, that's easy I'm about to get that right now. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Am I near it? Come on, I must be near that top speed by now. No. I'm not I'm only going I'm only going 50. We need to be going much faster than this Speed is key and all that shit Woooo! Throw in a backflip here and there. Life thought about throwing in little things here and there spice things up a bit! You know regular bike riding just doesn't do it for me anymore. I need some spice in my Curvy curry my spicy curvy, curry whoa whoa? That's unfair now. That came- That came out of nowhere. Okay, pedal pedal strong legs big boy Fuck Okay, that didn't take a life off me which is good But re-reach the top speed reach a top speed now go go go Go go go yes you're a slow ass I asked for a speedy boy Not this slow piece of garbage who gave me this snail of a man Okay. from there I can go out to the vine mellow straight stunts or a basic setup Basic setup, I'm as basic as they come. give it to me. I can do this This is no problem watch me go. UUH don't do ho ho balance on that back wheel Just like I used to do back in bike College Everyone used to call me the Mean Machine biking green I had a different hair color back then *bink* *bonk* Duff- Haahahaha! Ehehahaha! He won the race, but at what cost Oh Fuckin god. She fucking dead. Alright this one We can do this one's just a mellow stunts and all I need to do is get a top speed again Okay, turn it turn it turn it get back on track back on track. You can get off track every now and then It's good. It opens you up to new possibilities, but you have to get back on track later on okay, all right Watch out for the bales!! Jesus I'm lucky I grew up in Ireland. If I didn't grow up in Ireland I don't know how I'd be able to deal with bales of hay coming down the side of a hill You know I mean? Know what I'm saying? Wooeeeeeeeeeee!!! Fuck Is there a doctor in the building I think I'm gonna need a mortician Actually, okay slow it on down Getting up in the air is great, but he's not a superhero He doesn't got legs of Steel like your main man Jack here. All he- all he's got are little weak, baby chopsticks, so we gotta we gotta take him easy We can't let him go too fast or he' gonna breakin' all his bones and dying. steep curvy curvy stunts or steep straight stunts Um Let's go for curvy stunts Something I like to do. it's what I call hula hooping. curvy stunts.

BAE Or should I say hay bale? *a joke for today with jackcepticeye* And I'm doing wheelies You know you know I found a wheelies game I'll give you that one that was not the cleanest that could have been a lot cleaner This is just a nice little bike ride through the countryside let you see my house over there This is great Very unrealistic though. I haven't seen any sheep yet There's a lot more sheep out in the highlands. I know out there behind all their movers Okay, I don't know why I'm not getting any clean landings. It's fine. I Don't need I don't need any clean Lando's. I like my Lando Calrissian is dirty All right on to the basic setup *Jackaboy dances* We got this I can do this this time. Oh, let's do survive the boss jump You know your boys got this powder bales that make you lose more health, so we'll have your balls actually Backflip the boss job, and now you're speaking my language before I didn't know it all these like clean landings and so for but backflipping a boss jump I Do that all the time oh god wait am I down here now? It's okay. It's okay back on track back on track. There's a Massey Ferguson track They're great. They can pull money bales of hay you guys ready to backflip the boss jump I sure am YEAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Into the railing into the railing please all I wanted was a railing smash Okay, I got some more health that's good. We're in the forest finish low letting go of acceleration okay? Okay, you got it. You got it. Oh God, but I can't do that Oh Jesus, oh, that's a lot of air. I'm afraid of heights. You can do it Well this parts nice ah Delightful delightful watch out for the tree watch out for that tree watch out for that tree. Cut there's a lot of trees That you guys know the forests were full of trees. I didn't until now well now I do Nice do it do it do it hit the railing? Stop being all gentle and shit This one's just called steep in This one they actually kick you out of this game and to make you play Ubisoft steep game And you have the wingsuit down finish without breaking okay, I'm gonna need some specificity in this FUUUCK AAAAHHHHHHH Oh see that's what I wanted to know is It okay is it finished without breaking like with my brakes or finish without breaking any bones. Oh it was Ah Guys Didn't have to erect the statue in my honor I mean, I know I'm amazing and they put up a sign next when it said number one curves Thanks, I'm working on them, you know uh number two Hill Bom Well, yeah, Jeffrey has a better Hill bomb than I do so that's understandable all right. Well. I'm gonna leave this episode of Descenders here food and game. I like it a lot. I'm not sure if I agree with the whole system of Going down the hills and then unlocking the thing after three attempts or getting a shortcut to it Cuz it's and then like using lights to get there. It's a bit weird It's kind of like road redemption in that regard Maybe that's what they're going for maybe it's supposed to be like a spiritual successor to another game That was like this years ago. I have no idea, but I would like to see I'd like to see more modes I won't like in like a trials fusion type of mode we have to like Bale as far as you can I want I want a Mode where I can fly off my bike and see how far I can land ahead and stuff like that that Stuff's always fun really fun time but for now thank you guys so much watching this episode if you liked it PUNCH the like button in the face like A BOSS!! and high fives all around *WAHPOOSH* *WAHPOOSH* Thank you guys now. I'll see all you dudes IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!!!! :D *Outro Starts* (English subtitles done by a lot of people) Excuse me has anyone seen my voice 
Ahh *little boy voice* Ahh Aha previously on, Subnatica Here, here cuddle fish! There you are! *gasp* You were there all along! There we go. I have a cap. (But it's a nice cap) Hey look, my new babies are born. It's a new baby brother and sister! Say hello to Clint and Clara! Kevin, Carly, Clint and Clara. *Whip crack* Top of the mornin' to ya laddies, my name is Jacksepticeye and welcome back to Subnautious! We have Kevin, Carly, Clint and Clara. All together, that's a household and a half! You know I've never had this many kids before. Never had any kids before, but now I feel blessed. I feel blessed with my glorious children that drop my frame rates. Aw My frame rates are dropping like I did you when you were born! That, that causes some explanations doesn't it? (uh wut jack) (Yes wut indeed) Anyway, I want to build some more stuff onto my base. (Yay more base building) Right now. I'm gonna do it. You can't stop me. I want to build an observatory. Haven't built one yet. I... Well, I did, but I didn't actually build another one that's actually on my base. That's not what I mean. Underwater! I don't know what I'm sayin'. I need to concentrate. What do we need for it? I need some glass. Some enameled glass and some titanium. Well, just- Thanks. Gettin' out again though. Because I realized that I think I dropped. The base. *wild rave* Didn't drop anything. I'm a goddamn filthy liar. (That in itself is a lie) I put some stuff somewhere. And I'm not telling. It's a bag of cocaine, and it's up my bum. Haha! Shit, I told people. (Dammit Jack) Materials... Is it in here? Okay, I have one enameled glass... E E E *laughing like count from sesame street* Two... Enameled- Yeah, there we go. And then... rock metal. Should have some quartz for me. There we go. And then I can make another enameled glass. Do I have any...titamonium? No, I don't think I have any ti-ti-titanium lying around. I really wish I did. What do I have in my inventory that I need to get rid of? Copper wire... You can go into materials, even though you're kind of a rock metal, but not really... Um... Okay, apparently I had a quartz. I dunno what's goin' on. I also have an ass load of salt as I always do... That's just from my time playing this game. Ha, ha, I'm a salty boy. So, with this I always have to... Chop real nice, and then gobble, gobble, gobble! I'm a turkey! So, normally, what I do here is I just dump the salt like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah You know, like "Oh, salt laying around," but I have a fun new game that I like to call... SALT BALLLL!! Put it up on screen! Salt ball! it's a new game that I invented. It's my game! What you have to do is aim at other things with the salt, and then you... PUU-HOOM! Awww, almost. All right watch, watch. Line it up, line it up. That's not gonna work. Okay, it works much better when the salt floats This isn't really working. Oh! Either side! Almost, last chance, last chance. We have to hit farty-arse. Damn it. Anyway, that's my sport. Salt Ball! Patent pending. I also, may change the name so whatever I change it to patent pending on that too. I think I'm gonna do some home maintenance. Here. Gonna get rid of that hatch This This is where genius really starts to diverge, okay? (K then) um Just realized I might not have enough titanium for this so, I'm, it's a work in progress... Things are going to happen as they happen. I saw you move Sally, can't hide from me! Can I join these bad boys? Why would you why won't you just let me do? You guys will join right? No Aw, they will! Hahahahaa! (Mission accomplished) All right now we have ourselves a partay that's not what I actually intended on doing, but that's fine Okay, okay, I'ma go get some more titanium. You hold on you hol-sit tight stay there. I'll be back Don't go anywhe- Kevin, Carly, Clint and Clara. You look after the place, okay? I just daddy just needs some titanium. Just a small bit just a liddoo iddoo biddoo!! Very good very very good Why didn't I do that from the start that is actually exactly what I had done from the start isn't it? Oh, no, I had it connected up there, didn't have you connected down here ta'll a ta'll My life is not only flashing before my eyes, but a better version of it is flashing before my eyes, okay Even better again, why have three when man can have four We should have never gone to the moon we should have just stayed down here making sweet sexy awesome hatches with John Locke (I have several questions) Oh Spacious I really like this. I am having a fantastic time. Now I need to put a ladd-ay in Cool, so that means that I can remove you Yes, nice thank you, and I can actually also let me out Baby want out! Also remove I can't remove you... hominee hominee hoo hoo shiiet Okay, okay alright, I see that the gods are testing me I see now is a time of faith testing and I'm about to pass with swimmy swammy colours you see this shit. You see this shit that don't work. Oh Me I wasn't doing anything I didn't say this would work. I just thought it would. Hold on a minute. Can I just? Why the-- Why was I not doin' that before? This looks much better everything's connected now properly. I know why I'm yelling Is that good? Oh I think that's a good righty, righty Okie dokie What do I want to put here then? I like that everything is glass. I like that I have a glass thing going on. I also don't like that. It's nighttime Don't worry. We will get to some stuff in this episode. I am going to do a thing ahh Sleep in my bed. That's big enough for four of me But I deserve that I deserve a bed that's big enough for for me for one of me because I'm awesome I also wanted to put up more wall planters in here, right yes No, I love it when a plan come- So what if I used it before I'm using it again cuz it's a good one shut up So you want to kind of close off this now At all I don't need everyone to be able to get in through here Wow does that all look really nice? I? Think that that looks really nice Bit of a problem though, there's no um no hatch to get in now Don't know where to put that you can put it on the bottom No Wait how about it? How about on top? no. Don't know what I want, that's that's the size of the sign that you're allowed put in What? Need something like twice the size of that what is this a sign for ants Oh wait wait wait There we go there we go uh Right so I need I need to write something on this Umm What to write? As soon as you enter the base it's the first thing you see there, it says "Sup!" Suu dude My eyes okay, that's that's floating That's just straight floating I Like that I like that about my base floaty base. Well, that's a nice little bit of something doesn't it? It's not a whole lot, but it's nice. That's just like a bedroom upstairs aquarium right docking bay left that kind of stuff That's neat. I like that a lot. Okay. I'm going to go out and do what I intended to do a few minutes ago Which is excuse me. I need my batteries ah lot of titanium leftover um I Need to put some power sources back into you Back into you or three ion batteries now Sweet um I'll come back then and put signs in different places wait Let me just who's close off the fort here as I head out. Okay. Seal her up here nice nice We're heading off to kill some more creatures Sick floating around in this place fearing for my life Thanks, Cindy, Sally, Suzie, or whatever. Okay, bye my babies. I also need to be very careful that I do not drive into them as I'm going by But I'm going to kill The Batman no, I'm gonna kill some crab squids hey Heyyyy Reefies how you guys doing? I'm not gonna kill any of you you're too cute Jeffery ja wohl okay Jeffery I Was about to say a little bit too close to the ground there, buddy, but I guess hey hey be nice to each other I Guess you figured your way around that in the end after all, but good job Keep it up proud of you realize that I haven't gone under the island and display through so if anyone hasn't like seen this Haven't done it here It's so freaky the first time. I saw this was terrifying It kind of it kind of look like Metroid's all attached these are just floaters That are all attached to the island so the island would sink if these things weren't on them And you might have seen some of the other rocks lying around a little pink blobs on them the pink blobs are floaters So they keep things floating obviously, can I actually hit these rocks? Yes, I can geez so the all of these things are just keeping the island floating if some of these disappeared then the island would sink Be pretty cool. If you could actually do that in the game, but obviously you can't oh So weirds me out though cuz it's so foreign looking Was there a sea Emperor near here? Huh, I don't know let's go kill things so it's time for Jack to- oh God, what was that? Little crab dude time for Jack to shock back Yes, there's the holes we're looking for down into Zee blimey deep. Hey, broo  do do do do do make some sounds I want to hear you There you go Okay still a shithead come here Where you going? We going huh, you ain't goin fuckin nowhere imma get you Imma get you fire a little little bubble And then a big bubble o you gon die, oh you going die tonight, oh you going die tonight? What's up, no more shock attacks? Are you dead already is that you dead already, there's no way you're dead already You're dead already and you're  gonna sit there twitching? I Was hoping you'd put up some sort of a fight at least oh You're so weird. Okay. Go back down. Okay. Can't even affect you anymore Well isn't that disappointing I thought you guys were gonna be tough Cause you guys are made of TS tough stuff No made of plastic. I must save real quick cuz I want to know what happens if I attack a warper Can I actually attack one Okay, okay, I thought that that was them coming after me Do they do anything anymore even if I go and attack them oh Here more the crab squids it's so weird to not be afraid of anything anymore Now that I have I've done everything and I'm kind of just dicking around Okay, here's one. Here's one. Hello friend. Don't disappear before I get there don't disappear before I get there They just warp right out of it oh My god it can actually stasis my own vehicles. Oh, that's annoying actually Wow so can I even hit war purrs Whoa, I mean hitting them maybe What a dodge Where are they I want one I want a war What a war I want to stab them. I want to stab stab stab them. Here's one hi As soon as they show hostility they leave Maybe they're going to recruit more of their friends Okay, that was really creepy There was a crab squid right there But his head went through the ground and it looked like a horror movie like you see it in your peripheral vision. He just Disappeared and then you heard him So he's glitched under the ground but For the sake of the game that was really weird I also like how they blend in so these things kind of look like That's awesome he's technically underneath me. I think It's so creepy sounding surgery scan these things, I don't think I've see Anna I also fro two more creature eggs two more crab squid eggs anchor pods These unusual flora specimens have been Encountered exclusively on the deep reefs they consist of large spherical gas filled membrane anchored to the seafloor by its root system At these depths it is unlikely this structure is designed to enhance access to sunlight But rather the pods ability to propagate once the pods attain sufficient height They burst releasing spores, which contain which catch the currents and disperse around the local area Huh neat Daria's Hi big boy They just vanish when I get near them Maybe because they know that I am the law of the land now, and they're not scary anymore Uh-oh who is it? Who's here to say hello. It's Jack and he's gonna say bye-bye They keep going I want to do it again Boosh I love that they can't get discombobulated a small D but He's very he's like what the fuck oh Oh Yeah, I was just dicking around a small bit fuck oh No need to get all aggressive on my ass here stabby stabby Now you're dead All the time your mother told you to not fuck with humans And what did you do you went up and slap them in the face? Well I'm one slap face that will flap back So the game stops loading properly That's interesting Haven't broken the game in a while I'm technically under the ground isn't gonna fix the Fortran go through this - oh fuck me oh Just like a human birth It's very violent and there's lots of sparks a little sudden who a baby's born a baby Sally with a Jack inside Forgiving a baby with another baby inside So anything else single kill in this game my thumb big giant hole From Big Joe hauling ground Can explore I Thought this is one of the locations where the warp gates work Then you start exploring around now. I can go deep down into the dark deep down cave Choose me sorry my bad coming through Phoebe Wait I do have a horn somewhere Here we go baby seat riders What's up bubble boots These are underground Whoa I Don't know that that's where you originated seat Raiders path I'm but you at one point in this game If you haven't seen it from the very beginning there used to be Terraforming in this so you could just take apart pieces of the land as much as you want it You could just take away bubbles of land And then you could make your own land and you can make your own land masses and bases and everything it was crazy But as I said it broke the game, so they had to remove it Okay, okay, I'm gonna save this and I'm gonna try and kill one I Don't want to I feel horrible for it. It's not gonna be good But just for the sake of clarity I want to see what happens Okay you got poo. You don't have eggs. I want to see if they.. i should scan one of you did i not you before They sound awesome... sea treader a a vast pedal leviathan which Rome's reefs and herds grazing the seafloor. you're counted as a Leviathan? Antenna on the creatures head can detect a range of sense helping to sea treader to find fresh grazing pastures Avoid the path of large predators and sense chemical signals from others of their kind Aw that's cool thick armor protects the creature from attack by all but the largest of carnivores two legs extend from the rear Used to siphon up plant material from the seafloor and maintain balance so that front one is actually its nose It actually is a snout I thought it just looked like one Large herds would decimate the flora of a single area at thus encouraging the sea traders migratory behavior Families keep their young towards the center of the herd and parents will lash out at over curious interlopers in search of an easy meal sea treader herds mate on earth mineral deposits as they churn up the sand as you can see right here What are you doing? Are you?... are you Hurting Sally? What are you doing? I don't know what you're doing ok, let's see what happens Do anything to you, I don't think that did anything to you okay i'ma just stab away I can rose up Is this is this good for you, or you look like a fly on the front because I'm curious if you actually can die Or if you die do you fall over is everything else just floats to the bottom You sound scary Bubble but bubble bubble bubble but Bubble but I guess I can't kill her because this is thicker armor protects the creature from attacked by all, but the largest predators Okay, what about this? Whoa? I thought that was another one not right next to me Jesus Whoa see treaders are beast I speak your language, too Haha, oh wait We don't want you here Yeah shoot away. Oh You guys are cute. I'm glad. I can't kill you If I can I gave up pretty easily because I'm Saddened by the thought of trying to stab you to death really wish there was another Creature to discover like I wish I was going through the game I wish there was a creature in the game that they hadn't announced or said was even in it Or was anywhere any place at all? There he is I'm not gonna go kill him cuz it just takes too long But it'd be awesome if I was just going through the game again. Hey Refi and Like down in the dead zone. There was something more than adult ghosts leviathans. It was like a new secret creature That those who were inquisitive went to fight I could join Kraken or something. Oh, sorry So that eventually you were just going along and you were like oh I haven't seen this area before something like that and they're all of sudden a giant massive Creature that you had never seen before Though fuck going your shit heads I was admiring the sea Emperor that was up there So awesome that they just fly around now What happens if the Reaper gets close to it Here's a pretty damn close to each other right now Reaps You wanna come out tussle hohohoho? haha! Jesus you're cool It feels good to be home look at my kids all out playing I need to take a white berth around this area you know because if I come in too hot they're gonna slam right into me I Really, don't want to kill them by accident. That would heartbreak me It's okay because I got some new Got some new dudes from a fish pool also known as the aquarium um Don't have the materials It's okay go into slot two to build a hatch by any chance I did No power?? What a crock of shit! oh wait no. I had I had a battery oh There we go I had a spare battery in my inventory There we go jesus.. And in to this new special area Goes my new babies! Welcome to the family guys we're a bunch of bosses around here we kick ass That's what we do so I'm gonna leave those ones in there with the other guy And I'm hoping that they make more babies, and I just have a whole aquarium full of crab squids cause' that would be doooooppppee But for now it's time for me to head to the land of dreamy sleepy nighty snoozy snooze. We're gonna head upstairs I really wish there was a thing in the game where you had blinds And you could come in and flick a switch and all the blinds came down automatically and then you just went *yawns* thats kinda cool Iookin. Need to add more lights in this place   
*WAPSH* Top of the morning to ya laddies, my name is jacksepticeye, and welcome to Disassembly 3D, The Ultimate Stereoscopic Destruction Game! This is a really cool game. I found it on Steam and it's a... You get all these objects like an engine or a car or a phone or (some secrets that I'm gonna leave for the actual video), but you're able to take apart piece by piece, like take off all the little bits and pieces off a car, and then watch the whole thing fall apart. It's really fascinating. There's not a whole lot to it. Just disassembling things. But then, if you disassemble the entire thing you get a bomb and you can blow up the whole thing then later. It's cool. So you get all these different things like a side table, a lamp, a speaker, a pocket knife, microscope, antique car. Let's star off with something simple so we get the basis of it. A speaker! for the... for the audiophile that I am. You've all these different things... They have a 3D mode where you can see different versions of 3D, but the default is like wiggle, which is supposed to be like that... Have you ever seen any of those gifs where they wiggle and it looks like it actually has depth to it, and it kinda freaks you out. It's kind of freaky, guys, not gonna lie. So this thing has 48 parts in it. So you have to take apart all the little different things. It's probably not a good one to start with because there's not a lot of destruction to this It's just me taking off tiny to the pieces There's something therapeutic about it though watch the whole thing come apart. It's like reverse IKEA furniture building Its like that game home improvisation. It's like that but backwards Where have they taken it that furniture is all together, and I have to figure out how I take it apart good God look at all these fucking screws Jesus yeah, now we start taking bits apart now. We start taking the good shit out nice Variant wait was this thing attached Uh-huh, there's more there we go, that's how it tricks yet. There's more pieces stuck together get away from that We can I not move you there. We go get off that I don't care see Normally, it's like oh this thing actually has more parts in it But then you get to the point where it's like where where are the fucking parts of God so tedious, but all the electrics Electricals all the little electricals can I take this out we got 15 parts left? Okay, I have no idea where all these parts are And Basically at the end get up cut off the bottom of that See here we go it's all apart It's all apart. There's still four parts Wait where are these four parts Tony ah look at you Do you have extra bits? No is it in you are you the extra parts? Oh? my god really one two three and Four there we did it Jesus Christ that was tedious, but you know what the best part is Now that I finished the level. I don't have to do that again cuz I could just drop the bomb Nice wait do that again do that again that wasn't know wasn't good enough Gonna drop the bomb there Now it's it's honest you get the satisfaction of watching It just be here, and then I can pick that up and put it in different places and put it down here and then Yeah Okay, but that was that was that was a little shitty one because I just wanted to show off what the mechanics of the game were, let's move on to something a bit bigger and a bit better robot saves bicycles a house ah Ok aside from my expert mechanic skills to go to work there. We go you see well See all this shit is in your way. That's where your car's broken Its like see its like  god there's your problem Fucking kids with their suicide doors these days. They don't know what to do with them look at this you see this shoddy craftsmanship Shoddy shoddy shoddy. They just don't build them like they used to Back in my day a car was for life. You bought a car You knew who would get you for me to be to see and all the way to your brain Back into the hospital bed. It would even drive you to the hospital These days now. It's all about Lamborghinis and Tesla's and I Don't know what's the world come to you. See this you see this right here. It's not supposed to be there These are not supposed to be on cars These are actually for boats You're not supposed to have these yeah. Oh all of your shit. It's just it's all broken So I'll break it away. Can you? still drive Maybe it's not as bad as I thought it was oh Oh Jesus it's on fire. Well. There's your problem seats you don't need seats just Stand in your car from now on Just just go to the car store and buy a standing one you go all these pedals. They're not even pedals They're just fish splice spatulas You're not gonna be able to drive around with those in your car You know or do you rid of we're even thinking about going with this thing? So many, it's just falling apart This is not a well-rounded care look look see just came right off It's just terrible, it's terrible your whole car is falling apart This stuff is all supposed to stay on the car. Ain't no way it's not let me get a look at the underside here yeah, oh, it's Just a bunch of shit down here as well. Don't worry. I'm gonna fix your car I'm gonna make it better than it ever was it's going to run way smoother once Jack's done with it You're gonna wonder if it's even the same car anymore because it's gonna be so different by the end in a good way Yeah, yeah, yeah, well. We're good. We're reaching good potential now. You're gonna need a whole new set of wheels okay? These ones are bad deed these are actually snow wheels You're you weren't supposed to be using these on the road Yeah, very very bad. Yeah, I'm giving it a new lock. I'm giving this car the the I parked in the wrong neighborhood look very stylish very Fashionable not a lot of upkeep. It's actually easy to keep the car in this condition for a very long time Almost no maintenance towards it Insurance is good I'm gonna give you a nice premium and on sell insurance, but for you. I will there we go there. We go this engines bad This is a bad engine I've put together and took apart a few cars in my time. I know what works, and what doesn't ok? This is not supposed to be here. These are actually four sleds. I don't know why its on a car But not no, this is good. This is a good luck This is what you want, so you want to see what all the kids are doing? How do you think you get those high speeds in the new Tesla Roadster? It's because you have to sacrifice a lot of the bulk You got to make the care faster to go faster There was your biggest problem you had a Magnemite inside your care. Hole come on don't go and care. They go on Pokeball yeah Yeah, it's not looking too. Good is it Well your problem now, I'm not even a mechanic. I don't even know why you brought it in to me in the first place really Hopefully your insurance covers it, but no insurance Alright Well have a good day another day another citizen that needs help I mean this one's a no-brainer the windscreen is broken at least that parts easy to fix Oh Shit So nothing all right, I've intentionally saved the best for last. There's a lot of things in here like trains and planes and skyscrapers tanks and everything Geez Space Station's submarines everything you can just you can disassemble a frigate spinner my god. There's look There's a lot of things my favorite thing in the game though is none of those. It's the Titanic you can actually disassemble the entire Titanic I Mean there's a hundred and fifty one in Paris And I'm sure it was close to about 17 million of them in the real one port. It's fun because you can take apart You can actually take your pair at the front and watch the whole thing sink Are you actually gonna sink are you sinking? I don't know if that's sinking Okay, maybe okay there we go now. She's sinking now. She's going What a good boat, and then we'd be like oh no These ones have started ain't a contract water the water all aboard. What are we gonna do captain? Yep The unsinkable ship my ass. Oh wait Oh Jack and Rose must have gotten off the front. That's good I'm glad they got away Okay, there's something kinda creepy about hearing the whole thing Wayne and buckle and everything but with no sounds Like that, but there's no ocean sounds there's no people sounds. There's no nothing. This is actually kind of impressive It's sinking like it would have I wonder if it's gonna break in half Will the game actually allow that will it break in half, and then the bottom will go up and down Apparently, that's what really happened to it. Which is crazy when you think about it That a ship of that size broke in half in the ocean. Oh my god it does That's awesome Whoa The pipe all buckled and broke wait. Are you all gonna slam down? I'm not removing parts though. I'm not doing it properly Okay, you just landed cool still have a hundred and forty four parts to take away though, and this actually six properly as well That's cool Wonder if they programmed it that way or if it actually just follows proper physics, I don't think your to follow proper physics I Think there's a V R Titanic game as well where you can get in and walk around it and see it sinking and stuff like that or maybe I saw a while ago somebody made it in the Unreal Engine where you could walk around the Titanic I Mean I would a second just for a game like this Were you where you sink the Titanic over and over again with different variables, that would be a cool simulation to have To get in and I throw rocks at it and throw bombs at it Well you can throw bombs at it But I have to take apart all the pieces and I doubt I'm gonna be able to do that It's pretty like tiny little bits everywhere oh There she goes I'm fascinated by to Titanic after seeing the movie when I was 9 I got a book talking all about how their the movie was made in the production and how like behind the scenes and just lore and the real Titanic You're gonna crash into each other I Think it's fine. I think it'd been a clue and you can just stick that back together But I would look up stuff about the Titanic it ever since and I'm just fascinated by the whole thing Oh, dude. You could drive it into the iceberg oh Now that's cool. Do the propellers actually go, or is it just fake they do This is neat I Really like this okay slam into that iceberg iceberg And then well technically they tried to turn it and slow it down and that kind of stuff didn't they I'm just driving straight in Nice did it actually take a chunk off the front it did Just like it would have in real life That's cool, and now the whole thing's gonna sink oh Man I thought this is gonna be a thing where you just like took bits off of it I didn't know you could actually sink it properly oh That's awesome Boosh was waste. I wish was way speeding it up hold on. I think I might have burned away There she goes she broke in half kid wait you gotta lose the weight oh Yeah, I forgot they're they're very heavy oh Jesus Jesus Just tear a hole chunks of it on the boats, we've been through these lifeboats go people go man women and children first Hopefully don't freeze to death though the Atlantic. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. I? Don't think she was ready to be born yet Wait, that's late. That's like when you need a c-section But you don't give it Heys this other piece still coming down there. We go ah Nice one you might okay, okay? I need to start taking chunks off you you might need to crap You're gonna muddy the you're gonna money the piles No, we don't know what parents like doing in my parts. I haven't stopped that oh Christ I Guess that's one way of doing it just slamming bits of it into itself Here we go get rid of all that ass Get all ass say for you to lose a bit of weight Titanic Okay now this is very confusing. I don't know what parts are want anymore oh God you're all individual pieces. Okay, some of it is some of it is actually I Just break you and have you float up and break all these That would have been nice. Oh my god really. Oh my god really The captain's wheel comes off on its own Does it? No What are you telling me it does if it doesn't Hey there we go I'm almost there we need a 44% I can do this I'm telling you lads This is how we get the Titanic off the bottom of the Atlantic We just start taking chunks of it off Okay, I can't the steering wheel and everything is still there They're just floating Oh God are you individual pieces? Okay, I think these are just These you're somebody gone The drowning sounds oh please no I Think these were like throttle forward and back, and then you could steer it yourself from the inside if you really wanted to Have to get rid of the staircase sorry sorry Kate Winslet. You can't come down anymore All things fought this is what really went down Then this is the ravages of the ocean the Titanic sank and then the ocean was just like no I don't want it get it out of here Concern, it's freaking out bits of us are flying everywhere and all the fish around like Jesus right tap There was a shoe fucking Titanic, bro Shit's crazy wait why are you not individual bits on this one the nine pairs left two parts Really this Where are these two parts Scooby Titanic wrecking crew come through one part left Okay, okay, it's somewhere. I don't know where it is, but it's somewhere All I want for Christmas is two front teeth me two front teeth yes me two front teeth oh Yeah, I Don't want to hit, but I did it nice that means I get to do wait first. We're going a wiggle wiggle wiggle Yeah, okay cool. Oh Shit I didn't mean to explode it immediately okay, you put the bomb down first Let's need the bomb there the bombs fine the bombs not hurting anybody Are you just gonna explode once you hit it anyway No why do you all slow? What's wrong with you you gotta be going slow head going on okay as soon as it hits the water Holy fuck oh, that's good. Oh, that's damn good Very nice It's raining Titanic so thence let's slow motion of zero percent or five percent or something like that But I can actually put it so that there's no slow motion on the bomb at all and I can also pick up the bomb Do whatever the fuck I want with more the faceoff this bitch Do you think in the sink unsinkable ship meet a moveable iceberg Spectacu that's Titanic 2 the sequel to Titanic James Cameron's pulling out all the stops this time actually Titanic 2 is going to be directed by Michael Bay He's he's gonna he's gonna put a stamp on it this time happens if I put it Sorry my bad what happens if I put it on the iceberg? They destroy guys oh But that's my favorite bomb okay here comes the Titanic barreling down the street. It's just like hey, I'm unsinkable yeah come on try your best We'll fucking try our best send your Titanic Don't you even worry about that as soon as you start hit that iceberg? Oh no? No the guys are like oh You see that and see that the iceberg was explosive I Just said iceberg ahead. Oh dad Oh shit iceberg Take that you're in syncable bitch, okay, why would I leave this video here? That was a ton of fun? I may come back and play more of this because there's so many other things you can destroy Space Station's submarines there's bombs robots planes it's gonna be pain in the ass that you have to get to that to unlock the bomb I Feel like you should just have the bomb anyway, and you should get no score for using the bomb or something I don't know and then picking a parrot all the pieces can be differently. I don't know why there is a score I just like destroying shit, but it's cool that the Titanic actually works like the Titanic and you can mess around with it that way Okay, yeah, it seems like it just does the same thing every time Regardless of where you blow it up. That's fine it look spectacular Anyway, thank you guys so much watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face like a buzz James Cameron's gonna be mad

our fights together but I kind of want to change it around I feel like I like having Jimmy I feel like he's very useful way who else we even have mosquito he yeah he does a lot of cool shit was Dwight I might bring super Craig back in instead of Eric I like super Craig super Craig Tucker is super all the time even when not playing superheroes Kyle is pretty good for healing and buffing and stuff

didn't tell him our child did but you confirmed it when the principal called you how long before they find out everything our child is confused don't you get it first asking the counselor about sexual orientation then talking to the principal about race confusion was the point the more our child learns about the truth the more dangerous it becomes you stupid whore your dinner is on the table

feeling blue new kid feeling sad parents pieces of shit we've all been there music so sad as well but something South Park is always pretty good about I a lot of people like to give satisfaction because it's in your face toilet humor a lot of the time and that is true but it's offset by some really terrific satire sometimes with like really powerful emotional moments and it always tries to bring things like it never does stuff just for the sake of doing it really old South Park used to do that but modern South Park usually pokes full of things really really well while also having the toilet humor and also making a really good point at the end of it it's a fantastic show and the fact that they've kept it going this long is just insane it doesn't get enough credit for what it does okay after bed hey kiddo listen I know we never talked about it but your mother and I are very proud Irish people night-night bumpy too Irish strong Irish blue it night falls upon the town like a fat slimy turd at the stink of greed corruption crime rises from the gutters and fills only one thing can deal with that turds I love the art style lemurs fuck freedom oh man I really does feel like

follow me - professor Casas lair you'll probably want to know about my superhero backstory you see when I was just a child my father was in the garage working on a project there was a huge storm and

Randy get in here right now and stop keying my car okay but this is different my father's acting even stupider than ever before perhaps toolshed wants to help his father because he feels he could have

Be like backstage i'd met him before and he was really open and energetic and welcoming and everything so.. That kind of eased my mind a bit further to go out and do something like that i saw.. My family were in the audience and everything so it was really nice to but think we're going to all go get food now i Don't know how, the how This vlog.. Was gonna? End up this just bits and pieces of everything recorded everywhere it is up online to be able to go.. Watch i i did link it on twitter and i probably got a Link in the description here and i'm sure somebody somewhere has recorded.. The whole thing i put it up on youtube by now so you can, go watch it yourselves but i couldn't be happier.. with How everything, went it was over in a flash? Had to follow a dog when i went up on the set and everything which is very hard act to follow. But i.. Think, it went really, well and i i'm personally i'm very happy with how, it went and normally after these, things i'm like Mmm i should have said this i should have said that a more i make a perfectionist with it and i i overanalyze it so If i think it went well then it must have gone, well but i can't really remember What i said because it was over so quickly? But i think we're getting ready to leave now because we have to go, back i'm Flying back to Brighton literally.. Today, so we're gonna go get food and then we're. Gonna get picked up and then we're. Gonna head to the airport.. so Cool, (i may have not heard correctly){my tickets are on sale} on sale and they've been doing really really, well so thank you.. I'm glad a lot of you are actually getting your tickets and i've seen a lot of people tweet.. Pictures that many of them getting the tickets and how excited they are to come to the show. Is i'm super excited i can't, wait to show. People what the show. Actually is and to be there with you as we go through. stories it's gonna be fun! I'm excited! (long pause)           So is everybody else excited!  {Wiishu} I'm excited    ME! Not that many people here.. I'm back i made it i'm home all the way from Ireland such a long trip took 714 hours but i'm a time traveler so it already felt like an hour or so flight but, well we're back safe.. And sound and back home, and i'm already back in to record. And i've already recorded two more videos again, overall! Incredible weekend so far i was gonna, say incredible weekend but it's not even done yet, we still have a Sunday to go this saturday, feels like, weekend's going on forever but it both feels simultaneously.. The, ages ago since i traveled back home and also like, no time at all so that's kind of strange but.. really, really, happy with how things went.. Really, because i'm and i feel bad  a small bit because when i got back From the place from the actual studio i didn't vlog anything, when we got back to the hotel when everything... Was fresh in my mind i just forgot until i was in bed i was like? Ah balls i forgot to record the air like more of the vlog.. but whatever you guys, saw, some of the footage genuine you saw how, it went and.. I didn't want to vlog too much while i was there because.. When you're, backstage and there's a lot of people around. And they're all watching the show And they're all having a, good time and everything i don't want to be that douchebag youtuber guy, who's like hey, i need, to vlog and everything that's happening in my life i Like vlogging and i like bringing you guys, along and showing you as much as possible but it's Also a case of human decency and comfort levels and everything you don't want to be the guy.. Doing the youtube thing, when everyone else is trying to have just a genuine good time and they had Some really interesting and really deep emotional human interest stories on the show. That night! Some man lost his wife in a terrorist attack in Tunisia.. And some other people were left homeless and things like that and you don't want to be the guy. Backstage with a camera talking, about how great it is that you're on this show, when other people have, some like real World issues going on in their lives so that's, why You didn't see much from from back there but i try to like instagram story different bits and pieces.. When, we were there but Really, really happy with how, it went i think the interview.. Was really good in general itself i think some of the questions that were asked were really nice there were there Was the inevitable like, money question, which i understand everyone kind of asks it now and then i get, why? They, ask, it i'm glad, we could just move on from it and not have to talk.. About it at all because it's not that part that's important, what's important to me is always the human.. Side of youtube and the community side of youtube but i'm really glad that that's shown.. Through, and people could see that were more than just dancing monkeys on screen.. Despite what you may think when you take a glance at some of our channels but.. There's more to us than meets the eye, and that's kind of what i wanted to get across and i'm really glad.. About how, it went it was awesome the people, who were there.. Dealing with the show.. And everything we're all super nice and very very generous to me and the fans who showed up. And were in the audience as Well we're all super nice too and we went backstage afterwards and signed some stuff we took some pictures and everything So really really really great night i don't think i'll forget that for as long as i live One thing i really, wanted to say before i wrap up this video on end the vlog. Is that i want to say Thanks to everybody out there, who sent me so many nice messages.. After i tweeted out that i was gonna be on the show.. A lot of people were congratulating, me and telling, me that it was such a cool, thing to do.. And that was really sweet but, after the show i've gotten more messages than i probably have in my entire life! Because so many people were saying how, well it went and that everything Was super nice and just congratulating me and everything and all of you guys out there, who ..normally? Watched the channel ross super super sweet to me and that really means a lot it seriously does Because you can, do these things and you can try and make yourself feel good about them and all that kind of stuff but if It's when the people tell you how Much it means to them and when the people tell you that they were all tuning in and they were all super excited About it and things like that that gets me all giddy gets Me all fired up it gets me all energized so Thank you so much everyone! Was so incredibly sweet to me and so kind and generous and had very very nice things to say.. So i really, do appreciate that i don't just, say this for the sake of it i don't take it lightly i really do appreciate all day, oh god i Do appreciate all the Compliments and all the nice things people said to me.. My foot slipped and i kicked my.. Own arm and then the camera through all over the place that's What happened movie magic, but that's what happens in these bugs But i want to leave it here there's a lot More stuff that i want to say that i probably get to in another video at some point. I don't want to bug this one time too much because it's probably going on for ages already i recorded a bunch of stuff i never know, what's actually, gonna make it in because There's so much of it as me just dicking around with the camera, and i'm like, man that didn't work moving on But anyway, well What a great night! What a great weekend, what a great start of the year i'm not even close to Reaching potential yet i'm not even close to stopping this train or this Pma or this mentality and attitude and everything that i have for this Year i just said i was going to make it a. Good, year it's already off to a Good start so i'm gonna try and keep these positive vibes going But as of right now, as i'm recording this tomorrow, we're doing the charity stream.. so i'm really looking forward to i and i hope that that goes, well this is probably go up afterwards but, hopefully, well i Don't know i'll see you guys there! In the past it doesn't make, any sense anyway Thank you guys so much for watching! This, video i'm not, gonna, do the whole outro because it just shakes around too much! Thanks BYE (:! (Outros- I'm Everywhere By Teknoaxe) Thanks for this watching!!! WOW!!! (; 
ladies my name is jacksepticeye and welcome back to subnautica look at this thing hey I drill down all the ion cubes that were in this because they said it was an ion fabricator so I won't see if it would build more they got three out of it and now it's actually just beaming down from above from creating new ion cubes that's sweet I like that we've to work through one of these Oh God which oh this is the problem I went out through one of these warp gates and I can't remember which one and my like my beacon isn't this side of the thing it's the other side so I don't know where my beacon actually is until I go are through it fuck it's large okay well we'll just gamble on this one what's behind door number green blast I also need to keep in mind oh look at my health my water and my food they're almost all identical I almost have triplets please be the one is this the one I need to get to the mushroom forest what yeah we made it I was gonna go out here on my own cause lord knows pepper is slow as molasses but I need to charge her up I need to bring her back to Henry and charge her up hello little bee here Little Billy Beacon thank you thanks for guiding me that's a lot of lithium right there that's a lot of true lithium where's Henry Henry my boy it occurred to me as well that not everyone might know why I call him Henry he's Henry like Henry the Hoover you ever seen the vacuums that have like the little faces on them to call Henry they're like a really big deal over here but I realized in other places there might not be as big a deal so that's why I call him that because he looks like that and also God I didn't even realize in one of the previous episodes this parent 11 or something I had the crystalline sulphur that I needed I had some in the back of pepper and apparently I looked at it and everything and still didn't even realize I had it so I have the fluid so my bad sometimes they miss stuff in the middle of like the rush of everything and just trying to progress and keeping everything in mind so there's some stuff just flies past my face right past my face and I can't see it anymore because they don't have my eyeballs in like II you don't even say like nutrition or anything it's just like no you need calories God's gonna take us fucking forever to get back here Oh pepper you're so slow even if I had to jump jet upgrade I wouldn't help all that much so I'm probably gonna have to spend a little while back here like just making some self crafting some stuff getting some stuff in order I don't a bug this down with that though I don't want to stay here for too long so I might just do a bunch of the farming myself cuz I want I want the game to progress and I want to do all the cool shit and see the cool stuff like the sea Emperor I'm gonna do that in this episode that's a plan I want finished what she wants me to do but I'll at least see her oh hi you want to come here me yeah fuck you I grind your teeth into nothing shithead look at him going away like oh wow he hurt me yeah that's what it feels like another thing people were telling me on math last time was to feed a peeper to a Reaper well I love the sound of that and that's adorable they said that if you feed a paper to a Reaper he kind of leaves you alone for a little bit but why why would I even want to do that to feed a peeper to a Reaper means that I actively go after one whereas I can just avoid them why would I want to do that well besides it just being a cool thing you can do but I'm gonna freakin mission here man uh-oh it's apparently falling off the edge of this so that's the kind of stuff that I'll do later on like miscellaneous things that I'll try out afterwards right now no I'm on a mission I'm here to see a freakin see amber and get off this frickin planet um my fucking vehicle pay us in here it's a build another one of those now cuz I'm a dome where were you computer chip and copper wire should be able to just get the stuff together for that hey it's good idea kept my firm here oh my full of shit plant you eat you oh I didn't mean plant you shit wrong one oh well we'll have two of those trees now umm yeah I can't even come in here anymore because there's no fabricator and he's going to Henry hi Henry you thought I'd never be back but here I am [Music] okay I need ion batteries to be able to make that oh oh here gold and silver ore oh fuck you take this and use it Oh feels good right I need to get the stuff together to build a vehicle babe because I don't have one of those and I need that to be able to build oh please tell me it's to be a copy and out of modification stations that I need to build that oh I'm gonna be here forever alright well the first thing I can do right now is take these babies out and some of these and oh I have computer chips that's very good for me nice I really wish I knew which one it was modification station or other thing I know fabricator in here what am i doing coz I need to build like jump jet upgrades for my thing and people are also saying to build new suits but I don't have new suits I only have the radiation suit and the the regular one people are saying make it still suit because then you can absorb the water from the surroundings I know but I need to find like a data chip thing to be able to even get the blueprints to be able to do that it's the same there's a there is a fire resistant suit or a heat-resistant suit that I can get to but I don't have the blueprints for that so I can't make these things unless they have them in here unless they're in the modification station and I miss them but I don't even think there's any sort of like icon for this type of stuff in the modification station so can't do that I can make a blue tablet though what the need for purple tablets two diamonds oh oh I'm so lucky I am so lucky I got two kyanite I was like just give me a second kyanite and I'll use that like for another thing later on cuz I thought it was just one kyanite for that I'm so glad I got two I would have been fucking pissed if I got back here realize I needed to okay well that's done at least but that's progress I hope I don't need any more blue ones when I'm back down there cuz this is gonna be a pain in my rectum man alright let's see if I can build this other thing look I find some I found some weird mushrooms I was like what the hell's like Chloe thing but it's just mushrooms floating on the top of the water they're not connected to anything it's just there and then I Oh what the fuck I can't go past them strange please do this please be this please be this please be this please be this okay ah fuck why why why did I even bother making this I don't have the items with me that was dumb I shouldn't have done that hey fuck clean look at the clay not get to the stories you don't taking you out goddamn it I was like I'll build the vehicle up great because then I'll be able to build the thing because I have the items now put their back and my fucking other base like I'm not even I I'm not even close to being able to do that I need to nickel ore and three crystalline sulfur lithium I can get here if I really wanted to but man that sucks the thermal reactor I have like the bits and pieces to do that well fucking anyway man actually not I'll keep you there why not back in we go back into the lines then hopefully my fear now is that using the blue tablet to get into the sea Emperor's like Den is not gonna be enough that I put in the blue tablet and then it'll turn around to be like oh you need this to do this or something but I'm excited we're excited to see what the sea Emperor's like in the full game I barely just had interactions with her in the the earlier versions of the game in the early access version so this is gonna be really interesting yeah so I don't think she even talked back then and now she has like a full personality and a dating profile and everything uh-oh wait then the tablets in here let's take you yes is that it yeah baby nice so this is where she is this is her domain this is where all the water is being pumped to and all the ecology and everything are being generated for this location right here I also like that it's clouded over like it's sealed plus for the player it means you can't concede okay here we go oh it's so spooky and everything oh yes oh yes she shakes the whole thing now these walls they play no they're gone and instead we have you we are curious whether you swim correct or fight against it as they do that's so cool she's awesome ok I'm going up here just to get some oxygen I feel like I'm losing oxygen faster in here just let my rebreather on I do look at her go oh you must be so lonely all the creatures here so in the other version she actually did that like unusually passive behavioral patterns in nearby predators ah is she keeping them passive damn 14,000 leagues under the sea I got an achievement hi we can scan you all know the bone shark like life-form which depends on the organic detritus produced by the ecosystem around it hell yeah it is so this is her area this is where all the water's being pumped into there's just everything is in here to try and create some sort of like ecosystem so she can filter out the micro organisms these are her babies we're going out of there in a second right now I want to see if I can scan you I can't scan you oh man that sucks so she doesn't hurt you she's here to play she's here to figure out how she's a gist of what the hell is this is some sort of like slipstream behind you huh okay wait I want to get oxygen again wait no there's air bubbles down here I can just use these this is really deep okay we're gonna be here for a while trying to get their air out of these but she did that thing where she like crawls up and looks at you but I don't think she talked and the other version I think she would just go away again so it was really weird but she she doesn't harm you because she wants to figure out what you're all about oh yeah and then she just sits there and stares at you and she makes noise oh yeah cuz now I'm at your baby's high that's all right it's her eye on cue okay here we go whoa my I need to hedge to play outside this blazes agreed we have been here so long the others built a passage to reach the world outside I asked them for this freedom but they could not hear me if you help us I will give you freely but the others tries to invade to take what are you doing okay so this is this is the warp gate that she wants to get out through Oh awesome you're so badass I don't have another ion cube with me shit I need to go back out and get one out of pepper okay I'll be back okay oh my god you're my favorite you're so big geez okay I'll be back so it seems like as she said the others want to take the enzyme out of her enzyme 42 to be able to create the vaccine for everything bad that's happening but it seems like even though she is telepathy that they couldn't hear her but but I can for some reason so she said I'll give you freely what others tried to take in vain so she's gonna give me the enzyme if I help her babies escape and it's not just as easy as putting in an ion cubans of the warp gate and then they hatch I have to I think I have to do something with them I have to like provide materials or something oh my god can I can I just okay I'm glad I have all this shit now I'm gonna take a few just in case and make a little wah-wah well I can I have infinite of them there anyway ooh and I have peepers down here and I have a thermal blade so I can technically I can technically live for a very long time down here water might be a problem but I get water back from cokes peepers because my Serrano blade cooks them automatically curious so I might actually be able to just stay here well I'm gonna have to go through the warp gate after I figure out what she needs hi hi big baby hi man it's so awesome that she blew the sand away yes I did it I opened it up with the passage can leave this place yup first they must be all the time is right and break free of their shelves this is what the others could not force for me to you I get this secret willingly hatching enzymes whoa where is that damn dog ooh I got a new thing cm for his lifecycle the available biological data has been used to synthesize the effects of the alien bacterium on the sea emperor's natural life cycle this creature likely lived and moved in small herds around the planets ocean trenches coming to the surface to feed off the huge volumes of microorganisms in the shallower waters family size would be strictly limited by available food supply offspring would likely split off at a young age to form their own herds elsewhere damaged a whole herd of those guys given their sparse population mating an egg-laying was likely infrequent perhaps a once in a lifetime event the species likely had a preferred environment for egg-laying in fact successful hatching may depend on such conditions given the rarity of this event it is impossible to calculate those conditions precisely there's no evidence to support the assumption that all members of the species were immune from the alien bacterium even if this is so there's evidence that introduction of the bacterium decimated life on the planet and this would have a catastrophic effect on the Emperor's food supply and survival rate the symbiotic relationship between this specimen and other life-forms likely developed as a direct result of the bacterial infection those life forms which learned to keep the Emperor alive survived with its help this may explain the vast tracts of lifeless ocean in a rough perimeter around the Emperor's location hmm I just love the lore of all this stuff it's really really cool mmm where the hell is the enzyme oh here an eye stalks eat a sea crown seed a fungal sample bull Bush sample ghost weed seed I have no idea what any of these things are okay can you tell me where to find those things need air cuz they're not gonna be around here because this is all just stuff from the outside be fucking cool if it was here okay there's waiting for my air to fill oh there's a stream coming out of you as well I don't know what those streams mean what does this mean are these two microorganisms that you live on have no idea how cool she is why did you spend so long in here though she supposed to be what sixteen hundred years old man that's boring you don't even know solitaire or anything okay I'm still getting air okay that's enough whatever just want to look around with some of the things in here see if anything's different whoa whole like underdone oh you're one of the things this plank consists primarily of a large bladder like sack containing a huge variety of bacterial species which may enable it to break down complex compounds it draws from the root system shares large sections of genetic code with the membrane tree environment scans indicate this plant is rare to the point of extinction okay how do I pick you up can a knife you yes okay how many of those that I need C crown seat okay violet bow violet beauty how many - the plant grows faster sieve it okay hey push I need something from this all right bulb or sample that's a bulb or sample I need I've no idea what I just got cave bush seed okay ghost weed seed and I stock seat okay so the stuffs all in here Gabe's feather I'm just are slashing shit and hopefully get the things I need okay okay okay okay whatever I'm going back out get some air wait till I get any more of the pieces no getting pieces and lots of stuff but not the ones I need blue barnacle cluster stab it red wart that's not the thing I need okay I'm gonna go deeper down once enough down there was part of the thing maybe not all the pieces are here either way I'm gonna have to leave to go back to a fabricator anyway unless this thing the thing over there actually fabricates them as well there's one of the vents that we saw on the surface oh it's over here why aren't you where does this one go I gotta bring pepper in here right I want to see where this one goes I'm very very curious oh it just brings me to the entrance again well I mean I guess that helps maybe the maybe the Emperor like jumps up and breaks through the ceiling and I need to be out here to see it I don't know but cool I guess right so I think I have to leave this area and get a bunch of stuff the ice dark seed and the ghost weed seed I'm not really sure about I don't really know where I get those the fungal sample I it kind of looks like the ones that are just in the mushroom forest I don't know if I could just smack them and get pieces off them so I'm gonna try that and the pole bush sample is the same thing I've been at the pole Bush zone we've seen it before oh wait there's five things that I need to get and there's four warp gates and one of the things was found in here so maybe all the warp gates lead to different areas because one of the warp gates that I have that I've marked comes out to the mushroom zone the mushroom forest so I get the fungal sample another one came out at the bald bush so I can get that I don't know where the other ones are so I'm gonna try all day oh okay I get it now I know why they're in such random locations I'm gonna get my oxygen here even though I'm heading out I don't know why I'm doing that so I'm gonna head out and try and get different things from the different areas outside of this place or this might not be as hard to do as I thought it would be goody another way this platform is here it's very strange but I think that when she landed on it like the whole thing kind of moved it didn't do that before so subtle little animations that keep like Oh wrong side give hefter like the size of her and how much sway she has over the environment can I get out Thanks well that's where I was in the warp gate yeah are we gonna take pepper out with me as well just to be safe and secure because I don't just have oxygen and stuff like that I do have food dehydrates me but I do have water to offset I don't have infinite so I'm gonna have to be careful I mushroom forest first so let's see if this actually works I actually just need to bring pepper out to this one Wow it does work so there's two pieces okay we've got this I know what I'm doing now I have I have the power in the technology I know where I'm going I know what I want to do in life oh jesus oh Jesus these guys are stuck oh can you please leave okay can you go can you don't attack me okay the other guy managed to get out ah fuck's it going go back Jesus okay I brought pepper now this time so it got fried okay I just need a piece of this yeah baby is that is that the next section yes two more no it's the hardest ones I don't know what they look like well they're pictures kind of indicate I think I've seen the ghost weeds before eyestalks I'm not sure I can't remember okay excuse me it's gonna be heard me heard me what the fuck are you doing in here get out and go home your parents are looking for you I'm just gonna scooch by oh that's fucking bad-ass okay so wait now the question comes to mind of if the aliens built this place why did they build warp gates in such random locations if those are the things that are exactly needed to hatch the hatch the eggs unless they had some inclination as to why I mean from a gameplay standpoint it obviously makes sense I'm trying to figure out the lore behind it if there even is any I don't know pepra you're awfully fucking slow I'm have to speed this up I'm running out of oh where am I I'm running out of water only have two bits left see this is where the still suit would come in handy but I have to find the blueprint for it again how did it my old save but it may all save I also had everything so I don't have any of that like really cool upgraded tech anymore I just have like the bare essentials needed to get to here it's fine is fine I can do it right where did this one lead see this is the thing I don't know which one I'm looking for now this is the Lost River so am i looking for a ghost weed or what was the other one ghost weed or eyestalks you should be fairly prevalent once I come out here though because the other ones were there's going a fucking circle god damn it it's like I was like is that another fucking warp gate wait am I even on am I in water that's the really weird thing about this game is that later on you start getting into areas that are all just underwater all the time and you never see the surface or light again so do you come around into areas late you like this you're like am I in water or not okay Lost River eyestalks or ghost we'd make yourself known oh shit V ghost Leviathan over there that's fine please don't tell me you saw me oh I really wish I knew what I was looking for okay now he saw me now he definitely saw me the fuck I can't go fast enough oh there it is there it is there it is there's weird fucking vanished okay this is a place I've never been hey you guys could just shite off I don't care about you I saw the ghost weed I saw two of them okay okay okay I've never seen that school before that sucks man I saw to go Street and then they just vanished they like popped out of existence there's one there's one right there okay are you fucking serious why are they just vanishing it's so annoying okay look you can see there were two right there I have never been here before I have no idea where this is look there's some right down there those are ghost weeds right there right don't vanish yes fuck yeah my dude okay we are out of here I have no idea where I came in oh where am i right now looks like The Lost River but I'm not sure about that but chasing me again are you hey I just need to I just need to get out over this and hit back that's all I need to do it's all I need to do it's all I need to do Scooby Doo it's easy it's fine it's glorious it's lovely where do I go how would they get in how could she slap I do not remember coming past you oh fuck this is my nightmare oh thank God I found it again oh my god oh my god he's chasing me Jesus Christ that's scary okie dokie um well drink two of them that was terrifying so that was near the blood kelp zone if I got in like major trouble there I could have just gone back to my actual base I could have gone back to Maria and the base I had down at the bottom of that tree but no that is no more of that please all right so what do we what do we have left to get then we have the I stock seed all right feel like I shouldn't be carrying these things around if I die I lose all this because I haven't been to a base your stuff saves in a base and when you die you go back to the nearest base that you were at last we can do this we got this we're powerful all right we're B this place now is this one of the islands so you went through all the areas then then I forgot where they all came out I think this one actually came out no never mind I'm a liar lying sack of shit oh jesus where am I oh right there okay leave ever leave and pepper that's fine yes thank you can you tell me where I am no I'm 1,400 meters away from Henry I think that was like a grand reef or something oh yeah baby now we've all the stuff for the hatching enzyme fuck yeah so have to see if this thing will just accept the pieces and then it crafts it right then and there like they're the little console actually is a crafter or if I have to go back to Henry either wait not too bad if I have to go back to Henry then at least I can get more food and water and stuff well food shouldn't be a problem I have cure papers but they're gonna bring down my water all right so I'm gonna have to eat some of the papers that are in that area the results of some new papers that were there they look like papers but they had pink eyes and they had like three little tentacle tails I've never seen them before and of course when I say never seen these things before I mean I if I saw them in my last playthrough I can't remember I was scared all right it's see every time y'all I'm really excited for this cuz when I played this originally I hatched the I hatched the children but it was a case of they just kind of hatched on their own so I didn't do anything they just hatched on their own and they broke out and had no animations or anything they just popped and they were just floating around in the fetal position scared the crap out of me please pace pace pace pace please let this be a thing I can do right here yes oh no no no come on I do have to go back to a fabricator shit I'll be back okay I'll be back to help your babies damn it all right did we make it in here yes we certainly do there be those hatch and enzymes oh I thought it'd be cool if she actually talked to me to be like wait you got it come back to me now or something that would have been awesome but didn't do - you did nothing okay well the peppers charging up a small bit I want to go get me some bladder fish because I need to get some more water I'm not gonna be done this time before it was just for the sake of efficiency yeah I love that to get better water you have to use bleach you're basically drinking bleach but this gives you disinfected water instead of getting all the items needed to do this every time I was just making regular water I was like ah to be fine I don't need anything else but no oh oh cuz I can make regular waters I don't even need normal water to do it I was like don't you need to craft regular water and then craft the disinfected water but no it's just bleach actually it's just bleach use bleach and somehow you get disinfected water out whatever I'm not a fucking scientist okay um in a second one of these I don't need that it's taking up a lot of room imma leave this here in an environment where it's not supposed to be we're to get our there it is looks like a little almond or a little poop all right time to head back pepper that big long journey boy big did someone order some hatching enzymes I know you did big baby oh I love that she doesn't do anything just sits there and looks at you okay here we go this is it oh yes oh yes they're free they're free cm per juvenile look at them cows are so cute I have freed your babies cm per juvenile a juvenile and per specimen it is producing a highly potent form of enzyme 42 we shall be capable of fully curing individuals of the alien bacterium this species hash is relatively fully formed and independent perhaps reflecting that they must fend for themselves and they are first born away from their parents this specimen is healthy and exhibiting signs of a positive attitude to life the fucking they have a PMA the sea emperor babies have their positive mental attitude oh yes okay well now what do we do hi is it gonna secrete the enzyme or something do I have to wait for something else I don't know oh they're the air oh they weren't all born now the air I had stole your children all five of them can something happen now yeah oh it's so cute and he thanks or anything no she's dying my young are swimming for the shallows I thank you their freedom is my end what will it be like I wonder to go to sleep and never wake up perhaps next reread I will be an ocean current carrying seas to a new land or a creature so small it sees the gas between the grains of sands oh oh no she's gonna die so she was just staying alive all this time to keep them ready to go but so sad yeah but about my enzyme though about the enzyme okay we okay I'm not reading that right now whoa you're scary but you're cool so your babies went through here huh was this refined enzyme 42 I got it Oh I'm cured I think optimal health I got an achievement we fucking did it hell yeah holy shit oh there's enzyme 42 is everywhere okay okay I'm gonna be a pepper and we're going through this warp cave together oh wait so yeah first time I've ever done that first time we've actually been cured oh that's awesome we're cm per though wouldn't she be you see Empress I don't know but I want to follow her children I want to see where they go and I also don't to go through it on my own just in case I don't come back so I want to bring pepper with me okay see Emperor don't be scared this is my pepper hearing weird sounds is my pepper she won't harm you oh it's just the music kicking up we love you though I wonder what she just stay like that until the end of the game like if I actually finally leave I don't know sad she did all she could for her babies we respect you okay let's head out I wonder if you can actually see them swimming around out there or they just like gone they're heading for the shallows though which is back where Henry is well that's the safe shallows yay or the right beside the alien facility and it just keeps spitting out bits and pieces of it yay we didn't we saved the planet literally the enzyme now will spread there's five new emperor's going around they're gonna keep spitting out the enzyme and it's gonna spread and it's gonna heal everything that's in the land we did it everybody look at Sally in here waiting for us okay we're not done yet I want to see what happens when I heal myself okay make it fuck really really okay just go down to the bottom then this is the area where you can go down and stop yourself and then you can turn off the defense's oh my god I've never done this this has never been a thing in the game until now well maybe some people broke the game and did it but I've never done it you so excited I don't want to leave it till next episode since we're like came back out of the warp gate right there here we go I'm clean yeah [Music] it powered down whoa this is sounded made when the Sunbeam was coming in and the gunner was warming up to destroy shit now what happened they just shut the whole place down okay I'm gonna go out and Sally I miss you Sal I'm not gonna use pepper again for a second but these little dudes are swimming around anymore no they vanished they just had enough enzymes when they come out here they just start spewing em zines enzymes every words for the player to be able to be like oh I need to grab one of those okay and then once you do it and disable the defenses they're just gone so does that mean the war pers are gone now as well oh my god progress new territory stuff I've never seen before this is crazy it powered the whole thing down it's not even aiming up anymore whoa that's badass Oh after so many hours and hours and hours of playing this game we finally get to see what curing yourself looks like but finishing the C Emperor's quest feels like man we're not doing yet though I am gonna leave this episode here I wanted to end on that because I was so cool but we do have a ways to go yet because I do need to get the rest of my pieces for my rocket ship right now I have the blueprints to be able to build the base but I don't actually have the materials and I don't have any blueprints to build the next section so we're not done yet that is not the end of subnautica just yet but that is basically the end of our struggle our struggle to survive and our struggle to cure the place and fix the planet is now done and now the world here can go back to being itself again the enzyme can spread the Emperor's can spread and the infection can be cured awesome anyway thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face like a buzz and [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but now my other stuff is all the way down at the bottom of the lab as a whole

You were never in trouble were yet Okay, you know what they've whoa? You know what the craziest part about all of this is then we gotta escape this place Are you putting it together yet what we have to do Each you said something more than wahoo that's right everybody We got a controlled Bowser The weirdest shit to ever happen in the Mario game Then you're gonna get all his memories of like his childhood and everything and why he's so fucked up It's so cool when I saw this for the first time I I lost my shit The fact that you actually have to be Bowser They really went all out for this game Nice nice nice poses a fucking tank It's so awesome I love it so much So those things you're like they're not gonna do that are they or what they do or what they do what? Hey, don't fuck it up cuz the checkpoints in this area are very unforgiving and this all collapses when you step on it, so Destroy the tower destroy the tower we don't need to be here anymore, and you even get to do this All 2d Mario Bowser It is the coolest shit ever oh Shit everybody it's about to go down. We're all most out y'all Suppose you can do like this the super triple jump is low do dododo It's so cute it's such an epic ending. Yep. Fuck it all up tear it down tear it all down We don't need it anymore The moon was a mistake fake fake moon landing Okay, one left Okay, okay, everything is falling apart scary fuck yes loser You got to get there fast Bowser You got to get there fast atta boy now tear it down tear the moon down from the inside out Fuck yeah, oh hey look at that. Oh god. We're all in it Hey, we're all safe oh Fuck you peach, I think you're better than us, don't you? Well Let's do it in front of his dead corpse oh You guys are safe They're brother and sister by the way I don't know if that was made clear at the start Or if I skipped over that but that's what that's why Cappy followed you everywhere Ha ha ha oh I'm just gonna choose neither of you Not only is she not choosing either of them But she decided to take the ship and leave them I Don't know man seems like bullshit to me It's all over ladies and gentlemen that was Super Mario Odyssey we had a lot of laughs we had a lot of good turns a lot of deaths that I'm not gonna mention ever again, but It was a good time you can now travel to the Mushroom Kingdom So there's a little bit left at the end as some sort of like Like little nod to the old Mario especially Super Mario 64 which is the Mushroom Kingdom? And that's Peach's castle right there, so this is a level in Super Mario 64 And this is basically what it would be like if you had a HD version of that game, which is just fucking nuts It's so cool So cam and so peaceful like our trip that the Moon Kingdom was all a dream It was you were just asleep here all that time. Who are you? So he's basically telling you that you can go back and get all the moons if you want, and then you can go around Peach's castle and you can get a bunch of shit around here as well It's fucking crazy The fact that they actually put this in the game every like again This is another one of those things that when you see it for the first time. It's like What? Because this is such a throwback to what the other Mario game was and That's why it is so great about this Mario game is that it seems to have elements of everything and it went above and beyond as Some sort of like fanservice to the people who loved Mario games But also eight it had something new for people who had also played all those Mario games It's just astounding. It's such a well made game one of my favorite games this year So I'm probably gonna leave this series here, there is some stuff to do around this castle There is some more stuff to do. There's a shit ton more moons to get Which I might do in some sort of livestream or something, but as far as the actual series itself goes I think I'm gonna end it here because we defeat at the last level But you'll probably see me play more at this game in some form or another Somewhere along the line this this won't be the end of it in totality But I probably just won't be uploading them the way I am now but I love this game and The main reason I'm probably doing that is because I've I've played the game and I finished the game already myself And I kind of just wanted to do this to show off some of the games of the people who hadn't seen it But also just to have a sort of dick around series So this was a really fun series to do I could have done. It as a straight normal Let's play but because I waited so long to do it and because all the episodes started getting copyright claim by Nintendo I just gonna sit down look at the birds We had to figure out a fun way of doing it that allowed us to do it and dodge copyrights But also keep it interesting for everybody watching so I think we accomplished that through the type of jokes I was making in the series, but also with the type of edits that Robin was doing and they were so funny It's just with all the like the fair use in the background and no claim Please it just added a whole new element of the series that I'm really happy with and I'm really proud of this series I'm really glad with the way it turned out, but that does it for Mario Odyssey for now a Bird just landed on my nose see Mario your nose is so big a per thought. It was a tree Anyway, thank you guys so much for watching this series if you liked it punch that like button in the face like a boss and high fives all around!! Wapoosh, Wapoosh! well, thank you guys I will see all you dudes in the next video!!! You see that moon up there Birds, I killed someone up there and left his body 
*Narrator talking in a deep british accent. what he is saying will always be along the top* -Oh, we're just starting. Okay! Okay. Awwww, the littlest penguin! Anyway, *Whapoosh!* Top of the mornin' to ya, laddies! My name is JackSepticeye, and welcome to "The Littlest Penguin." This is a game that people told me to play a while ago. and it was all over the place and people were like jack you have to play the littlest penguin and I'm I'm kind of wary about it now because it's made by the same person who made Astro creep- oh! that was when people told me to play it, when I played Astro creep. which was a Game where you're up in space and you had to get an alien and kill all the people so I'm very very wary about what This game is gonna be, I think there's more to it than meets the eye. Oh God littlest penguin with the littlest jump Into the water you go little penguin Oh wow, "press arrow keys to swim. swim to the surface at an angle you want to jump off it." Oh hell yeah wahooo! *-Narrator continues, his dialogue is along the top of the screen* what up! Awwww I agree too! whawaawawanmwamamawammwa I speak penguin, I took four years of penguin in the Antarctic when I was 15 Very very delicate language you can like say Mwamhawa Can really insult somebody, but somebody else can find it very romantic. Oh God, it's- just listening to the wind is cold enough. We had like a bunch of snow here in Brighton today And it actually stayed on the ground earlier in the day I was like oh I wish it stayed and then later in the day it did stay and then the power went out everywhere in Brighton Okay What is this adventure we're going on? I am adorable by the way. I am a very cute little penguin oh This guy fell over! *Narrator continues* UHHMM?! UMHUMHUM??! What?!?! I have to kill the penguin?!! AHHHOH My god!!!! *Narrator continues* (the music steadily picks up into a sinister tone) oh god. Oh God! the music! OHHHHhhohohooono Ohhohohoho sweet jesus Okay! this took a big fucking sharp turn from Pleasantville into What-the-Fuck town! I love it! Yes! *narrator continues* [Jack, referring to the narrator] Oh you have a very nice voice! They're not running!! [captioners note: disregard the last two blocks of text as the text is just cycling through back to the start] Jesus Christ man this took a big turn This is creepy!!! This is like playing "can your pet" all over again! *narrator continues* Jesus Ohhh my god! Yeah, yep. Yep. Go a little bit of a little bit crazy over there tiny penguin Yep, see never make fun of that person in high school. They grew up to be a little penguin, and they'll kill you all What next? what other weapon do I get? the snow itself? my beak? my tiny little flipper hands? Okay, it's cold and now it's dark. Just like the inside of my tiny penguin heart They'll know, they'll know the day they crossed me making fun of my tiny flippers, and my inability to swim or dance But that's okay. This is what Happy Feet 2 should have been The fuck is this Arctic research centre outpost number 450 Okay, Ohhh my god! I'm getting a fucking chainsaw!! *narrator continues* haha lookit him go!! Oh God, we have to go all the way back? I love how he's just shaking along with the chainsaw! Go little penguin!!- wait should I be cheering for him? I don't know if I should This penguin's kind of messed up in his tiny penguin head He's got- he's got a bit of the shakes going on, he got a bit of the shimmy shams going on Because he's just eager to murder Any day now, just stick the chainsaw onto the snow and pull it and the chainsaw pull you along I Really want to try that I would see if that works in real life Hi friends How's it going? Do you like my new toy? Ha ha ha ha, oh jesus *narrator continues, ominous, suspenseful music play in the background* Come here friends! I love this music on in the background. Yes! crumble! break and bleed! oh sweet jesus Well. I did it. They didn't run they didn't scream. They didn't go into chaos. They kinda just walked towards me It's their fault! I had a chainsaw, and I said hey, I'm gonna just keep walking towards you and if you get hit by my chainsaw That's your fault not mine Is that it, did I finish it? did I kill all the penguins? Do-do-do-do-do-do *mumbling along to the background song* ~and then you feet on the ground~ is that that song? That is so familiar! Oh what song is that?! ah that's the end haha David Mills, come on man! *narrator continues* ohh is this going where I think it is? Yep! Yep! Huhuhhhh dont do it!! dont do it! Did he do it??! [violent chainsaw whirring sound] Yeahhhh! he did it! hahaha ohh my god! (a waltz begins to play, to which jack sings along, making up words) ~Cuz when you roll your fucking school on other fools or other jewels~ Okay, okay, we do not need a rendition of this again Can I- can I pause? I don't need to see this penguins Massacre again! Wellll ummmm That was the littlest penguin uhhhmmm That was messed up. Now I know why people wanted me to play it ummm I don't know what else there is to say. I was a tiny penguin. I went around, I killed everybody, and then I thought they were beautiful when they were dead, and then I killed myself Fun for the whole family That's such a messed up game, but then again this guy he makes a lot of weird games I played a game where I kill the guy who sat in the toilet when I was an alien And he's made a bunch of other games as well. I might try them out. He's made one called... Spime? Which I don't know what that one's about but he also played one called aqua creep, which is astral creep underwater I'm guessing so I might get around to those as well. I miss playing these like really weird flash games This feels like a very like, 2014-2015 era type of game and I miss those days!! It was just a ass load of really weird random flash games to play and I used to Fly through them all it has such a good time and everyone enjoyed them so much. It's such a different uhhh YouTube atmosphere now I miss these types of game so I want to try and take some time to go through some of them again Kinda like the wackier games And what was some other ones I used to play? like "the visitor" and that! I missed those types of games It's been a really long time since I've played any like really decent flash games the last ones I played are all like the troll face games. I don't know! there's something simple and satisfying about them If there's any other weird games like this, Let me know this definitely reminded me of "can your pet" which I did not expect to take such a dark turn either But here we are But for now, Thank you guys so much for watching this episode If you Liked it, PUNCH THAT LIKE Button, IN THE FACE!!!!

Should I just stay still then? 'cause I'm so used to jumpin to hit him. Maybe that's the trick. Maybe it's tricking me fuck *mockingly* Ha Ha Ha I'm a pirate. I have no friends. I wish people would come over to my house to watch movie nights. If only I wasn't a piece of shit who tried to kill people all the time Do you ever think that's your problem mr. Pirate? Nice nice Nice! Popow! Popow! Popow! ‚ô™Boom boom boom boom, I want you in my room‚ô™ dargh! Come on Those are the ones I hate.

Just put so much in your way *makes strange noise* That's the sound a fog horn makes Alright, here we go! Here we go Imma do something special for this one Okay, okay, okay. That fire is fucking weird! *agressive yell* Bitch! Okay, he did it right back to me *laughs* I'm trying to do it to him, and he was just like, 'No!  No! *laughs* You know what? Let's take a little break Let's take a little break, for a little second and go up here and do something There he is! "At last! Thought I'd never see another living soul again! I lost my way while searching for coins." "No one has money for haircuts these days, thanks to that blasted casino..." "Well, I'd better get back to my pals in the quartet." And we're gonna take a lovely break right now. We're gonna take a lovely break now and listen to a lovely song. Here we go *the Barbershop Quartet starts singing*
‚ô™It's nice to rest your eyes, and maybe go outside‚ô™ *the Quartet*
‚ô™Grab a book and get some air‚ô™ *the Quartet*
‚ô™So what are you waiting for?‚ô™ *the Quartet*
‚ô™Bom-bom-bom-bom, Why not take a quick break?‚ô™ Jack: ‚ô™Bom-bom-bom-bom‚ô™ *the Quartet*
‚ô™To the radio-o *jack with Quartet*
o-o-o-o‚ô™ *the Quartet*
‚ô™There's chores to do, there's leaves to rake‚ô™ *the Quartet*
‚ô™Strum the old banjo-o-o-o-o‚ô™ *the Quartet*
‚ô™You can practice your lindyhop‚ô™ *Jack with Quartet*
‚ô™Bom-bom-bom-bom‚ô™ I fucking love it! *the Quartet*
‚ô™- - - with your barbershop‚ô™ *the Quartet*
‚ô™Why not take a little quick break‚ô™ *the Quartet (and Jack at the end)*
‚ô™and come back for mo-o-o-ore‚ô™ *the Quartet (and Jack at the end)*
‚ô™Then come back for mo-o-o-ore‚ô™ *the Quartet (and Jack at the end)*
‚ô™Please come back for mo-o-ore‚ô™ Yes! Very nice my dudes! Fuck yeah! Best song! Okay. I need some coins 'cause I want to get some more, ehm... shots I want to get the 'chaser shot'. That might help me with this boss fight. It doesn't do a lot of damage, but it does lock on every time, so I'd constantly be hitting enemies, and I kind of want that so... Plus I haven't finished this level yet, and I kind of want to do that as well, so Okay. Now this, gets like fucking geometry dash 
all of a sudden. Can I kill you? Ahh fuck. So I have to hit that, go upside down, hit another one that's coming up and then go upside down again? "We ain't toying around with you, now scram!" *Growls* Hate levels like that. I hate levels that... go against mechanics that we've already established. Well, not really, but... since when have I been going upside down in this game? huh?! HUH?! That's what I'm trying to say. all right We're at- we're at full health right now. Can I somehow trick this guy to coming out again and kill him? Oh wait, there's a fucking- I didn't even see the floor down here. Uh, christ Wh- what're you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?? I was so close! I didn't even see the floor underneath that guy! God, I'm so dumb! 'kay, got him got him. Okay. Now where am I fucking going? Hit all these things, so annoying. Nice Another one? Why??! Kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him, Yes! Oh, come on *laughs* I didn't know where to go, I was so close to the end! 
It was right up there! *distressed noise* I don't like this Oh fuck. You gonna fart cars at me again? Uh uh, what's happening? Come on, please? NOOOOOO!! It was right there, and I fucking jumped into it. What? WHaT? The fuck was that? Oh my god. Oh my god, did I do it? Oh yes! *imitates game* 
Bravo! I didn't do very well, but I fucking did it, and that's 
all that matters. That's how you do it Not to great a dance that time because, I mean, it's just a basic level. It's just an ordinary level. It's no biggie, no b- no problem. *imitates game*
Cuphead! How many- Wait. How many coins did I get for that? I got all of them! Yes! Now I should be able to get a new sh-h-ot Might not help me all that much, but I want to try it So I have a choice between the 'chaser shot' or the 'charge shot'. People said the charge shot is very good but again, you have to charge it up, and you have to face one direction. Whereas- not the band. "Long range, below average damage." "Hold the attack to increase damage. No rapid fire, so precision is key." That's my problem with it. It's that I HAVE TO be precise. And I have to jump up, 
aim at him, shoot. So it's not gonna help for this fight, so... Imma get this one. I'm gonna get the charge shot for later on and maybe for New Game Plus, or something like that But for now, I don't think I need it so much *Hums along to music* 
‚ô™Doo doo doo doo doo, go fuck your mom‚ô™ *laughs* Right, let's head back and fight this pirate bitch. All right. Let's see this. Oh, no... Oh no, he's aiming at the fucking barrel... But I do have this! So if something comes near me,
now I have a shield Which I think is fucking marvelous God. This is, this is a disaster. This just... Here is me hoping I could get something to make this easy, but no. Oh wait, that was fucking useless Uh oh. Does help for that though, hahaha. Wait, does does the barrel count as hits? He's not flashing white so I don't think the barrel counts. Oh, it's good for this though Very good for this. And if they walk into me they're not gonna hit me, 'cause I have a mufuckin shield, son! Okay! I'm feeling this one Mr. Krabs! (OH YEA MR KRABS) Oww. I'm not feeling that one though, that sucks. Okay Okay. This might be taking me a lot longer to do, 
but I'm happy about it. Ahhh, Fuck you! I need all that health going into the last round. Do I just duck? Okay, I just duck. Hit him in the tonsils! Give him tonsillitis. Fuck him up! That's the shit, that's the shit right there! Yes! oh god That almost got me FUCK!! No! No! DON'T you ‚ô™forget about me‚ô™ It's 'cause I tried to dodge the barrel. So it's all about barrel management. YEAH, baby!! Fucking roundabout shot for the win! Oh, I didn't think I was actually gonna do it there. I was so concentrated I didn't expect it. A- too! Oh, 'cause I got the parries. Ooh, maaanly men! That feels good. Always feels good, it's always nice to- It's always nice to be able to make some progress 
in this game. It may feel slow, okay 'Charge shot' would've been handy for that. I know I said (I didn't mean it) But it turns out I did. I want to see what this level is Okay flying fish... no biggie Oh god. Oh god. Huh! Ah, I wanted to parry you bitch Okay, I'm gonna switch to this so I can just get a lot of shots going on at once. So every time I go somewhere, something's happening. Aah god. I thought one of my shots was... Ooohh Nice, Nice Okay This is scary level I- there's a lot of shit happening on screen all at once,
all the time. And I don't like it. Don't- do not- don't care for it. Okay Ahh, I knew I'd get hit Oh god, oh god, are- are you safe? Something tells me you're safe. I'm safe on top of the safe. Oh, don't land on that! Okay, everything's killable. Which is nice. Oh christ, oh christ Just go,  just fucking go. Just- just go, just- FUCK! How far did I get? That wasn't even halfway. "The Fish Federation and the Crustacean Nation are victorious once again!" Okay,  well you know what? I've been doing this for an hour. I didn't mean to exit to main menu. Let me just try something here all fancy-like. I've got these bad boys going on, which should be able to help me do a thing. I also got some lobby-bombs Aargh, FUCK OFF! *Frustrated noise* Not a fan. Not a fan of the fish. Not a fish fan. Somebody had to fuckin say it. Somebody had to put those fucking fish in their place See, now I can actually hit this guy. Couldn't do that before. You see what's happening? You see what I'm doing? Do you see? Now I just stand here and kick the shit out everything that passes my way. FUCK OFF! FUCK YOU!!! What are fish even doing in the air anyway? I'm scared of that guy I'm very scared of the abilities that he's able to 
conjure up It's a bunch of bullshit is what it is. Where even am I, Sarge? Just- just lay it out to me. Lay it out to me straight, sarge. Huh?! Where does one go from there? Can you parry and then dodge again? Doesn't fucking matter, where is the ground? Every time going into this section with one health. 
Every time. I just like it is all I don't know what that is. I don't- I don't- I don't know what that is. I don't- I don't know what it is, I don't care. I don't fucking care. *distant yell*
My life is a lie! Yeah well, thank you guys so much for watching this episode, if you liked it PUNCH that like button in it's

Top of the morning to ya ladddies, my name is Jacksepticeye and welcome back to Subnauseous! Right, so its 2:25 a.m. right now. I went working out and exercising and everything at fucking 1:30 a.m. And now I thought I was sitting down on it. And after i did the run I sat down I read the comments on cause episode 6 of this just went up on the channel today that day and I like I'm way ahead- Oh hello Peeper! Aw, he wants in you want in come here come here Come here! There we go he just wants in he wants into the ship Can't fucking drop him can I drop him here? god dammit Fine there you go be free Did he come back? No. I was sitting down I was reading the comments on part 6 and some people are giving me some Fantastic info and some people give me some suggestions and everything and I feel bad Because when I read the suggestions, I'm like oh why didn't I do that yet, and then I'm like two episodes ahead So that's like all the other All the advice and all their feedback and all the tips and everything that people are giving me. I can't utilize them immediately And I'm sorry I know how frustrating it might be to watch some of these episodes and be like, "Jack I told you to do this then" so, the biggest thing that somebody told me that I had no idea even existed because this was never a thing This wasn't a thing before somebody said "Jack. There's a-" thanks, somebody say that there was an upgrade module for the Cyclops in they said it was a fabricator module in the Cyclops in the engine room and at first off I thought it was this and I was like. No that's just a thing this isn't the engine room it's like Oh, maybe they're talking about this where you can access the upgrades Oh no, no. Oh no, no. I'm just an idiot, and didn't realize there's a whole fabricator here for the Cyclops and inside that There is the docking bay repair module that I got a piece of like four episodes ago And never seem to cross my brain again. There's a sonar upgrade, a shield generator and energy efficiency module There's the depth module mark one And I was saying what the fuck do I get that all I have is mark two and mark three Where do we get the first one? Here's the fire suppression system thing that I got here's the decoy tube upgrade. Oh wait That's just an upgrade Cyclops thermal reactor module which I'm assuming is that it's a thermal reactor so the closer I get to heat the more energy I get back I Don't know maybe it still uses Parsons, but this this is what I want a depth module upgrade Hell yes, so I wrote down a little list of things to get the first thing I need to get is some Ruby as you saw in the depth module and some magnetite and Somebody did give me a piece of advice as well saying that magnetite is on God I have the itchiest nose there's like a little hair in here ehhhh stoppp Somebody said magnetite is on the alien base Island, and I did not see any but I think the icon for magnetite has changed. I think it's different From what I remember seeing so what I want to do first off what I want to do is Have you hop out of this Because I haven't named you yet. Oh, please make it. Please make it. Please make it. Please make it Aw no i'm right at the cusp That's the worst place to be When you're at the cusp you can't keep boosting, and you can't keep your footing so you have to fall off It's annoying as dicks. Okay, and just plunk you that Punk you in here. Can I? Okay, now Sally. I know you're all comfy-cozy, but it's time to wake up Sal Time to wake up and go to work Okay, you're going over here because I'm Ah Thanks, I'm bringing you out. We're going over to the island with you, but I haven't named my frickin prawn suit yet My prawn suit used to be called Pepper And you're not color-coordinated either everybody else is out there, and they all have their colors already But you don't have anything you are going to be called prawn suit- Pepper Yeah, because Pepper the prawn suit. You know I liked it Up we go and green, yes, your name is going to be white just so I can see it a bit better Why didn't your name change to white? Whatever interior Oooooh Wait I need I need to figure out where this stripe is I need to color coordinate okay? We're gonna make the interior blue as well Just sort of oh look at that That is fantastic also on my list is the cyclops upgrade one if I get magnetite then I'm able to make the seamoth upgrade two For the depth so I'd be able to go way deeper with the seamoth actually I think the seamoth only goes to like five hundred then which is still good, then I need to get the prawn suit grappling upgrade Which is here so I need An advanced wiring kit in titanium time five. I think I can actually make that now But I'm gonna wait a little bit because I'm not gonna be using- get off my Pepper! I'm not gonna be using the prawn suit just yet Name didn't change color whatever and then after that the seamoth storage upgrades So people are asked me isn't there storage in the seamoth But it's an upgrade module now. I think I think ages and ages ago. It was just a thing that was attached That you could access it anyway, and I could put a bunch of stuff in there But now I think it's just an upgrade module so I need oh yeah, I got stuff Okay, does anybody have titanium? Here we go- one, two, three Is that what I needed, I don't know aerogel you can go in there my little flask Can go over there as well and my benzene And now take care of my benzene my benzene is very good. I forgot I had the world's supply of lithium, diamonds and gold now because of my trip to the fucking Wonka Factory And there's more Jesus Christ. Oh, I have a salt deposit You can never have too many salt deposits, so I wanted to write these things down after taking advice from you guys Thank you. By the way. It's always nice hahahahaha Ha hahaha Oh the little frog legs sticking out- you look like Lucio! But now everythings color-coded I like it But I really appreciate everyone giving me tips because as much as I've played this game And as much as I'm going through it my brain is so focused on the tasks that I want to do at that time That some a lot of stuff classes over my head like I miss PDAs or some that I missed in the Aurora I was swimming across and I missed finding one on the ground because I'm just so Paranoid about my food and my health and all that kind of stuff so Apologies I may eat a nutrient block just so I don't have to deal with that garbage Do I have any water left? No, oh wait wait wait wait wait. I was getting ready to build something right here right now. I needed to build a storage module for Sally Wasn't here I needed lithium I knew that and I just forgot to pick it out Pick it out of your arse people always ask me as well why I give all the the ships names and Well first off if you've watched me for any length of time You know that I give everything names all the time in all my series, I call things by names rather than by the thing just because I love it I love calling things by names because it gives them a character it makes them a character in the game like the Sally feels like a character in the game now because I've called it Sally so much and not just seamoth and Maria is actually like a character And it feels like a small character in a big character and Pepper- Pepper still kind of a new character cause I didn't have the prawn suit as long I Still didn't even- oh I did do the thing what am I fucking doing? I'm so confused It's an actual thing that I have to install Didn't go in but it went in at the same time. What the fuck... It didn't go in cause I dropped it, equip, here we go It's this little thing in the side- right, so for now imma put this shit in here I really should have just disposed of this somewhere else But I want to free up space I want my my actual inventory to be completely full But doesn't it feel like they're characters now And it feels like to have a personality and plus it feels like I'm not just playing the game alone That we actually have Other characters that we can talk to in the game, and as their voices is talked back to me and I dunno it just rounds out the whole experience, it makes it more fun for me And that's what I aim to do in every game that I'm playing is to just make things more fun I can always knock a lot of fun even out of the shittiest a games just because, I don't know I like games I like dicking around. I like having fun by myself I was gonna say something I remember- oh god you guys are all infected even out here now So that's the se- disease, the disease. What was it called? The Kharaa infection or something? (*psst Kharaa Bacteria) We get to know more about that a little later on but I hear ya I hear ya.. so I really should look up what magnetite looks like now. I think this is like a big deposit of it. Oh wait maybe not Naw that's lead Or maybe it's in the caves? I don't know if it's actually on the outside of this Oh, another thing I want to write this down before I forget is a scanner room Cause somebody in the comments said the scanner room is much better in this version of the game I don't know how true that is. I- last time I use it, huh you're just a fucking crap- last time I used a scanner module. It was it was interesting but a lot of that stuff, just kind of wastes time It's the same somebody else gave me the advice after it said in the episode to tame an animal for a pet And I did that before I did it with a stalker, I fed it a bunch of fish And then, the stalker follows you around and it brings Items to your base, and it brings metal to your base everything That's all well and handy, but it just feels like it wastes time What are you? Silver ore- Oh fuck... Did he spawn in? I heard him, where did he spawn in? Not you. There he is Woohoo they make a lot more of a menacing sound now But all that stuff just feels like I can find titanium faster myself, it is a good source of enamel or teeth, to make an enamel glass So in that regard yeah, it might be worth it But otherwise it's like nah I can find that stuff myself a little easier And it's just a pain in the ass to get them because they don't stay tame for long All right, I don't know if magnetite is the thing I get in or out of water, but we should go back looking through the cave anyway Are you getting to night time again?
 don't do this to me again. Oh shit, there's only six percent in this Right here's what we're gonna do We're gonna unload that battery and then we're going to switch that one and then in the laser cutter, we are going to get this five percent It was six, now it's five cause I need this flashlight I also needed to be daytime, but we can't always get what we wanttt not finding any And I am being like super vigilant with where I look Don't know, I wonder, okay if I Ok, I don't have the materials right now But could I build, like a scanner room just somewhere random Around here and then have that do the work for me if I put like a solar panel on it outside Will that work? There's a diamond. I don't want more diamonds, normally yes, but right now. No, thanks Then the scanner room could just scan for For magnetite and scan for Ruby That'd be pretty fucking neat actually There we go there's some Okay sweet, so I just had to go really far down then beside the island to get some and also a little closer to GrabbyMc-Bitey-Face over here now, okay? He's actually further away than I thought he was All right neat!- ohhhhhhhhh The fucking Warped Tour is down there really One piece of magnetite you're gonna do me like this- aha! two piece magnetite which makes sense because it's on a thermal vent Magnetite magma Magnemite! Pokemon. That's what I'm all about Ok, I don't want lithium and all that shit okay, grin and bear it grin and bear it. Ouch! My bones! And my skin- fuck offff rear, warp, dick. I'm all confused I don't know how much magnetite I need, probably not as which is all this but I'm here I'm grabbing it. It's happening. I'm just happy that I'm finding it Should have known too- this is where I got it the last time isn't it? Shit ton of lithium down here as well. Let's go to- NO! Oh Jesus Christ. Okay that got me Fuck I am out. I am gone! No more of this SHIT Don't laugh at me. Don't laugh at me. It scared you as well don't lie Seek my dick Sorry Sally I don't mean to take it out on you, it's not your fault because I was wondering about the Reaper I was like how much closer am I to him am I am. I pretty close could he get me and there are sudden yeah Whoa be still my babby heart I'm fucking dying, man Yeah roar roar, boo! Righty righty! I think I have all the pieces Thanks I installed the locker and a fabricator here. Just in case I need to start well I want to keep items here that I need for this shit, so I have the plasteel ingots, the magnetite and the enameled glass I might need something else. Oh the actual depth module Okay, well I need to go get that out of Sally I don't think I can get it out of you while you're in the Cyclops so I'm gonna have to gonna have to plop you out for a sec Sally. You're fully charged anyway, so you should be fine Oh wait, I just popped her and then I didn't even take the thing okay No access upgrades, boom! Thanks At least that's one upgrade got It's not the best one because it's still like other things can go further than the seamoth already But it's still an upgrade for Sally, Sally's a big baby now Sally's a big girl. I think she can go to 500 meters Can you go to 20,000 meters now Sally? Is that is that what's happening? Well 500 meters okay, that's still good that means now she can go down as far as Maria can go Which is great cause then I if I can bring her around and then I could just pop her out and go around as well, but Maria might just be for taking out the prawn suit cuz Maria can go down to 500 and then you eject and get the prawn suit out so I'm almost close enough to be able to get the upgrades for the prawn suit the drill arm and the grappling the the two most vital ones basically Grappling I have the benzene, titanium 's easy, advanced wiring kit- ok that's stuff I can get Diamond and titanium, I can make this one right now I have the diamond and the titanium so all I need to get is some is an advanced wiring kit, which is What again? It's a computer chip. Gold and a wiring kit, so I need two silver ore, gold, Copper ore, I might actually have all these things just lying around Which would be fantastic ok I'm gonna keep these things in here. No not you Just for the sake of upgrades except you you're just Yeah, just stay in there It's always nice to have more storage, I knew hoarding all that gold and all that diamond and everything would come in so handy Cause now I didn't even have to go anywhere. I was just able to make all this stuff where I was That's fantastic, ok. Now we should have two upgrades for Pepper Grappling arm Hi diddly ho Aw five titanium, shit, I forgot the both of them needed titanium. I don't think I have that on me do I The most basic of resources and I really just don't have any of it laying around I mean of course I don't why would I? It's not it's not even worth storage to me, but that's what that logic is Usually just find metal salvage laying around the place. God, nighttime just comes in no time I don't like it I'd rather have none of that wait- do I have any titanium? No, which means I need to find two pieces of metal salvage, ok top screen can go way I hate the top screen on the sea glide There's piece anywhere you find those stalker bastards you'll find metal salvage anyway the screen that shows up on the top of the sea glide kind of showing you the topography of the area. I really don't like that display I don't find it useful, and I find it obscuring to my view because especially at nighttime, so it gets in the way of everything I wanna just see what's in front of me. Okay here we go, no, oh you don- OW! How did you bite me and pick it up gimme gimme mine! Haha, you're it! Tag! Don't don't chase me though you have the bite strength of the fucking, of a s-stalker that's gonna, I was gonna say a shark, but it's basically the same fucking thing Especially in this world. It's okay Pepper. I'm here. I have the upgrades that are needed. Now we're making decent progress This is really good getting that magnetite kinda changed everything Even though I could have made these prawn suit upgrades Last episode I guess Just to get it in my head that I have to make them all at once, otherwise they're all kind of useless even though That's stupid That's not how that works What am I doing? Oh, I need one lithium do I not have a lithium on me? Mother of God you both use lithium? It's so much fucking back and forth I also have just an assload of lithium And i'm not using it. Well I am now But it was all these little things that I could have built- wait what could I build in here? Hull reinforcement? I don't want that there's all these little things that I could build but I never did or never went near them because Because I can't do anything immediately Cause even having these is like well cool. I can't really go anywhere though I did not want to get into you But I guess we're fucking here now aren't we? I wanted to just access your upgrades There we go so boom and boom oh cool, they go in the arms, and they can have four other upgrades as well That's nice. Ah look at it So badass give it the one-two punch so the reason I don't use the torpedo arm is because Normally, I just get away from stuff If it's gonna attack me plus, getting the torpedoes means that you have to constantly restock the torpedoes you constantly have to find all the resources for our torpedoes and then put them into the Thing and then you can only carry so many of them, and it's just it's too tedious. I'd rather just run away from things It's much easier But drill arm lets me mine all those deposits, so I can get way more of what I need now I just need to find big chunks of them, so I happen to go everywhere and grappling hook arm is just the most Necessary because let's face it It's fucking amazing it gets you everywhere that's needed plus it helps you get into the Cyclops sometimes Which I'm gonna do I am actually gonna do this right now? My check just to see what I needed for Some other upgrades. I think I need Ruby, but that's the main thing and some of the areas where I can get Ruby I'm gonna need Pepper. Upgrade module two an upgrade module one Okay, I need nickel ore nickel ore is Where do I find nickel ore? Don't tell me that down- I know I find kyanite in the active lava zone or inactive lava zone I don't find nickel there as well do I? Either way I still need more Ruby so I need to go off and find out so Sally you hang tight for a hot minute, I'm gonna bring Sally or Maria down closer to you Thanks I sure fucking hope so, that's the way I left them, okay? Oh, yeah, I love that that's cool wait why do we only have fifty seven percent? Who's been using up all my- energy Okay, let's go forward Need you to line up with with the belly There you go, there you go, there you go Okay cool now. Just get into you and fly you up, but seriously. What's using up all my energy? Does my Power Cell tactic not work anymore? You're at 0% boom Okay wait, what's your energy at now? Is there any way of checking that what I having to go into the cockpit fuck Now your at 73 the hell is using up all my energy I guess I am Using a lot of shit all the time. I did use the fabricator a lot. That's probably a big one and charging this obviously uses some energy from the Cyclops, but you're hoping that it charges faster than it depletes the energy necessary so then when you put it back in you're always kind of at a surplus of energy But also this one was probably using up a lot of energy as well. This is a 38% jeepers Here we go So I might just make a second power cell eventually anyway, so that I always have two here I And just keep going, Oh wait? What did I need for? For this Okay, I need Ruby for that if I could just find a shit-ton Ruby, then I'd be able to upgrade the Cyclops a lot and the Cyclops already goes to 500 so upgrade modules for that will go a long way but Pepper It's your time to shine we are going to some very dangerous places Wait do you have storage? Oh you just have? You just have storage anyway, that's fantastic because we're going you need it I Feel like that got better I feel like the base boosting No, I'm not talking about your doctor beats dre bass boosting. I'm talking about the bass boost thing that's in the In the prawn suit by default now Feels like that's not how that works you're going backwards and what you should be doing It's not how you reverse Anyway whatever I feel like the regular boost in the base Model of the prawn suit like jumping and setting yourself into the air I feel like that's a lot better than it was before Just get some speed going I know you don't need to tell me every single time. Tell me once and then I'll figure it out Blood kelp yeah, we might have to go over into that area Okay when you when you say that then I'll slow it down when you're saying that it's overheating. I don't trust myself then anymore Blood kelp, how deep is the blood kelp? This is all stuff? I used to know but it's like random knowledge from the game. Oh, I like that when you go down. He actually pushes the thing forward and then going up. He pulls it back like a plane That's neat I never noticed that Can we find some reefies? I haven't seen reefbacks this entire episode so far. It's making me sad- HEYYY REEFIES! Somebody said when I say that sounds like hairy fees wait Do it Do it. There we go I think it's just coincidence man that that works See I've done it five times and one out of five it works, so I don't I don't know man How deeper we? 58 meters we're going down in here Speed it up for bit, I have no fucking patience for it This whole area down here is where we're going and I'm hoping there's some Ruby down there. There was blood oil and that's decent but I don't know You also kind of don't want to let your prawn suit out Over a hole because if it goes beyond 900 then you might not be able to pull yourself out of it and then that's fucking bad ok also beware of Reapers Oh woah woah woah there's a big fucking wall in front of us Ok we're at. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know I know I know I'm very close to a lot of things Oh my god, there's two warpers Oh shit, okay fucking we're doing it pulls a steam, man You churched almost This ecological biome much is seven of the nine preconditions for stimulating terror in humans Thank You Cindy There's no what I want to hear okay? Wait how many how much water is one of these give me plus three? How much water is one of these give me? What's Okay won't pray for me I really just want to get down in here Geez that's a big giant piece of gold oh god no Don't we fucking go into hell oh Okay, I'm hoping my drill arm still acts as kind of fuck Still acts kind of like a semi weapon Okay, just go down. Just go down. Just go down thoughts those bastards. Oh Give me like my legs are fucking shaking I feel like you just need to keep bouncing my feet cuz I hate this Go down to these types of areas is the worst part of this game the best, but the worst part of this game I Love it, but I hate it if somebody had 400 meters good god Forgot how far down you could go Not seeing any Ruby though seeing a lot of you ran a knight is that what that is What are you right-clicking me for Sina can right-click this why they pull it off the wall It never hits it exactly though, whatever Lot of blood oil good off I need more of that Just getting out to collect it it seems like I can collect it Wit the prawn suit, but it's not really working the way it seems to So I'm just gonna fuckin gather. Whatever I can and leave Rosie Rosie I Like that they changed the sound of the warper because now when you hear it Before it just had a sound as a creature, but now when you actually hear that like word You're just all automatically on edge like worth of where the fuck. Where is he? Where is he where do I avoid? Is he here? Oh... Jesus, do I dare? Do I dare? Oh Go-d! Aw, he's right there! I don't like it! I don't like it! There's another one! oh Fuck fuck fuck fuck thiis! Oh, lava zone! What?! Whoa, we're here?! Okay, what the fuck is chasing me, go away. There's the big giant skull of like the really ancient creature I Get fucked piss off Dude I did not even know we were close to this area oh And I can come here oh man, so For any of you who are new to this series who are new to subnautica This is like one of the the later areas in the game This is a place that I'm supposed to be later on because a lot of stuff forward in that direction Is very very useful to us And it's kind of where we're going to have to be to get a lot of this stuff to end the game But this thing right here Is just fucking nuts look at that I'm not a crazy piece shit right there. I Really wish there was a creature that big in the game as big as some of the creatures are in the game I would just love one fucking colossal creature Like one, that's just unfathomable And if you notice these as well these are some of the pipes that we saw before oh There they are Whoo I said in the last of last episode episode 4. I can't remember. I said that there was a creature I hadn't seen yet that make my favorite noise in the game That's them that's them it's the crab squids go away go away go away go away go away go away go away Oh wait, wait wait okay? They make the cooler sound in the whole game, I know I kind of Okay, face through a wall. I know I can t scare them off, but they also send out EMPs that like cripples your electronics They don't need that right now. Oh Man I love this area This is like white fire one of the cooler areas in the game Can't believe we're here already Jesus. I Didn't think I could actually get down here in the piloncillo. You should have fucking do that last episode then Crap I didn't bring any purple tablets with me Could have gone in there got a lot of this technology But that's kind of stuff though. I want to get all at the same time I want to make sure that the upgrades I have I have a lot of them Oh Ruby nice Sweet dude, so I can get Ruby down here That was not my plan my plan was not to come here at all As I said I didn't even think I was this close to this area Because I normally go a different direction they go under the big giant island, and then there's a gap in the Grand reef that brings you into the deep grand reef And then you end up in this kind of area except you come in in an area down to the right down here Super cool fucking love this section of the game And yes, this is one of the later areas in the game towards completion we're still nowhere close to the end I I still have a lot of work left to do to get there But I am just so glad that I'm getting all this freaking Ruby I'm so glad. I have this rebreather as well So I should have brought some beacons with me God dang it We really could have put some stuff down and being like Oh warpgate, and then I'd know where I was going in general oh Yeah, baby look at all this Ruby So as soon as I'm able to build better Cyclops upgrades or prostitute upgrades I'll be able to go way further down because as deep as I am now I'm at 600 meters some of the later area gets to 1200 meters I think so double this and Again if you haven't seen the game Before you are about to see some shit, man. You're about to start seeing okay. This is all hiccupping You're about to start seeing like the coolest section of the whole game you thought the shit we were doing before was cool nah, dude This is where the real fun begins God I love this game Cuz I love these areas where you're on the planet you're on the surface You're swimming around and there's a few caves here and there you're like. Oh, this is cool I've kind of seen what the game has to offer now and then all of a sudden you find like these tiny gaps in the ground and You go into an your neck, huh? this is a bit deeper than I thought it was gonna be and then it just goes fucking deeper and deeper and deeper and then areas that were just underwater with the ground underneath you Now you have underwater with the ground above you with another ground below you and you have this entire Level of the game that's all just within another section of the game, it's fucking bonkers And I eat like anybody who gets to play this game for the very first time Because as of right now. It is 3:30 a.m. But it's technically the 23rd But 23rd is basically tomorrow's so the 23rd is when this game actually comes out fully public release the version I am playing right now goes live tomorrow for everybody to be able to play it's a full game now and Anybody who has never seen anything got to do with this game before and buys it on a whim I? Am so jealous that you get to experience all this shit for the first time See seeing a Reaper Leviathan for the first time Having that like well it happened to me this time having that telepathic message to show up out of nowhere the fact that I know what that is and What it leads to whatever you can see this is where I come in? Kinda ruins the surprise a small bit I was so shocked because I had never seen that before but Man just to see all that stuff for the first time and to see these kind of areas for the first time and to experience the lore and the Because I'm not gonna spoil it here, but there is like I'd say about 60% of the story of the game is in this area Because all the other stuff is kind of leading around and being like huh? I wonder why that is I wonder what was going on here When you get to the alien base, and you kind of figure out some stuff and Then this area has all the answers all the answers to all that stuff is down here Because there's there's more of the alien stuff going on and this is a remnant of that because as you'll notice. It's not just The school isn't just it didn't just die here. It didn't just collapse and fall down and like oh, this is where it lay As you can see there's all these like lights all around it. There's all these like mechanical parts all around it Investigating it Oh, is the crab squid back? Where is he? there he is! you hear that like gluk gluk gluk gluk gluk I wanna hear more of his sounds okay around this section is the first time I've experienced performance issues which I mean, is not that bad because the whole game before used to run kind of like this Okay, I want to get near that dude Where'd he even go? Is he glitching through the walls? Okay, those guys sound cool, too So i'ma head out oh There's another Ruby there shit How many did I get? Okay, I got a lot There he is! That whaaa gluk gluk Gluk gluk when I when I played it the first time and I heard them for the first time You can also look up if you look up subnautica crab squid sound If you look that up, you will come to a soundcloud page for the person who made Some of the sounds for the game and listen to that audio file Man, I just love audio and the audio in this game is really fucking good Sorry I'm going for like the last 10 minutes oh It's just so cool This is not where Maria is But it's the way I kind of know to get back out plus We come across more crab squids, and I kind of want to listen to them It all just kind of leads back to the same areas anyway And this this is why the grapple arm is Incredibly vital because if you don't have the boost jet upgrade then you'd fuckin' pissin' in the wind man you'll get nowhere in this area But this bad boy let's you go faster as well Superman Alright this area, terrifying, Oh balls That's the sound of a crab squid When I when I played it the first time I I likened their audio to the Muto's from Godzilla 2014 Was it 2014? Which by the way Godzilla 2014 not the best movie, but one of the best audio designs in a movie And believe me I fucking love audio so much good audio Is almost better to me than Any other part of a movie or a game if something has just really great audio? Then I can I can usually love something just for that alone So I don't I don't say that lightly Godzilla 2014 go watch it Somewhere in this area unable to confirm. Whether it originated on the Aurora A titanium mass? okay, there's a base over there... last time i went there though, it was covered in crab squids Gro go go go go, so awesome See if we can sit and listen for a second Come on do it make some sounds please Haha Oh there's one, do it again That's so cool. I I have a soft spot for stuff that has like deep bass in it So anything that has like a whooo woo woo whoo who Kind of sound to it, I just So good oh fuck you fuck you I think he might have spotted me Okay, I'm trying to aim for that hole. That's up there Shit, oh, shit. This is bad. This is bad This is bad Okay, they didn't get me they didn't get me they didn't get me that's good Okay, okay, okay, okay? We're gonna latch on here stay here for a sec. We still have boost recharging while we're stuck here. Oh That scared me Because I was afraid that I would start boosting they cut out my power and my thing would just fall and then the warper would Get me That would fucking suck Okay, okay, okay stick to something stick to something Okay, we're out of that area, but that's the Deep grand reef And this is the grand reef Leaves a sparse reef it gets very confusing to try and keep up with the fucking names in this game. I Just know the areas by what they look like and what's in them But we should be able to get back to Maria pretty easily from here well It'll take us some time because this thing is slow as molasses There's all the way over there Jesus That was one hell of an experience we're gonna do that plenty plenty more times in this game, but You never forget your first time Maria Maria I'm coming home. I'm coming home to Maria and I am coming home. Oh Finally back in safe arms. Oh, I like the little clothes strip on the top. That's very cute Maria did you get it upgrade while I was gone Thanks Maria we love you Uh Hawaii wait did that happen when I hit the horn. This is the music that played before isn't it? Yep, yep, yep, yep, that's like blood kelp music hear that like gurgling sound Okay Weird where's your hatch there? You go nice and easy from Clairol there we go Get pepper back up in this bitch, and we're heading home. Hey best friends. We're back Did you miss us we missed you a lot, it was terrifying out there we almost died Several times we're back, and we're loving life who is a message This is life. Pod, two coordinates attached. We're way past our safe depth and bleeding o2 we'll have to swim for the surface But it's 500 meters straight up We'll make for the rendezvous and keep you posted out signal location uploaded to PDA Oh Seeker fluid intake. Are you and your fucking fluid intake I feel like Feel like I've been at Life pod, too, I Say that for every life pot. I'm always that So with the Ruby as well now where did I put them here? Ruby is not only good for The the upgrades that I want to get ruby is also used to make aerogel and With some aerogel. I will hopefully be able to make a water filtration system So I need for it I Know I'm in desperate need of water right now. I'll get their water filtration machine copper wire and titanium. I only want aerogel fantastic Okay, but first I'm dying, so let's take care of that wait a minute My able to do this already Yeah Sally got her third upgrade No way Ida plasteel ingot leftover. I mean I still have to make more but Sally can now go that far Sally can go as far as we just were and further Than the prawns ooh Well, she ignored the same depth as the prawn see, but we only got to like 600 meters there I'm hoping to make some pretty substantial upgrades right now I firmed a lot enough for what should be three more upgrades for stuff Which a lot of upgrades ok we're going to dismantle her aquarium. I had to take my little dudes out I Couldn't I couldn't take them anymore Because I want to put something on the outside of this which is a scanner room Can I yes? Would you need a table coral sample to make a scanner room Oh get that okay? That's number one number two was Something else that I need to get in here for That hopefully I can build okay kitty you're gonna have to come down okay, my water filtration is coming in here. Oh Finally Yes, I forget what you put into this salt I Know I have to figure that out in a little bit So that's cool, and we have our scanner room here and also one last upgrade Which involves our girl Maria over here? And I should be able to give her the depth module mark one Which I'm hoping goes a long way. I don't have one of those do I Know that's the energy efficiency module. Okay, cool cool cool cool cool Yeah Jesus Christ, this is a lot of progress the amount of stuff. I've done in this episode is crazy Boom no she everything goes to 900 meters now Hallelujah Baba, Guiche Okay, and then what do I need for the rest of her then? Cyclops Doesn't say Why can't I see I want to go out back out here, but I free up a bunch of my inventory hey Yep, my inventory was full I'm gonna go out here into the moon pool for a second and see Can I build upgrades for the Cyclops here Okay, so I need nickel ore for that and then any kyanite for that one Kyanite, it's gonna be have to have to be gotten where we were but I'm gonna leave this episode here Jesus that was a lot of progress Thank God the last episode was a bit of a stop-start all over the place kind of session, and we got some upgrades But this one was just gangbusters nice back You want to get into getting a little buddy? So we got what did we do we got a bunch of upgrades all our stuff is way more upgraded now Which I'm very very happy about and it all started with that magnetite And you guys got to see they Was the ticket what's the name of that The Lost River Is that the name of that area we were? Before the lava zone is that the place with the Giants cool. You got to see that place? You got to see the deep grand reef. You got to see the crab squids which I love We put an upgrade in Sally we put some upgrades in Pepper We actually took pepper out for a run got very very far. We have some upgrades in Maria now as well Jesus hallelujah Things are about to start kicking off now again we can actually just go full force ahead again with more upgrades and Another part of my upgrade plan is to start moving this whole entire base to a different location so Ideally what I want to end up doing is having my base Down near that really deep area because but what I have to start doing then is making a thermal generator, which Do I not have it I Might not have it yet. I thought I'd eat Whatever would figure that out, I do need a thermal generator at some point and then you connect all the power nodes and The lavas on then we'll give the energy for that place that I need or I could just make a bioreactor Either way because if I have a farm and a bioreactor. I basically have endless power it's just nice here because you have the Solar panel I've talked enough this is long ass episode, but thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face like like a boss! And high-fives all round But thank you guys, and I will see all you dudes.. in the next video! That made me happy that episode invigorated me it is now 4 a.m. 
(Whoopsh~!) Top o' the morning to ya laddies! My name is jacksepticeye and welcome FINALLY!! to the Shadow of the Colossus remake! the Remaster remake!! I don't know! This is the PS4 version of the game. And I'm so beyond excited to play it! I've been waiting for this S- ever- ever since the announcement my enta- my anticipation for this game is through the roof. And I'm going to be playing through the entire game again. I already did the PS3 version of this game, and I did it start to finish. And I'm going to be doing this entire game start to finish again. And any of you who don't know, This is my favorite game ever made. Shadow of the Colossus is and will always be my favorite game ever made. I just love it to bits. It's so fucking good, and it had such an impact on me when I played it as a teenager. And I'm just really looking forward to playing. This version of it-- they've changed a lot, a lot like visuals already just for the temple itself are outstanding. That looks so cool! And they've re- they've completely redone so many different elements of the game; all the character models are way more improved, the colossus have fur now that actually like shakes around. Also when I started up the game. They had a... A Graphics mode. You can do performance mode or What was it?-- cinematic mode? I think cinematic mode this makes things slightly sharper, but because I'm only playing at 1080p it's not gonna make that much of a difference. Cinematic mode is really if you're playing on 4K with HDR and everything turned on, which I will be playing; I have a 4K TV. So I will be playing that after I finish the series here, but for now for the sake of YouTube. I'm gonna be playing it in performance mode. Which! Finally Shadow at the Colossus is at 60fps Which is something if you played the original it ran at like 15? Which was abysmal at times but back then it was like "this game is just so amazing it doesn't matter" and then the remaster of it on PS3 only ran at 30fps, so now we finally have it-- Well, targeting 60fps. So it'll probably slow down now and then when stuff gets really really hectic. But I'm, I'm just I'm gonna embrace this entire game, again. And a lot of this series is probably gonna be me pointing out things that are different or things that I notice are different or little things like that but OH! I am so excited. *mild stutter* This is always such a weird game to commentate over because it's my favorite game ever made so I.. Don't know. I don't know how to do this. Oh!!! The adrenaline's pumpin', man! This was like when I got to play, uh, The Last Guardian for the first time. Show me my boys; my boy, and girl, I guess. There they are, look at them go. Oh, Agro. I get it Agro, going downstairs into a dark...hallway is not always the nicest. And everything's so detailed and I normally gush about the graphics and games already imagine what it's gonna be like for this series Every minute little detail, coz I-- I know almost everything about this game Which is funny coz I still get lost going to some of the Colossus colossi, I guess Wander looks weird Wow There they are! But the statutes are so detailed as well-- Oh, your face looks bizarre!! What happened Wander? you look like a little chubby cheeked baby now? Listen to that music! Ah Awhh one of the best soundtracks ever made for a videogame! God it's so crazy to see Jeez all the details of his clothes and everything! Look at their little toes! Ah, The cloth animation is still similar. Hahaha Oh, weird!! That's so bizarre Tell me Emon ((Runic speech begins)) The subtitles start acting weird and filling things in, sorry, but this is going to go on until the monologue is done don't worry, if these subtitles are bothering you and you need them, just move them around the screen to a spot you like Did he say cock? hehehe my bad She's all like round-faced as well I'm wondering if they changed any of the voices or the sound effects in general coz the soundtrack is just identical *Agro is nervous* It's okay, Agro. *epic sword reveal* Ooo, nice Hm. Okay then they're gone *excited giggling* DOormin *deep amused laughter* That's a freaky voice aye x5 heheh So weird sounding You gotta go fight giant monsters wander Brave boy! ohmyGod it's so cool. Aye x4 My God we're in oh yeah Okay, maybe not yet, okay, give it a second, and then we'll be in now we're in "Aise renly" wait press X to jump? Whoa! they changed all the buttons Ahh, I mean that makes sense. but I didn't know they were changing all the buttons Ah yeah, so some stuff I might be mistaken on cause I can't remember what's from the actual full original Game but Well couldn't they just press left and right arrow or left and right in the d-pad to cycle through my weapons now It's just press left and right to uhm to take out the sword holdupthesword Okay, okay, actually be in sunlight "Press triangle or X when you're near Agro to mount" ah now it's press triangle to make Agro run faster, triangle used to be jump That's weird Holy shit look at that oh my god the game has grass Also high frame rate Kinda want it. I kind of want to test. This is what the game looks like now I kinda want it Can I do it on the fly? Cinematic mode yeah, so that's that's what 30fps looks like I don't even know if that shows up well in the video that is choppy as all hell and stuff looks slightly sharper, but not enough to keep that on Look how smooth that is oh my god butter butter in my eyes. I love it!! And Agro looks cooler, the rocks are so sharp... Let's play map Oh, the map is so high-res.. OH I'MGIDDY!! I'm gonna dri-- d'uh-- As many times as I've played this game. I can fucking blast through this game I could fly through this game if I really wanted to well assuming that the controls still feel similar to what was in the original Or in the other remaster But I'm gonna try and take my time with this series Just because so much has changed Stuff isn't just flat textures anymore it actually looks like rocks and grass The lighting is so nice one thing that people are worried about with the game. Is that the art style has changed too much Because if you remember from the other one the sky was always like really bright white and the game It was always notorious for having this like really strong bloom effect to try and give it sort of an otherworldly feel that this is not a place that you should be and that it's not a place of man so to speak so It might look a little worse art-style wise like the sword also. Just looks like a regular sword now whereas in the original It was definitely like black in the middle and white on the outside it was very very contrasted, so you could see it very clearly so this stuff all being changed might be a little weird to look at But this is like this is basically what it would look like if Shadow of the Colossus was realistic Put it that way. I don't like Wander's face That's one thing. I really don't like so far But everything else looks fucking phenomenal I mean the framerate alone is worth it Cuz Wander's face, oh wait we haveuhsa-- we have a photo mode as well Ohh.. So photo mode There's lots of photo modes in games Look at his face. He looks like a baby. I don't like that in the other version I'm going to draw comparisons all the time sorry in the other version his face was a lot more Triangle and angular because it had to be back then like all he had were like polygons and stuff R2 is to grab now? Wait, what was the original grab? It was R1 wasn't it? LeehhHHDOo
(sonorous singing) Like the grass actually sways now, that's awesome Wait what do other buttons do, the square is still that. what's triangle? Oh, triangle is my Agro button. Agro!! Sorry, stay there Agro. "Stay there egg roll" Listen that's your name from now on Agro! Your name's Eggroll for this series Oh wait, what's the button to roll now through it. Whoa, now we just have a dedicated roll button Cuz rolling in the original is crouch and jump at the same time, so now we just have a button. now it's like Dark Souls! now we just roll all we want! that- that's a good change and I thought it'd be weird to get used to these buttons, but it's not these actually works so much better good decision Okay, he feels the same like running around feels similar if anything he feels better. He feels more responsive that might just be the 60fps, tho give it to me show me the Colossus Oh yeah OHyeah OH ho fk! Oh, he looks so good!! See what I mean like the fur on his back and on his leg and everything now when he moves, it actually sways It looks like he actually has hair Whoa Come here ya big, bitch TheOnlyOtherTime to get this game at 60fps as well was to play it on an emulator on PC Whoa Dude you have a hand now!! You never had a hand before well you did, but oh- this glows red now that's kinda cool oh shit, oH shit Because I played this game so many times now there's pressure on me to do well because I'm recording I know I'm not going to It's gonna be so embarrassing if I fail these things Geezus the fur looks fucking awesome And what I mean by him having a hand is that he actually has like movable digits on his hand now oh, oH, OH, shaky bitch God that's fucking beautiful Okay, okay, let me give you a stab lemme give you a stab stab come on man. Oh, you've mad glowing eyes now whoa you've little nose rings! Dude you're punk emo, I never knew that OH So close to dead okay, okay there we go one down Because before their hands were just like this all the time. Oh my god those tendrils look so cool. Imma runaway The sound effects are way better Oh jesus, that looks bizarre Are we going through a fallopian tube? Well actually kind of looks like a wormhole now And there's no like do you want to save after the boss fights? Because everything just Auto saves these days that's cool I'm dead can ya give me a poke? You did it, Wander! one down you can do this She's not alive yet, though sadly Awesome it's crazy the difference like more detail makes My next foe is-- Have to go fight my boy Quadratus Okay you stay there, okay, I'll be back His face is so weird so is hers Let's get a close-up on this face now that I have photo mode He just looks like a baby He's in the other one he looked like he had like determination and everything ol' babyface McGee over here Oh, what's up, egg roll? Nice. Agro also looks a bit smaller or maybe my eyes' just playing tricks on me CozHe's massive in the original version of the game So fucking excited- Pray before it and you can save your game. Well that'll be interesting if there's auto saves in the game How is this gonna work? I guess we find out Alright, Eggroll? I'm going to the altar. I'm gonna go pray for not death *mystical wooshing* Wow That's a very very nice change Not only did it look all sparkly and cool but I don't have to go sit through menus to save or anything anymore I like this game! (no, you love this game.) Okay, ah shit okay new buttons kind of weird! Cuz X is to get off and get on instead of triangle X is normally to make him go! Her go, actually S' beautiful, man.. Be still my beating heart Didn't add anything extra to the game either by the way a lot of people were wondering about that Did they add all the bonus colossi that were supposed to be in the original game, but were cut, but-- BUT I get why they didn't because they'd actually have to figure out the AI's and the path thing for them and create the environments fully like all those things before were just concepts. They weren't actual fully fledged things some of them were probably playtested, but were removed then later on so having to add those would have just added way too much to the game and it also would have disturbed the flow of the Game because the colossi now are all set out in specific patterns That you you face certain one certain times for different reasons Good god oh my God look at the water. It has waves it actually looks like water!! That's awesome!! :0 "Is this real life?" I still can't believe I'm actually just playing this game It's one of those things that you wait for so long again like with the last guardian you wait so so long for it And then when it's finally here, you're like "wait, I'm actually playing this!!" This is the thing and then you kind of take it for granted, so I'm just Taking my time. I'm taking it all in Otherwise I could have this episode without the cutscene at the start. I could have this episode over in like 15 minutes And I probably going to keep the same pattern as well of doing like two colossi per episode But, as i was saying, like, the first guy you fight is the simplest Colossus just get up, stab-- actually stabbing him in the leg and-- d'oh-- Stabbing him in the leg and making him bend over. That's-- it's something you wouldn't really expect for the first, Colossus You'd expect just a climb and stab on the head but whatever, but then this guy Shows you that oh, not all the colossi are actually two-legged. They're not like humanoid They don't walk around like that this one has four legs and walks around like like a dog or a horse or something Or a goat! actually, kinda looks like a goat coz he's horns Yeah, there's a lot less bloom in the game the lighting is a lot more realistic rather than being there the otherworldly like super Bright, shiny sky, and everything glowing all the time which I'm sure will piss some people off but I mean, I like that they tried something different with it kept it the same But tried something different because otherwise you could just play the other version So this this is a nice Iteration of the game to try and show you like this is what it would look like if it was real life so to speak All the stones are all covered in sandy dust Please tell me Agro leaves hoof prints in the sand OH GOD YES It's like the first thing I look to- when I see sand or snow in games Whoa And the beam coming up from where I kill them Oh shit, it actually looks like a frickin' portal now with lightning in it That's awesome!! Jeez, I love this! and if anyone is gonna be hypercritical in this game, It's me. *heheh* But no, I'm really liking alot of the changes so far Sound design being better is one of the bigger things for me Because we have higher fidelity audio just in general these days and everything's like super HD So you need HD audio to go with it Show your face quaddy boy, Quadimodo * "I heard that" - Quadimodo * Look at that furry baby looks like he's mushrooms on him! Which I guess is the point and you can really see how glow-y their eyes are now Pretty sure in the original, they- they still had glowy eyes, but here you can definitely see it Okay, Agro, EggRoll. I'm gonna have to leave you STOP! IN THE NAME OF WANDER!! Can I make your eyes glow red? yeHAH! :D Okay, get ready Fuck yeh! stILL GOT IT! Egg roll! stay out of the way! I got a mission to do! Hup! nice... nice- good speed, good speed. climb. Can you climb? Why weren't you climbing? HUP! Oh God. you decided to shake at the worst moment? WhoAA! WaUW! x2 And the fur all moving around-- okay, why are you backwards? This makes you hard to control Wander. cuz normally you can as soon as you get up You can jump and the game kind of teleports you now, and then when you grab on to things So you can jump further and grab further wow, they actually looked like real creatures now! AH, Come on hold on what are you some kind of bitch? And I like to think the glyphs actually give off a glow That glyph, by the way is my next tattoo The thing that I'm stabbing. the white blueish thing I'm not getting it whitish blue. I'm just getting a simple outline of it because I think it looks fucking awesome Maybe I might get it filled in black So two tattoos from two of my favorite games because whAT? DX How did you fall off? I was holding grip! can i grab back on? oh come on man, waste my fucking time This is what I mean any other time I played and I'd probably be fine, but no the one time I decided to record it things go wrong for you What the fuck is happening? Okay these things That's what I mean. You can jump way further these things are all out of my control! I'm holding grip, but he just wouldn't hold on Normally if you're just holding grip in general you hold on no matter what happens It's one of the benefits of having a fucking grip button Whatever-whatever, we're back up we're ready to go This is not the speed run the speed run will come when I finish the game, and then I do the time trials Right now. I'm just enjoying it. wAUW, SHAKE IT BABY! actually, you're alot more like a bull aren't you? Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo?
(doo-doo's along with the tune of the song) Because when it comes to the time trials Then I'll show you my skills I can fucking power through this game if I want to. oH! shimmy sham Oh! shaky shaky bakey baby! Here you go. Yeah, okay wander. You don't have fucking skis on Wait your'e not dead. Oh man his health bar is blocked by my recording symbol awee :'[ The eyes go dark D: Okay Wander, get off get off, hide underneath him. if you hide underneath them they can't getcha. they can't catch you down here-- dammit! DX They literally always get you you can't hide it all even if you glitch through the wall They would glitch through the wall and get you This is still weird to look at I feel like I'm in interstellar or something I do like that the colossi kind of look more like creatures now they actually look like animals They have a bit more detail on them like the things on his shoulders looked a lot more like mushrooms than they did before So they look a lot more organic mixed with.. Stonework! which was the intention for them to begin with they were like part land part building kind of thing Nicee two down is she-- she alive yet? My next foe is-- my next foe is my favorite foe. The next colossus is my favorite one! A giant canopy soars to the heavens the anger of the sleeping giant shatters the earth So the next one is Gaius and he's my absolute favorite. He's the one that all He's like the face of the game almost That anytime you see like screenshots of the game a lot of the times. It's Gaius because he's just a coolest one Egg roll? There ya are! Poor-- aheh Poor Agro has to run back every single time I get teleported. I'm fine, but Agro has to be like "oh god =H=; " "Where'd he go oh? &gt;H&gt; " "Augh, I don't know. I'm just gonna go back to that temple, at least the girl is there" and then you come back He's like "Oh! you ARE here! Okay cool." *Sick swivel BI* Alrighty! Well, I'm going to leave this episode here. MAN, It feels good to be back in this game! So excited that they get to play it again for a series! I'm so glad that this is what I do! Every single day of my life now is that I get to play cool shit. I get to play cool games like, I get to have really great experiences for the first time and I get to share with so many wonderful people Man this is this makes it all worth it. This is what it's all about So guh-- okay bye Eggroll! See you see you next time ANYWAY! Thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it PUNCH that like button in the face!

Storied history of playing these games of the channel so we might as well play the newest ones when they're out so let's go! We've a PubG, thing, right here. umm... Ahh, Lara what are you doing? Okay, you're gonna count my clicks again? You gonna shame me like that? Why is that level fail? That feels like I did it exactly like I was supposed to. K-   Okay, I tried to click-and-drag you okay, that was kind of a different face though. What did I- Okay, I have no idea what I'm doing to do that ohh! Ohh! Oh, you're gonna get stomped on oh (Jack looks on as a fat and buff Lara Croft tries to fly) Ohh! You were supposed to win not Lara, okay, Jesus Christ alrighty! What do we got my Starcraft dudes? I don't think that's gonna work on her. She's impervious. She got a bulletproof boobs! (???) Okay you did that that's good see now I have to- like worry about clicking and dragging shit all over the place. Why're you trying that again it's not gonna work a second time Okay, pull down the visor is there something else somewhere. Can I can I? Can I? Can I pull a star out of the sky or something? You can click on you, but you're not doing anything for me. Okay a billion clicks. Oh don't click out of the game. Ummmm... Okay, I can't click and drag her, it seems. (Devilish laugh) Sounds like spongebob Really?! Oh sweet Jesus... Okay, I have to click and hold? Oh My god really? Okay. Go! kick'em... kick'em... Kick'em!     Wooooo! Bye!

That's still the same thing okay, try and kick him when he's bent over. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) (Jack is filled with pure disgust and jealousy) I Hope that you're hopping straight to a doctor, holy crap he stuck his foot up his ass! ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) Know everyone's parents always say I'm gonna stick my foot up your ass, but Jesus...! Okayhaha, Is this Wha- okay yeah GTA. (laughter) "Wasted" ah I get it. Umm... I can't click on 'em! Okay wait I can click on them, but I- Now that works! Okay, let's think this through, actually why would I do that none of these things ever make any sort of fucking sense. I'm trying to hold on him. But It's not working! Apparently that did something? Peace out dude! good for you! Oh, I don't have to press something else to I? Oh, thank god Jesus Good. The solutions to these are so obnoxious! You have to like click and hold very specific directions and everything now. Oh is this papers, please?(?) All right no it's hitman. It reminded me of papers, Please because you have a booth. I Want a papers please one. Shit. No change- change the page is what I was going to try to do. I didn't even click you! Okay, okay. Okay, Okay, Where else can I click? Cuz this music all my sounded like Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob dudumm! ooh... Ohhhh! Scan the back of your head there you go (Jackaboy laughter) It's so stupid!

Okay, grab the wigglies ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) Is this supposed to be Slithereo? Slither.io? ohh Jesus, Oh God. Ohh God!! Christ! I never would have played that game if I knew that was gonna happen. Okay, I'm tryna- I'm I'm kind of getting it now Okay, maybe not that was completely unexpected. All I'm literally doing is clicking and dragging on shit now to see what happens Who won? (I don't know what you said) Is that it? Don't tell me that's it. Is that really it?! Oh... Okay... Ummmmm Can I click on anything else right now? Little fucker!  What are trying to tell me to do? No, put the card away, put the card away. I don't want the card. No Okay, I don't know This is what hell sounds like, just everyone laughing at ya all the time. Okay, I don't know! Maybe if I- I clicked and dragged on his card, maybe if I click and hold it. Didn't do anything oh! It's solitaire! Thanks for laughing over 370 clicks in! my Jesus, okay, are you the wolf among us? That's cool game I'm just like clicking- Ohh! Um excuse me?! It's a very very meaningful bark Don't end, don't end. I- I need something else! I'm not even clicking the character. For drag something up if I just click you if I keep clicking you the other one had a bunch of clicks in it Just howling apparently is defeat I I can click on it again If it just keep shaking that work that'll get him Okay Oooh! That worked what the hell were you? Amalgamation creature creepy creature you have to click her a bunch of times, and she fell down okay. Hey, it's Bioshock one Didn't work you need to scare him or scare harder damn it Okay, he's asleep where'd he go? What now? Oh, do you scare him (arcadelike roar) Oh, huho! Cool! Ha! I did it! 530 clicks later. Christ allmighty Wait troll face quest, TV shows? have I done that? I HAVE I have done that one. I don't know if I have done internet memes (dank or spicy?) I Feel like it did a meme one, but I don't know if it was internet memes specifically I don't know. It's so hard to keep track of them. I need to go back and see if I actually completed that one If not, I'm gonna play that one as well because I love these games this one was a bit more obnoxious because some of the solutions I'm fine with the ones that just need a click or ones that need a clicking a drag one its clicking a drag in a Specific kind of direction or if it's multiple clicks like shit's just getting annoying after a while I just want fun little animations. I don't want to have to think But thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face! LIKE A BOSS!!! And, *High fives all around* Whapeesh! Whapeesh!

They're not buoyant enough Dude that boat's not gonna float Yeah, you've got to say You can do it repair it I believe you want a hammer. They could be on our boat if you want Maybe that's his hole, but he's just like ah shit how am I gonna explain this to the cow? Do you think they'd notice he's turning right now. He's looking at it again like hmm something's wrong with this boat I'm gonna fuck him up caz I want to okay? Have fun. He's dead now he never has to worry about a boat ever again. That was a that was a quick fuck up What can I say man I fuck quick? (BOI! THERE ARE KIDS WATCHING LOLOLOLOLOL) At least cuddle after don't just swim away like come on. There's no foreplay with him At least he got a boner visibly Oh I shouldn't have laughed at that No you shouldn't Oh wait kill me your joke. I'm dead I think we deserve a victory tune my dude I agree wait I need to just set our course and then then I'll join in This is the good song this is it the most victory song we have Yeah It is I do hope that they like include some sort of I don't know if some sort of one of those wind-up B Music boxes so you can listen to it when you're alone as well, yeah exactly That's what I want the amount of times you have to like Come away from your boat or away from the steering wheels just so you can start playing your own music. Yeah, exactly Are we onto a big one over there? I think so you know a tall boy. Yeah, we are I mean we ARR yeah pirate talk That deserves a little But the weather's turning all shitty, I know we shouldn't sort of we should sort of head away from here If you go look at the map and zoom out a lot it has like sections now There's like basically like safe shallows and dangerous tides and dewild's wise where we are are now the shores of plenty Yeah, we should go there later. I think the weather is nicer over there Yeah There's only three places? We are going right into the middle of this place so right under that bridge okay with the boat we should cross yeah Okay with the anchor I'm going to drop an anchor Do it n-n-now That was a nice drop you did Oh shit 360 360 map scope should be right on that man. Where should be right under this right? Got it A treasure I have found I mean down in the dirt there be something harder than this hand You know how sad be all horse and gross and it gets everywhere I hate it Yeah, yeah a chest is not like that a chest molecules are a lot closer together. I learned that in pirate school Good good job. I'm glad you learned something I called it pirate science Yarr pirate. That's pirate they always have oh, shit the skulls are coming They always have to relate everything to pirate stuff, yeah, otherwise they can't learn Yarr nutrition food That's their own table of elements so it's all oranges like oranges bananas and cannonballs and gold What in the hold? I keep forgetting that you're a lady because of your luscious mustache. Yeah, how do I drop? X X is to drop? yeah, it's bonkers It's it's silly Wacky game. I like that your map thing now has like a little dot in the middle So you know exactly where you're pointing when you're on the map now you have a little dot in the middle of your reticle. Oh So you can actually click exactly on the island to get a circle That's cool, dude. We're heading the same heading right. Yeah, we're all on the same plane east No no no that was a normal chest though right yeah, I found an admiral Wait (x6) There's another chest Really? Oh shit shit Dawg shit Dawg. Did you see as well they were talking about like endgame stuff for this No. A while ago, and they talked about how like there's gonna be a Kraken and everything in that properly Oh, yeah, if you I saw on the website that it said that there was gonna be like huge sea monsters yeah, so if you're Just driving along in the water all of a sudden. You'll see like black water whirlpools, and then That'd be amazing. and then a Kraken can come up and destroy you I want that Ah I missed I'm gonna be destroyed he got too close Whoa look at this cool place I'm over here killing skelemans goofing around shocking. Oh you see the skeletons can eat bananas really yeah Just here, that's not it no I'm gonna look at the map, okay Wait, which one is this? The top one the booby one. Okay. It's just under a sticky out to bit where's this sticky out a bit Oh this is it so it should be like here I heard a plunk Uh oh uh oh Skelemans Many many men Okay, I don't know where you are I can just kind of hear you okay. It's fine I killed him there were five of them. I saved you, are you safe, are you safe because I scared them? I just saw feets suddenly land right in front of me I was getting into a war cry Wait Can I can I AHH GET AWAY How old are you in pirate years um Well, how many years is a pirate year? One normal human year is 46 pirate years, okay, so I'm at least 460 Cool That makes it probably like 12 years old yeah I don't know the maths to that but a nice go I do not care about math whatsoever. Somebody out there do the math quick cuz I can't remember the numbers Robin said. Quick maths I forget as well Are we heading straight into the wind? Uh yes Yeah shit It's fine. You know why cuz we're partners we have this I miss my dad We're going against the wind It's too much think I should call home more V√©lib sadness I'm happy again now Fuck my family Should have never gone home again. Oh your dude has no teeth I know he's just hahaha, but he looks happy though. Oh happy boy wait see if we can see if I have any teeth Your moustache is in the way I can't see anything. Oh right I like it it's cool Mom I promise I'll I'll send you more messages in Bob home I'm sorry Bob. I never should have eaten that dog Are you ready with the anchor I sure am You can drop him now if you feel like it. Oh, I felt like it and I did it. Oh, it's good. That's cool. Okay, maybe to the left of big rock no, I'm just gonna. I'm just gonna stuff these holes a little bit, okay I found it Oh it's a gold one Ah skeleboy This one is red all over it. Is this a bad one? Yea NAR that's a captain's chest, that's the one I found when it was Dude. We're gonna get so many boat bitches with this Yarr wishes oh We used a one wrenches though you are a wench technically well. That's the thing I think we should be equal in this I think I think we need to come up with a new name caz wenches are women and Colloquially bitches are women too. I don't like that. I want it to be all inclusive What do you call men though in like pirates if a woman is a wench? What is a man? Dogs? A salty dog? So dead a dirty and dirty bastard Well if we combine them and make a new one that applies to all We need a I want some wigglies. I want to take the onomatopoeic feel out of it. You know like wench and bitch have like -ch sounds in them I don't like that. I think we got to go with something that sounds cute like oh, dude We're gonna get so many wigglies with these People are like that sounds cute, and then it's like yeah, we gonna fuck all night, though We could you we could call them What's the what's the word for for squid to like the food? Calamari Yeah, calamaris. Well. I think I see it. Oh no there's a boat Is there? Yeah. There's a bunch straight ahead of us. Uh oh we have so much loot Let's try to like just get to that pile I suppose Fuck dude. They're turning into us now as well. Okay. We yeah I was gonna say where to go, but I think it's pretty obvious when you can just see the outpost. Yeah basically Not gonna be able to get away from this easily, I don't think come on Yeah, did you fall off the boat? No, okay I have I have the really good one so but no one's gonna take this from us Did they come after us? Whoa dude Oh no, they're far away. Did you see how much that sold for? 995 fucking hell, yeah dude Anyway-that's what I'm talking-I cut you off, what were you talking about? I don't know oh, yeah, I was gonna I was just saying that I think Around the outposts like when you're inside of the radius where the like the cutscene and name of the place pops up Yeah, I think if you if you show hostility with that shit. Oh I think that if you if you shoot players within that radius, I think The outpost should like attack you back or like some sort of defense yeah, you need some sort of like bounty and penalty system Yeah, because as it is. There's literally not a single safe space not a safe area to be oh I'm doing it Anyway, we done it we got a lot of money, and we got a lot of shit. We did We are the best pirates those guys suck. Yeah Fricking come here with their big boat. See you don't need a big boat if you can be cool like us We'd be like that meme where it's like who would win giant boat or two salty boys I think the two salty boys win today. Can we try to shoot ourselves up to the boat on top of there? Oh that is exactly what we're gonna do right now Good cuz that's what I'm feeling as well Okay, we're stuck here, so don't have much choice get in I'll aim. Yeah, okay I mean you're going to have to toss me. Okay. Get ready. Okay Let me cover my ears, okay, okay. Are you good? I'm good three two one Spaceman. Ahh it's so much louder. Oh I went over it. Oh no Oh god, oh? Do you feel like you're was about to be devoured by sharks like 20 feet below the ocean I'm just gonna shoot myself into the space Blam Noo. Bye Bloosh So how much do we have now? Sixteen hundred Holy christ. Our boat sounds like it's in so much agony. Yeah. It's not doing well. What's up Cooper? Browse Cooper's stock okay? Wow, you can buy a bison muttonchops or an admiral beard I suppose Do I want a beard for my lady? I want this Bilge Rat Hair. I could buy a peg leg It's exactly what we wanted I know-we talked about-I think we have a normal one? We talked about this shit before where we said we wanted to be able to buy Like peg legs and stuff cuz none of that I don't think any of the characters had them when we played it before no not before yeah Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna buy the peg leg. I'm getting it. It's twenty three hundred how much do you have? I had three thousand How do I equip it in? Yeah, right got equip it in my vanity chest I'm buying muttonchops and it looks very much not that different, but I got it Yeah, you already had one. Oh Yeah, well you have one as well. Do we? Yeah if you go to vanity chest you see those empty slots up top It's next to your hair and stuff you can I think you have default patch and legs and stuff um Who's shooting? There's people on our boat! Yeah, it's just the big ship. They've just shown up to blow our ship away. Hey you guys! Get out of here you salty sailors! Hey you guys Can we shoot them? Feel like we should shoot them. We don't have a rifle No, I mean like with ourselves in the cannons. Oh Okay, we're just with the cannon Shot them with the gun and I mean I died also. I'm getting on their boat Did I kill one? I don't know. I killed one. King piggy 101-Haha I kill 2 of them Really? Yeah he's about to kill me though. I'm very I'm very low on health AHHHH Ow As they appear on the ship Wait oh you're dead Yeah, I was on the on the Flying Dutchman and just waving to them as they their souls appeared They're just gonna show up here again though. Our boats are-yeah We're just I'm just gonna respawn next to the ship. Yeah our boats sank Got em Dude, we're so awesome. I know right. Lets steal their ship. I feel like I should do something. I don't know how to sink ships I don't either. I just know that you can drive them away, that's what I usually do Ok they're back. I need to get off. Are they? Where, where are they? They're on the boat. I'm getting off. I'm on the boat One of them is downstairs and one of them is up on the deck. Can you see me? Yeah Wait I wanna wave too but they're gonna shoot me. Yeah. Wait (x12) Hi where am I? This is spooky place to be I don't feel safe here. Ah he's chasing me ahhh He's chasing-Come here-he's chasing me all the way around I'm dead again. What a shit Yeah, see that's it. That's exactly the problem like now we're just at an outpost and they can just kill us forever and respawn I got another one Nice I was hiding with my sword and he came around the corner, I just killed him Yeah, don't mess with the salty boys Hold on Oh, hello, did you get to the siren just now as well? Yep I clicked it. Oh hey. We came up against some shitheads, we swam away, we got all the money, we got upgrades They came and attacked us and sank our boat, and we still kill them and got away Fuck those guys. I call that a win that was a successful adventure See that type of PvP, I don't mind Dude, come downs by the fire with me I keep forgetting my buttons I forgot to put all my stuff Haha you're an idiot I got mutton chops and I forgot to put them on 
Top of the morning to ya ladies , my name is Jackcepticeye and welcome back to subnautious Im here in my PDA immediately because there was a log i missed a while ago and i still didn't go back to it after saying i missed it, and i think it was lifepod 6? That people said lifepod 6 crew log one. I don't think I've listened to this I need you to stay calm. We're not in immediate danger Where are the rescue teams? The aurora didnt make it So where are the rescue teams? No, I listened to that I cant remember which one it was This one when the altaira crew landed in area of significant alien activity encountered predators in the Leviathan class highly aggressive spectroscope scanner assigned species designator Reaper one specimen attempted to swallow the Life pod doing extensive damage in the process Only viable option is to make the safety of the Aurora crash site I have retrieved a data box with the creature decoy and enough resources to fabricate a couple of them The swims longer than the decoy lifetime, but it should just be enough to keep them busy If you don't find me on board the ship presume. I miscalculated and you miscalculated so Maybe that's not the one that people were talking about but that was one that I didn't actually listen to I did get something for a creature decoy as a blueprint and Lord knows where the fuck it's gonna be in the middle of all this Probably pass it over as well. There's there's a creature decoy that you can make that you put down as Like a reapers gonna attack you and then all of a sudden. He'll attack that instead of attacking you Also, somebody gave me one of the best tips I've had and it's such a simple one is that if I put in a bed I skip nighttime wait how or do I need for bed fiber mesh and titanium? I don't think I have fiber mesh I can get it very easily, and I didn't know that in all the time. I've been playing subnautica I never knew that beds just skipped the night, and if I did know it it was ages ago, and i forgot. Oh yeah I've changed the color of my beacons Henry is still blue the the other beacons are red and Damn it. I'm like what am I full of. Oh god i have a lot of shit. It's still not enough space I destroyed the creep vine as well anyway God dang it Fohkssake never enough space yeah, so Sally is now yellow and That was the tip people gave me after because the episode that just went up is the one where I said I lost Sally so I'm quite a bit ahead in my own playthrough, then the YouTube Let's Plays are keeping up with and I'm trying to take some information as I can have any messages From the comments, but sometimes. I'm just delayed because you know I need two of them I'm delayed because I just have like my stuff is far ahead of that u know I could put up the posters in there Yeah, put a fire extinguisher Extinguishers in here okay? I'm gonna. Have a little base It's not much of a base there's not a whole lot going on, but it's my base Okay I put you you are i only have two posters? Hahaha Keep Calm and hang in there Kitty This one they look awesome I really like those I do have a model of an alterra airship And i dont know where to put you but you I did have a table Should I should I try and build a table again? I have two titanium that should be enough for a table right? Okay, no equip this there we go um interior module Still need to get my modification station I didn't get that oh yeah aerogel I need that badly - Where's that miscellaneous where do you- miscellaneous items a counter - titanium there we go boom Nice I put my little ship here It's cute Not a very complex looking ship, but it's a ship nonetheless. I want to deconstruct Sam and then we can place him on the table as well I Know guys, I'm starting to really like this little base He so what I want to do now is go looking for oh Jesus oh wait, what do I need to make a bed? titanium, fiber mesh I already knew that that's what I'm out here doing I Was getting rid of items so I could go get more creep vines. I wanna do is go get the Cyclops parts and maybe explore the other Island because there's some stuff in there that I desperately need Stuff like the I think that's where I found a lot of the farming stuff or at least that's where I find Inventory full? I'm fucking bad at this No, I have two now right yeah, now. I have enough to make there the thing I just need some titanium now I should have some back at my base Titanium is that one constant that you always have Even though I just used some to build my table so maybe not There we go - titanium, I need to make the fiber mesh, I'm all over the place Cuz now its night time and i dont like night time. I wanna just skip it. That good? okay cool Let me in let me in let me in geez and then a single bed I Don't know about you guys but if I was stranded on a planet like this of course that's going to happen if if this type of scenario happened to me where I was even just stranded at all and As ludicrous as it is to be able to just build things out of nothing in this game that would be such like a huge boon to my system to be able to just sit down and lie in a bed I Don't know I'd like I need to change all the batteries in these because I have nothing but full batteries Here we go so many batteries and then take you Jesus Christ now i have an overabundance Now I have a problem. Maybe I should try building a locker Interior modules a wall Locker, I just need two titanium I have one Surely to God I have some titanium laying around somewhere, right Titanium? No Fucking everything else all right. Oh, I'll be so cool if I could just put the wall Locker there wait wait wait wait wait wait Yeah It makes perfect sense to go here all right so drink that water I'll store two Store three med kits and a store three nutrient blocks Cyclops efficiency module. I can't use yet and these batteries can go out and the fucking flares Oh yet the other poster I had I did have another poster, but it was the one I put inside Henry It's like this one to go right there It's a prawn suit in that cool Very nice, I do also need to find some moon pool fragments. Eventually. I'm gonna take you Put you in the Sallers all right, let's make a move, oh wait no, I've got a bed first Can't make a move until I go to bed until they go to sleepy sleeps even though it's morning time now Well I guess I'm not gonna sleep all righty mushroom forest do your thing and give me items I Am in need of some Cyclops fragments I Do know that You hold some of the hull fragments, and I don't want to have to go to the other place Which I fear remember correctly is the sea treaders path? And that would be terrible I do not wanna have to go all the way over there to do it I don't actually can't even go down that deep right now I don't have anything that can go down that deep I think I had to use the Prawn suit the last time I was down there Crap keep thinking these are like good things But it's just like a chunk of rock that I need the francais to get through. What are you? What do you know? What are you moonpool fragment? Okay, that's also very useful I Will take that moonpool fragment if you can give me another one of those that would also be great cuz that's That's something that's on my to-do list as well I actually thought I was gonna have to wait longer to be able to do that so we get the moonpool then I can put in the the vehicle Bay, and then I can start storing Sally in there and just Messing about with stuff in that regard oh There's a Reaper around but he's the one over near the aurora so she keeps searching around here a lot of people want me to Yes Well, that's the Cyclops bridge fragment. That's still good I Do need that I need one more of those and I need one more Full fragment and one more moonpool fragment a lot of people say to leave this Series uncut I said this before but Whoa what happened to you This is all I'm doing in the sections that are not like put into the series I'm literally just dicking around and looking for stuff. It's not even anything worthwhile. Do not come near me you shits You leave me alone, what is this scanning room fragment? I have that Okay be extra careful No no no no no no no no no no no fucking Mesmer's oh Jesus I've never come across one like that da fuck oh Man this place sucks I'm back in a tin mushroom forest where these guys are these guys don't even want anything to do with me Sure, they don't like me, but they don't gonna beat the shit out of me at the same time The Mesmer's I knew they were in the game, and I think I'd actually seen them before But I can't remember ever having that happen because what they do is they suck you in and then hurt you By like hypnotizing you Okay, give me those fragments I Need another whole fragment fuck So these vents I Talked about them before and I said how cool they were? But people are explaining them hmm like I didn't know what they were I know exactly where they go Yes, no Cool baby Actually now, I might actually Fuck yeah Now just give me that last bridge piece, I know where the events go I know what they're doing I know who they're pumping water to It's just that before I kind of just expunged the entire information of what this whole game was and I felt a little bad about spoiling everything so now I'm just gonna kind of lay back and Talk about stuff as it happens or at least if it's the next thing that I'm definitely doing oh wait Let me radiation helmet on I don't need that anymore Why my oxygen was running out so quick Whenever I get back to Henry I need to remember to put on my rebreather because now I have fixed the seal so now there's no radiation anymore And I didn't find there the pieces that I needed for thing That's gone, I didn't find the Pieces of the Cyclops that I needed, but I can build a moon pool all right now Elaine talking about oh I need to farm for a bunch more stuff I mean as long as I can get enough titanium right this second I have enough I Need to make two titanium ingots So I just need as much metal salvage so they can put the titanium ingots cost ten each So need 20 titanium to lead and something else that they already had I have the lead back at my base so Logic says I can build this bitch And I'm very happy about that That is something good going on in my life. I can't see anymore Matt, and I probably passed the freaking Cyclops fragment as well this is it's so dense in there that it's really hard to see I Think I can do it. I think I can do it can I do it Do you not need to be attached to my other one can I touch you is that another thing I can do This is weird this is all freaky, okay, I can't put you there cuz I can't get me fucking thing to get over there Okay, this is awkward. I wanted to put him near my other base, but Just put it here for now I can always deconstruct and come back after Wait will you you only have one leg holding y'all? How is that any good Baby Cool wait you have power Are you technically counted as part of the other one? Man I'm not even going to question it I do have to put up a power transmitter though vehicle upgrade console computer chip copper wire Three titanium all after weeks without human contact it is normal to experience psychological discomfort Research indicates symptoms may be partly alleviated by a doctor Inanimate object inanimate object, I'll just bring my Sam around with me Right I'm going to go Fuhrman to get all the materials. I need for the thing but first I'm a I'm a test out my bed Haven't I stood over my bed yet? I need to get in there and test that out and see if that works bed oh Yeah, oh, yeah probably not the best sleep since you don't have you're not getting under blankets and You're soaked Hey man first night's sleep you got in I don't know fucking how long how many days have we been here So far I can't check that right off the bat So you can hear acquit it quite a time so the fact that you got your first night's sleep now Says a lot give me copper or give me death. I just spent the last 20 minutes looking for copper in a place where copper is not I Was looking for copper in all the sandstone outcrops where you find silver? It's just in the regular old limestone, man Okay, is that what I need that it Yes vehicle upgrade Bay now this is at the end of it because I'm getting all these materials to build the upgrade Bay But then I need materials after I build it to actually put the shit in to put the shit in like my my my Sally So a good place not sure if I like that place Here this'll do oh Wait uh, yeah, you can just go here nice, I forgot it's just like a little recessed section, okay, so Seamoth modules depth module mark one. I have that Did I not get a depth module mark two Storage module energy efficiency module Oh Polyaniline why I? Thought I had a blueprint for okay four more upgrades for my Sally Hold on let go up here where Sally You depth module mark to Need CMOS dip module mark one. There's a build one anyway Does not stack an America three plasteel ingot s' she'll be able to make that and I have Ruby magnetite I do not have any magnetite I Do not know her to get magnetite ultra high capacity air tank lithium x 4 I might I'm not on board. I got off board I Should have four lithium right I picked up a bunch of it as I was going along There's one please tell me I have it then I can make it an ultra high capacity tank That would be marvelous that would help me so much open storage There's three Come on baby, I know you have it. I know I have it I have to Know There's only one place left that this could be and that's on top of Henry my boy Please please one lithium one lithium Okay Henry kicking me off like that. I am your dad. Oh, where did my storage unit go? The game glitched Well bugged out it well, it's my fault because they put the thing on top of Henry But it pushed it off an hour gentle where it went It could literally be anywhere by now Excuse me Okay first off I'm going in and I'm going to bed because that fucking nighttime as a pain in my ass. We're gonna have guns That's very heavily dependent on how far it got pushed oh Fuck that man Is it landed on something else over here Because they have no beacons or icons or anything on them they just look like this That could be anywhere by now, or it could be right there And it does have the lithium oh Thank god, okay. I'm fucking taking everything out of you Don't trust you anymore. Okay. I'm putting it all in here It's like having a bad child Don't need you don't need you don't need any of you Okay, I don't even have enough room for all of you des fine Lady wish I got my Cyclops built by now there was supposed to be a thing that we did. Well what am I even building? What did I need the lithium for Oh High-capacity air tank that was it nevermind, Shh I don't have a brain that forgets stuff in two seconds. I don't have the attention span of a teaspoon Amy alone Bye-bye weirdo Where do I build these things That's a vehicle upgrade console Modification station Oh An indoor grow bed I Didn't know I started that So yeah modification station is how I build all these things not the thing I think modification station modification station Oh Suck a fart Let's talk about a bit more about the ink or indoor grow bed though Green is unknown Does that mean I came across one and I could have had one that's that's my firm basically, and I'm shading around lights There's no point doing that There's no point looking around for bits and pieces that may or may not show up What I'm doing is I am a man of action right now, and we are heading to the other Island Before I head to the other Island though I want to start checking around some other wrecks because I still need bits for my modification station Came very sad that I haven't gotten that yet hey babies And I need it I need my modification station to be able to do the things that I want to do This is the sealed door so what we're gonna do boom Laser laser Cut that bitch open They got time for shenanigans anymore. We're going deep-sea diving We can't find anything here We're heading straight at the island because it might not have the items that we need but it'll have some items it loves some Information it has PDAs has all this different stuff that we'll be able to use Oh God Would bite look going into these wrecks. We might also be able to find a modification station fragment Because they do lay around polishing cannon fragment have that that was a blight crate. It's effective water battery charger have that Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah oh Hello in the last I world I Didn't realize you had a hole in you We've been here before we've been to this wreck don't you try and chomp on my ass? Ain't just some cheap piece of ass. This is an expensive ass you got to chomp on okay? You'd pay extra to chomp on this ass But I also want to just keep making progress because too much of it is me going oh I'm gonna build this and then I'm gonna build this. I'm gonna build this no It's time to be an exploratory Oh laser cutter fragment That's just obnoxious Laser cutter fragment in the room where I use the laser cutter to get into What was that? That's a piece that I already have battery charger fragment? Modification station fragment, baby We got it. Oh boy look Yeah, I know oxygen is the thing I need thank you look Got it. What are you worrying about? Okay? What do we actually need to make that putative titanium Timon? Led? Do I have enough to make that I think I've enough to make that modification Station here. We come. I need to start getting some Upgrade modules into Sally just wander. Let's go to 300, but that's not enough Actually in fact. Oh hold on I Should get these while I'm out No Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the one I want yeah, yeah, I like that one that's the good one He's going away with metal. We just let him do his thing for a little while come on Don't get stung okay stop, okay, stop. I had a good boy. I had a good boy. There's fucking nothing in here That's a bad boy I was gonna say yeah, I need upgrades in Sally to be able to go deeper like see trainers path and that's up but all that stuff is just Wildly deep Like that stuff is way way down that I'm gonna need a prawn suit to be able to do that Which do I even have all the bits and pieces to be able to build a prawn suit yet a Good for fragments well What was the thing that was something out of 20 those 20 fragments for something got to do with the prawn soup I? Know what that was okay? I need copper or before I head back ooh, ooh Oh, it feels so good To have a modification station Yes This is the shit I subscribed for okay plasteel ingot some magnetized, I don't have that shit a Battery and okay thermal blade all dry capacity. I think I had the fucking This game is just they came a back-and-forth isn't it? just doing the one thing I would have another thing into that thing a blob of black over and over 1 2 3 4 How many let them do I have 4 yes, I am all turned around I don't know where I'm going boom Okay 135 now I'm guessing me. Hey. Can we get up to 225? Okay fine, I'll Take this off 225 give it to me give it to me here. We go here. We go. Oh, baby 225 that's a lot of oxygen I Like it ultra got my fins are useless to me place precursor force it why oh? It's the repulsion cannon okay, yeah, I don't really want that right now And all these things Oh Magnetite magnetite where do I get magnetite? I don't know pokemon This island over here the islands just in front of me this island over here is like Everything around this area fucking socks Because this is this is where some of the deepest sections of the game actually take place a Lot of the area around here goes down down very very far down and it freaks the shit out of me I Love this game To bits I have such a good time playing it. I played it a lot I think the original series still stands at like 45 episodes and This shit still freaks me out Maybe it's all because I'm still not a hundred percent used to it Hey, this is the cave system I went into where I go all the Rubies Now I can actually go down deeper there's another vent Over here you make sense you're closer to where your your water pump pitch is going oh Do I even want to be here Do I even wanna be here Why am I here? It's just the way. It's just fucking freaky. There's no explaining it As a human you your body is just like no We should not be here at all Are you? loyal Repeat ep that's not a reaper. It's a water. What am I saying? I'm fucking scared. I don't know Wait are you this thing I need I Know why you are what is this? Can't scan it probably nothing So yeah you remember last time We're not last time a while ago The Reaper was like sharing location with other agents or the warper. I keep seeing Reapers They had the voice that was on the distress signal Almost sure that that's a warper because what they do Like they're not fully organic so to speak So freaky So if my porthole could clinch anymore it would end countries There's nothing you can't see I don't know where I am. I think I might be near the sand dunes, and that's a bad idea Just like exploring though So the war purrs are somewhat synthetic So, that's why they have a big robot voice I hear one oh I Remember this wreck this wreck give me a Key I didn't realize I was already too far down This was the wreck that gave me the biggest trouble in the game Cuz I knew there was some stuff here that I really needed When I was playing it naturally myself And then when I got here all the stuff that was supposed to be in this Fucking place in this wreck or at least what unlined said was not here Never what that was? What are you nuclear reactor oh? Yes I Know it was a nuclear reactor that I wanted I just remember those bits and pieces of everything that I was trying to get and there were some items. Oh nice There's some items. They didn't have yet in the game like the water filtration system at that time. I didn't have a bunch of shit like that so I was trying to find all the pieces that I could And just find all the upgrades and everything that I could for my base, so I just had the items Anyway into this Hello Thank God. I got that ultra-high capacity tank before I left It's gonna be a lifesaver right now There we go okay, no back up to my seamoth Just get oxygen back and to put my rebreather back on so you don't need to worry about that Thought did you guys whirring all that much? I know you guys are cool Okay, I I'm gonna pause this because I want to see what this is it's not about money and without my oxygen going down That's what every director on Altera's Board has told me and I believe them profitability is just an interim measure of success Power and status are the real goals, okay? I read you When I when I have more time To react a fragment nuclear reactor fragment, okay, no don't need those Fuck this place is confusing. Oh, it's so very quiet oh It's so very quiet, and I don't like this oh, I'm getting myself into a lot of trouble by coming down here Was this Cyclops or our upgrade cool I Don't think I actually have fragments for a driller Tasty Okay, I think I can actually get out down below here anyway and head back up to my AC MOT So I have a quicker escape if necessary and this is one of those wrecks that I was searching around and all of a sudden I Came back in and stuff was just spawned in the middle of nowhere like I went in looking for it. It wasn't there I came back all of a sudden. It was there anything nuclear reactor fragment Jesus Drill arm oh great yeah Nice we got lots of good upgrades. I think that was it I searched around a lot, and it's just Bronze to drill iron fragments and other stuff like that so Alright, that's a reef back up there. I reefy So I think it's about time we hit up. Oh god. It's fucking nighttime now Okay, I still want to head to the island I still want to get there and search around a bit Where am I okay Henry's there oh? This way should be kind of under the island by now No way no way no No no no no no no, no don't do it don't do it, okay? Okay, okay, you didn't do much. You didn't do much yes Cyclops Cyclops, okay? I know I said, I was gonna go to the island. This is more important getting this Getting your Cyclops That BRC trenor's yo Like a coast of their pathway, then I can't see fucking anything Okay, there's the surface Jesus That was risky I was just like no way What's happening What's happening Was let the sea Emperor get inside my head again Where's this just the fucking music there's no way that's just the music That was creepy But yeah, I saw the thing I was like there's no way that's a cyclops bridge fragment Is it and it was like the little steering wheel? So have all the parts, okay Good because that means I can actually build the Cyclops Now hopefully, I know I'm gonna have to go find all the parts But if I can build the Cyclops now that means I can bring that over to the island And that would be way better for me I'm excited I can see Maria again. We get to see Maria again. Oh my god. I can actually make the Neptune launch platform Whoa It doesn't need a whole lot I still need lots and lots of pieces of it But I forgot I could just make my pron suit now as well if I'm aerogel oh Man, I have to go farming for a lot of shit to be able to make this Plasteel ingot s' enamel glass The legends stuff shouldn't be too hard but no one ate for plasteel ingot Segen Lithium and titanium Jesus Reactor pods what the fuck is this benzene synthetic fibers cuz I pick the blood oil There's a creature decoy Okay, well I have a lot of farming ahead of me then I don't even think I have enough lead for this Some lithium ok blood oil go in there, and I have one stalk or tooth Just be happy you guys don't have to see this shit. Are you ready? Are you ready for this? Are you ready for the big bad lady in town to come back? must be constructed Ok ok What That's plenty deep are you ready for the big bad lady to come back? Yes Jesus man it's been so long Maria you're back watch her watch her go what you do it. Oh oh It's so good Maria oh Man Getting emotional at this game man. Oh Hold on so good so good, I'll wait for it wait for it Engine offline ok You have to turn on the engine and everything now tonight wait how do I how do we do it? Otherwise that's doing How do we honk your horn Oh wait Rig for silent running Jesus There's so many different things now, I don't know the button for the horn is anymore. He used to just be left click There it is actually the press like care Oh Oh Maria I am inside you once more. Holy fuck. This is awesome This is new I've never seen that before our little compass down here is no this is new this was added a While ago, I remember this kind of little display is new this is new Oh Some of these features were in it already like the silent running and going twice as fast and the cameras in that kind of stuff They were in it But they were in different locations. This is so sleek God that did such a good job upgrading this Food lights on or off or internal lighting on and off. I'll just not mess at you yet. Oh here we go Here we go soap, Maria Okay name you're gonna be quite the bass Tonight there we go the bass gotta be green and Then this stripe is gonna be blue I think I don't know I have no idea how that looks let's get out and check oh Yes there she is the Maria I know and love Oh God it took me forever to find all those items, but it's worth it She's back baby. Oh I'm so happy. Oh my god Now they know the fucking real fun begins in this game now We take this majestic beauty and we go do whatever the hell we want Right okay? What I'm gonna leave this video here. We did a lot in this next time We are definitely going to the island I've been putting it off for the last like three episodes, but I'm definitely going there now I just have to take some stuff from here Miles oh, I think some stuff from here and put them inside, Maria, and then she will act as my mobile base and then I have to somehow get Farms everything going on inside her I have to put the prawn suit and then that can go inside her but for now the sea moths can go in Either way, this is good progress. I am so goddamn happy, but for now Thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face Like a boss But thank you guys, and I'll see you in the next video! Seriously man that's enough to make you cry so good 
*WAPOOSH* Top of the mornin' to ya, laddies! My name is Jacksepticeye. And welcome back, once again to my nightmare. Never before has a game ever encapsulated my nightmares in visual and audio form before for the whole world to enjoy, so... Welcome back. Umm... It's also the first thing in the mornin' that I'm doing. I-I woke up not that long ago... so I thought, "Hey! Why not ruin the rest of my day and play some Cuphead?" So, we got some shit last time and we got a new shot, we have all the shots now. We have charge shot um... charge shot and lobber, are my big damage dealers. Then we have a spread and we have my roundabout and then the chaser Ok, cool. So I have to figure out what I should be using. But we have the last mausoleum to go in to. And after this mausoleum we'll have the last super as well. This might be hard though because the Ghosts. *Game:  And begin!* They were getting a little hard last time. So now I can't really take my time to do this gradually. oh shit Is it over if they touch it-? or do I actually get like three health? OH, THAT was CLOSE. Oh thank God, you can multi-parry. Aw, shit. NICE! What the FUCK is that? Oh my god. OH MY GOD! I GOT AN ACHIEVEMENT! POO POO POO! Ain't NO ONE coming in mah house! NICE!! Okay, Jesus.. Oh wow I'm fucking nervous. Oh crap. I couldn't reach him.

Thank you!) 
(Wapoosh~) My name is jacksepticeye! Welcome to a game called Heartbound which I think is supposed be a mixed kind of of undertale and Kind of earthbound-y or at least emulating their styles in that type of game Which, you know, I love immensely. So I wanted to try it out. It's up on gamejolt. I think this is only a demo or That's great music, it's only a demo so it's not a full experience yet But it gives you enough for sense of what they're going for and it looks really really cool. I like the art style to it. I already like this little logo here, but it says continue and literally just launch the game. I don't have it continue. *Thunder booms in the background* (Quick note: Characters name is Lore. The dog is Baron.) Oh look at my little dog my dog so cute. Okay. How do I interact with things? Lore: Back to bed seems like a bad idea Why? Sleeps great. I mean no it's not, it's for the weak! uh-huh Whoa. Lore: There we go, all set to battle the day. Awe you're cozy. Lore: He's out like a light. Jack: Oh good boy. *Tries the light switch but it toasted itself* God Jesus that scared me Oh God Wait you talk? Baron: Yikes! Lore, are you okay buddy? Lore: I think so... The light switches is toast though.. Lore: I'm gonna head back to bed, this days already sour enough. Baron: Wait what about breakfast? Lore: Dude, it's too early for food Jack: It's too early for food, dude. Baron: It's never too early for food! Where is your sense of adventure? Lore: Sleeping, like we should be. Baron: You know I can't open the can. Lore: Oh fine, let's get going then. Your fault if anything goes wrong. Jack: Okay, come on Fido. Did I- did you have a name? I can't remember. Lore: Too much water or not enough Sun, it's just like the rest of this place. Baron: That plant looks kind of sad, it clearly needs an adventure. Lore: Damn, he must up. Baron: That's okay. Maybe he's in a good mood today Jack: Who's up? Oh God? Dad(?): Hey moron (kiddo) the kitchen trash is overflowing go take it out now. (Would you?) Baron: Problem solved! That wasn't so bad right? Lore: Always the optimist... At least it's just the trash. Game: This broken painting clearly depicts a slayer of champions. It said something at the bottom of that dudes dialogue who told me to keep taking out the trash (It said Would you?) Lore: Definitely don't want to go in there. Jack: and I didn't see what it was. Lore: Looks like the power is still on. that's good at least Baron: Things are looking up for our brave adventurers. Lore: Okay, I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt. Baron: Mutt? How rude. Jack: Sorry boy Game: An exquisite shell stands before you Jack: Cool This place is uh... Nice... Dirt everywhere. Ah Baron, that's his name. Lore: Better feed Baron before we go anywhere. Jack: Okay What about if we watch TV? Mmmnn the white noise channel love it- went down after season two though. Whoo-hoo-hoo spookie! Lore: They just keep piling up. Wish she would quit already. Lore: Definitely the best seat in this house Jack: Okay.. Baron: The can is over on the counter. I would open it myself, but pause and stuff.. Jack: Okay Lore: It's full of... Socks??

But it will not be easy for either of you. Lore: Just tell me where he is. (???): Please, Calm yourself. I am NOT your enemy Lore: I-I'm sorry None of this makes any sense I didn't mean to snap at you (???): That's quite all right Lore, life doesn't always make sense. We don't make do with what we have or we make do or hurt. We have I'm old I got giant eyebrows What do I know? Lore: What? How do you know my name? I'll tell you when you're older. (NO) That's for now. That's for me you may call me Binder. Lore: What? Your name is Binder? Binder: Feel free to look around. I will be setting the time. Jack: Okay binder at the spine of the world a guardian perceives every page simultaneously guardians can move freely between these pages To record any and all events the food of information brought on by the power of the spine can be overwhelming Terrarium with a large stick placed in the center. I see you found Agnus. her back is worse than her bite there Jack: haha, her bark, not her her back Binder: I can you assure you. Hit the brown book big red book These books are glued together. You can't even pick them up oh, it's another one I Will write my name in it as long as this isn't a Death Note (Ah 40 seconds..) You progress has been saved. The space feels cozy and warm. Binder will understand if you take a nap rest for a while.. I gonna rest for a while here. (Sleep is for the weak. Jk.) Jack: Ooooh. No my dog he's still gone That's weird I like it papers in a strange runic text litter the table Okay Can't read that actually looks a little bit like Korean that first letter actually a lot of it looks like Korean that very first letter up there looks like Yuna a Baby book tower it's cute! Anomalies can manifest in many different forms at any given place or time within a page as the anomaly progresses Aspects of the page may become corrupted the results of this corruption are highly unstable and impact each host differently The leather-bound home shifts away when you reach for it. Binder: Don't worry. It's just shy around new people Okay, brother booked our hides behind us mama, haha Very faint mist swirls in one of the chairs hmm The twin terrariums each have a stick placed in the center the hell is this place Auntie Bock tower is spying an uncle book tell her Okay, Oh Apple You found a sock reading a book smart smart sock And gnarled blackroot lays in a terrarium on the shelf the label says break glass in case of goblets Thankfully they're not seem to be any rabbits nearby Jack: What? (Big MOOD) Binder: It's important to stop and enjoy the little things I'm glad you understand that The clock is ready for you unfortunately you must handle this trial alone Lore: trial? clock? What are you talking about? Binder: In order to save Baron you will need to go somewhere I cannot. There's an artifact of great power trapped between worlds. This clock will take you to it Lore: Can I really bring Baron back? Binder: I hope so it's the best chance we have. Lore: I understand... Binder: Stand back I will open the way through The connection is established, please step inside. Lore: Hey a binder? Binder:  yes, Lore? Lore: Thanks Binder: Think nothing of it you're doing the same for me Lore: Uhm, Actually, no. I wouldn't. (rejected not respected) Hope this works Jack: Cool! Lore: This place is falling apart. I Hope binder was right Jack: Okay, can I do anything with any of this? Oh I can't move you. Oh Wait I did it I did it right, I'm supposed to just lighten it up and hit the crystals gotcha got it Jack: Don't got it... What? Am I not supposed to hit this? Okay, can I move this again? Oh, I didn't push it all the way up Haha Jack: Thank you, I'm in I'm in. Binder:  great job. Thank you through that let me know if you need help Lore: Yeah, let me ask let me just ask for help from a disembodied voice quality plan (üëå). Binder:  I heard that Jack: Sorry, what's the deal with socks in this game? I can't move you. Oh! I got the sock He found a levitating sock space Jack: Huh... Nice I did it! Binder: This is the final challenge next room holds the artifact Lore: Alright, I'll try not to get lasered -in space (sass levels üëå) And stuff. Binder: quality plan Jack: Uhm... Jack: Alrighty you go there *Jack licks his lips meticulously.* Jack: Huuuuh. What do you do? whoa! Okay if I move you all the way down wait Will that block that if I do that? yeah, it will let me just see what this one does again Okay, so there's one still left to turn on Jack: BZZZZ! just get fried Maybe if I push you all the way over to the end, I mean the others weren't that complicated That in the fact that when you push them there you can't push them back so that has to be the solution more or less. Awww man. Jack: Cuz I can't push it back anyway, I doubt the game would break itself like that. Here we go! clever Clever. I did it! Binder: You're always there the artifact is just up ahead be careful, Lore. *Jack sighs in relief* Binder: Wait... something's wrong. *Text goes from 'Binder what's going on' to 'I understand now.'* Jack: OOOh Dude he has a dark version! (*cough*) Lore: I understand now. Binder: Lore! get out of there ---wrong!! Good Lore:I'm scared! Bad Lore: and we need this to save him. Jack: Dude I'm into this! (big mood) *Corrupted screaming/laughing* Jack: Awee Yeah, (???): I Was like you .... once. (???): Full of hope, ambition, curiosity, fear, (???): Now I am here (???): Trapped in th- here in this (Prison)  place waiting for you.. (Oh...?) (???): Show me why he chose you, show me why you matter, wake up Lore. (*cough*) (???): Wake up and prove yourself. Jack: That Dark dude talking? is that Anti? (*COugh*) Jack: My boy is back! (YAY!!)

I didn't think it'd be THAT good I mean not to say that I thought it was gonna be bad or anything It's just really surprised me with how well made it is it is It is very very earthbound and very heart- or heart stone.... Very- It's called heart bound It's very earthbound and undertale Very very much like those well undertale is very earthbound started off all that kind of type of game But I really really like it! I can't wait to see more of this! (Same) Aw I'm glad I played this now that was really really good, and I always think these games didn't get in and do little voices And I like the story so far. I like the characters, and I like that there's like an evil version of them It's a good. It's a game. That's very I'm not gonna say cater towards me because obviously it's not made for me, but I mean it's very much. My type of game From the stuff that I do on the channel and the types of games that I do because it has like a cool interesting story It has a dark persona character, There's all these different characters that I get to voice has cute little dog as my little buddy It has all like the little names of characters they all have their own personalities. I love this that was cool. Ah Half-hour-long, it's a nice little tease for it. I really hope that this gets made I really hope that they continue with it and make a really like a fully fledged game out of it go support them They are they're cool people I can't wait to see more of this game It's probably gonna be a really long time before any of its out Or if before any more of it gets made  uhm. But I'm really looking forward to it, and I hope that doing videos like this helps boost Some awareness for a game like this and then other people get to play it and other people get to support it and it it turns out Into something much bigger. Anyway THank you guys so much watching this episode, if you LIKED it PUNCH that like button IN THE FACE LIKE A BOOOSSSS!! And, *Deep voice* High fives all around... WapOOSH! WhapoosH! Thank you guys and I will see all you dudes, IN THE NEXT VIDEO!!! Thanks for letting us help! Anyways, from the first until forever, we love you!

*Wapoosh* Top of the morning to ya laddies! My name is Jacksepticeye and welcome to a game called "Doki Doki Literature Club." Which - Okay - *scoffs* There's gonna be a few disclaimers about this game before I start. A lot of you have been suggesting that I play this game and when I saw it first, I thought - I kind of rolled my eyes at it - I saw it on Steam when it came out. And I rolled my eyes at it cuz' I thought it was just a Japanese, schoolgirl, visual novel, dating game kind of thing. And it didn't seem like anything that I'd be interested in, But everybody on the reviews - this is a 10 out of 10 on Steam - and everybody in the reviews were saying, "Don't read anything else about the game, just play it for yourselves." So that already had my intrigue and then when I started up the game it gave me a bunch of disclaimers that said, "You need to be at least 13 years old to be able to play this game." I had to agree to a consent; And then it said, "Warning: If you suffer from anxiety or depression, you might not find some of the stuff in this game appropriate." SO I need to say that outright as well and then it gave, like, a link to... like, a disclaimer page for warnings for this game so I have no idea what this is. Apparently it gets very weird very quickly and a lot of people have been suggesting it to me, so there has to be something to it? That - Again, cause if you're like me and you rolled your eyes at it first, It might be completely different from what we're expecting, so Let's give it a chance and give it a shot and see what it's actually like. Um, I-I literally have no idea what to expect from this *reads dialogue* *reads dialogue* Awe, look at her! *chuckles* So fuckin' anime. *reads dialogue* Actually I probably won't be able to do voices for this cuz' it's all girls and that high pitched voice is gonna blow out my throat really quickly. "But I caught you this time!" Oh yeah. My name is Jack *laughs* Okay. I guess that works. I wanted to put in Jack cause I wanted the characters to call me Jack. *laughs* My waifus. *reads dialogue* *reads dialogue* *Reads dialogue* Whatever you Say-ori! *kawai girl laugh* *Reads dialogue* Have you not deci- *corrects himself* Have you decided on a club to join yet? A club? Maybe Doki Doki Literature club *Reads dialogue* What‚Äôs a NEET? (a young person who is "Not in Education, Employment, or Training‚Äù) I look around and realise I‚Äôm not *corrects himself* that I‚Äôm the only left in the classroom Going through these classrooms always reminds me of playing 'White Day' Um... 'White Day,' A labyrinth named school! It's a Korean... Um... Korean horror game that I played ages ago Um... I-It was a bit all over the place, but these classrooms- -the- -the Japanese and Korean- Like classroom styles and building architectures and everything are very similar So, it always reminds me of that. *Continues reading dialogue* Girl 1! Oh god there's too many of them... I already forgot the voice I gave you! She looks like Kyu from... Huniepop Oh, that- Oh, this is Sayori! OH! I'm gettin' all confused THERE'S SO MANY CHARACTERS! *Inhale* CUTE GIRLS! I mean, uh- Sorry... *Chuckles* Mutterings... *Continues dialogue* *Clears throat* *Strange noises* All these, uh- Cute girls, uh- *Continues dialogue* Smells great... Nice hair... *Continues dialogue and gets back on track* I have no idea what voices to give these girls *Kitty Jack pose* You look like you have- Like kitty teeth MEOW~ *Continues dialogue* That's always the case CUPCAKES Are not designed very well It's not like some baking engineer went out and made cupcakes The most prime candidate for icing sugar...treat 'Cause if any of you try to bite into, like a proper cupcake, You have to get icing everywhere Maybe that's the point... *Continues dialogue* I mean- *Talks with mouth full* This is really good *Continues Dialogue* What? *Continues Dialogue* WHOOP THE MUSIC! *Dances* *Continues Dialogue* you're not the Yuri I know The Yuri I know is in Girls Generation Kwon Yu-ri AHHM- FAKE YURI!!! Little weird Her 'Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson' impression is getting better though SHIT!!! She's onto me Immediately Can she read my thoughts? 'The Shining' I heard it was called By Steven King AH! Monika comes back in to do her 'Rock' impression After hearing me- Actually, after listening to me think about it *Jack about to say 'What?' out loud but doesn't* *Also Jack, you ARE adorable. Right, guys?* *Jack chuckles* *BURP* Or as in Anime they would say, "Oh, oh. Nani?" When all of their cute smiles, And pretty hair, And lovely eyes Stare back at me! DEJECTED! *Jack holds himself* H-hey, you're choking me Yeeeeaaaaahhhh Heh One of these names is not like the other~ Perhaps, I can even make Da Waifu! See, this is what i expected this game to be Just this like, FOREVER! But apparently it gets much different Apparently, it starts off like this And it's supposed to make you think that's it's all this And then it takes a sharp turn And I don't know what sharp turn that's gonna take pretty quickly But the fact that it said, "You're not gonna be happy if you suffer anxiety and depression" Makes me think that ahh- Their poems are gonna open up a bit about who they actually are. ALRIGHT! Ohhh... So who are we thinking? Who do we like most so far? I don't like Natsuki cause Her-she seems a little hotheaded And her attitude towards me was a little- A little sharp Sayori is my best friend Kind of but she cute Monika *smack his lips* Feel like Monika is a little too out of my league She's a bit too, uh...official Since she's the president I think Yuri is my heart's desire for now umm I forget what she's into *Jack laughs* Okay..what should we write about? "Pain!" Ah, hahum "Massacre!" Let's write a horror! Wait, are these girls bouncing based on what I'm picking? ...Oh, you're just bouncing anyways.. Ummmmm "Raincloud." Oh, they do bounce based on what I'm clicking! Ummm "Philosophy?" Ahh! So I'm trying to pick the ones that Yuri likes. I like Yuri. "HORROR!" "Melancholy." Okay. Sayori jumped a little for that one, but I don't know if it's just a natural jump. Uhhhh, "tragedy!" Sayori, you like "tragedy?" Ummm... "Boop?" *laughs* "Misfortune." Shit! "Dazzle?" Ah, shit. "Infinite, fester, eternity!" Yeah, there we go. "Misfortune," shit! "Effulgent." I don't even know what that is, "disown." Okay, so you like the dark stuff, (Yuri) You like a middle ground, (Sayori) You like the cute stuff. (Natsuki) I can't even impress Monika! She's not even here! Ummm "Destiny?" "Wrath." "Unrestrained?" I'm picking all the good ones! For Yuri. I have to pick twenty?! God Almightly. "Graveyard." Ummmm "Hurt?" Okay. *laughs* You like that one. Uhhh, inf- -alliblllllle "DEATH." wHAT!?! Sayori, you like "death?" Ummm, 'kay, two more... "Insight." Nice, and "misery." Crap! Okay, last one! Last one, last one. "Determination!" &lt;3 Let's get a little Undertale in there. Okay. Time to- -see what our poems are all about. *he's just reading dialouge right now* Huho! ROASTED! I do! In real life, that's me! I always do my best, as long as I'm having fun. Why do I help her out with this? Don- *scoff*Don't out me in front of my waifu! *weird voice* Don't be shy! What book did she get me? I wanna know! Is it "Shutter Island?" Is it "IT?" Ahhmm.. Oh God. Uhh Ahhh! It's because she bought the book specifically for you, dummy! Cause she LIKES YOU! Is-is this happening because of the stuff i picked? For my poem? That'd be really cool if that was the case. *sub. author(s) note:"relatable" This sounds awesome! I feel like that this is, um foreshadowing for the game. It's-it's-it's symbolism! Don't judge a book by it's cover, And it's a literature club, and they're reading books *smart Jack is smart* Not just a hat rack, my friend. *coughs* It's also a cough factory. Why do I feel like this is telling me everything that's gonna happen? Aw, that's so sweet! Wow! This is even worse reading! Cause not only am I a character that doesn't read a lot, but she reads a lot, so that means she's probably gonna finish the pages sooner and I'm left going like this: And whenever that happens. I have done this with somebody before, not like, in a romantic kind of way or anything, but just like- -you know when you're younger and you're in school and you have like a- -a little book.. ...hour? Or whatever, or at least my class had that. So, with my friends, I'd be doing it but I couldn't read as fast as they could, because they read a lot. And then- My mind wasn't even focusing on the page It was just waiting to figure out when they were finished and then I would just turn the page anyway. Oh, she's looking at me. (nice save protagonist) *weird scream?* I COMPLETELY forgot we had to share poems. Alright. Who should I show my poem to first? Hmmm... Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. Catch a tiger by the toe. *singsong* If he hollers, let him go. Eeny, meeny, miny, MONIKA! Eeny, meeny, miny, Monika *chuckles* Let's just start with Monika. That's kind of like me in real life, actually. Maybe that's why I got- -instantly drawn to Yuri's character? *forced laughter* *dramatically reads poem* My bleh! *chuckles* *continues dramatically reading poem* *shooketh* Whaaat? *accidentally does Monika's voice for Jack and corrects himself* (as a writing person, this is good advice) That's pretty good! Who should I show my poem to next? I feel like I should show it to Yuri. I feel like since it's-it's the reason I wrote the poem. I feel like I should have brought it to Monika first since she's the head of the club. (you did but okay..) *dialogue* What's with this sort of like- Reggae... ...menu music that's going on? Okay, short and to the point. Like the book she gave me. *dramatically reads poem* *weird voice* Ookay.. *chuckles* Aww.. Precious!~ Okay, let's go with Natsuki! I'll go Sayori last because it might be the end of the day, and then we can walk home together. What? But, I'm not a rapper. *confused* *chuckle* I like how the music changed. *reads normally* Exactly! Every poem is beautiful! As long-well- As long as you're writing from your heart, and writing honestly, that's art. And no one should ever judge your for that. *dialogue* Yeah, so the idea of her poem is that, everyone else around you can do great things. "Eagles can fly, monkeys can climb, horses can run." "Frogs can leap." That kinda thing. But humans can only try. That's deep. *dialogue* Like humans fall flat! Short and sweet. Okay, Sayori! Let's get into it! *reads poem* *laughs* That's a good one! I like that! It also explains the last line. You remind me of the.. what's her name? Sasha Braus, from Attack on Titan She-she loves food so much, and you kinda have the same face as her right now. *sigh* *corrects himself* Oh, God. Ah, girls, girls, calm down. GIRLS! Girls, we can calmly- *weird sound* Oh, God. Umm, Girls, can we re- *grunts* Natsuki! .... Hi. Ummm... *sound of "oh shit, I have to choose"* Fuck. OOOOHHH! What do we do? I can't-I wanna go with Yuri, because that's.. ..my waifu. But I don't want to upset Natsuki. Uh, "Help me, Sayori!" Girls, girls. We can talk about this. If only- *imitating Sayori* Big, beautiful, boobies! Wait, does that mean I leaned more towards Sayori then? Am I even picking a dating partner? That's cute. In the club! You know, bottle full of bub? (no, what?) *pat pat pat* Okay, good night, bye! Okay. Time to write the next poem, which means it's my time to save my game. Okay! Okay, right. So so far, we're an hour into the game, nothing, crazy has happened yet? But I can see that it's setting up for something. Or maybe it's just because I know people said that weird shit happens. Which would probably really take you by surprise if you knew nothing about this game and you just jumped into it. First of all, I still don't know what's gonna happen. But I feel like Yuri laid down some -some groundwork for what COULD happen. She might have foreshadowed a bit of things and the types of poems I'm writing might lead to something but... ..very intresting! I like the characters a lot anyway. Even if this didn't turn into anything, it's still just fun to talk to them because I like how different all the characters are. Umm, even if it is, kind of like, the-the sterotypical dating thing! But, haven't found anything crazy yet! I'm looking forward to what IS gonna happen, though! It'd probably start happening in the next episode. Umm But- So far, really liking it! I like it a lot! Hopefully you guys like it too. And- If you're a person- whos played this game, and you know what happens, or you know what's about to happen, or you know the different types of characters or what- Personalities they have or if me going with some character Ileads to different endings like that, PLEASE I-I beg of you not to say anything in the comments. Because I don't know anything! And I don't want to be spoiled And because I read the comment a lot, I don't want to go through it and have the whole thing ruined for me. But other people who are really getting into this, or other people... ..who like this for their first time through as well, I don't want them to get ruined either. So, please, please be mindful of others. I know... ...that... ...the temptation to post spoilers or to even-don't even the stuff for like- "Oh, I know what's gonna happen if you do this!" Like, don't be sly about it either. Just DON'T POST SPOILERS! I do not condone that! And- I-I hate it when people do that. It's-it's such a shitty thing to do. So, please be mindful of that! That some of us are going through this for the first time so we don't know what's going-going to happen. And! If you're not into these types of games, if you're not into the whole.. "Japanese Schoolgirl Dating Sim" kind of game, Normally, I'm not into that either myself, with the exception of-like-Huniepop just because that was so... ..that was life, the first kinda thing I did. But- I-I was assured that that's not all this game is. The tag for this on Steam have Horror, Gore, Self Harm, stuff like that in them, So I have no idea what's gonna happen all I know that it's not this forever. So give the game a chance. Anyway! That does it for the first episode! If you liked it, PUNCH that like button in the face! LIKE A BOSS! AND- *whisper* high fives all around *high fives all around* Thank you guys and I will see all you dudes! IN THE NEXT VIDEO! Woah! That took forever! Hi everyone!

If you want to subtitle one of Jack's videos in your language, Don't hesitate to go to the specific video's settings and find "Add Subtitles."

it's like a rave it's like a big big rave full of very ravenous people hello and welcome to subnautica or some noxious as I like to call it since I was away yesterday and since this is now a daily thing Dave daily series are a lot harder to do when you for record them for two hours at a time so because this is like a daily thing and I didn't really have enough time the day before to record like two episodes of it I missed one today sorry so I'm here now to livestream it because I was gone away all day I was in London all day hello hi yes welcome something you said hey babies hey hey yourself is everything good everything everything working wait if I can hear an echo it will be working yep there's an echo it works it's working as Anakin Skywalker would say well except on Twitter because it decides to show me with the charity stream picture which was a whole month ago stupid talking about YouTube not the charity stream the charity stream was amazing shall we hop in should we dive into the deep blimey deep into Z water I think so oh wait let me I need the chat to be here so I can see it how was Black Panther it was really good I liked it a lot I'm not gonna say any spoilers or anything don't worry about how the movie itself in totality was I just really enjoyed it but I think my perceptions of it were changed because I was at a premiere and there was like a thousand to 2,000 people there watching it and when you're at a premiere everyone like super gets involved when something really cool happens everyone cheers for it and that's just that like the jokes people laugh at those and everything but when we're in like something like the hero does a cool thing everyone's everyone's like cheering for the hero it's really awesome it gave me a whole extra feel and vibe and hype to the whole movie so I I really liked it a lot I had a fantastic time I only got to kick the crap out of a stunt man I met why did they you say that every time I met this stunt coordinators for the movie two of them and one of their moves they taught me the one they showed on Twitter is actually in the movie which is really cool but I did a whole vlog about the whole day that'll be up whenever why do I have this open what is happening I don't know it's everything okay okay thanks that's cool so what I wanted to do Ramesh I really wish they weighed a lot of noises like they made the real noises for teeny-tiny see just hear little squeaks coming out of him but I wanted to do in this part in this episode was my plan before I did the VR one because I suddenly just was like hey VR yeah let's do that I mean used to do that for the longest time so I want to do their base down in the deep down Derek deep down hence the title of the stream if you get me so I'm gonna have to get a lot of materials for that though because I need to figure out what's in like a scanner room and I want to leave this base the way it is I don't want to have to get new parts and that's actually not that hard five titanium copper ore and gold okay I can do that that's not a problem I also haven't made my stuff better I haven't sorted out all this because that's busy work and I don't want to do that no one wants to do that it's like housecleaning um no copper and gold not nickel there's nothing in that one well that means then that I can put some of you in there I don't need salt I don't need rubber grab stuff as I need it I do need some Wawa though copper yes it was two copper one gold I might not have any gold I lied I'm a big fat liar bring me to court and throw the book at me bring a bunch of these because we're gonna need some of these to build other things mainly all I want to do is build a base that's down there that can scan I want to build a base that I can go down and scan everything that's down in the lavas own ins this is deep down to our deep down and if a cat scan that then what even I might am i a real man okay okay I have a lot of copper I have a cop a lot er I'm gonna bring some of these things cuz these are always useful Ruby do I need Ruby so no oh no depends what I want to build mainly just these rooms just basic rooms maybe a moon pool I don't know I might have to sir oh yeah I'm gonna have to build a thermal thing magnetite and aerogel so I do need where was the magnet I was in here no no this is why this is why you label them like those memory games okay I could drink one more of them magnetite and aerogel so I do need some Ruby okay I'll dump a bunch of this into Maria and that's how we'll do it so you know you get to see what it's like when I actually just record the episodes before all the stuff is caught out of it a lot of stuff gets caught out of it let me tell you thanks that's where I left them so I would hope so okay I don't have anything in any of these things so what I also kind of want to take one of the fabricators out of here I'm highly inefficient when it comes to things like this I can I just build them the way I think they look cool and then after that I'm like it works I'm gonna take this one because it's not imperative I have some back here I actually have to have one and Henry I'm one beside Pepper's moonpool some Ruby some of these we have any aerogel lying around I don't think so I bring some enameled glass and some of these things I can get when I'm down there I remember I needed rubber for something what that something was I could not tell you lithium led all that stuff is gonna be very useful well these things I can get down there as well yeah what am i whirring oh I don't have to go I'm gonna have to bring pepper aren't I so Sally hmm diamonds I got down there it's all good it's all marvelous it's all great things there's a lot Ruby down there as well I actually should be bringing my batteries see I'm bringing the fabricator from here because I can't get table coral down there too easily there's one titanium there and get titanium down there as well they they love titanium down there that'll do we'll be okay we'll survive we'll be fine until I get down there and then I'm like I needed this thing some of you guys out for now you have an eye on power selling use your good and I don't need you okey-dokey okey-dokey oh I need a battery chargers it's very difficult to say what I'm gonna need because I always do this I hate busy work I hate tedious busy work so when it comes to like organizing things and getting things in order and pulling things from there to there my god takes up too much time I just want to do the cool stuff also got a sweet sexy cup of coffee with me oh yeah oh yeah can't get that kind of coffee here in the abyss I think everything's good here I will in no I don't need a knife is silly I will install a fabricator here the stuff I needed really gone in here God dang it wait you're gonna need titanium gold table Coral so I still had that on me it's table Karl really put that one piece of - I  put the one piece of take it back this is what I do this is how I am I don't know why I am the way I am because I've seen my head I was like it's one piece of titanium white of why would I need one piece of Titan exactly now why I needed one piece of titanium where they put it I don't know seems like one of those memory games why were you guys not charging I have a Power Cell charger for this specific purpose I'm not putting a name on that I want a rock and roll all night and party every day that's what else should I bring maybe some more copper coppers very useful I would bring the water infiltration but I like it there if I need to build another one well that's my problem for then and there isn't it aha see I bring lots of copper because of that okay Kevin Carly where are you hey babies oh wait no I told you to follow me I don't want you to actually follow me sorry stay there I was trying to turn off the lights on my C glide hello I don't know which one is which I'll play with you now could vanished it was behind your eyeball I would say was behind your ear but you don't have ears I know they're so cute I love them welcome aboard captain all systems online why aren't you saying it to me man I am fall up already I still didn't put the power cells in you see when I say that I have a DD I'm not just saying it cuz it's hip and cool I really think I do can think of anything I didn't put the stuff in there something's wrong with my head there's something going on he's just a lack of something going on inside my head sometimes that I very highly worried about you guys in then the other one can stay with me cuz it's got that 59% so they talked at the Black Eyed Peas no I didn't I saw them but I didn't talk to them it's really bizarre they were just there I mean that's usually how you think they're gonna be it wasn't tough  ting that I needed but they just walked by I was just like oh hello and then he sat in front of me for the whole movie about the table coral there I put it there finally after four and a half thousand years jack has finally done it game audio's a bit of low okay where are we there I turned it up a bit turn it up a small tiny bit and probably still have to go up a small bit more but I'm here guys I'm trying to do a thing somebody also give me a great tip in the comments before that I haven't had a chance to talk about which was when I had the scanner room installed and everything was going on and had all this on my screen and I was like I cannot deal with having all that stuff oh no game audio that's strange there should be it's coming out of mine and people wanted me to get I guess I said that I should have taken the chip out of my helmet which was a good idea then I wouldn't have to see all the stuff that was on my screen also apparently reef black eggs are not in the game yet which is sad I want them they look the same as the Spade fish eggs let me see this okay that would be the reason I don't know why obeisance stuff turned away the down on the road again Nakia we'd get on road again I don't need this on my screen please oops sorry my bad I mean if you can't hear the game audio it's not that big a deal anyway you've heard it a billion times there's nothing new hey REE fees how's it going oh these journeys men they take so long hi oh that's how I talk to them let's take off my socks it's very warm in here oh maybe cuz I'm drinkin coffee I also need to slow down the chat just a small bit because my god I'd like trying to keep up with it I'm trying to see all the messages from people but I physically can't because there's too many messages coming in all together and I want to be able to see it I want to be able to interact with chat [Music] god I hate having slow internet it's like just go to YouTube just log on just do the things all I want it's all I want just do the thing I think you click on something 10 minutes later it actually does it oh jesus slow mode is already on Oh yikes then let's bump it pop up the jam okay mm-hmm why are you even wearing pants or am I even wearing pants yeah I am you never know when those stream slips are going to happen what if I'm going along and then all of a sudden oh oh I jumped up in the air and there's no pants then that's a problem okay we're going down into the deep down down Jesus Christ that scared me every time I go down here the music just goes boom it's scary then here's a music kick in wait is me hitting a freaking tadpole sound like I just ran into the side of a cliff it scares me there we go now I can reach at amazing impression thanks mate my snags in something how I am he didn't give me a sound notification or anything though wait there's a piece of something out here that I've never actually gotten to Oh God Jesus alright a little bit of Health gone off that smack it into something like stuff out here that I can scan and get what are you part of a nuclear reactor fragment I have that thought you were something cool you're the same nuclear reactor fragment get out here with your bitch-ass nuclear reactor fragments I don't need them I would like all this quartz though this quartz is very nice like it's all so weird being down here now I'm not having war pers attack me because now I'm not afraid of anything because there's nothing in this immediate vicinity really that can get me at least nothing that can do serious damage that I can't get away from so now it's just like ah a wooden field farming adventure trying to get courts and trying to be happy that's right that's a subsonic it really is the pursuit of happiness there's an armed fragment but that's for a drill arm I have that are you piece of a nuclear reactor as well yeah there's another drill arm fragment no-one wants these least of all me my science my impression of Maria okay easy does her Maria easy does or just ease it on through now you get to see how much time is actually spent going back and forth in this game which is to say an awful amount of time cuz normally we just edit these out because why would I leave all this in oh oh I'm in the wrong place I am in the wrong place I am very scared Oh Paul stalk it stock don't get stuck don't get stuck where are we oh I took a wrong turn somewhere okay okay saved it nailed it we're supposed to go this way I went into the dark deep black hole that's where I went what I was doing the VR version I fell in I went into that dead end when I was way in Sally I think okay down under under and over under and over yeah would be cool if this game had a multiplayer mode I agree I mean I wouldn't ever suggest playing it multiplayer for your first time through to anybody because it's an amazing experience to go through the first time on your own but it would be nice if I could just oh it'd be nice if I was able to get somebody else to help me do stuff now just bring in a friend and then we could build like really cool bases together and somebody could be all the way down here freaking out about something and then I could be all the way back up top being like lalala that'd be awesome we are not going any faster with that that is not enough hi everyone saying hi to me how's it going did you guys see that the German figure skater dude that I tweeted about earlier that looks like me it's so freaky normally because normally people say oh you kind of look like this person or you look like that person everyone kind of gets that every now and then from somebody and then you see the person as some people are like yeah he kind of does look like that and people have done that to me in the past I've seen it online in places really like it kind of looks like Jack and I'm like no it doesn't I don't think so I know my face that's not me this is the one of the first times where I'm like okay what the looks a lot like me it's really weird Paul Finn's the German dude it's really funny if you seem like up close just his face he doesn't really look like me Bernie's out and the the rink and he's actually like doing his moves and the cameras at a distance looks an awful lot like me Oh coffee please never leave me thanks to everyone who's sponsors as well by the way I don't really have much stuff in place for that but I still really appreciate it because I know it comes from a place of people just really liking to channel enough to do something like that so that's really really nice of you thanks I appreciate it you're a half-two but I appreciate it hello babies one way Jack's coming through yeah we're almost 18 million it's awesome I haven't so quick I don't know what to do for it cuz I I know shut up I kind of want to do something different for it this time I actually want to do like a fun video for it cuz normally I do the the vlogs showing my appreciation everything but I feel like I've done so many of them that some people are getting sick of them and then the people who like them are kind of like okay we get it kind of thing so I just don't I don't want it ever to seem like I'm doing it as part of like an act or doing it as part of something that I think I have to do I just really like showing my appreciation for it but I I repeat myself a lot in them so I'd like to do something extra for it still show my appreciation obviously cuz I am very appreciative of it it's crazy even after 18 million I still can't believe that stuff is still increasing the way it is but I'm trying to think of other ways of kind of celebrating it alright we hear some start building that base I don't have the basic substance to start making the base like titanium which is kind of bad oops but you know what you live and learn that's what life's all about living and learning and going down into lava zones and dying it's fine we should just get a basic base started at least a basic base oh can I build one down in here uh-huh hey it's my stuff from before let me come in handy have a bunch of Lube down here I have a bunch of lube and dildo shaped objects very good so could you start building this it's not gonna be structurally super-strong oh and then I can snake it around down in here that'll be cool okay how much do I need for one of these two versus three and that's probably more useful and this is three as well and this is more useful so let's do that because I kind of want it to be here and then I can like bring a piece down there uh maybe I don't know it's gonna be fun though base Hall eight okay any two more titanium then leave any titanium here today hmm I have to go get some in pepper she build oh I should change the name is well Sally's been around longer I need a new video vehicle that I can call salt salty to see Glide their new character new name salty the ceiling so now we have salt and pepper I like that I'm a creative genius oh I know we've the new boost jump jets oh wait I just need to go right here wait are you led no your titanium nice this is where I need to be this is where I want to be right now I'm eating toast nice hope it's cold toast better be cold toast look at all this titanium I'm getting hashtag salty hello mate hello ello my but know that we went to London yesterday it was the first time we actually took the train from Brighton to London they always knew that London was pretty close like even by care it takes what an hour and a half to get to London or at least her like Gatwick and stuff or Heathrow Gatwick is Brighton but or at least near enough Brighton but then we went up in the Train it only takes an hour to get to London from here and it was so quick like if I had like my switch with me or a game with or a book with me or something like that I think that that time would fly by cuz even just checking my phone and stuff it seemed to fly by and recording bits of a vlog and everything so I want to try and do more stuff in London other than a horse you can put them on top sweet who gives a we're not gonna have oxygen production offline for very long okay also oops I should have made the aerogel before I left I was gonna put the fabricator in there and make the aerogel but I realize we've no power so apparently I do give a umm right Oh wrong one shoe there and then I need my the gel sacks and some Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby oh that song that's a blast from the past play hollow night oh I really want that to come up for the switch soon let's go it is coming out on the switch soon for all I know I want to play hollow nighttime hopefully the one i hollow night an owl boy I want to play but I'm waiting for them on my switch wait what are we building what are we doing why am i building arrow Joe again oh yeah there are thermal deuter's oh and to magnetite Oh to magnet I right here know that to mana tight I should either just sitting there they're not even part of the stuff I dropped okay bear the brunt at the fire wonder if I just build it here well it just reached my base oh please oh please oh please oh golly gosh no I do need a power conductor in it super conductors did you see gold and titanium I have gold I have titanium guys I have all these things I'm so happy here it's on cord there was another reason I wanted to stream subnautica I I said it wasn't gonna stream in until I was done with the game I know that we are done with the game I'm streaming it and that's the story end of but a lot of people wanted to see it on court and I was just gonna take too long if I wanted to get the ends of story so now we can do that fun oh nice one yeah dear ooh three more titanium and I can build a multi-purpose room are there another titanium around titanium okay up we go are these new jump jets it's so much nicer haha there is titanium it was here from last time how is your diet going funny you asked that actually because we're not doing it anymore we we were doing the keto diet which was it was good for the starch and it was good to lose because I again long story but I I had like a lot of weight that I wanted to lose because I was like ten kilo heavier than I was before I moved and I really didn't like it so I wanted to lose 10 kilos I get back to like my super lean muscular fit kind of phase which I'm still working on Aikido is great for losing a bunch of weight quickly but I don't think you can get like way down to your target weights and all that stuff with it and it's just I don't know I got really bored of it I didn't like it anymore it's a fine diet but I don't think it's very sustainable so now we're just on a very healthy protein based diet again I know for a lot of people very very boring stuff but this is part of my life so which i think is just much better for me and I think keto is more for people who are like very overweight that need to lose a lot of weight very quickly which works it does it really just burned through my weight like nothing else and it really surprised me but again not sustainable oh man can I not build you here I was if I do that dude I think that wall is in the way crap if I just put you on top I mean that works and then we can just add a connector right or not apparently doesn't like doing that okay well how about we just destroy this thing how about we just have the multi-purpose room be the base yeah what are you guys thinking maybe he's building a base like that that made no sense you guys were making no sense right now okay and then we just put the hatch directly on that boom nice cool and then I can let this thing charge up right so we have the basis of our base back I need to go back and get my fabric at or she play hard mode I thought about it but I still stuff I want to do here and then perma death mode is one of those things that like if you go back and watch the new version of they saw the episodes leading up to this one I only died once he died once and the only time I died was when I was stupid and couldn't find Sally I went to Henry instead so if I wasn't moronic like that I wouldn't have died I don't think put you here scanner ooh yeah I'm getting for that now I might make another yeah do I need one I don't think so right it's kind of room is why we're here so I have the titanium and I should have the copper and the gold oh but I should have brought my upgrades from the other one wait what did I need two copper gold and table coral two copper golde don't even have a table Carl I don't but that's what's down here right I should just bring Maria down closer ah see I planned it all along oh wait I got build you inside okay are you gonna connect that seems pretty far away no you're not why aren't you connecting huh that poo do I have enough titanium for another thing one two three four okay I wanna see if I just build a tube out to it will will it build in should maybe move stuff slightly left yeah you should work right you are much closer than the other one and still no connect well that just about butters my biscuits just just connect just connect just just do the thing just connect connect no connect there's something I'm doing wrong this is all missing because it's sideways why did it start off sideways ah haha you're right when you're right you're right okay now I'm a three point six probably should build a base under this okay Maria I'm just bringing you down closer because this this is getting ridiculous we can't keep seeing each other like this we need to be closer Maria first I want to steal your lid that's magnetite I don't need that but I will start dumping other stuff back in D so these are now fall there we go use these to measure blah blah blah blah blah these little  are coming back that's cool the base and all the foggy glow eNOS I really like that these dicks let's go suck her onto the side of my my Maria oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on get your jimmies and order people engine powering down I want a modulator on my voice to make it sound like that like a super heavily edited voice oh that's awesome where it's just like huh what's there spooky spooky okay at least I thought it was cool can I build you under this will that even be a thing will you actually be part of the base if I do that this just looks stupid though it looks stupid why would I want to do that should I put it down before I did anything else guys I'll have you know this but I didn't think that through see I don't have any upgrades in here now range upgrade copper or magnet who can make that hurry need more cameras speed upgrade silver and gold I can get those and I have the chip okay that's fine magnetite and copper wait it was the other one I forget things so quick silver and gold I don't have any silver I think I purposefully didn't bring any silver with me because I can go get it myself pepper I'm coming to get you salt is coming for pepper I'm gonna make pool kids oh yeah they they added strength didn't they okay I'm going into deep dark down hi I got it mainly just cuz I kind of want to go down here cuz it's fun scary but fun that's my kind of scary stuff that just scares you and leaves you scared actually that's awesome too I like getting scared so I like horror movies and horror games and everything so much such a such a raw visceral emotion it's fun excuse me excuse me fishies you can stay in the air for so long now and when I like leave it go my jump jets recharge so fast so faster so furious what is you are you the copper your copper I don't need copper I need two golden two silver keep your all you keep your people's papers people we're looking for gold and silver see it with me gold and silver yes I think I found some of them down here before should be looking in the deposit shouldn't I instead of just searching for I made a  scanning or scanner room I already have the hood chip I mean a scanner room and I'm not even using it oh I deserve the that happens to me in this game this is gold all right drill that gold anyone want a necklace honey one more nice jewelry necklace watch ring for a coat can't get that out of the gold or drilling or anything but I can make one for you I can do it yes gold and silver hold on a second hold on a second are you kidding get off me get here they kill him good now stay dead what's dead is dead  that's a

you weren't paying attention you're not going to get the answers Jack needs silver Jack got gold why is my nose so itchy somebody tell me piss off whoa I didn't drink one everything liked hey you bet there that's more goal they don't need more gold I already have all the gold than I can old nothing thinking about that I ever see silver down here yep ha ha ha ha ha ha oh Jesus a scuse me career come here come here I hope you're not a fan of your bones asshole Oh hold on hold on we have a winner arias Santos you have won the 10 jacksepticeye points some other aw Matt Brown you were very close to it you were to chat messages down you know what both of you somebody else probably said it earlier but that was too fast it was a terrible Terry Tate quote arias Santos and Matt Brown you get the jacksepticeye points well done will you be able to cash those in at the end of the year they go against your taxes can you not you'll also be able to spend them in jacksepticeye land when that gets opened excuse me excuse me I have a bitch to deal with oh yeah that's so strong with someone fights back oh yeah great career bitch I'm being burnt to death and I'm kicking your ass what health are you at 50% and if you want to know what the reference was from look up office linebacker probably my favorite set of videos that exist on YouTube it's so good now if you excuse me I'm gonna get this silver real quick oh yeah you mark the 10 points you think I don't you think oh 10 points is not a lot I'm going to come back and get the reference that's a thousand points what if that never happens what if that other person wins by 10 points it's a lot of points those are make-or-break points why don't you give him more points for that one because that's a bit of a more obscure one it's not like I said they do move in herds what's that a reference from everyone would have gotten that now there's no points with that one you don't get points for that one okay excuse me um yeah I go look for eggs and all that stuff after this this is just building the base I'm only after getting down here I'm more I playing for fifty minutes now you know my struggle just getting down here and getting the resources to start building the base and I'm almost an hour in it's a long time it's worth it though it's one of those series that hours just kind of bleed away what's that one jaws I know you're joking I hope you're joking yeah remember in Jaws when they saw the shark and the guy said they do move in herds so good I want to do that what is I want somebody to dub over movies and just have them say ridiculous quotes from other movies that make no sense in the context of those other movies that was so funny Thanks all right can we build these now oh wait wait I didn't even get the stuff out of pepper my bad okay I didn't actually take any super okay and I need to go get a copper ore out of here Thanks Thanks [Music] don't burn and burn them whoo-hoo okay so what can we search for down here three pages blue okay sold for a copper or gel sigh heat area LED lithium magnetite nickel or Ruby shared strong stalk or tooth here on a night crystal these are all boring go search for them I'm gonna send my camera's out camera three what wait can I control the other cameras from Lake oh I can i camera five and six now I can control all the cameras from all the scanner rooms okay it's like she's your your sidekick and then from a lake Batman calorie intake recommended by the way I know I know you're on a mission you're on a recon mission getting into your cameras and everything but just remind you calorie intake recommended don't forget we're gonna plant some more stuff down here that means I could have just done this easier by bringing some  cameras down here and leaving them building more cameras and just bringing them down and leaving them here okay I'm gonna keep eating these okay these are the ones I need to plant banging my who's banging on my Maria but are you serious are you serious I'm coming for you get out of here you see through idiot oh I feel bad for doing that they're so cute spooky scary pace spooky scary mist base about you in there perfect oh alright but these cameras though one of them is going all the way back up here as far as it can go and it's going to go back to where the ghost Leviathan and everything is man you're slow I'm not gonna be able to get back that far but so I'm just gonna get as close as I can because then we have a range upgrade so it should be able to scan much much further you can feel like you've traveled much slower down here you probably only get as far as that tree if even yeah Street Monster Hunter again eventually probably do that and twitch again you want to keep you nice and snuggly over here can we make it can we make it oh yeah we can nice camera six camera six okay there we go took you long enough I'm gonna need I'm gonna need speed and efficiency here camera six can I can't cope with all this like in between E slow down E laggy nonsense I need you to be on your game on the ball it is a spooky god there's like no sound why there we go musics back and we're kind of at max range there okay yay we got one more thing titanium whoa my lights just turn on that was really weird or this suit oh look at that click playing that game scanner somber that I played man well this is a big ol pile of disappointment I thought I'd find like a bunch of stuff down here bunch of different stuff I thought I'd be able to search for like more creature eggs and everything because I could just make more cameras and go deeper down why don't you make cameras oh never mind I needed my firstborn child to build them Oh making computer chips and all that  is so annoying can I want to add more to my base though I want like I want some lights breaching through the darkness or the lights glass we have any glass oh oh f quarts it's not on me but I have it wow I didn't mean to go over there stop burning me quartz quartz quartz quartz quartz other things go go go quartz quartz have a name of the class where I needed a titanium gold and silver you can go in there but now I have a scanner room so if I do need stuff I can just go look for it then it is waiting around kind of  a man of action I'm a man of planning they get the things I needed glass glass put some spotlights on the top of it or somewhere they're sort of like breeches out through I think that would be cool I think that would be radical yeah my leg did turn on or something right one of the bulbs is going in it and every now and then I turn it on and I think they're on and then every now and then what it actually like finally pops on I'm like what happened something changed about my environment and I don't know what it is right you kind of want these lights here because if you're here you're kind of okay maybe that will work if you're there you're kind of already sticking out of the fog I want you below the fog they suck that's not fun that's not fun at all it's too bright down here that's the problem what have you got the floodlights to like no that's not gonna work my plans are all falling apart let's just see let's just see what you look like Oh bad yeah I should have guessed Wow see this is shine through whoo I know we're gonna have the spooky base base so still probably just put spotlights on it anyway because they're useful you can't even see that one spotlight on the front is it on I can't tell it's too bright in this stupid place sunshine down here why is it so bright down here what's giving me light next of lava which really shouldn't be you know glowing down here the water should be super cooling it I mean I'm just saying right you're gonna want to add more to my base I want to make it look awesome what should I add to my little Basie moon pool lubricant LED titanium ingots okay that's easy especially since I left lubricant down here how it works and I need to put there's a titanium thing right over here that I can get stuff out of Punk this just pop up as well I feel like I would have seen this on the way in it's an alien planet Jack that is true maybe the the the water works differently around here I probably won't be playing this again with the vive in VR it was to all over the place then the framerate was bad it was just hard to see what was going on I read what I watched the video afterwards I'm like this is so like bouncy and moving around and everything and game just works better without VR sorry peps I have to go now and to lead I don't think that's enough for titanium ingot they ran out of lead no wait I pick up both yeah so confusing this is like a tiny bit of lag now that I'm streaming it so the menus are a bit slower titanium ingot I keep forgetting that what I'm grabbing this stuff it goes into peppers inventory or not mine I would also like a thing in this game where if I have like a plasteel ingot made that I can reverse that because it's nice to be able to use some of the materials that are already in something else like the plasteel ingot already need one now but it has a titanium ingot in it so it'd be nice to reverse engineer and get all your materials back ah I only have three more pepper we need to go find some more titanium but pepper don't worry I have a plan because right now I have a scanner room and I can use this to help us continue boo-boo that's awesome so cool can we undo the stuff like that is actually a thing in the future oh I also need to build something for water that might be bad are you telling me there's titanium right there still there's not I just got it where where exactly show me the titanium show me the titanium that's supposed to be right in front of my face you're showing me titanium that's not there it's not there I just harvested that okay this one should be here because I haven't harvested anything down here don't lie to me don't you lie to me titanium ingots in Moorea Oh think so I have a plasteel ingot there's a plasteel ingot in Moorea but i don't think i have a titanium one that's why I was saying I wish I could just reverse engineer because then I get the titanium eating it out of the plasti one getting titanium is my life now together Oh No that's a lot of titanium boys nice okay a lot of you too pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew all right I need to go further see my base is like a secret now if anyone comes looking they won't be able to find it they'll just find me down here hold on hold on hold on almost did it again stop it stop no not nice what everything cool pray okay Oh God can I even put this anywhere uh oh I can put it there oh this might work I love that only the tiniest parts are sticking out over the top like the parts that actually matter oh oh oh we're breached oh oh oh he got some lithium need to get some lithium do I have lithium I have missed him breaching my base yep that's shh shh yeah it didn't happen it didn't happen it's not doesn't exist all these things that are here yeah that's not part of my base some other guy did that that was um Jeffrey the new intern yeah not me no I was just oh it decides to water my flowers ah nice guy good for him yes yes very good very good very good there we go can we drain oh my problems away no no okay so Manny holds okay I was worried that I was actually gonna burn in here because when I was outside I started to burn I don't wanna burn I'm in the water I'm out in the water I was just making an extra big moon pool I thought it was could i hook this to this yes but not yet I need another one god damnit pepper we need more titanium what are you doing yum-yum-yum okay I just replanting that and boom boom okeydoke right we still have a lot more titanium that we need to get for some reason I love burning through it I love finding it I love consuming it I just love being all about it - how is the titanium up here is that another part of life that I'm not aware of Wow look at you Oh make it a drill arm upgrade or it's just like Papa and then everything's done I would love that y'all doing good today hope you are hope you taking care of yourself hope you're happy first and foremost lies the titanium I get it all think so we pretty good that's good some people saying no it's also good as well because it means that tomorrow can be better if you are having a bad day I'm sorry to hear that Oh No now we're gonna do oh wait yeah god damn it the deconstruct to fabricate at first I don't even have room for all these materials do I yeah dudes PMA okay hold on a little longer don't burn to death yet did you connect yes okay we are also breaching again that's fantastic goddamnit okay now we're at five point nine that's good what do we mean for the bulkheads again ah that's why I brought the silicone okay let's start putting in some of them because they increase their whole integrity separate out all these well you know I've drunk fire to drain oh look at that you did it already hail integrity restored I don't think I have the pieces now I put the gold back in pepperoni see I've burned slightly every time getting into it now it's okay feel the burn so you know you're alive I need a hatch somewhere on this bad boy but where do boy deed ah maybe just right here because if I put it there it's gonna extend out towards me I kind of want to use these as a way of reinforcing nice I like building basis in this game it works really really well it's just fun to do - okay what else did I build that I took away spotlight I don't know if I want that still all right I could build another bulkhead here oh you know what could I go there yeah let's do that so right when you come into the hatch the bulkheads are either side like it would be in like a sci-fi movie or something oh that's awesome cool so it's like you come in here and you get your chemical bath and then you have to move on you can't go into the main areas without having to first go through this area that's pretty dope all right what else do I build might have an even better idea ha bye get more titanium well if we could put the hatch on top what if I came down from here like the base itself was hidden but the entranceway isn't so you come down and through it ooh that might be fun name or titanium though all right now I'm should be dumping stuff oh no I shouldn't I'm doing it right I need to free up this or when I go looking for titanium I can actually put it all in pepper thanks peps hey this should be one I haven't been to yet she make reinforced I ever sued again everyone keeps telling me that I should make them the diving suits I don't have the blueprints we have to find them in Rex I need to actually go to a wreck and find it in one of those like disk things that you pull out the little caricatures and then I can actually make them right now I don't have them they're not in my actual thing to be able to to be able to do my dog shot in the floor sorry man that's a hard day find the wreck I don't know which one it is a little worthy heir I'd have to look it up three chicken wings that's a good time right there that base is cool-looking okay pepper you can now go in here God freaked out on me like that because then we come down in through here oh I can't get out now just put a whole other multi-purpose room on top they wish there was another room that was kind of roundish that wasn't just the multi-purpose room I haven't even gotten there the sheet I don't have to take you out as well because god I have to get in to take you out because I can't get into your storage access without actually like you can't access this without being in it and then getting out there you go hmm guess I could do that but that's oh god it keeps lying that's a big room to put on top see what it looks like I'm curious I want to know okay that looks weird and you didn't connect so it's stupid it's pointless could just put something like this on it that connects but that doesn't look as cool Oh would you make a noise stop that could a four-way one on it but that also doesn't look cool and then I always feel obliged to have all of them actually doing something could I do a cool thing no power oh man okay take the power out of the scanner right now oh wait I have other batteries what are you doing there we go Oh any class wait do i oh I cuz I picked the glass one I wonder if I could build these all in a circle all the way around is that a thing you can do would that be really cool if I could do that okay join on oh I don't have enough titanium for it but could get a start going what yeah it is literally no purpose other than looking cool oh but I can only do it oh I can make the infinity symbol like a figure eight and we call our base infinity patent-pending don't steal my joke please please ah oh it's being torn apart again I don't have enough I need more titanium god dammit oh god yeah oxygen oh god that was the thing I needed down here if I had like infinite titanium and stuff I mean I can do that I could just turn that on and do it myself but I don't want you that I I feel like that takes some of the charm away take some of the accomplishment away I don't want to do that yes see this is so annoying it keeps telling me the Titanium's that they have any of you just sitting up here no lame I have the ones that we're back there well I guess we're going deeper boys and girls it's a really no titanium down here the Sounders not picking up anything there's nothing on our scanners go away go away I don't want you I don't like you I guess there's no more titanium down here pack it up time to go home see some sort of titanium deposit down further hi someone or that lead this is one got it but the Arctic zone there is no Arctic zone that's a dlc idea they talked about it's not actually in the game I have the fluids to intake seek fluid intake vital signs stabilizing all right cut some more titanium that's go ahead cook it more quarts I guess as well much room do I have left in this I don't have a lot of room time to head home no I was gonna hit him I was gonna get that satisfying Punk detector way I wanted to hit him well there's a new titanium guess I'm back in range for the thing how am i doing I'm doing pretty good should save your progress funny thing is I never saved my progress until the end of the videos because normally I'm recording and then I see if the recording is actually worked because if it hasn't then I've just overwritten where I was because this game doesn't have save slots it just has like one save file and then you keep overwriting it and stuff so if I if I end up playing and then I save halfway through and then I figure out that and something cool has happened and then I figure out that I can't or add a recording didn't work then I can't show it on video anymore because I can't go back and replay it I guess live-streaming it helps that fine fine I'll save my progress geez can't save right now there we go cuz no no matter what happens the live stream is archived okay that was a long save I need to get titanium oh dear thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks I was a even building with this oh yeah my figure eight oh wait no I need to build a reinforcement plate first otherwise we're gonna be back exactly where I was boom now we're at eight point two the Infinity is complete look at that that's cool people scientists for years will be coming down and going eight what could they have possibly meant by eight I'm like no stupid it's infinity okay now I need a hatch to get in just put a hatch on top I need quartz I don't need glass I just need quartz the irony of that like I don't need quartz oh wait I couldn't fit in my thing anyway even if I did want it hey I'm stuck oh god I'm actually stuck Oh No oh thank god jeez I thought you were gonna be stuck in there forever I was not gonna be a happy puppy about that well let's say haven't the jump-jet upgrade makes it a lot easier to get around in here doesn't take half as long anymore which Jack like another alien cache in the Krag field oh yeah I forgot to go to all of them that's another thing I have to do - I need to start looking them all up come after me I'm clean clean boy oh don't fall down in there the old fall down in there what did I say what did I say pepper for these quartz things were closer probably stood a scan for them oh well my figure age should have a wall full of lockers that's not a bad idea again need a lot more titanium to be able to do that oh wait they were down here found them go go go all right looks like anime hair what do I think the precursors look like I don't know I can't keep thinking that they look like the war pers cuz the war / then the precursors made the war / so maybe they made them in their image I don't know maybe not because by the sounds of it cuz we got information in the last episode or not the last episode they have so before that that one of the aliens that worked here was just sent somewhere else like they were they were stationed here to study some stuff we got that in one of the cache locations so we don't know if they're native to this planet because I was going to say if they're native to this planet then they're likely waterborne creatures and they likely have like the tails like the tendrils like all the Reapers and the war pers and everything because that would make sense it would make it easy for them to actually get around in the water then but if they're just stationed here studying things then who knows what they look like I bet they look like Mick Jagger he's a bit of an alien look about him Oh make it nice now forgetting this time tada I can't put you right there that's awesome ah ah oh wait I can't go down what what one reason I built that was so I could have a piece that was above we need to make a ladder god I don't even have the titanium for that so annoying I think I have titanium that I could just oh so say some of the lockers in here I could take apart to get titanium but can't take apart those lockers anymore titanium just laying around Oh is there some in pepper might be some and pepper and I've joined the Bernese own hey hey get off that's my Pepe damn it that order has none well I'm gonna search it again these ones are new firming firming firming the game for days this is what you need to do when I play this game seriously as all the episodes ever are and this is why I normally don't make them uncut because it's a lot of just being like okay I need this go get this come back write the next piece need this go get this come back it's not an 8 it's a pair of balls mm the ball Factory take the hatch off I still need the hatch I guess I could have taken off the top one just for titanium but I still have to come get it later because I want to see if I can put the hatch just on top and then take it all just put the hatch on top and then come down through the bottom so hard to see okay got it I see you you're not dropping me this time no uh Jax smart now was I not before party right here never the letter this way it has to go sideways hi yes it worked okay now we can get rid of this hatch sweet ha ha I love that I love making weird down here it's all a mess though all these freaking pieces hanging out that's so awesome it's kind of annoying that these sections are darker looking because of the way the lighting hit it wow maybe I should have some lights uh-huh uh-huh can't any glass wait just have some pepper I didn't want to get into that I wanted to get the thing out of that come here okay start putting a bunch of you in here because I need the glass alright I'm gonna burn for this but it's gonna be totally worth it ok did that fix the lighting issue no see this these two sections look like they're gray and these look like they're white Oh poop indeed alright whatever I don't have to make spotlights I spot a right on top of the hatch lock yourself out you can never get back in fist in your face recommended fill up all these no got lots of titanium got lots of titanium I can't fill up that Ghilas titanium even though I've had lots of titanium many times of the game already and they just kind of run out of it very quickly I thought I need for the water filtration system copper wire and titanium and aerogel hmm I can have those I can make that copper wire where did I see the aerogel aerogel and how many titanium three perfect awesome I just build a water filtration machine and then I would be your life forever down here boom I like how it down into the thing you can't see the bottom because the fog blocks it I love my base it's the best place you wish you had a base like this oh wait I haven't built a copper wire didn't I have aerogel Feeny you have to build the copper wire before you leave let me put in the aerogel did I even put a fabricator back in here I did it's in the moon pool there we go which means now I need some more thermal plants know if I have more aerogel Oh any more thermal plants because I thought energy is gonna run out pretty quickly with this thing to my site five titanium aerogel okay let me just see if I have aerogel I don't think I have another one pretty sure I don't have another one pretty sure I mean I would love if I did more titanium dang it but I should be able to just find gel sacks around here and Ruby and everything will be good in the hood see there's gel sac already thanks for already looking up and there's a Ruby I was there too second Ruby boo we did it already see that speed efficiency that's what I wanted out of my my systems out of my peppers out of my Murray's out of my everything boom-shaka-laka said all the stuff yay okay can you build anywhere cuz I'm running out of the health I'm running out of Life deadness is cashing up on me yeah now we should have twice the power how would you look at that we do you see this thing is already draining power like a mmm ever delicious food so good wait can I turn off this thing this doesn't use up any power when it's not scanning right it's like a big giant power button they can hit to turn the whole thing off thought it'd be amazing okay new base built and it's looking pretty awesome at least I think so I think that's pretty freakin good haha safe alright I'm going to leave this stream here um coming up in the two-hour mark let me just quit back out so that stays there stay stay stay good there we go that was fun I like doing that a bit more of a chill session we can just hang out and build stuff it's always nice but as always well this is going to go up afterwards when the stream is finished so if you're watching this afterwards hi but if you any suggestions on what to do next as always just let me know and I will try and do them there's a bunch of like little things that people want me to do and I will try and do them eventually but I don't know a lot of them are just like tedious little things that don't really add a whole lot like hidden the cuttlefish was a big thing cuz I wanted to do that and I wanted to build another base down here so I'm gonna extend on to my face I just like the base building I like doing that I do that over and over and over again if I could eventually I'm just gonna get my own save file like outside of videos and everything and just go with no cost to anything and build the biggest pace that I can possibly do well I might do it in a video anyway but you know what I mean blues foot I've support windows in my base I should do that scanner room upgrades don't stack sadly I tried to get double range on them or maybe maybe they do stack cuz I thought I at the time I thought range meant the further I could go maybe range means how far they can scan I don't know maybe they do stack I don't know what do I know thanks everyone for being here in the stream was fun I had a great time I hope you did and we still hit our daily sub now to go upload so that's good I have no idea what I'm gonna do for tomorrow because I was supposed to record that today but we'll figure it all out I might have to cut back on daily subnautica anyway just because of how much time it takes up and because I'm not doing anything super spectacular in the game anymore so I might have to just pump it down to like every second day or whatever just for for ease but thanks for watching i'ma leave this here I hope you guys have a wonderful evening hope you guys have a wonderful night morning whatever time of day you're in have a good one take care of yourselves No okay bye-bye everybody see you later 
*whip crack* Top of the mornin' to ya laddies! My name is jacksepticeye and welcome back to doki doki literature club! Things are getting weird...I don't know what to expect anymore Somebody's very very sad, somebody else came over to my house and had a great time but it was kind of tainted by something else...Monika keeps breaking the fourth wall...things are getting crazy! And after the reaction to the other episode that just went up, people are like "Ohh Jack's gettin' into the weird shit now." Okay, strap yourselves in Jack! You're the first one here. Thanks for being early! That's funny, I thought at least Yuri would be here by now. Monika is placing little booklets on each of the desks in the classroom. They must be the ones she prepared that has all the poems we're performing. In the end, I found a random poem online that I thought Monika would like and submitted it. So that's the one I'll be performing. I'm surprised you didn't bring Sayori with you. Yeah, she overslept again. That dummy... You think that on days this important she'd try a little harder. I say that, but I suddenly remember what Sayori told me yesterday... And I suddenly feel awful, knowing it's not nearly that simple for her. I only said it because it's the way I'm used to thinking, but... Maybe I should have gone to wake her up, after all? Ahaha. You should take a little responsibility for her, Jack! I mean, especially after your exchange with her yesterday... You kind of left her hanging this morning, you know? How did- how did you know? Exchange? Monika„Éº you know about that?? Of course I do. I'm the club president, after all. But„Éº! I stammer, embarrassed. Did Sayori really tell her about it that quickly? About how I basically turned down her confession? That makes me really seem like the bad guy here... But I'm the one who knows what's best for her, right? Jeez... You don't know the full story at all so... Don't worry. I probably know a lot more than you think okay Okay... Monika is being as friendly as usual, but for some reason, I felt a chill down my spine after hearing that. Hey, do you want to check out the pamphlets- I do not trust you. This is... she's weird. They came out really nice! But so, because she's broken the fourth wall already and told you to "save your game", does she know directly what the players doing? Yeah, sure... I grabbed one of the pamphlets laid out on the desks. Oh yeah, they really did. Something like this will definitely help people take the club more seriously. Yeah, I thought so too! I flip through the pages. Each member's poem is neatly printed on its own page giving it an almost professional feel. I recognize Natsuki's and Yuri's poems from the ones they perform during our practice. What's this...? I flipped to Sayori's poem. It's different from the one she practiced. It's one that I haven't read before... Oh god... It just says get out of my head over and over and over again. Ooooooh Creepy! Get out of my head before I do what I know is best for you. Get out of my head before I listen to everything she said to me. Get out of my head before I show you how much I love you. Get out of my head before I finish writing this poem. But a poem is never actually finished. It just stops moving. So is she saying that to me? That I'm the thing that she can't get out of her head? Oh God. Ah--- what is this? Reading the poem I get a pit in my stomach I keep having to check the fucking game files now as well, because it's causing shit on me! Jack? What's wrong? Ah, nothing... This poem feels completely different from everything else Sayori's written. But, more than that... I- I changed my mind! I'm gonna go get Sayori, so... Ah--- Well, alright! Try not to take too long okay! I quickly leave the classroom. Don't strain yourself~ Monika calls that out after me. I quicken my pace. What was I thinking? I should have tried a little bit harder for Sayori. It's not a big deal to at least wait for her, or help her wake up. Even the simple gesture of walking her to school makes her really happy. Besides I told her yesterday that things will be the same as they always have been. That's all she needs, and what I want to give her. I reach Sayori's house and knock on the door. I don't expect an answer, since she's not picking up her phone, either. Like yesterday, I opened the door and let myself in. Oh, no... Sayori? She really is a heavy sleeper... I swallow. I can't believe I ended up doing this after all. Waking her up in her own house... Isn't that more like something a boyfriend would do? I'm so nervous... In any case... It just feels right. Outside Sayori's room, I knock on her door. Sayori? Wake up, dummy... There's no response. I really didn't want to have to enter her room like this. Isn't it kind of a breach of privacy? But she really leaves me no choice. I gently opened the door. *gasps* (Screams!) Oh my god!!! What the fuck?! What's the fuck?! ( I don't know...) What's happening?! What's happening?! A new file just went into my game folders--- oh no! See traceback.txt for details. I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred. While running game code--- *traces the file* Restart top context: Oh jeez... I didn't break anything, did I? Hold on a sec. I can probably fix this... I think... Actually, you know what? This would probably be a lot easier if I just deleted her. She's the one that's making this so difficult. *scrolls* What?! What the fuck is going on...? What the hell?? What the hell?! Is this a nightmare? It... has to be. This isn't real. There's no way this can be real. Sayori wouldn't do this. Everything was normal up until a few days ago. That's why I can't believe what my eyes are showing me...! I suppress the urge to vomit. Just yesterday, I told Sayori I would be there for her. I told her I know it's best that I everything would be okay- Ooh, so that's why she didn't come out this mornin'! *falls into despair* *peeks the game file* Wait a second- No fuckin' way! There's a folder in the game called "characters". And in that folder, I've checked it before it just had Monika.chr, Natsuki.chr, and Yuri.chr. But it also had Sayori and Sayori's gone now. So her character has actually been deleted from the game files. *clicks the text box* Ooh, this is creepy! I don't like this! (yeah sure you love it) That's why--- it was Monika wasn't it? Because she's the one breaking the fourth-wall- there's only one character who could actually do that and she was talking in this.. *clicks the traceback.txt* She's the one saying "I didn't break anything, did I? It'll be a lot easier if I just DELETED her..." "Haha, well here goes nothing." You actually just deleted Sayori from the game! Ohoho, this is- oh, I get it, I get it now, I get what people were talking about! We're gonna be so hopeless. What did I do wrong turning down her confession? But has to have been what pushed her over the edge her agonized scream still echoes in my ears Where did I do that to her when she needed me the most? Why was I so selfish? This is my fault and the music's hidden all creepy my swarming thoughts keep telling me everything I could have done to prevent this If I just spent more time with her walked her to school and gave her what I know she wanted out of our relationship then I could have prevented this I Know I could have prevented this Screw the literature Club screw the festival. I just lost my best friend Someone I grew up with she's gone forever now Nothing, I do can bring her back This isn't some game where I can reset and try something different well technically it is and that's what Monica was saying to save your thing I Only had one chance, and I wasn't careful enough and now I carry this guilt with me until I die Nothing in my life is worth more than hers, but I still couldn't do what she needed from me And now I can never take it back never never never!! never!! NO WAY! So C or E is gone! But now all that's left is like an amalgamation of the other characters in her place.. Oh!! No!! It's starting the game again, but it's all fucked up! See you knowin girl run toward me for the distance waving her oh God! that girl is She just has no name anymore Or she gonna dish you gonna turn up all fucked up Ha ha ha oh jesus no Oh fuck you game Mornings are usually the worst being surrounded by couples and friend groups walking to school together meanwhile. I've always walked to school alone I'm so into this. This is an outstanding turn of events I Always tell myself, it's about time I meet some girls or something like that, but I have no motivation to join any clubs and perfectly so now The game has basically started again it tried to do it with C or E in it realize the character is gone and then Just decided to make up a scenario where that character never existed, so now we're getting new dialogue I mean obviously completely intentional by the developers, but that's awesome So is the anime club, but it's not like there would be any girls in it anyway Okay, this is all the same but different Frankly shirt the wallet confirm, okay clubs Maybe this is all the same. We've we've read this before Cuz there's no choice, but to start with the anime club, and this is where say Ori would come in Take all mother a god oh God she turned into Monica Monica. What did you do? Monica oh my goodness, I totally didn't expect to see you here, it's been a while, right uh? Yeah it has Monica smiled sweetly we do know each other well. We rarely talked, but we were in the same class last year Monica was probably the most popular girl in class smart beautiful athletic Basically completely out of my league so having her smile at me so genuinely feels a little What did you come in here for anyway? I've just been looking for some supplies to use for my club. Do you know if there's any construction paper in here or America's? Guess you could check the closet you're in the debate Cup, right? about that Actually quit the debate club really you quit yeah to be honest. I can't stand you. Okay. This is the same I'd much rather take something. I personally enjoy and make something special out of it In that case what club did you say to join actually I'm starting a new one oh fuck Let's see Yuri trying to get through a Literature Club literature, that sounds kind of dull how many members you have so far It's kind of embarrassing, but there's only three of us so far you fucking liar there was four It's really hard to find new members for something that sounds so boring Well, I can see that, but it's really not boring at all you know Literature can be anything reading writing poetry I mean one of my members even keeps a ramanga collection in the club room wait really Yeah, it's funny right she always insists that manga is literature, too. I mean she's not wrong. I guess Besides a members a member right? Did Monica say she? Mmm. Hey Jack by any chance. Are you used to looking for a cup to join uh? I mean I mean I guess so but in that case is there any chance you could do me a big favor I won't ask you to join, but if You could advert the very least visit my club it would make me really happy, please Um I guess I have no reason to refuse are we just progressing now forgetting that say Ori ever existed Besides how could I ever refuse someone like Monica sure I guess I can check it out Awesome, you're really sweet jack. You know that but it's really nothing Shall we go then and look for the materials another time you are more important. You're doing this on purpose aren't you? Is she like a character who's able to see through Lake she's like Deadpool or flowey she's able to like see through the game She's able to see through the fact that it's a game and she's talking like She knows that you're gonna be there She kind of needs you for something and or maybe she wants me, and she's getting rid of all the other girls although she only say or he's dead, but she bought it sounds weird I Timidly follow Monica across the school in upstairs a section of the school I rarely visit you yeah, this is all the same wanna get full of energy swings open the classroom door And back and I've brought a guest with me who fucking christ. Okay. This is terrifying Yeah a guest no that means all my progress with URI is reverted Now we were getting along so well wait I wonder did any Hey, happy thoughts is the same Nervous Seriously, you brought a boy way to kill the atmosphere Don't be paint Natsuki, but anyway welcome to the Cobb jack All words escape me in this situation this club. It's full of incredibly cute girls all this stuff. We've seen before You're Monica's boyfriend right? What no I'm not Netsuke the girl with the sour attitude his name apparently nice key. Yeah, this is all the same as well Anyway, this is not Sookie energetic as usual except say Yuri was the one introducing me to all of these the last time And this is Yuri the vice president no Say Ori was the voice voice president It's nice to meet you Yuri you appears compared to be more mature and timid seems the aaaa It's nice to meet both of you so I ran into Jack in a classroom, and he decided to come check out the club Isn't that great? wait Monica Didn't I tell you that let me know in advance before you brought anyone knew I was going to well you know Sorry, sorry. I didn't forget that but I just happened to run into him in that case. I should at least make some tea, right Yeah, that would be great. Why don't you come sit down Jack? The girls of a few desks arranged to form a table Yuri walks to the corner of the room and opens up the closet meanwhile Monica and NAT ski sit across from each other Still feeling awkward. I take a seat next to Monica So I know you didn't really plan on coming here, but will make sure you feel right at home. Okay as President of the literature cup it's my duty to make the club fun and exciting for everyone Sprays aren't more people in the club yet You know I'm sprays there's not one energetic pink haired girl with a ribbon whose lovely and we all forgot about Must be hard to start a new club you could put it that way Not many people are very interested in putting all out all the effort for something brand-new Especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention like literature You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile But it makes cool events like the festival that much more important I'm confident that we can all really grow this cup before we graduate right Natsuki Well, I guess let's Keep reluctantly agrees such different girls all interested in the same goal Monica. I must have worked really hard just to find these two She didn't you don't deserve this URI returns to the table carrying a teasing well, we keep saying that but she might not have anything to do it at all but I'm on to you Cheerilee places tea cup in front of each of us some of this is all the same So I'm just repeating the same lines keep a whole tea set in the classroom Don't worry teacher gave us permission after all and hock up to you. Good book. I guess Don't let yourself get intimidated here. He's just trying to impress you That's not insulted URI looks away I meant that you know I Believe you well tea and reading might not be a pastime for me, but I at least enjoy tea I'm glad Yury friendly smiles to herself and relief So check what kinds of things do you like to read? Well soon you know little I've read the past few years. You didn't you read a lot You're answering the same thing But I is a player this is like Groundhog Day But I is the player No And I'm playing as Bill Murray who doesn't know? Really weird I'm skipping some of this because this is all the stuff. We've seen and now when I went into the settings before it said skip unseen text So this means skip everything except the unseen text because I would like that because now I don't want to reread everything I've read already Okay, I'm gonna save... No!! No Oh!!! Fucking weird! These are all saves another ganda oh! That's awesome Monica. What did you do okay? I want to see what happens if I if I click this Okay, okay, okay stop sup sup!! Do you have any ready experience to hurry? Maybe sure sir okay? I don't know if I actually skip some shit, sorry!!! you can set an example and help Natsuki feel comfortable enough to share hers I Guess it's the same for URI we all sit in silence for a moment hey. I just got an idea how about this? This is all the stuff I've seen You've been locked a special poem Would you like to read it? I hope I didn't actually skip anything. Sorry just allotted that was the exact same stuff... Just missing say Orie Okay, I'm on to you game. I'm checking your shit a dream. I was wandering an abandoned warehouse at night I was lost looking for an exit. She wanted to go home I came upon a huge empty room its ceilings and walls that deep black beyond the deep blackness My steps were quick in order to hurry to the other side or to a wall anything suddenly the ground was no longer beneath my feet I stepped into a hole of into intermediate inter indeterminate with I Fell for a good 5 seconds before crashing into warm water Figuring out which way was up. I surfaced myself the air was human and the sounds of my splashing reverberate it endlessly My vision was completely swallowed by the dark with one hand I could feel the depth metal wall of the container My lungs were already getting tired Oh no Ok so Since I went through this already and since I did URI stuff, let's see what happens if I go with Natsuki stuff now Boop sweet, this is the stuff that I said it'd all be perfect for her Dance yeah, let's see if I can actually predict her if she really was that easy all along On get 20 out of 20 for her Oh Oh melody yeah Chocolates Fun sugar Twirl Joy what You like joy since when Yuri I Know you okay Valentine Bunnies Puppies Heart giggle milk Other that's a chillax climax Hope oh shit and love oh no oh no stop stop oh It's almost like the game is like hey remember me It's one of those things that it's like the game knows what you're doing And it's giving you that like creep up your back. Hi again check glad to see you didn't run away on us, haha I don't worry. I'm just might be illustrating me needs to keep my word. This is the stuff I said to say Ori. Oh god stop You must stop this Thanks for keeping your promise check over the 200. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh No, no, hope oh Come on like he deserves any slack. This is all stuff. We read before as well Where are you in front of the text? Now but now I know I'm like keyed into everything now didn't know what type of game This is I'm like I'm identifying Every single little clue like her standing in front of the text does that mean she thinks she's in front of the other girls This is all the same stuff I read the stuff that I think is new So you wanna skip, but I feel like it's not actually skipping the unseen stuff or skipping to the unseen stuff And it sounds like the music is slightly going out of tune Yeah, yeah, this is us reading the book again I Should look it up. Just away. Just so I know oh god. There's a food There's a text file in the folders now. This is can you hear me? There's a little devil inside all of us beneath there manufactured perception their artificial reality is a writhing twisted mass of dread loathing judgment elitism self-doubt or Thrashing to escape the feeble hold of their hosts Seeping through every little crevice they can find Into their willpower starving them of all motivation and desire Into their stomach forcing them to drown their guilt and comfort food or into a newly opened gash in their skin hidden only by the sleeves of a cute new shirt Such a deplorable tangled masao is already present in every single one of them That's why I choose not to play myself with her actions all I did was untie the knot Okay, so Newly opened gash in their skin hidden only by the sleeves of a cute. New shirt seems like she's wherever this is talking about URI Clothing judgment elitism self-doubt is that nat sake oh? This is really bizarre This is phenomenal I love this type of shit She seems to be annoyed by something I approach her in case she needs a hand oh, this is new okay Looking for something in there. Oh Fucking Monica hmm She never puts my stuff back in the right spot What's the point in keeping your collection organized that someone else is just gonna mess it up That's a key slides a bunch of strike box and boxes across the shelf Manga, you eat manga, right? Sometimes I've known to dabble Manga is one of those things where you can't admit. You're really into it until you figure out what the hooded person stands Yeah, how did you know anyway? How did you bring it off at some point? Besides it's kind of written on your face What's that supposed to mean? But I see the Salone volume of manga omits the stack of various books on the side of one of the shelves curious I pull it out of the stack There it is let's key snatches it out of my hand and she turns to a box of manga and slips the volume right into the middle of the rest ah Much better Seeing a box set would one book missing is probably the most irritating site in the world I know that feel I got a closer look at the box that she said she's admiring parfait girls The series I've never heard of my life that probably means it's either way out of my demographic or it's simply terrible Way to be elitist my dude Okay, keeping an eye on files If you're gonna judge, you can go do it through the class on that Thor she boys at the classroom door hey I wasn't judging anything didn't even say anything I was totally churching in my head dog It's the tone of your voice Bryant's man you wanting Jack Kassandra distillate oh fuck Don't judge a book is this you saying this is this C or E. Trying to get through me? Let's keep pulls out the first volume of Perak fate girls from the box I'm going to show you exactly why she showed us. The book right into my hands. Ha I stare at the cover It features four girls in colourful attire striking animated feminine poses Sounds very familiar It's exceedingly mo We just stand there what? Let's get grabs my arm and pulls me out of the closet She then takes a seat against the wall we need the windowsills she puts on the ground next to her signaling me to sit there What chairs be more comfortable I? Take my seat chance wouldn't work. We can read the same time at the same time like that Why is that I guess? It's easier to be close together like this Don't just say that make me feel weird about it Let's ski crosses her arms and scooches an inch away from me This is like what I was doing with Yuri, but now it's not Sookie Didn't exactly expect to be sitting this close to her either not that I can say it's a particularly bad thing I opened the book It's only a few seconds before not Sookie once again inches closer reclaiming the additional space while she hopes I won't notice I can feel her peering over my shoulder much more eager to begin reading than I am Wow, how long has it been since I read the beginning You don't go back and flip through the older volumes every now and then Really, maybe sometimes after I've already finished the series hey pay attention oh Yeah, but nothing's really happened yet So I can talk at the same time looks like it's a bunch of friends in high school typical slice-of-life affair I kind of grew out of these since it's a rare for the writing to be Entertaining enough to make up for the lack of plot, are you saying something developer about your own game? Oh god. You look even more like a child now that I'm this close Are you sure this isn't boring for you? It's not Even though you're just watching me read Well, I'm fine with that You say so because it's fun sure you something you like with someone else I was getting excited when it convinced any of my friends to pick up a series. I enjoy you know what I mean oh You don't That's not I Wouldn't really know What do you mean don't you share your mango with your friends? Could you not rub it in jeez ah? Sorry I Gotta ever get my friends to read this you just think mangoes for kids can't even bring it up without them being all like You still have four grown out of that yet makes you wanna punch him in the face I know those kinds of people Honestly takes a lot of effort to find friends who don't judge much less much less friends who are also into it Already kind of a loser so I guess I gravitated toward the other losers over time Bruce brought me harder for someone like you Yeah, that's pretty accurate Wait which part I mean I feel like I can't even keep it in my own room My dad will beat the shit out of me if he found this Whoo-hoo Let's leave here in the clubroom said Monica's kind of a jerk about it. Oh Just can't wait Kenan Well it paid off in the end didn't it I mean Here. I am reading it Well, it's not like that solves any of my problems maybe Least you're enjoying yourself, right? So Jeez that's enough you want to keep reading or what yeah, yeah, I flipped the page Time passes Natsuki is strangely quiet now the clients over at her oh she's asleep Hey, that's key hey, yeah Suddenly nice and that's key collapses straight into me. Hey. Oh god. No. Oh Why? What the fuck is this why are you all weird all of a sudden What the fuck oh geez Natsuki are you okay? Here Monica reached into her bag and pulls out some kind of protein bear. She throws it in at Sookie's direction. That's keys I suddenly light up again. She snatches the bear from the floor and immediately tears off the wrapper I Told you not to give me She doesn't even finish her sentence before stuffing it into her mouth Don't worry jack. She's fine. It just happens now, and then that's why I always keep a snack in my bag for her I'm getting really weird like controlling AI vibes from you controlling all the other aspects of the game This is fucking cool anyway. We don't we all share our poems now Okay, let's let's go to your either Nats ki there Monica Cuz I want to see what Yuri thinks of my porno Yuri stares at the poem a minute pass is more than enough time for her to finish reading oh Sorry I forgot to start speaking Um it's fine. Don't force yourself. I'm not I just need to put my thoughts into words Hold on Okay, this is your first time writing a poem right? Yeah why do you ask I'm just making sure I guess that it might be after reading through it ah So it's that bad No, did I just raise my voice? Oh? Oh? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry Yuri buries her face or Hanson Maybe I should have gone for your Ease poem again What if me picking a girl is ends up saving that girl couldn't help, but notice that it's been several minutes And we really haven't gotten anywhere if I take Yuri a while to get used to new people it's fine I really didn't notice how are you saying? right um It's just that there are specific writing habits that are usually typical of new writers and having been through that myself I kind of learned to pick up on them. I think the most noticeable thing I recognize in new writers Is that they try to make their style very deliberate? Okay, yeah, this is the same stuff as before Okay Yeah, this is all the same Okay, let's see if her poem is the same Ghost under the light the tendrils of my heirloom in a panini yeah, this is the same Okay terrible handwriting we've been here before Hmm yeah, this is all the same, maybe I should just skip okay Natsuki Okay well, let's start with the things I don't like first of all um That's kiri reads my poem Never mind. I'll feel like giving you my opinion Then what's the point of sharing it in the first place? I wrote this when I could have been doing other things In fact remember I said, I wanted to read your poems That's what I had in mind when I was writing this I wanted to help you feel comfortable enough to share yours like Monica said, huh? Well he'd be more comfortable sharing my poem and yours was really bad He was supposed to show me some dumb poem and make me go huh well it's not that great But let me show you what a real literature looks like you went and ruined it. Hope you're happy So in other words you're saying you liked it Minsky's retort gets caught in her throat You're so you just you Don't understand anything. Do you I only told you that you don't have to go announcing it to the world like you are all self-important Pretty sure you never actually said that say that mostly to myself. That's he must really hate me or something How do we grow if it's a win or a loss that she liked my poem? In any case you still need to show me yours right yeah fine. I guess Only because Monica will make me if I don't same one Okay Sorry so is this basically saying it matters fuck or what you write This the same stuff Yep She's gonna give me the same writing tip of the day, okay stop. Uh, haha fuck Guess you could say it's fancy Thanks yours is cute cute that you could really miss it yeah. This is the same Co the notes are different in that song our thing is gonna get So my prediction of what's going to happen is that the the deeper into this. I get more characters are going to start disappearing and then The game is going to get progressively more fucked up Yeah, that's saying that Talking about her boobs being big and talking that Jack like my poem as well and Or there was some text in there than didn't get to see shit Fuck I skip to the oh god don't do that Hi Um hey Jack Why don't we step outside for a little bit okay? What the fuck is happening man Sorry about that They really shouldn't have tried to get you involved It's probably better for us to stay out of this Go back inside once. They're done yelling ha ha ha ha Some president. I am right Can't even confront my own cup members properly. I just wish I was able to be a little more assertive sometimes But I never have it in me to put my foot down against others you understand, right? Anyway if this makes you want to spend less time with the others then that's fine I'd be happy to spend some time with you instead Suddenly were not Sookie runs out of the classroom. Oh, no she's crying She quickly runs away. Oh dear what it looks like they're done. I Didn't mean it I didn't mean it I didn't mean it Yuri is rocking back and forth in her desk with her pans on her forehead Yuri, but I didn't mean it I I believe you I've no idea what you were he might have said to Natsuki or did Jack Please don't hate me please. I'm not like this There's something wrong with me today. It's fine Yuri. We know you didn't mean it Besides, I'm sure Natsuki won't forget all about it by tomorrow Completely The meeting is over you can go home now if you want Here he looks at me like she wants to say something But she keeps glancing at Monika you you can go first Monika I'd like to stay a little bit longer I think the president so I should be the last one out I Wait for you to be done Well I'm vice president, so please let me take that responsibility today Kind of sounds like you don't want me around or something you reek It's not that it's not that I just I didn't get much of a chance to discuss my book with Jack it would just be embarrassing with you listening I Guess I don't really have a choice. Do I I'm sorry for causing you trouble fuck oh Fuck me dude Fuck me, dude. It's Monica Monica's doing everything It's like she's supposed to be controlling the girls. That's why she's the president And when they try and go against her she just fucks it all up I mean if that wasn't telling that when they were arguing she just came out of nowhere Came in front of all the dialogue options and everything basically breaching the game and talking directly to the player oh Fuck it weird Okay all the other characters are still there anyway Okay, I guess it doesn't fucking matter what I pick around here It just seems that it's all random Well I picked a lot of URI stuff anyway it seems Luther Day has another day passes. It's time for the club meeting already this this game or no there's another thing There's a text file, and it just has all the letter like lowercase eyes Just like iiiii. What does it say I? Hate this I can't do anything nothing No matter how many times you play, it's all the same It would be really really easy to kill myself right now But that would mean I don't get to talk to you anymore all I want is for you to hate them Why is that so hard? Is that Monica talking to me Okay, um URI cuz it's like It's like she was acting out not under her own will that Monaco is making her do stuff Saying that like she kept glancing over at Monica saying that she's not normally like this And then Monica was like I didn't want to have to do this. Are you gonna make me do it aren't you and Then the day ended like she didn't have a choice Nats Keys reading manga at a desk and surprisingly Monica isn't here yet Suddenly URI takes my hand and pulls me to the corner of the room About yesterday, I I? really need to apologize nothing like that has ever happened before and Something just came over me. I guess I Wasn't acting mentally sound please don't think we usually like this Not just me, but not Sookie as well URI I'm happy that you were considerate and apologize, but you have to worry too much Even though I've only been here a couple of days. I could tell something was off yesterday We were just a little extra sensitive because those our first time sharing poems Whatever it was it didn't make me think any less of you I already had decided that there's no way you could be a bad person and now that you're apologizing I know you really didn't mean it Jack Don't say those kinds of things so frankly they make me a little too happy. I'm really glad that you're such an understanding person And I'm really glad that you joined this club everything is a little bit brighter with you around and Sorry, what am I saying right now? I just Know I haven't I was also kind of wondering where she was man You're a I'm guessing you have an eater You're he's clearly taken aback by how calmly Natsuki is addressing her like something reset and didn't happen and somebody can't remember it No, I haven't geez Smoker at all I know it's stupid, but I can't help but worry a little bit What? What are you looking at me like that? um That's the key about yesterday. I just wanted to apologize I Promise I didn't mean any of the things I said and I'll do my best to stay under control from now on so Yuri Thank you talking about Did you do something yesterday? Oh? Fuck Yuri's gonna be the next one to die isn't she Because she's not under the spell anymore. She's not a puppet anymore geez Whatever's on your mind, I'm sure it was nothing I don't even remember anything bad happening You're the kind of person who? worries too much about little things Aren't you? But I accept your apology anyway, if it helps you feel better about it Besides it's kind of nice to hear since I was always afraid you secretly hated me or something like that No not at all I don't hate you ha ha ha well, they're kind of weird I don't hate you either Let Sookie turns to me. You're still on trials oh Hey, suddenly the door swings open Sorry, I'm super sorry ah there. You are I Didn't mean to be late. I hope you guys weren't worried or anything Nah, well that ski was not What took you so long anyway well My last period today was study hall to be honest. I just lost track time so this is the same It's no sense though you would have heard the bell ring at least. Yeah same practicing piano Okay Working on a song will let you down Jack Monica smiles, sweetly Monica wants me all to herself doesn't she Don't worry something that I could share with you anyway There's a break so much recently yeah now that I think back to her saying that lines that she was Practicing the song a bit too much recently because of me Now I get it was she under was she controlling se or II from the start and made her Bring me into the club check Since your compliments put me in a good mood. I was wondering if you would like to spend some time together today I mean in in the club Suppose, so yeah. This is the same cuz I made the joke last time like in the club She's reading over there, so it's okay right alright that case. I don't see any problem Okay, can we start now? Let's find a place to sit? Being a little forceful, Erin. I am I'm sorry my heart. Just won't stop pounding for some reason I'm on to you I'm not reading by the way because this is all stuff We've seen before or some of it is very similar to what we've seen before so Sorry, if it seems like I'm just skipping over it Portrait America same Okay oh Shit I was like we just skip a little bit ahead and see but some of the fucking black dialogue came up damn it What's Auto? So just skip on its own haven't I was interesting anything Or they just skip anyway said something about my whole body Fuck dude Oh Creepy So good I love it Like I've said this before I think even some of the games that I've played that I've done this before as well I love fourth wall breaks. That's one of the reasons. I love Deadpool so much So this is awesome There's a still fuckin Christ it still gets me every time stop glitch and out like that Yeah, let me just get the book I quickly retrieve the book and put it in my bag fine if I sit right here Yeah, this is the one that she said she had two copies, right? And so we sit next to each other Keep an eye out oh fuck it skips it on its own. I didn't like I didn't even click that time it just like flipped over itself I Don't really mean to you. Sorry, I mean Yeah now we're gonna sit next to each other at our desks this day is all the same And keeping my eyes peeled on the environment as well You might be able to see some of the dialogue if you're watching the video And a little trick if you're watching youtube videos if you're if you're watching the video you can actually go frame-by-frame On YouTube the left and right arrow keys on your computer you can't do this on phones or mobile devices but left and right arrow keys on your computer skip forwards and back five seconds and then The comma and the there full stop icons on your keyboard go frame-by-frame They're all so little like Greater or - or greater and less than signs on your keyboard so you can do that so some of the dialogue that skips over Its own you can actually go back and go frame by frame and see it for yourselves I can't do that because I'm it just skips it on its own, and I can't see it here And if it's not actually working on your video click the video itself click play or click the video on video window and then play it again and then it should allow you to use the keyboard to be able to skip through stuff and Instead of pressing space to pause and unpause your videos I don't know why II but the actual button to pause and unpause videos on YouTube is K And then I will so you can use K to like spam pause or not to see some weird shit They I feel like that's gonna be good advice for this series So this is me telling her that the character reminds me of her Now we're talking about yeah She sends up and rushes over the transfer machine I miss something what on earth was that about Jack did something happened just now I Have no idea He was acting a little strange I guess So you don't know anything? Sorry, I can't say I do you worried about her. Oh no not really I Was just making sure that you didn't do anything to her no no nothing. Huh, don't worry. I believe you silly Here he just does this sometimes, so it's not alarming All right, if you say so Anyway, why don't we start sharing our poems at each other? Shouldn't we wait for Yuri. Well. She might be a while, so I just started figured we get started without her Is that okay? Yeah, I was just asking I stand up I make a mental note of where he left off in the book and I slip her back into my bag Okay, let's go to Monica last because she's the fucked-up one Well, it's not terrible with three disappointing after your last one and again, if this one is this good. It's your last one I will be completely pissed. Well. I guess I wanted to try something a little different this time fair enough You're still new to this so I wouldn't expect you to find your style right away I mean everyone the club writes really differently from each other Maybe you'll find a little influence from all of us for instance. I noticed that you were spending some time with Yuri today No, I care, who you spend your time with after all I was thought never to expect anything from anybody So it's not like I was waiting for you or anything still you didn't even look over my palm Might be able to learn something from it This is new Oh coz before I wasn't able to actually read her Poems she would skip over me and say fuck you or whatever Amy like spiders you know what I heard about Amy Amy like spiders deke wrigley hairy ugly spiders That's why I'm not friends with her Amy has a cute singing voice. I heard her singing my favorite love song every time She sang the chorus my heart would pound to the rhythm of the words She likes spiders. That's why I'm not friends with her one time. I hurt my leg really bad amy Helped me up and took me to the nurse I tried not to let her touch me she likes spiders so her hands are probably gross, and that's why I'm not friends with her Amy has a lot of friends. They always see her talking to people she probably talks about spiders What if her friends start to like spiders too? That's why I'm not friends with her Doesn't matter if she has other hobbies doesn't matter if she keeps it private doesn't matter if it doesn't hurt anyone. It's gross She's gross the world is better off without spider lovers, and I'm gonna tell everyone Not bad right it's quite a bit longer than yesterday's Yesterday's us way too short I was just warming up But we didn't think that was the best I could do no of course not Anyway, the message is pretty straight forward in this poem folk Amy cook fighters. It's simple I don't have to explain it like anyone would argue like anyone would agree that the subject of the poem is an ignorant jerk Everyone has some kind of weird hobby, or a guilty pleasure Something that you're afraid if people find out they make fun of you or think any less of you anime But that just makes people stupid Who cares what someone likes as long as they're not hurting anyone and it makes them happy Yeah, I guess I can agree with that wait Okay You ready left in a rush, and then I was like wait if she's still in the game But her character is still in the folder I think people really need to learn to respect others for liking weird things But just two of the girls in this very club whom I respectfully won't name Hey, if ironic that even in my one place of comfort I can't even have people respect me cheeese hey you're making me complain too much Why don't I do porn? It's worse? I respect you. Well I? guess Thanks It's kind of obvious that you respect Yuri more so whatever we're not sharing you can even ow you're a lot like no good Hi again jack, how's the writing going? Alright, I guess. I'll take that as long as it's not going bad hobby. You're playing yourself. This is all the same as well Hey my poem to Monica a great job jack I was going in my head while reading definitely remember her saying that line before Um Okay Well see if she says anything about Yuri Hmm suddenly the door opens Yuri I'm back. Did I miss anything not really well we all started sharing our poems with each other Already I'm sorry for being late. No need to apologize We still have plenty of time, so I'm more glad that you took all the time you needed All right, thanks Monica. I suppose. I should get to my poem now. Anyway. You want to read my poem now I like this one turn out so I hope you do too Yeah save me Yeah, I read this one before Oh, I read it, but it wasn't accentuated like this Some of the letters are actually missing now cacophony is capitalized stop sine cosine tangent knife breathing ribcage I Knew you had weird letters under your stuff for some reason oh shit that was more to it fuck I don't like it Monica's writing tip of the day you're facing a difficult decision when that happens don't forget to save your game It said wait who am I talking to you tell me you can hear me, please tell me please help me Okay It's made rice for today, thanks for listening I've been waiting for this. Let's see what you've written for today We see Miss plays. Do you like it Jack? How did you pick up on this? Okay? This is all the same? Ah? She blushing it makes me so happy it's amazing to feel like I'm valued Jack my heart pounds. Just holding him Ha ha ha all the same stuff again Routine wheel turning on an axle grinding Bald head linear year box falling sky. 7. Holy steaks a duct ship a portal to another world a thin rope tie to a thick rope a Torn harness parabolic gearbox expanding universe time controlled a kaleidoscope of blood written in clocks a time devouring prayer connecting a sky of 40 gears and open human eyes in all directions breathing gear box breathing bold head breathing ship breathing portal breathing snakes Okay Haha, doesn't really matter what it's about my mind has been a little hyperactive lately, so I had to take it out in your pen That is a pen fell out of your backpack yesterday, so I took it home for safekeeping And I am I just really like the way that it writes So I wrote this poem with it and now you're touching it I'm okay. What did I just pretend this conversation never happened? You keep the poem though? You've knocked a special poem would you like to read it? Oh the last one was so fucking weird though. I Can't convince myself to go to therapy when I'm the happiest I've ever been I'd rather keep this up until I blow my cover and someone takes me to the emergency room Okay everyone Rodan reading Ichigo those poems write Me something we need to go over today So if everyone could say front room is this about the festival well sort of I actually said that but she said it as well Hahaha, so I didn't read it in her voice. I was saying it to myself Do we really have to do something for the festival so they can put together anything good in just a few days? Just send up embarrassing ourselves instead of getting any new members That's a concern of mine as well. I don't do well last-minute preparations. Don't worry so much. We're gonna keep it simple Okay, look. There's been a little more Navi Araz jack joined. We started some calm activities. This is cybers become complacent We still only have four members the festival is our only real chance to find more. You know Perforate about getting new members anyway. We already have enough to be considered an official Club All members to just mean everything gets noisier more difficult to manage That's the key I don't think you're looking at it. The right way at all Don't you want to share your passion with as many people as you can to? Inspire them to find the same feelings that brought you here in the first place The literature Club could be a place where people can express themselves like they can't do anywhere else Should be a place so intimate that you never want to leave. I know you feel that way too. You know Like you never want to leave You know we all do so that's why we should work hard. I put something together for the festival They flip it something small right jack Uh-oh come online can't take advantage of Jack to agree with you Just because he doesn't know how to say no to anything look Monica Do you think any of us here joined the club with other people in mind you you never even talked until Jack joined That's for me. I just like it better here than I do at home Maybe she's the one going through Like family issues. She said something about her dad would beat the shit out of me if He found I know that was the the black text but That's everyone Sorry, but you're really the only one who's interested in finding new members the rest of us are fine like this I know you're president at all, but you should really consider your opinions for once I heard Phineas for once Monica's clearly taken aback by not Sookie's words that's Not true at all. I'm sure URI and Jack want to get more members to write I Don't know about URI, but I'm kind of indifferent if I showed as much enthusiasm as Monica wanted Then I'd probably be lying still it's up to me to rescue this situation No That's like. He's right. Isn't she this club. It's nothing more than a place for a few people to hang out Why did I think that everyone here saw it the same way I did? But that doesn't mean we that we're against getting new members or anything Jack. Why did you even join this club? What were you hoping to get out of it? well It's not really something that can be honest about is it in fact if I remember you weren't even given a choice not to join Monica's sits down and stares at her desk It's the point of all of this anyway What if starting this club was a mistake? Now you've done it NAT Sookie what me I just spoke my mind is it a crime to be honest It's not about being honest, it's about word choice Besides you have no right to speak for everyone else in the club like that You don't understand at all I just I just want to play some field tonight saying I would a few friends Is there a problem with the club being that for me throughout that many other places like that for me? No Monica wants to take that away from me. She's not taking anything away. No Jack. It's not a sane I won't be the same at the direction She wants to take it. I wanted that and I gonna just join any other stupid Club with this one I mean At least for a little bit of time things were dice That's he starts packing up her things I'm going home. I feel like I don't belong here right now. That's key Let's gig Nora's EURion walks wait under the classroom This is bad. I don't know what to do Well do you have an opinion on the first of all but I don't know I'm kind of indifferent I guess oh Who cares about that obnoxious brat oh God is that your thoughts breaking through. I mean, I like how nice and quiet the club is right now And I'm just happy with you here, but still The vice-president, it's not right for me to extraor ignore my responsibilities like that Nobody would cry if she chose herself Oh God Huh I Should do my best to consider everyone's perspective and make the decisions that's right for the club. What about you jack? What do you want to get out of this cub? Yuri repeats the same questions as Monica it's like giving an indirect answer is better than nothing I Think the most important thing for it is for everyone to just get along and for the club to provide something that you can't get Anywhere else I don't think it's about a new member or about how many members, but rather the quality of each member that's what will end up making the literature Club a special place I see And really agree with you Each member contributes their own qualities in a special way With these change in members the identity of the club as a whole will change too. Oh God her fucking eye is bleeding I Don't think that's necessarily a bad thing Stepping out of your comfort zone once in a while So if you would like to help Monica with the festival, then I'm on your side as well All right, well, maybe we can all talk to Natsuki tomorrow Yuri nods hey Yuri Um I know things are a little bit awkward yesterday But I feel like you deserve to know that I still think you're a wonderful vice president and also a wonderful friend Monica I Want to do everything I can to make this the best club ever okay Me too, yeah Let's all go home for today. We've talked about the festival tomorrow Okay, I look forward to it. Shall we go Jack um Please don't take this the wrong way but I'm going to chat with a little bit with Jack before we leave Just want to see what he thinks of his time here and all that it's important to me as president URI looks a little trouble, but she doesn't protest okay, I Trust your judgment Monica in that case. I'll see the two of you tomorrow. Please don't leave me alone with her See you tomorrow Monica waves as URI exits the room here Things have been a little hectic lately haven't they? Jack I just wanted to make sure you're enjoying your time at this club I'd really hate to see you unhappy I feel like I'm Kind of responsible for that as president And I really do care about you you know They don't like seeing the other girls. Give you a hard time Without me not Sookie. Isn't everything and you were being a little bit you know Sometimes it feels like You and I are the only real people here You know what I mean? But it's weird because in all the time you've been here We've hardly gotten to spend any time together. Uh-huh. I mean. I guess it's technically only been a couple days. Sorry, I didn't mean to say something weird There are just some things I've been hoping to talk to you about. Things I know only you could understand, so that's why- no, stop it Ooooh! Interesting So, now I'm- now I'm starting to think Maybe Sayori is interv- interfering with everything I didn't get any new files, but I wonder if any other stuff has changed Nah, everything still seems to be the same anyway So fucking weird Okay well, I'm gonna leave this episode of Doki Doki here Doki Doki is not okey-dokey holy shit, this got good I mean, I was into it already I would have been into this even if it was just a regular like visual novel dating game I mean, just cuz I like the characters that it was bringing up, but holy crap This has everything I like in it Like kooky characters, weird twists... all of a sudden, the glitchy shit happens and then fourth wall breaks and it puts stuff into your folders That is outstanding I love this so much I'm so excited to play more of this now Now I get it. I get what- I get what people were saying. And I kind of had an inkling. Because the game at the start was like Oh, if you have depression or anxiety or any these things, this might not be a game for you so I was like "ok, it's gonna tackle issues like or issues that Relate to those topics." So then when it started talking about depression and self-harm, I was like ok Kinda felt like it was going there didn't expect it to get that real But I-I thought that that was the thing. All of a sudden, just- Woosh! 0 to 100 real fucking fast. Man. Ok, I get it. I get it I get why everyone was like "don't read anything about this game. Don't spoil it." Don't spoil this Anybody in the comments. Do not spoil it for others. This is an incredibly unique thing. And it's- it's very very- It's very Shocking when you see it for the first time So ruining that for people Which would suck And now- now I'm at ah, it's because now it's like how do I title and thumb nail this series with out giving too much away? But also kind of hinting at it at the same time? I don't know, I'll- I'll figure something out. This is my- this is my specialty. *laughs* Oh man, so good it's my favorite episode of it so far Oh, I'm all a buzz with theorize and suspicion and everything now Man.

This is the game that inspired Bennett Foddy to make getting over it. He even references this game a bunch of times in getting over it so it's called sexy hiking and I think it's supposed to be The same thing I can't even select play oh Boi oh boi Oh, G- Oh, Jesus (Jack regrets his choice) Oh, my mouse goes off the screen.

Hi it's me Super Gamer48 so i made changes to the subtitle 'cause a lot of them are wrong so whoever subtitled this video i hope your ok with that. After everything it's still you 
*WHAPOOSH* Top of the morning to ya laddies my name is jacksepticeye and welcome to what's probably gonna be a very bad idea welcome to fortnight, which I have played Very very little of and any of the parts that I have played I have died very very fast I played five matches and I have gotten two shotgun eliminations. That's about all I've done in this whole game so for herself I'm not very good at it But I want to get good at it because I see a lot of other people playing it and I see a lot of Streamers playing I see a lot of these people who are very very good at it And I want to be one of those I want to get better at the game And I want to I want to learn the mechanics, so there's a lot But I still don't know so if you're very good at this game. My gameplay skills are probably gonna piss you off So if you want to train me and teach me I'm ready coach. Oh my girl. She's so buff and ready to go I'm excited, so I don't really know like the ins and outs of all the mechanics yet because Well even coming from something like pop G. Which everyone compares the games to I wasn't even very good at that, so Trying to learn trying to do the same type of game But having a few more things in it like crafting and building and destroying of buildings all that stuff Over my head every time. I'm getting shot at I forget that I can build stuff, and then I die I've gotten some six shots after what happens if a jump-off the edge. Oh I can't Oh man you won't even let me kill myself. Oh Everybody else has really cool shit That realist looks like Knights Templars have their own pickaxe and everything, I'm I'm Johnny normal bones over here. All right From what I know going into these areas is probably going to be a very bad idea for me maybe So I don't want to go into any of them I Want to go to a place that's on my own first and work my way into the fight Rather than fighting right from the get-go cuz let's face it I'm gonna die and that's not fun imma go over here at the wailing woods. I Don't think anyone's gonna follow me over here cuz this is a bad place to go But at least then I can get my bearings and some weapons and everything, but at least let me loot before you kill me Let me loot before you shoot That's my motto for this game. Ah crap. There's a dead dude. Just landedr there. Oh, man Now I got a runaway. He's gonna kill me Fucking he landed faster than I did, how are you doing that? oh god Am I even going towards buildings? Oh? Shite oh boy shark whatever, okay? At least they have a gun The fucking vest, please I have something to help myself Oh That's what that does! Was wondering what the the circle showing up on things actually did it makes you do more damage and get more items, right? Yeah, I'm learning, friend. Did you die on your own? That'll be real neat oh Okay, at least I'm in Storms not gonna kill me.

I don't have to win Do at any Leon You got this nice I Will say I do like that the game Has movable cover and stuff like you're putting down your own cover like that such a neat mechanic It really just changes the whole battlefield by the end like everyone's in their own little forts Based right to left That's that's the final guy over there, are you gonna be able to do it Leon yeah, yeah? Yeah, I know a lot of you want to watch me play the game, but I'm having a great time watching Leon right now Oh the fights getting closer Sgt Leon gears up heels up and shields up.

Okay? Well I'm gonna leave this episode here. That was fun I can definitely see how Addictive this game can get and because it has a way faster pace And you get in and out of rounds really quickly and I don't know it's very very fun I like it a lot. I think I'm gonna play a lot more of it Just in my spare time so I can get better I didn't do too badly for a guy. That's only played How many rounds ie I don't even know I like 10 rounds I was doing okay? I got top 5 even though most of it was just hiding around and trying to figure out But I'm just hiding a kills man, I did I never really got kills before I got like a couple and that was it but getting kills is fun so if any of you played this game a lot And you have any like tips or tricks for me in the comments I would love to read some of them because I do want to get better I need to get better at my My like barrier management whenever people start shooting at me I just figure oh, I just start shooting back at them And eventually I kill them Instead of thinking like ten steps ahead or I'm like okay build your lil fort and then shoot some kind of thing and some of the items I don't know what they do so I need to I need to get a little bit better on that but fun game for now Thank you guys so much watching this episode if you liked it PUNCH that like button in the face like A BOSS!

THE MIGHT OF SALLY AND JACK TOGETHER WILL DEFEAT ALL ODDS Actually had no idea you could kill a Reaper in this game I'm wildly impressed by myself And on that day it was known, that Jack was the most fearsome predator in the Subnautica oceans No longer did people cower in fear of the Reapers. The Reapers cowered in fear of him Uh, but he also need oxygen to survive, so he needed to get to the surface (Heavy over-the-top intakes of breathe) Oh God I may be a fearsome warrior who's able to tackle the ocean's deadliest creatures and kill them all But oxygen's a bitch, man!

Ha ha ha I thought I'd be here for ages trying to figure out how to kill one of these Turns out all you need is a knife and a lot of battery power in the stasis rifle and you can accomplish anything Accomplish your dreams. Go out there with your PMA and YOUR POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE And you, too, can kill the Reaper I'm a man of my word.

Feels good Feels good to protect my family, my home, and my country Such cute babies I'd never let any harm come to you guys Don't worry Jack has the power of a god now Another thing I found out was -I'm gonna consume you - is that I was suppose to stab these ....I think Can I stab you- yeees and now I can get some seeds out of it and now I can plant those Ah, see when you use your brain you can do dangerous things The brain is the most powerful entity in the known universe Use it wisely. Use smartly So now I should have a lot of food I also did that with my gel-sacks outside. If I stab them I also get bits and pieces that I can put in That's very very good. That's stuff I like to know. If only I could build a farm on my back If I could build a farm on my back and go with that, that would be peeeerfect. Are you fully repaired- No Sally, you took some damage there but I'm proud of you I'm proud of you. You held your own. Last time you went up against one... You had to fake your own death. We understand that. We get that Y-you even put your upgrades in the fake one Really committed to that part Putting all you depth modules, your torpedoes, your- your everything. You put every thing into that fake You even had me convinced. Everybody at home was convinced. But the real Sally Was hiding All along We were in an impostor. All this time Can't charge you for some reason. Because you're broken and I don't know why (sigh) As I sit and stare out upon ... this troubled planet Wondering how I... Can fix it. How I can overcome all odds and become... The grand protector of this known world. W-What do you think, Sam? I should do shouldn't I We need to go out there and kill all the Reapers We need to go out there. We need to show them what we can do And we're gonna start with the sanddunes Because we have some cuddlefish out there that are still stuck, still trapped, don't know a way forward or a way out I need ta- I need to save them. There are a lot of Reapers out there in the Sand dunes. I can't let them live I can't let them live knowing that people out there are suffering. Fish, Mankind alike I- I'm suffering I'm the only man here. But - a- it's still valid. I'm still suffering. Still me Sally: All Systems Online Oh, you bet your sweet tasty ass they are Let's go Sally. To the Sand dunes I hated the sand anyway It's coarse and it gets everywhere (nice starwars ref) It's time we show Just- (stutter) It's time we show that whole area a lesson Kay, a new found sense of confidence in ourselves Op, sorry My bad Look at this fucking weaving and dodging This peak conditioning.

*WAPSH* Top o' the morning to ya, laddies, my name is Jacksepticeye, and welcome back to Trailmakers! Your boy is still sick. I'm all over the place. I don't know what's going on. I don't even know what day of Tuesday it is. But I played this game a while ago, And it was only after coming out. There wasn't a whole lot to it. It wasn't fully developed or anything. Well, it's still not fully developed as you can see it's still early access. Ooh! The rings of fire Wooooow :D So I wanted to give it another shot. I wanted to see what's in it now. And I think there's also multiplayer in it too, so I might do that eventually with Robin. We kind of talked about it at some point, but for now I'm just gonna get into single-player. Restart my expedition. I'll get in and see what's in the game now. I'm probably gonna have to go through some of the same... sequences as before, 'cause when I played it the last time you had to put together a little car, and then you had to drive along and get more pieces and put together a bigger car and then get up certain areas so maybe some stuff is different. I don't know. I'm excited to see though. Aww, look at my little pod! I made it look like a little Septiceye Sam kind of thing. And I'm blue on the inside, so. The colors are there at least. Aww, look at me go! I'm so tiny. I'm this- I'm this badass little lady right here, who has like hair covered over her eye because she's too good to see with both. Okay, let's go- Look at my little waddle! I'm so cute! (yes you are jack) Okay, there's the end goal. That's where I have to go. Whoa! There's floating rocks up there! Okay, [reading] "The Principles of Building." Show me. I think I kind of remember anyway. Uh, okay. Yeah, this is all stuff we did before. Okay. I get it Ahh! Look at that. I have a little car. All right, let's go! *Brooom Brooooom* Aww. This is lovely. [reading] "If it ain't broke you didn't drive fast enough"! Thumbs up. I like this mentality! (PMA) Yeah, let's mess shit up! Let's break stuff. (in a positive mental attitude xD) The start is down here apparently. Oh man, the sound effects and everything are all better. And the car controls better and the graphics are all better. This is delightful! I've seen some gifs and videos of people making really great structures in this game, and people are making pod racers. In fact, Robin sent me a message of him making a pod racer in this game.

Okay, I didn't go for any of the stuff this time, I'm basically just getting the essentials so I can clear all the areas but, man, This game is fun. I like this a lot. I'm gonna spend some time kind of re-kajiggering this vehicle because it's not aerodynamic at all. I need to start putting some more stuff on it, maybe a- -a spoiler, If I get another power core I can add the two engines back at the front, which will balance it back out cause right now it's very arse heavy, so I need to, I need to move the center of mass closer to the middle but, Excited. anyway, thank you guys so much for watching this episode if you liked it punch that like button in the face LIKE A BOSS and high fives all round Thank you guys and I will see all you dudes in the next video! *Jack`s awesome outro music* Well this music it needs some bongos 
Top of the morning to you ladies, my name is Jacksepticeye and welcome to a game called Slay the Spire It's a game that I found just randomly on Steam As I was going around I went through the top sellers list and this was just sitting there And I'd never heard of it before but it looks cool. It's kind of a hearthstone kind of game, but it's a it's a Side to Side Like fighting kinda game. I don't know you'll see when I actually get into a choose your a choose this well, I guess I can only choose this Are you artorias? You look like Artorias from Dark Souls. The remaining soldier of the ironclads sold his soul to harness demonic energies Burning blood?!? Hell Yeah, I want some burning blood um It's kind of Hearthstone ish, kind of Yu-Gi-Oh ish and I think I just have to go up the the ladder so I'll just start here It's like this you bring up your cards, and you fight the characters like side to side it looks cool it looks neat it's only an early access game though so and Forgive some jank if we see any that defeat enemies by playing cards from your hand Currents require energy to play once you're out end your turn, luckily for me I'm never out of energy so. at the start of your turn new cards are drawn and your energy is replenished, makes sense play defensive cards to gain block when enemies aw I'm so gonna- I am so gonna trigger my trap cards on you. Alright who do we want to attack? This is cool. I like this This is basically the only reason I got it because I kind of liked Hearthstone-y kind of games But I'm not good enough at Hearthstone to be able to play it and this is like a neat twist on that kinda stuff so deal six damage deal six damage gain five block Deal eight damage and apply two vulnerable Let's do this Haha, okay, and I have what okay, so this is my energy up here Why can't I attack you? oh there we go Pa Poosh! Cool oh okay, maybe I should have blocked Who cares I'm strong? I'm a strong boy. I could defeat you, okay i'm frail now apparently Okay, I need to kill something I'll do that and then I'll oh I can strike again killing you and then I can defend I got you this time! Wait why do you have two health left? Didn't I kill you? Dammit I got plus one frail, what am i an old person? No more cards? If there are no cards to draw your discard pile is shuffled into the draw pile. Oh man you don't get money cards do you Okay, I should be able to just do this to you, right Dead, and this is not gonna kill you. Oh, i can do twelve with two of these Nice I wish I had more impactful sounds like Make it seem wound unplayable how dare you kill that guy kill him kill dead Not too bad good going Jonk. That's my that's my name At a card to your deck woo a clash can only be played if every card in your hand is an attack deal 14 damage Wow gain eight block draw one card Gained seven block exhaust a random card in your hand Why would I? I gain 7 block, but I exhaust a card so it gets removed from my hand until the end of combat, i wouldn't shrug it off I'd just get 8 block can I go back down here and start? So I'm assuming that slay the spire Refers to me climbing the ranks until I get to the very top Ok so these are all just random enemies. Okay, got it got it I'm good at this wait'll you see! Oh no they used to curl up See gained eight block and draw one card that's amazing um Okay boom Now you're vulnerable take that and I'm gonna put some block. Oh on me come at me dudes what you got Ahh Okay  they got moves so on my health keeps going for the whole thing so that's good to pay attention to Kill him Oooh I can almost kill you Dammit why didn't that do 12?  I keep forgetting to pay attention shit Okay if I can do this and then just attack okay cool, So you get six health back at the end of each one whenever you lose HP from a card gain one strength oh Wait I have others Deal four damage place a copy of this card into your discard pile deal three damage to a random enemy three times That sounds good. I like that ooh ooh merchant merchant unknown or an enemy. I want to go If I defeat you can I just come back and do this one I kinda want to visit a merchant I want to see if I can buy stuff. Oh god. You've no face Welcome Oh that's cool his hand comes down. Deals ten damage to all enemies, gain one artifact. Can I get some health back? Oh? It's the only reason I came here. heal four HP exhaust remove until the end of combat okay? Alright. I can't even remember how much that cost me is this my money?

Gain five block upgrade a card in your hand for the rest of combat This turn your next attack is played twice, ooh double tap So this is gain five block, but I can upgrade a card So I can technically do like one of my cards went from what seven six damage seven damage to ten But this one means that I can play the ten one twice ooh a chest You can now gain strength at rest sites three times max strength adds additional damage nice So let's go to a rest stop Start ba- oh shit, now I have to choose. I think I'm gonna go for the health Doo-doo-doo-doo Such a simple little game As you make your way aww food, as you make your way down a long corridor you see a banana a donut and a box Floating about no upon closer inspection. They are tied to strings coming from the holes in the ceiling There is a quiet cackling from above as you approach the objects. What do you do? It's just telling me exactly what they do Donut, you eat the donut it really hits the spot your max HP increases Nice, I'm so close, and it's only enemy mystery merchant fire and end I'm gonna do it oh. Hi you a mage or something Sever soul; exhaust all non attack cards. Okay, there's only one defend in here That's a lot of fucking damage though Straightaway, that's more than half as health gone right in the first attack. No. He's able to do is to damage Oh I've only got the thing There we go, so we'll defend and I will strike oh, I could have killed them What are you doin? Dont be raking me. Ooh if I can finish the- Oh yes. Boom baby, I was just about say if I can finish this without getting hit again I'll be able to have full health deal two damage four times, but it's exhausted skill cost zero Whenever you skill and play a skill exhaust it With that that uses three gain two strength at the end of your turn lose two strength, okay, I'm just gonna go for this one Alright, what's the mystery? What's the mystery do I have to have a bad thing now? Okay a strange blue humanoid with a golden helm approaches you with a huge smile. Hello friend I am cleric. Are you interested in my services? The creature shouts loudly healed thirty five gold purified. 50 gold remove a card from your deck Why would I remove a card from my deck. I'm just gonna leave. You don't trust this cleric so you leave Weird. Merchant boy! what's going on? Gain five block, enemy looses two strength Deal damage equal to your current block. Oh that might be good, gain one vulnerable deal nine damage. I can get another heal Can't even afford this one Can't afford any of these I'm gonna get another heal I think Okay cool, and then we rest Which means I can start battle with +1 strength, or I can upgrade a card? I'm upgrade a card in my deck Yeah, heal me six times Awesome now. It's time to slay the spire. Two hundred and forty health! That's a bit over the top for the start, don't you think? Okay, I can't block so I'm just gonna do as much damage as I can why do you want to do? Or you're charging up. Oh Christ destroy destroy destroy Thirty-two damage oh balls Okay, we can mitigate this at least a small bit I forgot that when I end my turn all my cards go in so i don't keep the heals Shit, I can do 16 damaging and gain two vulnerable Or cause two vulnerable What did you do? get back out here okay I need a health card badly Yes, and it's the good one and they cost zero now no matter what so uh, deal two damage four times Eight This Why did it hit me? Oh, it's reflecting it shit Okay, I'm getting all my cards back now though. I got this I can beat you you stupid spire, okay he's about to do 16 next time Uhhhh Shit Can I just deal 10 or deal 16? Can I deal this 16 even without doing that? Oh I can Okay, okay easy does it don't beat don't ouch I'ma defend. I'm a double tap and then I can do 12 damage Oh he's about to destroy me Oh mercy Okay heal me Defend me And attack for me Okay, not going the best whenever you play an attack take three damage. Okay, so I need to defend up there There we go there we go now, I'm thinking instead of be stupid like last time They got in that last first three turns Balls he's gonna do a lot of damage to me. Okay block DoubleTap Not enough energy oh fuck Okay, he's down to a hundred, but I am about to take 16 Wow Okay after taking 50 damage changes into a defensive mode so he oh god He's gonna kill me on the next attack if I'm not careful. I have no stuff Give me the two heal cards They have to be here together What Goddamnit man Um Block first then cleave and then just regular attack Uh It's charging up there. He's gonna block. I'm so close You're not gonna give me any of my heals back That blows dude, I'm dead No! Man That sucks Floors climbed sixteen enemy slain six exordium elites killed one bosses slain zero Oh Got a new character. Oh you're badass looking That was like such a huge spike in difficulty Jesus Christ, that's fun though I like that game It's really interesting with a couple of tweaks I think if the attacks look a bit more fantastic, and if they just focus in on their sound effects Making it sound like you're actually like smacking the shit out of them exploding parts and all that kind of stuff It would be really really good These types of games are just so addictive the way they are Relic collection Hey, can I see my characters? What do you do a deadly hunters from the fog lands eradicates foes with daggers and poisons at the at the start of each combat draws two additional cards oh But healing at the end of each one is really really good Anyway, I'm gonna leave this episode here. That was really really fun I like that game a lot and only for an early access thing I like the idea that they are going for it is kind of just like hearthstone in a way, or a Yu-Gi-Oh Type of game, but I just like the way they've done it the way It's it's what's that other game? theres a game on the PlayStation That's kind of like this as well like the the turn-based kind of thing There's a lot of elements from games that I really like but for now Thank you guys so much for watching this game episode video if you liked it Punch that like button in the face LIKE A BOSS! And high-fives all around I almost slayed the spire, but I got destroyed
