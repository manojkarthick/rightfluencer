I'm a big fan of the foam boxes that I have in my  @hourglassworkout studio... Let's just say that I didn't land every single jumpüòÅ... But have no bruises thanks to themüòÇüòÇ Box jumps are great to work on power and speed. They are also great for fat burning and 'toning'  as they sure get the heart rate up!! üî•üî• Personally  I like to include them on plyo days  drill workout days  lights leg days where I'm working more on activation and ab/core days... A set might either be timed ie 1 min of box jumps 3 times through as a super set... Or maybe in a drill 5 sets of 5 exercises 10 reps each incl box jumps... These are fun ways to work them into a program üòòüòò Happy trainingüôå  #twl #hourglassworkout #teamhourglass #trainwithlyzabeth.

hey guys I'm lights of a Clopas register - listing nutritionist and master trainer have you ever worked out and you're going hard and you're wondering why is my bum getting smaller big question here it all the time I'm going to give you my top ten tips for this to not happen anymore and actually build your booty properly here we go first thing is that you might be doing too much cardio by doing too much cardio what could happen is you could actually be burning away at some of your muscle I know that sucks right you're putting in all this work and you're actually doing the opposite by losing some of your butt muscle on top of losing some of your butt fat which will give you a smaller but point number two is that you may not be activating your glutes and I've actually done a video right here on YouTube that you can check out put the video link in the description box below so you can learn how to activate your glute but you may not be activating your glute prior to doing your workout and in that case a lot of people will end up getting inc becoming quad heavy what does that mean it means the Front's of your thighs become very big and your bum not so much okay so the answer to that is activating glutes prior to your workout you can do it with nothing you can do it with booty bands you can do with ankle weights but you should do it okay the next one is that your hips might be too tight if you sit most of the day okay you you watch TV you driving your car long distances you're at work at an office your hips might become tight or some people just have tight hips even if they're not sitting all day but if your hips are tight what happens is it can inhibit your glute activation okay so what you need to do is you need to actually loosen them out before you do your workout how do you do that there's two ways that I like to do one is you can use some type of trigger point like a small it looks like a little lacrosse ball and they have like trigger point balls or you could do foam rolling but you want to release your hip flexors okay and then you can also do hip mobility movements point number four you need to look at the whole picture here's what I mean sometimes you might just be so specifically staring at your bum right so every time you go to the mirror you're not seeing your new sexy sculpted shoulders and your abs coming and the only thing you're seeing is I think my bum might have got smaller or it's it looks the same or everything's changing but my bum so to make sure that you're actually looking at the whole picture and you're not becoming like funnel vision just on your bum bum is you should take a picture take a before picture right when you start working out so that you can then look back at it maybe a month or two later and see like oh wait my bum actually is it it's a little perkier than it was before and holy crap look at my abs look at my arms look at my legs like all this stuff has come along but you need that picture otherwise you're seeing yourself every day and you're not going to see the changes okay so looking at the whole picture point number five is that you might be focusing on toning exercise for your bum when you should be focusing on building exercise what's the difference if you're doing things like bodyweight squats or your unfortunately doing something like the squat challenge which I don't like it all sure you're going to tone your bum you're going to tone your legs which just means that you might be getting slimmer and things might feel kind of tight but you're not actually changing the shape we need to have progressive overload we need to add weight to actually see a size change in our gluts okay so you need to be doing things like heavy weighted deadlifts or heavy lated squats and really put some muscle into that bum bum if you want to see it grow okay so that's toning versus building number six is that you might be training your abs like a bodybuilder what you want to do is you want to actually be doing things that are going to simchah waste now what does that have to do with your bum the whole body is kind of based on illusions sometimes so if your waist is a little wider it might make your hips look a little bit more narrow whereas if your waist is a little more narrow it may look mate look like you have some hips and some bootay I'll kind of go in like this but if you're training more like a bodybuilder and you're doing things like really intense cleans and you know really heavy crunches and stuff like that versus doing more Pilate style of cinching cinching breathing then you might actually block out your waist so I'm not saying don't train your obliques you should train your obliques but I just want you to think the obliques they kind of come all the way across and if you're going heavy and you're going right into kind of a lateral area of the obliques to the side of the waist with heavy weights you end up blocking yourself out additionally if you're doing too much of the powerlifting style exercises where it's very core intense you might again be blocking out your waist and taking away from the look and the illusion of the curvy hips and bump up so number seven I feel like a lot of you ladies are really gonna like this one are you ready you might not be eating enough where food and bigger booty but I don't mean in the form of fat if that you know anyway you may not be eating enough and what that means is if you're doing those heavy lifts and you're working hard in the gym you're doing those squats and you're doing all those heavy lifts but you don't have enough calories to actually maintain this new mask that you're building you don't get to keep it it's pretty much that simple so you have to make sure if your goal is muscle gain that you are having those appropriate amount of calories okay so keep that in mind not enough calories goes away okay so number eight is actually kind of like it fits right perfectly after the food one because we're still talking about food and that's that you might not be having enough protein okay so having enough protein here's how I like to gauge it personally everyone's going to be a little bit different I feel that most people should be somewhere between the point six to a one gram of protein per pound okay so for me because I'm a little bit more active I'll try to stay somewhere in the point eight to one gram of protein per pound so how do you calculate that if I was 130 which I'm not right now a little heavier than that but very simple math would be somewhere around the 104 to 130 grams of protein per day would be my protein goal to be able to maintain all of this muscle happening up in here so number nine is that you may not be giving it enough time and I know that that's so boring and we all want it like immediately but building muscle actually does take time so you need to kind of say to yourself this is my goal I'm gonna put in this much work I'm going to take that before picture and I'm gonna have little mini goals kind of like with any goal you want to have the mini goal and then the big goal so personally I've been doing glute training since I was 12 like seriously and I've glute kickbacks and all that kind of good stuff so so give it the time and you're slowly but surely going to see that bumbum form so give yourself some time so that you can actually realistically get to your goal okay are you ready for number ten this is the drumroll finish and this is probably one of the most important ones is again it's on being realistic we all have different genetics guys so the main thing is you need to look at your own derriere and say I want to have my best bum bum alright like your best booty your best whatever you can't look and say wow look at her I want to look like that and then you're sad that no matter how hard you train you might end up looking better different whatever like we're all just different so you have to kind of assess what's going on be realistic with it follow all of the things that we just talked about okay be consistent with it and you will build a great flat okay so at the time we do genetics and you'll have an amazing bum good luck to you have fun with your training happy booty training to you if you enjoyed this video I hope you learned something please comment below you can send me more questions I'd love to do more

best friend if you're not using it I'm going to show you how and then you will start using it because it's awesome and you know why because it builds out some of the sides of your bumbum 
[Music] hey guys I'm Isaac Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and today I'm here with miss katlyn in a workout and then Josh works out yes she was really hurt and she's excellent at pull-ups which is our topic of the day today we're actually going to show you proper form for pull-ups with Caitlyn and then as well we're going to walk you through progressions so that you can get your first pull-up to think first of all why would you want to do pull-ups because they're badass number one like just a girl doing a pull-up you're just like yeah yeah that's so cool it doesn't it looks great but also it's an incredibly functional movement it's amazing for strength and it also gives you this I'm just going to turn you around for seconds with just give you the really nice we kind of you know backwards just like a little wider up here which this is the hourglass workout so when this looks wider then this looks smaller and then you're kind of like working towards the illusions of the hourglass okay turn back around are you ready here comes the first of all let's say after pain so from here yeah to here it's just like this sure yeah it's just yeah just like depressing the scapula so scapula's come down and then retract dinner back good now keep your elbows straight okay now come back up yes okay now to pray yeah now this off the first step boom exactly to pull up to actually use you with back muscles probably and everything else a straight and curly yes you feel it yeah I'm gonna stand on the bar okay so first thing we want to do is top hand position if you're on a straight bar which we're not we have all these different options of hand positions but the pull-up one is this one here okay that's kind of like the typical overhand pull up you want your hands to be just a little wider than shoulder-width so if these are my shoulders I want it just a little wider so pop/imap Kaitlyn feet yet those other ones there you want me to pop you up you're good and we're just going to do the first thing which is the act of pain so from regulating to boom there we go that's the first part and then after this then we want to actually go up into our pull-up so first they're truck down and then pull up your shoulders down the back and then pop back down okay so to get from not being able pull up to be able to do this we're gonna take you through a few different steps the first one that we are going to show you is going to be a lapful down so this is something that you can do just to add strength we don't have a lat pulldown machine here so I'm just going to show you what a lat pulldown is for those of you that don't know and this is more of a if you have a gym okay you a gym membership so she's just gonna pop on the florida to show the movement of a typical lat pulldown and this is gonna be showing the same muscles that you generally use for a pull-up so it's a good one to do and the same thing you want to first put our shoulder blades down the back good and then we want to do elbows towards the back pocket good slight curve in the spine and then drive it back up good folding so this is a good exercise to do and you can do people on get that just for a few more good exercise to do probably do like 10 to 15 reps with in your back day which depending on how often you workout could be one to two times a week feed and pop back up so lat pulldown in a really good first step to work on in order to get to your pull-up another one that I like actually to warm up with that I'll show you before you start with pull-ups is this one here and I think not even just propose but just for having a healthy back but this one is great and what she's just pulling so I'm gonna do it hand and let me just turn you back so what I'm gonna do is right here I'm just putting my hand and bed right there so I want her to actually squeeze my hand between her shoulder blades the best we can and right down and this is a really good one to do this is just a fara band you can get these like anywhere and these are amazing for all I cup rehab or people in the nation call it pre hype rehabilitation work so that you don't get injured and also so you're strengthening the small muscles so you're able to do the big exercises so this one again really before any upper body day this is a good one to do maybe just like one set 10 to 15 reps is fine okay so then that's when we're gonna show this is a Libra Lizer now if you don't have this you can also use like a TRX you can use rings you can set up a low smith machine bar and do it from the smith machine but we have this one and it is great if you do want to get it so what you want to do is you can start with the overhand grip okay her feet are just about shoulder-width apart and she's got the bar just right down the middle of her chest she's first thing she's gonna do is flex her glutes so bump squeeze all the way up before she starts to pull an - she's got a nice solid a body now is gonna come up for her road trying to get her chest right yes good now she can do different elbows positions if she wants to the absolute elbows can go wide as long as her chest as up and her shoulders are coming back the one thing that I really like to do with this is obviously you want to do like here your said we're kind of like 10 to 12 reps but what's really fun she's which she knows what's coming yes you can come all the way up at the end of her last her last set and a little bit as high as humanly possible this is a great thing to do at the end cuz it really builds strength okay and then once she's completely destroyed failed as we called it which I can see a shake your hands together longer we slowly however come down like literally as slow as humanly possible this is called a negative and when you're doing the negative or the weight down and you do it slow like this really build strength which is gonna help you with so the next one we're gonna do is we're actually gonna do negatives okay Kaitlyn already known huh this little box now negatives this is how I learned to do them back in June I live in gymnastics days so in gymnastics we had to jump up and control down which is the negative it's a really long time ago but so what she's gonna do if she's gonna use full momentum and she's gonna jump up okay so it's just her it's just her body and momentum getting her up but now she's gonna control her way down as slow as possible see if she's shaking we know she know how to do cool but that the flow is hard it kind of sucks like a lot that's just who's gonna jump up she's gonna drive her chest up and and then she's gonna come in slowly with a nice natural curve and the spine good stuff right okay so that's all the negative I like to do them either in the pull-up I also like to play with with different grips if you're new we're to doing pull-ups you can also switch your grip underhand do a chin-up switch a little bit more bicep it's a little bit easier though so it'll also get your confidence up to get the pull-up yes yes you want to that's where I started that's right here yeah here yeah yeah and a lot of girls will start either underhand or this skirt and then once they get it then they'll move to the pull-up grip mm-hm yes you agree yes so this is a strength band I chose purple for Katelyn we have all of these mass colors here now there are a million colors just to be pretty there's a million colors because they're all different intensities so if I have clients here at our glasses that are heavier so maybe they're closer to the over 200 pound mark but they're working on their pull-ups they get to have a little bit more resistance to hold them up so I might start them with an orange band or a blue band depending on their weight and strength if I have someone that's a little bit lighter but they're not very strong yet then I would choose between a blue band and a green man and the colors are relatively Universal but your main thing you're looking to see how the how wide it is okay see how they all have different widths that will also tell you how strong they are so I would do that so with Caitlin because she's pretty slender and quite strong my options were kind of between the green and the purple so I'm gonna go with purple for her because she strong matches my works better in the difference and then as I get really strong I'll drop them down to a black man right before they're ready because right when I know they can do it on their own I'll give them the black band for that like pseudo spotting it's really doing almost nothing that makes them feel like it and then when you taken away you know how to do it so let's show how this is done can you just wrap this over these two fantastic okay so wrapped over two it's wider which means it's gonna be even easier for her to do if I wanted it to be harder I would just wrap it over one if we put it under her foot it is easier and pushed straight down until your feet are together good and now what she's gonna do is do a pull up and now it's like she's got a spotter so even if you're home alone it's like you've got this spotter now that is helping you through your pull-up and you're still in a pretty natural motion one more time so fruit truck down good and then we come up okay now the next step before she switched bands would be she would take this same purple band and instead of having it under her foot now we're gonna move it under her knee and stab which is gonna be definitely more challenging because it's less it's less assistance we go Childers down in back anything and this is gonna be a little closer to doing it by herself yes yes yes it's harder it's harder to make sure you get those supertastic oh I know okay so the next step after she was able to master this purple under than me and I'd know if she'd mastered this purple under the knee because she could do ten reps to completion and that would mean that I would take her to the black band okay you never want to get like to just reliant on a certain band like I always do my pull-ups with a purple band it's like no one's you can do ten you don't get to use it any more then you go to this once you can do ten then you go to nothing yes yes yes okay so we've gone through all of the different steps we've done the negatives personally with girls that um have access to a bar even if you're doing this at home the two I like to do the most are the negative so the jump up control down and the banded pull-ups because they're the closest to the real thing kaitland you want to tell them how you learned your pull-ups so I learned them mostly I actually purchased one of the at-home ones that go into your doorframe yeah so I purchased that and I used to put a chair underneath to me and I would just practice every morning I made it like part of my brush my teeth routine also involve doing pull-ups I was just I'm a pretty competitive person and someone said that there's actually a article posted why women can't do pull-ups so I made it my goal okay so now that we've shown you the steps now Kaitlyn is gonna show you some real badassery and you see this chain I don't remember what it weighs but by just knowing what dumbbells and stuff feel like I'm gonna guess this is like 20 pounds okay I feel like it's like 20 pounds it could even be 30 pounds but this is like it's not it is not a play weight it is no weight so we're gonna put this on Kaitlyn just because just watch the ponytail Babu watched videos did you guys catch the ponytail haha she made it pretty cuz she knew you're getting filming her bathroom okay and she's gonna do it follow Freddie we are ready okay might take a couple of takes how long did it take you one more thing how long did it take you to get there it does take a while so it's one of those things like you just have to keep trying don't give up and eventually I'll get there I'm gonna say probably about four months till I could actually do like the narrow ones and then I progressed wider and wider so it doesn't happen overnight yes folks aren't impossible for girls they're just harder for girls we hope you enjoyed that video we hope you try it if you do or if you have some tips that helped you get your pull-ups I would love it to see it in the comments below and we put out workout and nutrition fun fitness video everything videos every single week so make sure to subscribe and like the video because it helps the channel share it out to the world please show them Kaitlyn some love in the comments below and we will see you next week thanks guys thanks [Music] 
hey guys I'm Liza Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and today I'm here with a CLIA and sharing these to you guys if you guys have watched videos you know I love to make some of my hourglass girls victims or volunteers to show you guys how to do things so these are two awesome girls from the program and they're gonna show you how to warm up for your leg day to make sure you're getting the maximum out of all of your booty building you know efforts there we go this is video number five today the reason that you're gonna want to actually take some time to do a proper warm-up is if things are not released properly or activated properly you're really not gonna get the most out of your workout so taking like four to five minutes before you actually start your leg day could mean like everything to actually seeing some booty building gains like games so we're gonna start off with is we're gonna show you how to release your hips and I actually love doing this with a hard medicine ball so each of the ladies so clean Charlene they both have a hard medicine ball some of the balls are made of sand or they're just soft you want to make sure it's actually very hard like if you were to balance it it would be on this back and they're gonna put this right into their hips like right there okay and then they're going to get into position it's actually generally quite painful if it's not painful and you are the person in the world that does not have tight hips thank good for you but most people when they do this their face looks something like this show us Charlene pretty much um reasons that you'll want to do this just to make sure you're understanding the full and need of this warm-up pre like day is especially if you sit for a good amount of the day the hips to contend to get tight if the hips are tight it tends to inhibit the glutes which means that it is hard to use them or activate them when you're actually trying to do your leg base your squats with Douglas your kickbacks if your hips are too tight you're gonna have trouble especially things where your back leg is elevated like a Romanian one of my little Bulgarian split squat or about to gamma B to deadlift or step ups any of these things you're gonna be like why is this feel tight even that's just cause it is tight so this is a good one to release before how does that feel guys good they have a funny sense of good usually painful their response I get but I'll take good a hundred percent so they're done with that one the next thing is and this is something that I'm always working back and forth with my chiropractor because there's different different people and different modalities so as me as a trainer and my chiropractor as a chiropractor I definitely respect your opinion as far as as prep and we kind of chitchat together and she talked to me a while ago about not doing full foam rolls pre workout and I looked into this a bit and I actually really liked what she was saying about this so what we now do is we do scandals rather than full firm rolls before so these ladies are gonna show you what a scan role might look like a clear is holding a grid foam roller and you can see it has the different bumps and long bumps and where Charlene has the beginner one right now not that she's being in her she's just showing it she this I didn't she's not this is cut they call this the Eva where I got it but it's basically just a relatively flat like slightly softer foam roller and then they both have be very mean rumble roller and when I say mean the first time I went on it I actually thought it was like a joke toy I didn't realize it was actually for really like you're supposed to I was in so much pain I almost died but anyways they're gonna show you what skin rule looks like which is basically what it sounds like you're just doing a little roll scanning for knots you're not trying to roll out your whole leg and go back and forth for quite a while in different areas because what can happen is it can get all the tightness out and just kind of release it to the point that when you're trying to actually work out you're you find it harder to activate and flex well in your workout so basically we do not want to do that we just want to kind of find those knots that are inhibiting us getting a good workout and getting a good pump and see how they're just I think they be you guys have both found a knot it looks like yes they have found or not and they're just kind of sitting on it and when you find a knot you can kind of sit on it or you can just do little teeny tiny kind of back-and-forth to try to get rid of that knot but again we're not releasing everything we're not just can you show them what what not to do pre-workout or not necessarily what not to do because it's science science it's always changing but what preferably what I've learned right now is not to do is they're just just roll back and forth up and down your legs obviously we wouldn't go over joints we're not gonna go over the knee or anything like that but I would prefer you guys not go back and forth quads and hamstrings and I teas and everything you're just gonna find those knots so they're there they're really finding knocks on their pods right now because they haven't left their watch they found their knots they've done the good skin but generally you can look for knots on your quad from your hamstring your inner thigh or your abductor so the rumble roller is cut they didn't really need to go on it but I just thought you should see how challenging it actually is are you done so I would say if you want to do a full roll good luck go go Charlene go get your weight in there girl I know hey if you really want to go for it I would say post-workout if you want to roll out your whole leg and everything like that and just really release it but all means post-workout is a great time to do held stretches and full rollouts and all that kind of stuff otherwise pre-workout I like to just kind of look for those knots and then move through the movement so once you're done with your releasing your hips and releasing small parts of your legs we're gonna move on to the dynamic movement okay so in an emic movement is what it sounds like you are moving dynamically so let's show some example so right now they're gonna do hip swings which I love go ahead so hip swings you want to just kind of start light and then you're gonna get a little more I don't know if the right word is aggressive but that's what I say in class gonna need a little bit more aggressive in with the swings at you start to get warmer and you're just trying to get that stretch through the hip as you come back and then through the hands and the glutes as you come forward so both directions are part of the stretches kilohm or it's deeper get in there can-can girls up how high can we go so I would do like five or ten of these per side and we call this sagittal okay or forward in the central plane and then we're also gonna do lateral so hold onto the wall with both hands just for a nice grip and now we're gonna be lateral or to the sides and again same thing they're gonna start off a little bit light and then they're gonna get deeper good and you don't want to control the movement you really want to swing like literally swing that leg how high can get it now that they're getting a little bit warm and they swing a little bit higher and then mainly we're focusing on the up and out to the side or the abduction and then they're gonna do the same thing about five to ten per side love that one so much it is always part of the drill so now they're gonna go to side to side lunges which is good for kind of opening up the hips so it yet or an remember it we're going on the side to side good now we want to make sure that our knee tracks our second toe good so we're just kind of going side to side we're always continuously moving I'm not a huge fan of health stretches pre-workout I like moving stretches or dynamic stretches pre-workout when we save the held static stretches spin end now we're gonna put our hands on the floor and when you get deeper now and deeper and as an expert dancer gymnast we get right into like believe right towards floor and heel coming up yeah you know we're getting right into yeah really blow it feet a little closer together because want to make sure that knee stays safe kind of tracking as much as can can we yellow from your hands on the floor and go really low and then feel that stretch than a nice no okay we're gonna move on to an really relaxed stretch this is called a window this is from Pilates so they're gonna lie on their back and this is for the thoracic spine it's really nice it feels really good hands each side and you can do this even if your back go ahead I'm so hands spread out like so yep knees up and they're just gonna kind of just thread side to side yeah sorry kettlebell in your way of course it's a like a 90 pound kettlebell there you go perfect and they're just gonna do that again you can do it like five to eight times and you can just control it through the ABS and feel this doesn't feel nice on your spine it's feel good and if you need to like in between deadlifts if you want you can kind of jump into this and this is the windmill very good we're gonna move into the moving calf stretch so we're eating that one of them up with hands on the floor and one of you guys can you hands on the wall just to show the difference and what we're trying to do is we're just trying to get one just a little bit of a moving make sure we're always moving so just kind of up and down so heel comes up heel comes down good [Laughter] we're coming up and down and up and down so it's kind of its kind of chill and we're just mainly we want to get the cast stretched out a bit but we also want the ankle mobility so they're trying to also lightly and progressively drive their heel towards the floor because when you're doing things like squats and that type of thing if your ankles aren't mobile you're gonna have a little bit more of a hard time getting into those squats there's also work that you can do with bands but I'm trying to do less equipment if possible that you guys may not have and wild blood will have foam rollers and booty bands these days and not a lot of people have strength bands but if you do have strength bands look up ankle mobility plus strength band and you'll find some really good ones or maybe we'll show it one of these days but that's a good one there okay so we're gonna move on to activation now so activation they're gonna throw on their booty band which they are very well-versed in you guys know all about the booty bands okay and they're gonna start off so now we're actually going to activate the bum which we have a whole video on maybe we'll place it here somewhere a very popular video on our channel which gives you a full activation routine but we're just gonna do a short one so they're just gonna do side to side walking good so nice and low good and their knee is tracking their second toe let's even have a little bit fun these are two different ways I like to do it since they were clearly confused it's just a moment so let's get Charlene to come back over here show me it's just gonna go side to side right left right left so you're just gonna go and right and left well the quia is gonna go left left left left left left left left left you're gonna go a little circle and she's gonna stay on the same leg and then the camera person is gonna say we're stayin frame but I sent her out of frame yeah is she gonna keep going on that same leg and you could do we're gonna get clear to do like maybe ten reps all in a row on one leg and then ten reps all in a row on the other leg whereas Charlene maybe she's in a tight space like in her room and can only go side to side with a quiz maybe at the gym right now and she could do ten in a row I prefer this one where you're doing multiples in a row because I feel like it just it just burns that side a little bit more right a little bit more challenging notice that both of them had the good form of staying and squat the entire time with their chest up and their court in I should have gone and given you those sucker punches think about it and their bums were back and their knee was tracking their second toe can we just showed knee tracking second toe and just get a little close-up on that so when they're doing that this is the most important part of it that their knee is wide and it's trying to track right here because what happens with the booty bands is people do can you do the walk all this your knees and like this for me and and do it yeah this is what I see all the time and you know what that says I don't want to wear my book I don't want to do it they pushing your knees open is what works your bum so if you want to work your bum in with your booty bands then you should open your knees because that's the whole point of the exercise there you go okay so next we're going into it clam shells and if you've been on this channel you'll see clam shells on various videos because it is that important for activating bum bum here we go point the toes good dick literally did your top foot into your bottom foot toe and heel with we do booty blast in class a lot which is why Charlene is trying to just lift everything she's like I just want a booty blast that's what I'm used to okay so she wants ever hips stacked which keep going which means one hip is on top of the other versus ready leaning back leaning back and doing this means you're kind of working like it here and you're not working here let's just set there's this very little booty engagement when you lean back which is what you want to do so instead he wouldn't be going up here I love hate aggressive with them but I don't know what my problem should see me in class one it front up let's go find it bunch off the other toe and push push aggressively your foot into you're out of 50 now I feel it like with my hand right here on her bum I can feel the shiver of the glute muscle and she's gonna drive her knee open flex her bum with all her might good and Acquia same thing yes okay and that is our clamshell so again you could do like one set just ten per side you're just trying to wake it up just say wake up glutes we're about to do a leg day let's get prepared right do you actually say that okay so finally getting towards the end of our warm-up it's it's a few steps but each thing has its place we're now gonna go into more of the ballistic okay so now we're gonna go through the motions of the workout or kind of like a warm-up set so I like to do first just let's say let's pretend on a leg day we're gonna do deadlifts for instance because loud this licensed deadlifts are a big part of like a so I like to do this little warm-up prior to to deadlifts and it's just kind of like it's kind of it's not the motion of a deadlift but it kind of makes my hamstrings feel like I'm about to do deadlifts yeah so keep going to do this because it's kind of one of these you know you're just like and I don't know and I know that because I watch girls in class in their leg they're all over that's okay I'm about to do with you so what you want to do is keep your do this with me home ready stand up we're gonna put our left foot and make it stationary this is not gonna come off the ground I'm gonna dig my right foot forward and now I'm gonna tap it back and the heel comes up this one's so stationary I feel like we need like pokey booth I don't know why I just made this video really childish but it's not it's actually the important video now that I'm starting oh yeah now that I'm getting the motion now I want to make sure that my hands are always on my best leg why because if I push on this leg and it's straight that's a little bit of pressure behind my knee not ideal it's not what we want so here and here now while I'm doing this I'm driving my glutes up if you feel that yeah you drive the glutes up for the stretch drive booth up booty to the sky now we are feeling our hamster yes they hamstring stretch so good final part warm up set so these are the weights the big ones that they're actually gonna do for their kettlebell deadlift but I got them to get two mini kettlebells for them which are eight kilograms each so 18 pounds each silica almost forty pound deadlift which is definitely a warm-up for these two ladies because they are strong and go ahead so cut about a left boom-boom and I want them on the floor so I want them pick up and put them down yes pick them up and put them down and a little bit more down up yeah there we go so they're just kind of going through the motion you can keep your hands on them so they would do like 10 reps of this and now they're just kind of getting even further warm and ready for their deadlifts the weights that I gave them because they're strong so this is like 70 pounds each so this is about 140 150 pound it sorts all kilograms and I'm really bad at the times to point to Billa anyways it's about 140 150 over here for her dead lift and yeah so that's 50 it's about [Music] you are mathematician over there Oh oh that's right by the way surname is an actuary but she explained it she does like all those equations on the board like in what special calls so okay so they're gonna now grab those they finished their warm-up set and now they're on to their actual deadlifts and the workout can begin and we'll just let them do a couple reps this is not actually part of the warm-up of course but just for fun just clearly for fun they're just like doing it damn you Liza it's okay I like putting them on the spot it's very fun sterling is just like why are you doing this to me would you like to trade yeah so you know what happens at hourglass is is we we used to have we have these kettlebells over there that are 16 kilograms each those were our heaviest kettlebells and they're like Liza get heavier kettlebells so I got these ones and then they said lies that get heavier kettlebells so I got those ones and then I got 88 pounds each and then I got 100 pounds each which you can see are the black ones in the corner over there if they happen to be in set but they love it can't you tell they love the really heavy kettlebell this is her favorite but then turn to the side look at the bombs though all I say is worth it worth it okay so quick go ahead so qui is going with the hundred pound dadlab boom and chest is up shoulders are back and boom yes and do a quarter angle and boom do you see her bomb in her muscles they're just fantastic I'm sorry chest up chest up shoulders back feet slightly straddling the kettlebells yes down mm just get it yes I'm doing air yes just safe as long as you're safe chest is up you're good I know you're strong professional best about there yeah so this again this is like 160 pounds she's doing fantastic and bam squeeze it yes yes that was they're done they're done that was fantastic I hope you guys enjoyed that that was a typical type of warm-up that we would do for an hourglass obsession which is a bit of release a little bit of activation a little bit of a warm-up and then you go into that leg day and you get all all of the booty games please picture leaking Annika yeah who did that warm up for you they were amazing give them some love in the comments below and we will be putting out videos every single week so I hope you guys subscribe so you don't miss out any of the fun and that's all that's all I have to say thanks I don't know why [Music] 
it is time to do a blood microscopy so blood microscopy is when they take a sample of your blood and put it on a slide and then kind of squish it between two slides and put it under a microscope so what you're going to be looking for is things like mineral deficiencies and immune deficiencies what else we're looking for antioxidant balances parasites yeast Candida so we're going to take a little look at my cells here the goal is that they're a little bit more solid and we're looking for things like parasites and yeast and stuff now some people might say that blood microscopy czar hokey you know like it's a quack or whatever and I don't just believe okay to lista cannibalistic so it must be okay that this is why I do up testing and I have to say you know I did regular blood testing like regular with your doctor blood testing and you know food sensitivity testing plus I I know myself really well and my results from my blood microscopy were right in line with all of the other testing that I've done so um I've done it every three months three times in a row and I saw the progress and I saw the difference in the cells so I'm a believer mm-hmm so now it's time to start the cupping this second use a lot of stuff a lot of times this is how they go on with the flame cuttings actually a very ancient therapy and some people get it for things like pain inflammation blood flow some people think it can help with deeper things like herpes skin disorders arthritis and this is one style of cupping I've actually seen at the gym people will use a pump style that doesn't leave these kinds of marks and they'll use it pre workouts so that company is crazy stuff so they put the cups on and you can see she put the fire in it and it's just kind of like latches onto your body and then whenever it's them it's dark when she takes it off so it looks really kind of gross on my skin wherever it's dark is where you have I guess it's not so like a blockage or something like that so it's very interesting it's my first time ever trying that I am a holistic nutritionist and I do like to support the holistic and the result from my blood microscopy is that I'm very healthy but I think I need to cut down on my sugar a little bit which sucks because I don't have that much in the first place happing day two I think it's getting lighter well you'll think mmm still can't wear sundress so the reason that I do some of these more interesting holistic things is as a practitioner I really feel that it's my duty to try things before before giving any like information or feedback or anything on different hopes to practices like when I was in school a long time ago I remember like in one year I did like I think I did and a parasite cleanse or liver cleanse a gallbladder cleanse and gallbladder cleanses no joke by the way um a candida cleanse and I'm going to even remember what else like yeah I did like compresses with castor oil and all kind of stuff like everything I learned it just wanted to try it um personally I think um in North America we get too caught up with just um you know for sick with drugs and if we're whatever like so everything that I do and everything I bring to the table is it's all about preventative health so it's like how do we just stay healthy and not get sick and just kind of keep each organ at its best so I mean if I'm looking at a cleanse or a detox I'm not looking to lose weight or any of that type of thing I'm looking to to narrow in on a specific either issue or specific Oregon to make it work at its best my whole body works at its best so I really don't believe in the trendy stuff in Fitness you're probably never going to see me support like a detox tea or waist trainer or body wrap or any of that kind of thing okay and that's it because I'm so tired good morning and happy Mother's Day get Bette to start just a quick or that session before they'll see my family and seeing my cup and stone cupping check-in day three I think it's fading so I just finished my sprints and now I'm writing today's workout so it will be a lot more than what's there so today I'm doing I did my sprints and I'm going to throw some upper body cardio and core in because if mother's day who knows if I'll do anything else and I almost forgot she's really they love babies ones just simple black and white I think this will be the full workout but of course in testing it so take the picture if you want look good look reading my awful chicken scratch hey Rick had done it was good I approve this workout headed very long sets and probably very little rest and I think I did like about 200 push-ups so doing doing good I love morning workouts because it's just done and when you put in so much month already you're less likely to eat bunch of crap like some other yeah the Mother's Day because I've already done my other code and put so much and I probably able stop at like one piece cake having some cold-pressed juice mixed with fiber while I wait for my breakfast to cook sitting down for some lunch and I've got some chicken and some zucchini soup I'm working on my digestion right now so I'm not really doing raw veggies right now so salads and stuff like that because I'm I'm just working on digestion so I'm blending my vegetables [Music] just more than one piece of cake after all so I messaged some of my friends asking if they wanted to do a late-night leg day because well you saw the cake maybe but so my friend Sabine who's a runner message back and asked me if I wanted to do a late-night 10k run and something made me say yes so I'm going on a 10k run I'm scared I have my back it's not because I'm trying to be fancy it's because wish me luck here is the Nike running app alright and this is Sabine here [Music] friend complete just got home and feel very good so I'm glad that I did the run and I will try not eat for this is too cheap again good morning I'm about to hit my morning sprints and I'm now subject to having to wear t-shirts everywhere because I have these cupping mark things all over my body so maybe I should have raged researched better but I had no idea that the cupping marks lasted for like a few days to week so I had to cancel a photoshoot for Sunday so for the cupping I'm still glad that I did it it's still good for you and it's pulling stuff out of the muscles and helping with circulation it's just I would have done it in the fall because I do detox is usually twice a year I do a spring and I do a fall and a detox that's going to make me have to wear sweaters on the first week of summer tingle and fall this is what they look like so you can see I'm not exaggerating I look crazy enough chitchat it is time to run hope you get your workout too by the side of my sprint watching Gossip Girl makes the time go by this was the equipment needed for two days worked out very simple keeping that home gym style workout going and my shoes of the day planets so of all the home workouts that I've written so far this one is my favorite I'm not done yet and I almost died it's good can you see the sweat on my back seriously though I almost made myself throw up so I'm heading out to a day party which is literally my favorite kind of party because it doesn't mess up your sleep and that is important to me and I'm playing the game every girl plays before they go out which is trying on every pair of shoes they have to see which one goes with the outfit mm-hmm I'm just about ready to and hair is curly so I decided to go with the gladiator boots I thought they're cute my mum says which is natural so fair I'm right outside patio look Justin sighs I got some Canada geese or nein yeah so these are the same girls you'll see me on my blogs doing like Balak and everything hourglass girls and it's nice to get out and have a little bit of fun I do love day parties so I can get home at a respectable hour and eight o'clock so I can work until 2:00 a.m. but we had a good time I think Sophia is growing to love snapchat I'm just saying and it's nice to see Jana having a snack while I have my protein bar she's usually pretty anyways bye guys Lexie [Music] 
hey guys I'm Lizbeth Lopez registered allistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm here to talk to my fellow dick girls for all my thick girls out there that want to build out their bum bum or a badonkadonk whatever you want to call it but they don't want to build out their thighs right this is for you I am that girl too we're here I see you I feel you I understand I'm going to show you five exercises now these are mainly gym exercises so I do have a home workout video that you can look at I will click it up here so you can click on that box up there so I'm going to start out on this lovely machine right here this is called the glute ham this is literally probably one of my favorite machines in the entire world if you do not have this machine at your gym first I'm so sorry but second of all you can use a low back extension in a slightly similar way it is not as good but it will do a similar thing so I'm going to show you what this is I love this machine as you hear right in the name glute/ham what is the glute it is the bum bum it's right there in the name that's the whole purpose almost of this machine a lot of hamstrings as well but you have to remember when you're building out your bum bum you want to build the bum you also want to build the hamstring you want the double bump to get in I'm gonna put my foot through that area right there okay and this is gonna keep me still and then through there and now look no hands I'm good I am secure you can feel safe this is the way that I like to use it I like to pull all the way through until I can't go any more so my toes are actually pointed okay so they're not flexed here they are literally pointed like I'm trying to escape okay that's important I'm going to come down on the machine first I'm going to do is we're gonna hinge at the hip to flex out the glutes now hinge at the knees to flex out the hamstrings and now we're going to control the eccentric down keeping the glutes keeping the hams nice tension on them and then control it back down if you get to a point where this starts to become easy which is where we need to get to slowly but surely that's when you can add weight so now we can grab I've got a 35 yeah that feels good and then come down and that is like quite literally one of my all-time favorite exercises okay so now I'm going to show you guys the deadlift the deadlift for me is for every single body type so I'm going to show you two different ways that I like to do with kettle bell now why am i doing with the kettlebell for my thick girls I actually have a reason as to why I like to do kettlebells with it girls I find when I do a limpet bar personally I'm very just kind of I really pay attention to what I feel and where I feel it in my body and when I do I'm Olympic bar heavy deadlifts so there I find I get a lot of add doctors as well which is kind of all in here right like the UM the inner thighs okay my goal is for us to pop there there boom okay um I don't necessarily want you guys to grow this way because that's what makes you sad because your genes rip here because things start to grow okay we don't want that okay these I do every single week Olympic bar I might do twice a month something like that I'm gonna put my feet just kind of outside of the kettlebells I'm going to really pull back and engage the hamstring glute before I stand up abs are super strong and I'm gonna really make sure I'm completely in those hamstrings I feel them well stand up and flex it out okay I'm slightly in a Romanian stance right now with the glutes a little bit higher boom and in that I want to really get that stretch and that flex probably my favorite way of doing deadlifts we can also as thicker girls stiff-legged with good form is also not a bad option I prefer to do these with a barbell but this is what I have here right now boom some exercises I don't feel that girls should go very heavy on like squats and leg press other things heavys great I love hip thrusters because it actually kind of builds you that a versus this way okay if you know what I mean my thick girls you guys understand I don't really feel that hip thrusters hit you in a way so much that's going to grow you this way it's going to give you more that pop at the hamstrings which looks really sexy in like tights and shorts and also of course the bum bum so when you're doing hip thrusts you can do it on the bench with a barbell which I've shown in some of my videos but barbells only go up to 110 pounds so what do you do when you've done your progressive overload and you're slowly getting strong enough that you can go heavier than 110 pounds you come over to the Smith machine or you can all see you the Olympic bar with bumper plates on the floor but today this is the one that I'm going to show you you want the bench kind of to hit you I feel kind of the bra strap area just front of around scapula's and that's where you're going to preset it I'm going to use a sissy pad is what I call it it's the only time I use it as if I I pass a certain weight and around 220 I want to use a pad with barbells I don't use anything maybe sometimes a towel so I'm just gonna kind of slide on in guitar out of the way and I'm gonna slide down again until I'm about bra strap area just below the scapula's I've got my bar firmly on my hips and I'm gonna unlock so I'm gonna push up and push that way to unlock so here we go I'm unlock I'm gonna take it all the way the bottom boom power up take it down boom and I'm back at it this one is a great exercise to really build out those glutes and those hamstrings without thickening out the thighs and again this is how you can get heavier so you can really add some bulk to your bumbum this exercise I'm going to show you is awesome and it's an isolated exercise which I do like for my thicker girl and what we're about to do is called pull through okay cable pull through Zoar I like to call them also cable deadlifts okay they're gonna isolate that hamstring and right into kind of the under bum I like to call it and we're gonna get into the hamstring as well so we're gonna walk back to our machine I've already set my weight I'm just doing it at kind of like a teaching weight which is about 70 pounds okay so it's not not too crazy I've got my tries I call it a tricep rope I don't know if it had different name I've always felt that but I'm gonna take a couple big steps forward that's important and I'm going to make sure that I feel safe and then my heels are dug in so that I don't fly backwards or like flip forward okay think about that you want to start off with your glutes clenched control your shoulders keep them down and back pull your abs in head is in neutral which means don't do this keep it in line with your spine and we're going to slowly find that stretch in the hamstrings and then we're gonna drive through the glutes to come up BAM that easy okay you're gonna feel that stretch and then we're going to go right into that flex such a good exercise now I'm just going to come out and talk to you so here we go big steps back lightly put it down boom some people are going to feel shy to do this in the gym and they're never gonna get to do it because they're gonna go to the gym they're gonna be like I want to try that move but I feel kind of silly just do it okay if you want to actually change your body you need to get over these fears of doing like the abductor machine where your legs are going open and closed and doing this type of move these are moves that are gonna be really great for growing your glutes so you need to just tune everybody out put some of your phones in it's what do they say you know gym on world out and just do this exercise it is amazing for those areas let's do the next exercise I've been doing this exercise since I was 12 years old quite literally these ankle cuffs here which I already touched for you guys you'll find this in my purse at most points in life you could walk up to you in the street and say Elizabeth to you of your ankle cuff and there's a good chance it will be in my purse with me just because ok that's how much I love this exercise it is a kneeling cable glute kickback I'm about to show you how to do it this is another one that is a little bit more isolated again posterior chain hamstring glute right into kind of the erector spinae and getting into the low back area and this gets a really nice pop of the bum but also I feel when I'm doing it I can really feel my hamstring stretching and strengthening and I just love the feeling and I know when I'm good at doing it meaning I'm doing it often and heavy and I'm good on my diet see a change in my hamstrings so I'm going to show you how to do this amazing exercise are you ready here is all the little tips and tricks to do it right okay first of all you need an ankle cuffs you're going to clip it onto here and you want to take the cable portion all the way down to the bottom of the machine I've already set my bench okay so this is an important thing as well the bench is set so that my foot when i kneel my foot has room to come backwards like so very important that you keep your core engaged and a natural curve in the spine throughout the movement I'm going to hold here cores engaged foot is all the way forward this is to make sure that I hit my hamstring keep my head in neutral and now using my glute I'm going to bring that leg all the way back until I flex okay and then I'm going to control it forward little things to make sure that you're not doing is yes do not round that back keep it neutral abs in core flexed and get that flex now I'm just going to quickly show you when I want to switch legs here's what we do we're going to bring it all the way in watch I'm going to move my bench just like that and now you can see I've got room for my other leg to go back so I would just attach and do the exact same room thing and now I've got room on the other side for my leg to go backwards and this is an amazing amazing move only go as heavy as you can keeping your lower back safe and so you actually feel the flex in your gluts this is going to hit the whole thing the top of the bum the shelf the under bum hamstring so this is a good one to add to routine for all my sick girls out there I hope you enjoyed that I hope that gave you a bit of an understanding on what we need to do to build out the booty while not giving us those you know thunder thighs are great but we don't want to like we don't need too much thunder okay only so much

hey guys I'm Leslie Lopez registered listing nutritionist and master trainer and I'm here with two of the beautiful hourglass girls here today this is Christina and push out and I'm gonna put them through a very fun uphill treadmill sprint workout which all of you will love and they're gonna go through it just for you right now I'm gonna have them just get a little bit warm in the background which is something that you also might want to do before you do some up hill sprints so Keisha is actually using a it's the name I know for it is a tiger tail but really it's just like a self myofascial release tool so she's just prepping a little bit christina is kind of doing his swing doing and she's afraid to kick it so they're just kind of getting open and just ready another thing that you could do is just like a little bit of a foam roll of the hip area but the swings that suffer definitely necessary now what we're about to do is we're gonna do sprints on an incline now why are we adding an incline it because when you're on an incline it actually can help to engage to your bum bum bum bum just a little bit more so you're getting a little bit more glute engagement while getting our fat burn going and because we're doing it in a sprint fashion where we're gonna go on and off the treadmill and have them go very fast and then come off and just little steps on the side just to keep the blood flowing and that's kind of it increases all of the good hormones that you want to increase for all kinds of things like beauty stuck and ring stuff so kind of helps with your HGH it helps patients are on all these things that we want to naturally slightly elevated in Sprint's will help to do that on top of being fat burning and with inclined slightly booty buildings so let's show you this amazing sprint routine that this was not created by me this is created by hourglass girl Liz Cardoso thanks Liz for this treadmill health is the name that was made up for it we're about to start here's what's gonna happen the ladies are gonna turn on their treadmills it's going to go to an incline of 15 that is correct 1/5 which is the highest of our treadmill Stowe and that is a normal high highest for a lot of treadmills some go up to as far as I've heard I've heard ones that looked at 50 but most of them go to repeat they're like thank God one guys don't know that ones I know that's what we're doing right now now they're gonna take their speed because we are ready they are warm and we're gonna go right into it so we're gonna go right up to a speed of oh my god here we go I'm gonna put the clock on the first clock is going to be for 30 seconds so once I see there we're gonna go by are you ready yeah I'll let you go if you need to not he's like full-on advanced and these two are from my ever glasses so I know how strong they are I know they can do it I'm giving them one minute rest so put that on my clock they're gonna just kind of like walk their speeds for side to side or they can kind of just do this if they need just a little bit of movement in their legs a little bit for you guys I'm gonna put in the subject below exactly the timing of this workout the next one would be again level 15 and 9 but I'm gonna let them go down one so we're going to go to a 14.5 but we're maintaining the speed thing so they've chosen the speed 8 rather than the intended nine that okay I still love them very much but don't mean we're gonna speed for the entire workout and they're not allowed okay but slowly but surely the incline is going to come down any chance so they're going to start at 10 seconds and we're going to sprint a 14.5 and 8 and 3 into 35 35 second sprint under 14 he's very intelligent so don't get twisted I drilled about 30 cents they're strong go taking each rest early and we'll let you rest but we need a rest rest you've got five or three right to time that just the note that I didn't tell them because I've had with more fun to not tell them it's collector with an idea that's to learn I never made it through the phone for 30 or 35 it's very hard I try [Music] [Music] but I like to have the door because it gives you something to work towards they have another 30 seconds left on this this routine has 11 and we make you do 9 at the 11th but your whole work that will be again listen description box we're starting in 15 seconds and you take you get down to 14 but you're gonna attempt to go 40 seconds this time so notice all the times adjust slightly it's all very fun and 3 and 2 and tango all remember to speed does not get to go down each time and time goes down a little bit they're doing fantastic I can feel that there are two stops turning and by the second [Music] it's all about you [Laughter] when I made her sprint this might possibly be harder but we should make lists for that day I didn't write this forget she did but I loved it very much so here do you guys love it still okay and we're starting high just because in 13.8 you know the Bandit standing here so I fight what I've done before at night and it was very hard and I didn't I didn't actually meet my time that you supposed to hit first part either not even if you get like five seconds [Music] why do I get into it I don't know you guys are doing great and time okay you're good time start you're taking it at your mind down to 13 the new goal is 30 with a time of 45 second third and more cut today we're starting in his second guide six seconds everything you got they've never done this before that's how mean I am I'm like let's just try it on you need they come big if you're going to try you will thoroughly love it you are going to want to choose what speed that is challenging and almost to the point that you don't make it the first time do any of them time so when I was great - 23 seconds but nom if you can actually do it every time you're probably not going fast enough you're not challenging enough so I like the fact that it's challenging so we're almost there give it to me Christina five four three two last one minute rest on the clock I've had a sprint step like on on the at five o'clock sprint workouts and sometimes you will say a minute is too long or sometimes I'll give you two minutes and then like that's too much rest I started early it's because you're not going hard enough if I said you can have two minutes rest right now would you be very happy properly and they actually need the rest which is a proper sprint if you're just jogging of course you don't need two minutes rest you jogging this is actual like fall on their with their work their work and they're going to get all the sprint benefits because they're doing it properly and that's what I want you guys to see you guys have 13 seconds and I get a loop four three two and time on Aging they're going for five second interval they're gonna try to get as far as they can this is the second last one so I bet I could have got a little food on top of that if I said second last do and do it you're doing great you're doing great nature takes huh two pumps so guys so guys about 30 seconds to go this is hello babies are 12 don't forget don't forget there you go let's have 45 seconds to your last sprint the pool which again you can blame Liz for this and now I think we should like pop a picture of lists each item editor and then you guys can like throw dirt but then you're done and then it's just like a cool-down job so I'm just thank you 20 seconds there you guys excited I think they're going to show you how to do this okay you got five four three two laughs can you can you stop guys last one therefore no hands no hands gasps beach bum sprite breathing face are oh my god they're doing great they're doing amazing they're already 15 seconds in phenomenal I know everyone at home is like I can't wait to be as tired as there hi dick so there's 35 seconds left on the clock jump back on as soon as you're ready we'll finish off this final final sprint hear that ladies final sprint you can do it remember that you're on camera ready people pressure you know what I do in class and like I said snapping and then they all worth ten times its various second second who at home is so excited to try this everyone's just like yeah I wanna look like that but do you see the body throw by click it they use a little snack choice they work hard in class they work very very hard and very proud of both you how do you feel can you speak feel good all right Cristina your hair is doing something so when you're done your Sprint's at the end it is important just to have a little period when you're actually just walking getting the blood flowing or keeping the buzzer is going keep it inside flowing getting the artery to slowly come back down this could be your workout for the day in itself again benefits of it super fat of your epoch so your the excess post-ops is in consumption which is your abdomen which helps you burn it bad all the time it increases those hormones again that are gonna help you to be cute and lean and all that kind of good stuff and it's just fun this is fun right [Music] a little bit fun

hey guys I'm Lizbeth Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm going to talk to you about the worst cardio that you could do if you're trying to build your booty this is the thing guys when you guys are trying to choose which cardio trying to choose which what weights to do all that kind of stuff you have probably have full-time jobs you might be a mom or you know you have other things to do than trying to figure out okay if I'm trying to do this which cardio showed you which way it's a lot of stuff there's so much to think about so I'm going to tell you exactly which three you should not be doing and then at the very end of the video I'm going to tell you the three that I like the best so you got to stay tuned all the way to the end see how I did that you see you see the very first cardio that I'm gonna say is like can't do this one is jogging and I'm so sorry because I know there's you know certain running groups that are sponsored by people and stuff like that that are really fun and they're great stress release I'm not saying it's bad to do I'm just saying it's not great for trying to build your bum and actually it might actually make it flatter okay the good thing is if you're trying to lean out your legs it will probably make your legs look a little bit leaner and smaller but if you're actually try to build your bum not the one that you want to do if you're really insistent that this this makes you feel good you like it at least add an incline okay maybe take it up a hill you'll get a little bit more gluten gage Minh to kind of give you a little short story on how I actually know from my own clinical trial on me that this is true is back in the day when I had built my legs so much because they didn't know about glute activation all this stuff at the time and I had some pretty big thunder thighs they were like rubbing and ripping jeans and all that kinds of stuff I decided I'm gonna stop all leg training and instead become a jogger and I was running for like an hour every day and my legs got so skinny like I'd never seen them so skinny but my ass was like it disappeared it all went away I managed to get it back again but it was it was gone so not helpful for the bum bum okay so the next one I'm going to talk about is are you ready long duration cardio in the fat burning zone and you may think I don't I don't know if I do that or not if this is you you go to the gym and you sit on the exercise bike or the elliptical trainer or you do a nice jog on the treadmill or an uphill walk and you're doing it for like you know thirty minutes plus and you're at that zone where you're just feeling good you're getting a nice pump and you're feeling great about yourself then yes you are doing it this is this is you yes you're doing some fat burn but I want you to think about this so when you're going that slow duration for sure you're burning calories and for sure you're burning fat but you're only burning so many calories because you're going at that nice comfortable pace you're not super challenging yourself so the percentage of fat that you're burning overall is still probably less than if you were to do something like intense Sprint's where you're burning so many calories and even though the percentage of fat burn might be a little bit lower for that amount of time possibly the overall amount of fat and calories and everything is still going to outweigh it and be better so that's just one thing that makes Sprint's better not that I'm saying Sprint's we're better but Sprint's you're better okay so my very last one for you guys before I get to all the good stuff the three favorites is actually that 90s year 2000 style of you know grapevine okay all of that cardio in a group class where you're kind of fit dancer size it's really fun it definitely does have some benefits number guys I'm not saying this is like bad bad so I'm just saying it's not gonna help build your bum grapevines and knees up and and like light jogging on the spot is literally doing nothing for your derriere what do we have in common with all three of those is their long duration their low resistance and low intensity those three things will not help that bum bum do we get that is that all coming through I hope so it's not only not building muscle but you might actually be atrophying your muscle and what does that mean making it smaller and that's part of the reason that it's not only not helping your mom it might make it shrink oh my god all of that hard work all of those squats and then you're making it smaller so that's definitely not what we want to do so let's move on to the things that we want to do new oh no is guess Sprint's it's Prince okay I love Sprint's so much I do them on a very regular basis myself if you watch my snapchat are you watching my snapchat lives of a slow PES on snapchat I actually walk you through how I do sprint so so really really intense bursts it's probably a total of maybe like five to six prints over maybe 15 minutes with little rests and stuff in between a little warm-up this it's you burn more calories you burn more fat it's muscle sparing so I'm burning the fat and maintaining my muscle and on top of it it even activates the glutes that power off of those Sprint's it actually helps you build your bum bum on a tip on top of keeping your bum bum like everything about it is booty building okay and fat burning so Sprint's is number one so my next one that I love and especially for my slim girls out there slim girls are you listening you want your booty and you want to be lean and tone it's bike sprints okay so there is the running sprints was the first one by experiences the second one why do I love his bike Sprint's especially for my thinner girls is because one it's fat burning it helps with the bum bum it's muscle sparing but it also does build the thighs just a little bit which for some of you it will look so sexy and so feminine so bike Sprint's are amazing full intensity when I say sprint it's not faster than but you know the the heart rate zone it's everything you've got so I want you to really learn to slowly progressively get to that everything you've got mode what I'm going to tell you as well is with the two forms of Sprint's one of the things that I really love about it is even though you're only going for a short amount of time if you're doing like a Tabata or you're doing the Sprint's you might be going anywhere from four minutes up to a very probably maximal of about 20 minutes and even though you're only working out for that amount of time it boosts your metabolic rate so much that it takes about 24 hours and you're burning calories that whole time so it's actually way more effective than if you were doing kind of that steady-state cardio in your heart rate zone where you're burning for the 30 to 40 minutes and then right so which one would you rather do okay let's go to my very last and favorite one for building your bum bomb through cardio throw on a weighted vest okay if you're a little bit more advanced and we're going to do some intense running up the stairs with the weighted vest so we've got the activation of the gluts by going upstairs we've got a little bit of weight and we're doing it in first okay make sure that you're coordinated before you try this we don't tripping on the stairs maybe try it without the weighted rest first get climate into the type of stair that you're doing and then go for it so full-on bursts take your time back down the stairs just like if you seeis furniture they sprint sprint sprint and then they take that nice walk back they get their heart rate back and then they do it again so those are my three top ones to build that bomb bomb I hope you enjoyed that and I will see you in the next video please comment below if you have any questions something you'd like to see in the next video like the video subscribe because I put out fitness nutrition and recipes every single Tuesday and Friday I hope to see you there peace out so first thing that we're going to talk about is energy good so with energy drinks I know that we think that like even just in the title energy like it sounds great right and really at the end of the day it's just kind of glorified soda with extra caffeine and maybe a little 
hey guys I'm Liza Lopez register Phyllis - nutritionist and master trainer and we are going to talk blat belly packs are you ready here are some of my top tips to kind of get that flatter belly if you've been bloated and stuff like that then this is for you but just to kind of like preface it I was competing and fitness competitions and I remember the first time I saw having a six-pack and I was just like oh my god this is the coolest thing ever and then it wasn't too much long later that all the sudden my belly was like why is there a basketball under my shirt I don't understand so I started to research into why these types of things happen so I've got a lot of flat belly hacks I'm just gonna share with you like maybe five of them right now so maybe they'll be a part two maybe so let me know in the comments below if you would like to see a part two after you watch part one right now maybe or just regular let's see the first one that I'm going to talk about is chewing gum tada I bet you guys didn't think that something like chewing go could actually cause you to have a bloated belly but surprised it actually can when you're chewing the gum you might be swallowing a bit of air which can cause an issue but that's not even the one that I'm fully talking about when you're chewing okay and you're tuned usually your body when it feels chewing it thinks oh I think we're going to digest food let me create some stomach acid and get ready for all of this food coming down but when you're chewing gum as we all know here there isn't any food coming down you're just chewing what happens is you start to create extra HCl hydrochloric acid okay you might think that then a lot of people that chew gum end up having like an acid reflux then you might go to your doctor and say hey I'm having asteroid flux and then they might give you some type of medication and then it could lead to something like leaky gut there's a whole like I could just keep going on or I could just say and you know you can research that further try to not chew gum anymore if you can if you want to have that flat belly instead just you know do the usual brush your teeth you know mouthwash all that kind of stuff maybe try the oil pulling we've got a video coming out okay I can link it on how to do that to get the fresh breath and the white teeth and all the kind of good stuff most of them do have aspartame and you're chewing on bad sugars all day but even with the healthy ones that don't have them you're going to have the same effect so it's just kind of like no another thing that might be causing your bloated belly might actually be not having enough acidity in our stomach and you might think but I don't want to be acid but it's kind of like different parts of your body should have different acidity levels so you're some if you actually want it to be relatively acidic so it can break down your food okay so I know you don't don't just think I'm so sevilla alkaline no the stomach's supposed to be acidic so things that could be causing it to not be acidic could be things like stress I'm having too much sugar medications antacids yeah there's there's quite a few things but to fix it some of the things that you can do is this is a digestive aid so this is um it doesn't say right on it but it's actually a beitung so hydrochloric acid so before meat meal maybe having something like this with it or even better I like doing like apple cider vinegar drinks maybe in the morning or before a meat meal I do have a recipe on the channel called the flat belly secret which is my fire shot okay that's what we call it the fire shot and it's like apple cider vinegar and turmeric and a bunch of other things I personally have it at least once a week if not like sometimes three times a week four times a week I love it I literally feel energized my tummy feels flatter everything feels good when I have it and a lot of people have actually even stopped me in the street and said I've tried your fire shot it's like changed my life if you even look at the comments on the video like just genuine people saying how much they loved it it is a huge huge helper for getting a flat belly now note not everyone is low stomach acid so don't just kind of watch this and think everyone is so I'm just going to take all these things to add acidity you should always check with your doctor to find out but it is a cause for a lot of people another reason a lot of people are low stomach acid is lack of zinc so there is something called the zinc tally test you can check the set at your health food store and it is one measure that a lot of holistic practitioners like or you can just check with your doctor by a blood test and see how your zinc levels are and that can also correlate to having enough acid in your stomach and then again that is a major I know it's kind of boring it's not like just do more crunches but it is like one of the things that can really really really help to flatten out your belly okay let's go back to me it's very simple but a lot of you are going to be annoyed when I say it because I was annoyed when I read about it so don't get mad at me don't shoot the messenger and that is stop drinking water and liquids with your meals I know that this is hard to do because that's generally when a lot of people drink their water or with their meal so they pour a glass of whatever and they eat and they drink but what's happening is our stomach again is meant to be acidic so if we're drinking a whole bunch of water while we're eating we're actually diluting that stomach acid a little bit and not allowing it to do its full job which is breaking down food but you know that's supposed to be very acidic it's supposed to parasites and all this kind of stuff it's supposed to kill them so they don't further on into the body so you need to try to drink your as you're saying when when do I have it then probably like 20 minutes before a meal is great or 20 minutes to 30 minutes after the meal just give it some time but definitely 20 my Sifu formula is awesome because then it even like gets everything ready and stuff right but just between meals it's the best time to drink water for that flat belly and it will make a difference okay ready next I want to talk about sleeping now we hear you know beauty sleep and sleeping is a time of rest and cell turnover and all this kind of good stuff but I want you to think about this if you have an ill combined meal so what does that mean first of all if you're combining things like meat and rice and vegetables and maybe even as an ice cream or something afterwards you've got so many different things happening all in your tummy at the same time that could take you like five six hours to digest now let's pretend that you're that late-night eater okay so let's say you finish that meal around like nine o'clock and then you decided to go to bed at like 11 o'clock so for two hours you got to digest but three hours into your sleep you're still digesting and when you sleep things slow down as well so let's say it even took like four hours into your sleep you're digesting and you're kind of your average typical American let's even say and you slept for six hours so that means for four out of those six hours you are digesting digesting takes up so much energy so you're sleeping and you're digesting you're trying to break things down you're not getting a lot of cell turnover you wake up you're groggy you're sleepy and you've got a bloated belly let's fix this the best way to fix this is to one dinner time try to make that a better meal combination so something quick and easy to digest something like maybe if you're going to do meat then meat and maybe like a fibrous vegetable like a meat in a broccoli or something like that or just just something more easy to digest you can look up all of these things and also try to give it at least a minimum of two hours before you go to bed if you can do four hours I personally I like that better some body builders out there are like oh my god my muscles are going to disappear really really fine if you need to you can I'm a protein shake okay that will also be relatively easy to digest but let yourself actually digest at night and you'll be shocked how flat your stomach is in the morning when I used to do this and I used to wait for hours before bed and wake up in the morning I would literally was shocked at how much flatter my stomach was it was like an instant gratification and I felt like I slept better okay try it give it a try you'll feel good you'll have a flat belly the next one is like a little fun little saying that you'll probably remember okay and that's when you move you move we're talking about your poof okay so basically what I'm saying is when you move around like you're exercising you're running you're jogging you're working out or whatever everything is moving and it actually helps with something called the purse salsas which is just kind of moving as a Katsopolis must' - that moves things along and it can actually help you - to poo okay a little bit better so just remember that when you move you move and then when things are moving out this can be a little flatter so that's just kind of like a quick and easy something to remember to exercise walk run jog whatever okay lemon water I love lemon water and have some right now I have this like first thing in the morning I have a citrus juicer and slice it in half and then juice it up and I'll do like a cup of water and then pour a whole lemon into it I usually like a liter of water this is a great thing to do it's it's really good for again we'll talk about poop again it's good form for helping you poop in the morning it's also good for your liver and it's good for your digestion it just does so many things the best way to do it is you wake up in the morning and before you have food you have your lemon water and then you wait about 20 minutes before you eat okay and all of that is kind of systematic where you just really let it come in and cleanse you and everything and the enzymes and it just really can help you just you know move things along and you may not notice you can actually not everyone but you can hold like up to like 20 pounds of fecal matter or poop okay in your tract and that will make you look more you know people that that don't move as often maybe they move like once every three days the goal being at least once a day that's don't worry if you're not there it's just a goal is something to aim for but something like doing that lemon water in the morning can definitely help and it's very easy and it tastes really good for your kids if you want to add a little like stevia drop or something to make it taste better you can do that to tell them it's lemonade so those are some of my flat belly I hope that they help I have a ton more of them so again if you would like some more just let me know they're all very easy and the more you can add one at a time and then you can add second one and then maybe doing three maybe you're doing all seven of them or six seven eight I showed you eventually and you're just going to see that stomach shrink and you're gonna feel good and your skin's a little good and it's just a big ripple effect if you have some other hacks please share them in the

my name don't mind my crazy hair getting ready to come to Atlanta I'm having my favorite super food cereal so I'm about to bring the alibis work out to Atlanta I'm on the way to the airport to meet Melissa and get this tour going Trenholm has such nice Edwards pretty that is get to work you got the full work stations here my fans that's a terrible always I'm playing whatever gonna break in my new sunglasses since it will be nicer in Atlanta than it is in Toronto look at our window you know have to check for bedbugs always when you arrive at hotels this is imperative so I packed few foods with me let's see if it still intact yay healthy food on the go Jim yeah City for a tour date is I check the venue and check out all the equipment I literally count everything like I count every dumbbell every step every kettlebell just so I can spend that night really kind of putting my circuits together because they do like equipment and all the venues that I choose always have equipment because obviously when I'm flying I can't bring like my money kettlebells with me but this was an amazing space here in Atlanta they were so so good to us and you see all this equipment I was like the kid and all the big candy store it was amazing and I think I used absolutely everything that they had we don't talk anymore she just goes on sweet potato fries with marshmallow dipping sauce I'm not in Toronto anymore chicken waffles this is the restaurant in the hotel hi Nelly must get the muscle yeah the marshmallow and then the liver fear attempting to be healthy those are Brussels sprouts but they're fried so again attempting have to say I really like the southern hospitality here in Atlanta it's like every go everyone says hello and you know you get on the elevator people are saying hello it's gym time now started too so we're getting our gym session and of course even though we're on the road we happen to luck out with an amazing gym in this hotel we would have worked out regardless but this was just you know bonus and me and mallet used to film each other for Instagram when Instagram first started and she knows how to get all the good angles on this email now and yeah she's off in New York teaching hourglass I was there and I'm misty belly getting her morning pump ready to teach this workshop so here we go it's class time I taught two different classes here in Atlanta plus the certification and I actually really love doing these tours and getting to go you know across pretty much into the u.s. this time but I get to meet so many people that I just kind of get to chitchat with on social media and get to actually train them and show them what our class is and you know just work out with them and it's it's amazing and I have to say like the energy and the enthusiasm and how hard these girls go it's phenomenal and then it's kind of exciting when the you know write on a comment later on Instagram you say I'm for Chicago workshop I don't remember them and it just makes it that much more personal and kind of takes that social media to an in-person thing so I love it hey day is all done we just did a couple of classes and was so much fun and so I love the girls love them morning you're gonna do day two of the certification here in Atlanta and it's getting ready to watch just about to get started to bring our Buster lentes over in Atlanta there's going to be programs here recently so the first day that I show it was the camp for just kind of anyone that wanted to come out and do a intensive that booty workout and when it's done it knows it's intensive you might not be able to walk for a week but this day this is the certification base so this is where I have personal trainers so all the girls here are all personal trainers who are learning to actually teach hourglass workouts so this is a training program that I put together to teach one of the methods that I've created for creating that hourglass shape so we do a lot of activation a lot of Pilates mixed with heavy lifting and it's very specific to kind of getting the fat burn and the proper shaping to build an hourglass shape so that is what we're doing today so all the girls this is the first well this is the second part they had to do the camp to actually see what the class was like because you know we're not in Toronto they've never tried it and then the second date was this where they actually learned all the techniques and all the styles and all the different all the different kind of I guess workouts that I do and then after this I don't show it but then we sit down for another like six hours and we actually get into the theory part of it and then there's like a full theory part and tests and all that kind of good stuff so our last workout is now in Canada the US and the UK which is pretty awesome because it just started out in Toronto if you want to become an our best workout instructor you can now do the certification on just go to our glassware Capcom forward slash certification and you can do the certification online and bring it to your city we have one day left in Atlanta this is what Melissa want so the real story behind last night's Segway decision was we actually wanted to go and see an Atlanta strip club because I haven't been to him before and apparently if you're gonna go I went is the place because it's actually like a show like a real show but it was Sunday so strip clubs are closed on Sunday because it's a church day so we decided to do segways in in the morning instead so off we go so that there's actual like Segway trip is nerds excited when Melissa was first like let's go do this and I laughed at her I was actually thought she was joking I'm so glad I did it it was so fun my one tip is don't worry feels I don't know who told me to wear heels on a Segway but it made it very off balance and I was actually like the worst person at it where I had to stay behind the instructor because I almost rolled backwards down the hill at one point and there's another point of almost train rolled into traffic but that doesn't usually happen I did catch the hang of it eventually yeah so it was an excellent tour of Atlanta like you just you get to go to places that you probably might not go otherwise in so many places he took us to kind of the area for dr. Martin became his final resting place we also got to see his first house and you know you're just you know you're out in the Sun it's beautiful you're learning something new oh you're doing the Segway at the same time as just I don't know it's just it was just a really cool thing to do he also took us to see here we got um handmade organic popsicles and I started in sign of benches and parked our segways and and then he took us back on a tour and we started to head back and took us through some cool neighborhoods where we saw being at the house where the CEO coca-cola lived which was a big beautiful house in a beautiful neighborhood and I really felt like I got to see a part of Atlanta that I probably wouldn't have seen if we did what my plan was which was to just go shopping so anyways I would recommend this trip it was it was great I hope you enjoy it just kind of seeing what we saw it was funny right now 
I'm Elizabeth lopez and registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer I do hourglass shaping see the wall behind you you see Lucy that I read let's forget so what we do is we shape out curves and to do that I do personally believe that you need to be able to add some weight be able to do a little bit of progressive overload so I'm gonna show you some of my favorite pieces are you ready I've got the stability ball dumbbells TRX booty bands kettlebells and jumper all in all I to the entire kit if you want to go right for it that's probably about two hundred and fifty dollars but you don't need to get everything I mean you can just start with dumbbells and a ball would probably be the first two to get and then you can add on from there to really get a good home gym this is the only guy that's gonna take up some space but you can use it as a chair for your desk and then really get some course support going people thought extra wall exercise well stability biology knots as well there's a million names for it it's it's about anyways to choose your height for it here is the trick this one here a little bit too big for me you know how I know because my knees are not at a ninety degree angle when I'm sitting on it it's a little bit too big for me these things are so insanely versatile it is awesome I can make it a bench and now I'm able to do bench press I can do pullovers and I can do abdominals more abdominals it's really just a super super versatile piece of equipment and it probably will cost you depending on the quality that you get anywhere from maybe 10 to 40 bucks I would go a little bit more on the high-end one and make sure that it's burst proof next piece of equipment I'm going to show you I adore these these are actually my own these are called blue band okay I have them on my website lights with Lopes com2 click below to find more information I use these for activation a lot of times people have trouble activating their glutes so when they're doing their squats they're actually using a lot more quads and hamstrings and the glutes may not be turned on and then they're wondering how come I'm not seeing any difference here okay so what you want to do is pre activate before you actually you're lucky let's gonna show you maybe one or two exercises that you can do quickly so I'm going to purple these are the medium I'm gonna put them one at my knee and one at my ankle so some things you can do with this is you can step side to side now see how little space this takes but I'm getting a good workout for the side okay gluteus medius of my glutes core is strong I can also take this to cardio jump hanging it out still using the glutes getting the cardio up also activating and I can clamshell okay again activating right here I can booty blast taking it all the way up and down if I was doing hip thrusters let's say when you lie down and your head's on the bench and you thrust it apart I can put it around my knees to also make that move even more intense those are booty bands I love them I have them in my purse like all the time they're like always with me I will be showing more video on teaching you guys how to use them next thing we'll show you is kettlebells I love kettlebells so much just recommend that you have two pairs I'm not saying need to start off with 16k okay because that's a little bit heavy but I'm just showing what I would have at home and I'll give you a suggestion of if you're starting maybe where you want to start why would I have these two weights specifically if I could only have a few I would choose a heavy for lower body so for me I can use these and I can get my deadlift okay I can do my suit Menezes I can use them for lunges okay so all of those heavy lift things that I want to do I might not have a barbell or Olympic bar or any room for that these just kind of look how small they can go under something it's so nice and simple and I can get my intense heavy training I can also even put my head on a couch and put the kettle bells on my hips and do things like hip thrusters right so they're very very versatile so then I also my light set now the light set that I keep around this is more for upper body stuff and also even quick-moving so I can do things like my traditional thing press keep it nice and tight I can do bicep curls with them I can do traditional kettlebells at them with the kettlebell swing I can do back rolls right so they're like very very versatile I just really need the two sizes for at home they're usually around maybe like two dollars a pound herself these are economic so when I clean it goes to the shape of my arm I find that a lot of women that I work with they don't love the traditional round you know those uh old-school wrist bands the kind of like fuzzy terry cloth ones you can get those and you'll be fine with the round ones so next thing I'm going to show our traditional dumbbells now I would recommend that you have three pairs of these so these are my heavier --hz for me I probably do something like a 25 because again I can do my deadlifts I can do my lunges I can do my squats all of that kind of good stuff I can get all my heavy stuff in I also want to have a medium pair they need a pair will be for me to do they look like my shoulders okay so lateral raises all my shaping stuff but I want to have a light set as well because you definitely don't want to forget areas like your rotators right so we want to be able to do rotator stuff with things like triceps I actually like to go light so I go like five to eight pounds on triceps so if you're new to working out light medium heavy weights for you might be like a two pound an eight pound and a twelve to fifteen pound if you're more advanced maybe something like this maybe heavier okay but that's a good guideline of where to start okay guys so next I'm going to show you the TRX this is an attachment that you'll want for home I'm going to show you it in my gym so it's attached to a pillar that I put in but this is it that you put in your door okay so if you picture the top of your door you put this into the top of your door you close your door and now you've got your attachment for your TRX which is what you'll see me using in a second and you're just going to attach it to this guy right here and then you got your door and your TRX okay so that's how it becomes a home unit these are technically for hands and these are technically for feet you can get creative but that's how it's meant to be used and I'm going to show you how you can kind of do full-body with this you can even kind of make it weight related so if I'm very new I might stand up this tall for instance to do a back row and there's very little resistance here but if I'm getting stronger the more that I walk out the more intense it gets just by bodyweight I can even straighten out my legs and make it even more intense so I can really play with the intensity and make it kind of like almost like I'm going from 10 pounds to 20 pounds to 40 month just by where I'm standing I can get into chest ok little bench press the lower that I go the more intense it so right here hitting those triceps just like an overhead press to put it on my feet even though I'm going to turn around I'm going to get in this way and then I'm going to flip so cross my feet roll over and I'm ready so I can do the apps I can add a push up okay I can do cardio with ABS like there's so many things that you can do with the TRX like it really is just like it's an all-in-one or dam it's amazing so that's just one of the reasons I'll try and do a video just on the t-rex and I'll try to show you even more exercise you can do you can also stretch with it then last piece of equipment that I'm going to show you is the jump rope it's one of my favourite pieces of equipment ever I love that the jumping motion is great for your calves grip for your bum it's great for your shoulders and of course again it's this small you can't pack a treadmill with you but you can pack a jump rope this is another thing that I always have in my purse I know it's so weird so weird a million lipglosses jump ropes and booty bands you know my Chanel wallet because I'm a girly girl but I love jump roping one thing that's fun is you can start off with your basic bounce this is the basic bounce then you can start working on crosses and learning to process so it's kind of like you get to have fun with it you're always trying to learn new things you can get to your doubles and then you can just start dancing it's kind of like I'll just put on really fun music and it's just like I'm just dancing in the Rope baby yeah okay so that's that's kind of the running man right you got you got it you got it um so that is living my favourite pieces of equipment you know that that was a little bit of talent I put out videos every single week I hope you guys subscribe below if you want to get email

so probably all of us have some type of small parasites in us so she's dogs cats so so when I do cleanses I like to focus on a specific organ and get it all be song focusing on my intestines and trying to get them as healthy as possible it's time for some colon cleansing so that I don't look like so I'm about to get a colonic and no you're not going to watch but I do this as part of my colon cleansing and when I'm done my stomach is so tight and flat and it's hard not to get too addicted to them but you can't get addicted to them because you should only do them so often I'm also doing some fish oil this is a bubble gum flavored fish oil and then this is my parasite actual cleanse it tastes really disgusting but the results are worth it so when I'm doing any type of cleanse I also stay relatively low sugar so you're seeing I'm doing meat vegetables and more vegetables for dinner I'm on set getting ready to shoot so today's shoot I'm back at my hourglass regrets studio and now we are filming my home training program and it's going to take a while to put together a train with Liza book took me about two years to create which is my gym training program of actually how I train so now this is my home training program and yeah I'm really excited about it we're getting really really close to it being there as you can see I'm trying to keep it also fun lots of different outfits hairstyles breeds all that kind of good stuff but there will be a lot of Pilates involved in a home training program because I'm a Pilates fiend I love it so much I think it's the best I won't say only way but the best way to get a small tight you know strong waist a lot of people say how do I keep my lower body kind of thick but my abs really strong and it's definitely the Pilates and I do not use waist trainers I don't believe in waist Reiner's on last year suffering from diastasis post pregnancy I think Pilates is the way to go so these are some of the moves I created this is from my sexy Pilates repertoire which is a repertoire that I created myself from mixing Pilates dance and gymnastics some of these moves like this one here this is actually a real Pilates move and which I fell on it but um but a lot of the moves that I'm gonna be doing in the program are actually moves that I created by myself so yeah I think the one closer so it's easier for like people to see okay go so some of the behind the scenes that people don't generally see is that when I'm shooting this stuff it's generally an eight-hour day of like 40 to 50 exercises and each exercise you know to even catch a 15 to 30 seconds and probably filming the same exercise for like two to four minutes non-stop so definitely got my work cut out for me but I have fun with her so that was an awesome and productive day now it's time to get this started I got my chocolate I'm going to eat this full video so welcome to our class and put my little home I'm meeting up with a couple of my hours less franchisees we like

cut has begun this is how we're doing our warm-up and we're doing the workout that I showed on the board which was repeatedly flats and jump squats as you're seeing here and then I think it's um oh yeah MMA push-ups and then next you'll see some single leg stretch Pilates and then I think a switch lunge and we do 30 seconds per exercise and just two times through and it's just kind of a nice way to warm up that isn't something like running on the treadmill so we're working our core working our legs getting a good pump in and then and then we're ready for the actual workout and it only takes a

hey guys I'm Liza thawfest registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm going to show you an amazing dish it is a spaghetti but it is basically gluten free it's very very low carb instead of using spaghetti we're going to use zucchinis with this spiralizer and we're also going to use a ground turkey so it's going to be delicious it's going to be low fat it's gonna be high protein it's gonna be low carb and loaded with nutrients are you ready so I'm going to use I've just got right here it is a coconut oil and ghee okay so I'm gonna spray my pan with the coconut oil linky I'm going to use a good amount because I got a probably a full pound of ground turkey we go adding all of the extra lean ground turkey so super good source of protein of course I don't really like to add too much until it's brown because if there's a lot of fat I might pour some of it out and I just have it set to about a medium heat you can see it's already starting to brown and we're just breaking it out as we go I'm going to start doing my zucchini and just start spiralizing that I've pre-cut to organic zucchinis right here so I just chopped the ends off of them and I've washed them you can see right here there's a little circle that I'm going to put that into and then that right there so I'm going to pop this in just like that and I'm going to meet it just like this we just start spiralizing and their skills and that fun pull that guy out BAM oh so usually I just use one zucchini but because they're small I'm going to use two of them and usually it will fill almost this bowl and bam bam and bam and I'm going to leave it raw sometimes people will actually throw it into the pan and give it a little bit of heat but I like to have a little bit of raw food in my life and this is a nice way to do it let's go check on that meat again this is coming along very nicely there's a little bit of fat there I'm going to pour that out there we go so this is Bragg's amino acids I like this one it kind of tastes a little bit like soy sauce it's very high protein and it just adds a really nice flavor to it I know it's a little weird I use a little bit of jerk spice in my past so just I like spice and it flavorful and it just I don't know it's kind of like the hot sauce put that issue on everything this is Himalayan pink sea salt I do add salt to things but I choose really healthy salt from very specific about what I will use just a little bit though give me too much of some black peppercorns and a lot of black pepper and then let's also add this is a hot chili pepper because this and the jalapeno and you know I like it to be sticky yeah that does smell good so next up this is a tomato sauce but it's organic I do choose your organic when it's Tomatoes because the skin is so thin that it's very important do-do-do-do-do and then the nice flavor I chose a tomato sauce that had like spinach and spinach and garlic in it so it adds a nice flavor time to add some vegetables now that it's pretty well cooked so next we're going to add in our mushrooms break them up a little bit make them a little bit smaller so next up I'm adding these jalapeno-stuffed olives so it's all of us with jalapeno stuff in it and jalapenos around it I like a lot of spice and I actually think that this is one of the things that makes the whole recipe if you don't like spice as much as me you can just use regular olives so gonna throw these guys in without garlic we got more jalapeno because again I like some spice yes yes yes yes yes throw in one garlic clove as well a little bit of flavour and garlic is good for your blood and the olives is like it's a good it's a good oil pepper for like one minute just to get it all like soaked together so we're in the last part guys here we go can you see it can you can you can you okay guys this is the finish line we're gonna go and get the meat sauce we're gonna pour it over the raw zucchini noodles yeah smells so good guys we're just gonna pour that on over so we've got the raw of the zucchini we didn't cook it which is good to get some raw food to keep the enzymes in so it's almost no carbs I mean we're using zucchini which is a great fiber lots of nutrients vitamin A vitamin C good for the skin the fibers good for the colon whoo this is about two servings here by the way just in case your eyes are getting bigger than your Tumtum and then just to finish it off nicely put a little bit of parsley chopped up it's kind of do a little bit of that okay all done oh it's so good you guys see that so yummy I used to eat this back in my competition days when I'd need to get like really really lean and this helped me get there because you're not missing anything it's still very hearty you got your fiber you've got your protein you got all the nutrients and you've got lots of flavor with the olives and Malik Daniels and all of that kind of good stuff so it's a great one it doesn't even feel like diet food yet it kind of is and it's great for your whole family if you guys like this recipe I hope you guys will subscribe to the channel I put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday fitness nutrition tutorials all that kind of good stuff if you have any questions or ideas or suggestions or you've tried the recipe leave it in the comments below I love to get interacted with you guys and hear what you have to say and like the video and by all means if you would like to use the share tabs below and share it with your friends I look forward to seeing you guys in next week's video have an awesome day peace out everybody coconut is our next ingredient now I was already guys to use this because this is how I get the water over to coconut but I've been challenged literally on set just now to use a trail I'm a little scared I haven't used this before okay here we go are you ready okay hold on okay 
hey guys I'm Liza Beth and I am an avid gym goer and I love all things sound and music and all that kind of good stuff so I have moved into the century finally and got myself some wireless stuff I grabbed it at Best Buy and I got some wireless earbuds and I got a wireless speaker so I'm gonna give you guys a little review up and playing with them and a spoiler alert I love them both but I'm gonna tell you why and I'm gonna give you all the breakdown and all the details of how they works okay you ready let's start off the earbuds now with the earbuds I'm gonna say I've been using these Bose ears buds probably for like two or three years I love them I love the sound of them the wire does get in the way a little bit sometimes so I was really curious to try the wireless so here we go we got these I'm Jaybirds this is what they look like here and they come in this nifty little case as such they actually originally came in this box here where it says sweat proof that was a big seller for me right there because I will be using at the gym and because they're wireless I do kind of worry like is it gonna shock me or something if I get them really wet but no no it will not they were ready for me so that is the first plus and one of my first concerns that I had so this is how it opened it kind of just snaps shut which is nice and easy like so do you see the nails by the way I do you see the garrideb-san's I'm saying just saying the next concern that I had was will they stay my ear because I sprint I jump I run I really do a lot of athletic type things and I'm worried that they're gonna fall off and write on the ground because they won't even be connected to anything so are you this is storing a lot of stuff so I saved it all just to do this review because I really only need the ones that they gave me but all this stuff is in this little bag and all gonna fall on the floor because I'm a bit of a klutz so we've got the rubber one like so and the kind of foamy one like so and I will also flip it around for you just so you can kind of see the other side and they gave me three of each so they gave me three rubber and three foam different sizes small medium large and then I'm not sure what these are called but I'm calling them bat wings maybe that's what they're called and I'm gonna be the makeup artist thing like so where you can see what is happening here and these just kind of like hug into your ear so they don't fall out and they 100% work I chose the medium in this to create my combination that we have right here okay so that is the small rubber with the bat wing and as you can see it's just a wire run back I think some of the older models had more of a firm kind of plastic on the back I find that this is very comfortable these actually the little bat wing it like clips under your ear so these things stay in okay I sprinted at a speed of 13 can I get a round of applause here at a speed of 13 under strain it didn't fall out very good I love that they one thing I didn't think about when I was thinking of ear buds I like my normal earphones they don't need to be charged you know you plug them in these need to be charged so this has about an eight hour battery life in total so this plus did it fall on the ground nope it's still here this including this charge here this is like where you charge it but it also has battery life in it so if this dies a little bit early and I have this in its handy little pouch I can just plug this in like this for a little extra battery life and then the little USB port is right there with the little plug that you can put into whatever you need to get a little bit of a charge fantastic so that is kind of fun and I love that they thought of something because you can still be wearing it and have this in and it's super duper light so it's no concern now the other thing is even though I'm techy I I always need help I'm techy with health so I love that that was very easy was like a one button thing I opened my settings I hit my Bluetooth thing to search it found it and it immediately turned on and everything from my phone switched right into here the other thing that was great is when I got a phone call while testing it the phone call came here and guess what there was a speaker so I was able to just keep going about my business I had the option on my phone to choose answer with with the earbuds it said and jaybird or answer with my phone so it could switch back or forth so that was also like so many things mean thought of in advance which made me very very happy person and I lost my carrying case anybody see it in case because I don't know if you're like me but my purse is just a magical area of lots of stuff so the sound get it's gonna be as good [Applause] first I was like okay the sound is decent like I can I can live with the sound because it's not as good as my Bose but it's pretty good but it does a lot of other cool stuff but then guess what happened I found out there's an app because there's an app for everything right so there's an app the app is called my sound I have my earphones on I put a song on that I like and then I can click to all these different sounds what I do is I have a song so last night I was listening to Beyonce so I put on Beyonce and then I clicked through all these different options and these are all juicy oh this is moving these are all different sound options and then what I also did is see this one called Liza I customized my own so I chose RMB and then I just kind of changed it a little bit to get the exact amount of base pitch everything that I wanted and then once you choose at whatever you land on last saves and until you change it again it's saved so it was my perfect sound so it was kind of like an all-in-one everything so super duper duper fun I'm very very very happy with my purchase I am excited that when I work out now I don't have cords getting in my way so I am now in the wireless world of earphones next thing that I picked up was floating bluetooth wireless speaker how much fun is that so it says right here floating speaker and that was like a big sales pitch for me which I thought was kind of cool this is the Cristiano Ronaldo collaboration with monster so he's a very very famous soccer player for anyone that does not follow football I should say sorry but this speaker is great it's very pretty and it comes an awesome carrying case and the carrying case is padded so it keeps it a little bit safer and it's just the right size to perfectly fit the speaker and the charger so that you don't lose this because we have so many chargers these days it's nice to kind of have it with the piece of equipment now one thing that was so cool about this is I'm very clumsy okay you watch some of my videos my cooking videos you will see I'm constantly dropping things that is real life for me this is shockproof are you ready oh wait let me turn the music on first that's the speaker first oh my music and play okay so it's playing for my phone there we go now we've got our sound it's a very nice sound as well hey now we can play with this trick so silly okay so it is shockproof and as clumsy lives with us that I am I dropped everything all the time so now ready still going still going so tall the back float and you might have wondered why I have this water sitting beside me while I'm talking about wireless stuff it's because I'm gonna dunk this in water and I'm gonna turn it up in a second so you can hear that it's gonna continue playing so if you have like pool parties or or you're just clumsy like me no worries so here we go so you can sit in your hot tub or whatever and it's gonna do its thing put your down just a little bit okay and then it's not meant to play submerged so this is kind of fun because I don't know about you I like to hear music when I'm in the shower this way I can kind of have it in the shower with me and I can have my music playing or if I want to go and do laps and I'm on vacation or something and bring it to the beach with me so this is a really cool one and the other feature that I really like I'm just gonna leave here the feature that I really really liked was that it has a speaker so if I am chilling at the beach or whatever and you know I've got it in the water with me and I get a phone call and some reason I'm holding my iPhone maybe that's not the best analogy maybe I'm in the shower and it's got air in the bathtub man's got the water going and I want to pick up the phone it has the speaker so it can actually pick up my phone call and I can speakerphone through to right into this without having to touch the phone which is great so makes it again hands-free Wireless all that kind of good stuff so I did love both of these I'm excited to be in the wireless world I hope you guys enjoyed that video on that review if he did give it a thumbs that don't forget to subscribe as well I got all of these toys over at Tom at Best Buy which I will link below they've got a lot of really cool fitness electronic all that kind of stuff as we know it's all like that and I hope you enjoyed that thank you so much I will see you in next week's video peace out bye [Music] [Music]

they're hilarious [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] hey guys I'm Liza Lopez registered Llosa nutritionist and master trainer and I'm here with you very beautiful SMA hourglass girl client and super teeny waist girl look at this weight it's insane and today we're going to talk to you about how to get a tiny waist right like any adds to give it to me okay we're going to talk about how to get a tiny waist with you today and we're going to do it through teaching you how to have an internal corset of abdominal strength that will literally take inches off your waist 100 actually but first let's just do a little bit of Miss dispelling are you ready you ready I don't know what this is whatever what I don't know I'm not retired okay so let's talk about actual corsets that people use which I happen to have two right here just for the sake of showing these okay so this one is one of the ones that you'll see all over social media which is the latex version and this is the one that has like boning in it that is pretty intense and it actually like laces up so these are corsets that you've probably seen a lot I think people with promo code selling them to you saying get a waist legs by selling and fees and they give you their promo code so you can purchase it so let's talk about these for a second and I'm going to give you just my own personal opinion on them and you can further research on your own for whatever you choose to do with it okay so first of all latex versus corset so again this one is boned this one is not going to meaning I can't I can't bend this it has it has thick I can't remember what they're made up to be personally perfectly honest but you can't bend it this one obviously is very bendable it's latex so technically this one will shrink your waist here is the issue I have with that if you were to go on YouTube or somewhere and look for women that do wear these and I like no shade at all whatever people choose to do more power to but just my opinion on health-wise how I feel about these I find a lot of the women that are wearing these yes there ways to smaller but from what I've seen they have to wear it like 20 hours a day minimal so you're like you're wearing it you need to keep pulling it tighter it's restricting the breathing and some of them might die from it at a very young age and you can look this up yourself and see it personally I'm feeling that this is not the ideal situation and again it's not shade do what you want to do in sharing my own health opinion on it this one here which is the latex version that again you kind of see everywhere here's here's the issue I have with this one here at hourglass I have girls that do show up and they'll be wearing it under their clothing and I've had girls almost passed out wearing them and here's a couple of reasons why that might happen one underwear this would cover okay we have our organs they're important when you sweat here's here's a thing when we're working out we sweat part of the reason that we're sweating is it's the whole purpose of sweating pretty much is to cool off the body okay we're hot cooling off the body this is latex so we sweat and we sweat and you're like glue look at all to slow down you there oh yeah but your body's trying to cool off your body is saying I am hot my organs are right here and it's all hot and then you're you're saying that I don't care just do the deal with it I'm just going to make you hotter I don't think that that is necessarily very healthy I think if our body trying to cool itself off I think we should let it and the other thing is when you're sweating off water you're not sweating off fat okay so just keep that in mind when you drink water again back in your body again so you're not actually losing pounds of fat by sweating out water and electrolytes and minerals okay so just kind of know the difference between those things another thing is is that personally me online I have either semis small waist and I am on social media so I get a lot of emails from different waist training companies saying you have a small waist we would like to send you our waist trainer and please say that you use it we will give you the promo code and we will pay you thousands of dollars to do so so mmm I'm not I'm not saying that anyone else is using it and saying that I'm sure lots people might actually be using them and selling them but the fact that they want to ask me to say I use it when I don't and give a promo code it just kind of that was my first concern because I said to them but I've never used your product I did this through Pilates and that was not so much of a concern the next thing is that I find that they'll say a reason to use them as it makes your core stronger okay it strengthens your core it actually does the exact opposite if it acts as your core right so it you put it on and it's holding you up so your abs and low back can say I don't need to work something else is working for me so it's actually making your abs and low back weaker so there's no plant magical I'm not a huge fan of these actually one last thing is when you're working out you're going harder which means you need more oxygen your oxygen needs to get all the way to the body very quickly because we're breathing more quickly so we need more oxygen to get all the vitamins and minerals through the body get all the all the carbon reacts and everything out of the body if we're restricting our breathing and if we can't breathe as deeply because this might be restricting our breathing that's another issue I have because with exercise you need to be able to do that deep breathing so one of the things that a lot of people will put courses on and they think that they need to select in their belly but sometimes other things like food sensitivities that are actually causing you to have loading versus actually having a big way so sometimes something like this can be a bit of a band-aid solution that we're looking for where we're actually should be going and seeing is there something going on in our body where maybe we're having the wrong foods so technically we need to see what's going on inside and try not to do the band-aid solution but I will give you one exception to this rule where I do think some doctors will actually recommend this but it is only the one circumstance so don't get overexcited out there this is for women that have had babies okay and you have something called diastasis directly where your abs have actually separated and they've come apart due to the pregnancy which doesn't happen to all pregnant women but it does happen to some and there as there is doctors that will work with women and have this not as tight as as this one particularly but it says they do put it on and it helps to apply them it back together I don't know technically exactly was doing some not a doctor but I do think it should be doctor supervised and I do think that you should actually be clinically diagnosed with the diastasis directly where the ribs have separate or the piece or the muscles have separated so that's one place where I've seen it actually has been helpful outside of that I don't know I don't believe there is a magic pill but I do think that instead of putting on an external corset you can work your internal corset did you know we have one because we do very exciting we have all of these magic things called abdominals there's a whole bunch down there's the rest we're very used to the breakfast okay which is that that that's it I got a little bit little success living there she does chess we laugh we see all the little ultimen are down and that's the part we're used to seeing is that that's expect but we have this very deep internal abdominal area called the transverse abdominis okay which is amazing and it acts as an internal corset and when I studied Pilates I don't I can't remember how long was like eight years ago or something like that I used the Pilates zip up breathing and I actually cinched my ribs my waist everything in and I lost inches my ribs used to actually flare out because I started training so young and I was doing improperly and it caused my ribs to come out of it from just breathing wrong and training wrong and I taught myself to pull everything back in and I'm doing it right now it's kind of like I say like you know when you're doing like the cables nobody knows it think you can you can applaud like I'm finished right now right so you can just and I do not sound like I'll do it I'll walk down the street and I'm like I'm just going to zip up and I will walk down the street and I'm all zipped up so let's teach you how to zip up and then we're going to teach you specifically how to train the transverse abdominus so you can also sense your waist and also when you learn to do this when you're actually learning how to contract you're learning how to use your abdominal muscles and your transverse abdominis all the exercises you ever do for abs from here on in will be so much harder because you're doing them right which is just throwing yourself around and stand up doing some abs and you're like I don't know strong for my abs aren't for the next day probably not being right okay so let's do try to do it right let's do a little zip up - may are going to do this together we're going to wrap our hands around our ribs yep so fingers here and some is there perfect we're going to take a deep breath in and we're going to make the ribs go wide I'm going to exhale and pull them together blow it all of the air pull it in good and breathe but keep it tight tight tight tight tight yes very tight are you doing it are you doing it move the hands down in line with the belly button now breathe and in Pilates we breathe this way yoga it's more that way okay so we do these differently and this is not a vacuum this is a Pilates if up they are different okay so breathe two into your sides inhale make the sides come out and exhale bring ribs together Shh ribs together belly button tight and you're not like tight you're just you're telling yourself you're giving it a direction of in this way tight tight give it to me give me so now we're going to go right here so cuz there's psi cells right here see right there perchance yes inhale exhale pull this and muscularly pull it in here below there's a pull and drop this down make it as flat as possible everything in is that one more to do is excused against to the generation checks good now the kegels will just go like this you're zipping up like if you had to pee and you're going to not let yourself pee pull up okay so we're going to start ready starting from here inhale and exhale pull together pull together Latin note poke Eagles rep your now is it cold your zip well it is it just Danny are we all doing standing here now my favorite thing I've mentioned this before I like to just walk a block or two and just say okay when I hit that next lock I'm gonna relax okay and then maybe one more time in that dam in Judea and in yep I'm all dis and I'm going to walk again but s may is now going to show you some exercises specifically for the transverse abdominis which is going to cinch and cinch and cinch hopefully permanently for you and you have to do the zip up the whole time who's ready who is ready this is not a real time workout but we will put one out to show you actually a transverse abdominis full workout but right now we're going to show you how to do the move so you know how to do them are you ready ready you excited so she's so excited I still AM hanging wrong that was a powerful one through you so funny okay come on down we're going to start off with dente' done the zip up we're going for plank variations plank is probably the number one exercise people know of for the transverse abdominus okay so get into plank position here are a couple of tips that I like for plank so one she's doing is perfectly neutral spine okay next thing for like a more intense plank yep I like to have the hand right in line and I like to have the elbows right underneath the shoulder and she in the plank position is going to zip up keeping a neutral spine and zipping up now when you're doing things more properly they become ten times as hard good job if all of a sudden you're like I usually will do this for a minute now it's only do 10 seconds you're probably doing it right okay and if you can do it for a minute properly you're amazing so if you're doing a zip up why don't even drop to your knees Esmay keep the bum pulled in yep good putting out do your zip up ribs together bellybutton in flatten out pull the kegels up and hold it and things like ten seconds and then you can relax and then you can do it again and then you can relax so you always want to be thinking about that zip up in your transverse abdominis exercise and feel free to rest any time that you need to but doing these together like cinch it just it just takes off the inches okay so different variations that you can do in plank position I'm just going to like I was going to pop her around if you can see some different things you do can you show me plank crunch so she's going to yep and she's going to contract good so she is doing mean shrimp and neutral the round and neutral okay so we're still working transverse abdominus but we're actually adding some other ab muscles in as well all together good and this is called the plank crunch next thing we're going to do is a push up from the knees okay but staying zipped up because the push-up technically is kind of like a plank moving around and adding some more upper Berlin muscle as well otherwise she's in that nice plank position so she's staying tipped up and she's really thinking about zipping up the entire time but also pushing through the floor and driving the floor together and just getting every yes everything working that's beautiful perfect okay so those are just kind of variations that you can do in plank position but you're always thinking of your zip up okay the next one we're going to show is the flutter kick so she's gonna roll over on her back and we're going to show you with the perfect form for this she's going to put her hands under her bum good now when she does this she is going to lengthen out her legs perfect she's going to slightly curl up now you can do this with your curl up or not or you can keep your head on the floor she's before she starts she's going to first zip up so she's something and exhale together belly button down nice and flat kegels up stretch out the legs and we're going to do this type of thing good so we're working not just the transverse but we're adding some other things into it but the transverse is definitely getting in there and we're spinning and with the waist by really working that transverse and we'd like to get a little lower yeah there you go and I would be zablo crisscross good now she's putting her hands under a bun to protect her back so putting the hands into the bum and then she pushes herself into neutral spine okay perfect let's go on it's an ice-cream truck it is it is a spaceship the next what we're gonna show is dead bug so dead bug she is going to lie down now dead bug is an amazing exercise it is a favorite of a lot of like chiropractors physiotherapists because it works so well but you have to do it properly so here are some things to think about if you do not have back pain you're going to do it in this advanced position that SMA is showing with the legs straight the goal is push your hands into the ball to start so you want to really just feel the proper positioning to really hit the transverse before you start moving then you're going to push your legs into it and you want to do that and really contract your could you feel it super contracture for what you have to be very actively pushing into the ball now pushing into the ball zipping up take opposite hand opposite leg off the ball and bring it down to a hover perfect cover she's still pressing very intensely good and now she's going to switch bring everything up hold and then bring the opposite hand and opposite leg down now focusing through we call it powerhouse and Pilate she's going to push through her hand and foot and bring the opposite hand and leg up now if your lower back does not like this or you don't have the flexibility to get there what you can do is instead bend your knees there you go and you can either and you can suppose and feel pretty come pretty high yep there you go you can either put one foot to tap the floor yep everything through hinging at the hip and the opposite hand comes down yes exactly so you're doing the same movement you're really driving your knee into the ball good and you're really contracting through the core as your low back gets stronger or your flexibility increases you can go into the more advanced position but you still feel this one huh yes it is for everybody perfect okay let's show one more exercise and this is a staple in Pilates called hundred we love the hundred 100 okay so she's going to lie down okay good and what she's going to do we're going to start in a level-one in a lot of Pilates moves we'd have levels like 1 2 3 4 and it gets harder and harder but level 1 is where you want to start even if you're advanced because form is the most important thing in bodies so she is going to reach your arms board and she's going to curl her head and shoulders up the floor it's important that her spine stays neutral so she needs to push her chin back in and let your head kind of fall back a little bit keep falling keep falling until you get my hand and push your chin back there it is woo that's a pretty neutral sign right there can we hold it though gut and that slight curl up she's going to contract and zip up and now we're going inhale 2 3 4 5 and exhale let me hear you breathe and and Shh I really like to hear the breathing and let them hear you boo boo hood ok and the breathing is always be inhale 2 3 4 5 and exhale 2 3 4 5 notice what she's not doing is she's not coming forward and it's very this is still and it's coming at a hinge at the shoulder ok she can from here go to level 2 okay so we're going to go straight straight legs up and continue and I'm just going to move her three levels good and then we're going to go to bent knee and you want to have those knees slightly in front of the hips which is really important there's a huge difference between this and even just the slight couple of inches where this is like so easy right and as soon as I do this you're like no okay now give me more pulses boom boom boom boom neutral spine add foot in so mean assuming and then the last and hardest one is right down here and we continue and we curl up and these are our hundreds which are awesome cinching movement doesn't feel good it feels so good and that

hey guys I'm Liza Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm here to show you probably the most requested video that I've ever got which is how do I train my bouquet at home so I'm going to show you right now guys we're going to do about five different exercises I require a little bit of weight but if you don't have them yet I'm also going to show you some really great form and I'm going to show you right now so here we go we're going to start off with the ankle weights this is how I'm going to activate my glutes what does that mean after dating your glutes is an amazing thing to do before you do any glute training day because if you go right into glutes if you do squats or something like that and you haven't pre activated your quads or different areas might take over so you're not actually getting the same glute workout that you think that you're getting there's a ton of different exercises that you can do with the ankle weights these are five pounders you can get them as far as I've seen all the way up to 20 pounds always making sure your core is engaged your abs are pulled in and you can do these ones which are just basically your what do they call it again just kickback donkey kicks you can also do it with a straight leg okay you can do circles you can do fire hydrants can either there's so much you can do the main thing that you need to do when you're doing this exercise is contract okay what does that mean just quickly making sure that you understand just lifting like this so it's very little just with doing a bicep curl like this is very little you must contract your biceps same thing as you must pull your abs in and contract your glutes at the top of every single rep I added just a few more enjoyed and now it gets a little bit more like booty building with this extra weight now you only want to add extra weight if your low back is strong enough and of course if your glutes are strong enough because you don't want to be like throwing it and stuff like that because then you can actually hurt your back instead of building your bumbum here it at hourglass we actually have a challenge that we do with with my girls of who can do the heaviest and quit cake back now I haven't tried this weight yet let's count see what we got here we've got 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 okay so we got 50 pearlized right here I'm going for the challenge I'm basically wearing a person on my legs right now here we go since I can't add to my sanity recovering my knee I got this guy's I got it oh yeah no problem give me another 50 come on now okay now I would bend my knee but I can't because there's an ankle weight like behind my knee anyways I don't recommend this if you have not a strong low back but if you do it's pretty fun challenge okay guys the next exercise I'm going to show you is the kettlebell deadlift I'm going to get a slightly heavier or at least a heavier of the three you want to have your feet just a little bit wider than shoulder-width I like to put my feet at a natural angle core is engaged super strong I like to hold on to the kettlebells first then I'm going to drive my glutes away to push my weight into my heels again keep it shirt be sure that my core is strong I like to actually pull on the kettlebells a little bit until I feel my hamstrings and my glutes engaged once I feel that engagement then I'm actually going to do a hinge at the hips boom forward what you don't want to do is think lift my chest okay as soon as you think that lifts my chest you're going right into your lower back so thanks pull on the weight engage the core engage the glutes the hamstrings well dressed dive down exhale get it down exhale make sure two things sink on the way here before you start your stretching on the way up you're flexing I want to pretend this is like your dining room chair okay you know you so designer now if you're going to try it on a chair just make sure it is propped ups against something so it is very sturdy we don't want you to put your back on it and it goes sliding and so do you safety first the good place to try hips dress is on a couch it's on in bed basically what I want to do is I want to get kind of for the ladies around bra strap area for the fellas just kind of below your scapula area which would like those chicken bone looking things that come out of your back we're not lower our glutes to the floor my knees are just um about shoulder width wide and I'm going to power up okay and I want to ask tail and contrastive loose to the top of the movement core is strong I'm going to control my eccentric space which means my way down I'm going to flex up now if you don't have weights guys there is ways around this are you ready ready to magic lift one leg it becomes like to have a big weight on you're coming either like doesn't matter you just kind of find your balance pin so much fun it makes it so much harder if you decide to do this you're cheating it kind of makes it way easier you that leg must be in the air that move is great because it works like without getting too graphic on you know YouTube right Oh Jim then they love your bone it also gets right into the hamstrings and helps you get that double pumped because it's not just about this hump it's really about that hump - we're going to grab one of the heavier ones that we used for the eye deadlift and I'm just going to hold this on my hip I'm just going to slide on out and I can do the exact same movement and now I've added weight well now when you get back up just for safety you always want to get back up that way versus what I see please don't do this and just just because I see it all the time from newbies and I'm going to risk my knees just for you just so you don't risk your knees people do this I don't know why but I teach classes for hundreds of girls that is the most common thing make sure guys that you're able to slide back up prop yourself up properly and get out of that safely the next exercise I'm going to show you is squats and I know everyone knows how to squat but I'm still just going to throw my two cents in there just to give you a little you know at work last booty FY and squats I think that squats is not only a booty exercise it is an abdominal exercise and if it is not a abdominal excess for you it means personally I don't think you're doing it right okay you need to contract your core think about your heels okay you want your whole foot engaged but you want to focus into your heels right now because it's going to help connect to your posterior chain and then the first thing we want to do before we start is kind of rip the floor apart that way okay so stand up and do this if you stand up and steal the floor now tear it apart and I think you will feel this engage before you started moving okay core engage keep the chest up keep the shoulders back rip the floor apat keep your knees in line with your second toe as you come down now think about your glutes and start to fire back up and squeeze them in okay so notice I'm not throwing back I'm not sticking out I'm not dropping forward those are all things that you want to stay away from once you can do that then you get to add weight until you can do that properly and feel good about it no wait for you okay and you're how can I get the video booty without the more weight okay you could use these all day you're going to get nice toned legs and all that kind of good stuff as you're eating right but we need to wait I'm going to keep my core engage abs in my weight is in my heels and ripping out floor get my squat now I can also do it in a goblet squat style like this and to learn French this helps to counterbalance so this is a great way to build out not just a bun keep in mind the entire leg it's going to hit slot to hand the glutes to add the lower back it is a compound movement it's an excellent moving to see a little bit out of breath after doing Cup squats so many muscles involved so much activation everywhere and that's how you do a proper squat I'm going to show you walking lunges now which I adore you want to make sure your back heel is off the floor I would have my newbies hold on to something sturdy okay and then focus into your front heel focus into your back toe with your heel lifted and slowly lower down like an elevator thinking to your heel focus onto your hamstring in your glute and fire up using the hamstring in the glute the reason I like to do that first is because I'll have girls in class sometimes and they're doing a walking lunges and I'll say to them where do you feel it majority of the time if they haven't learned properly they're feeling it in this one I think a lot of you as such we're doing a booty workout want to be focusing here and here so you have to make sure you do some stationary ones first find your hamstrings and roots before you start your walking lunge just when I'm even doing a walking lunge I don't just Prince along like a lot of people do every single step is focused I'll take my step out I will stop I will lower and think about the muscle and I'll power through the muscle to make sure that I'm using exactly where I want to use proper form then we add weights here we go I step I stop focus into my heel feel the hamstring power together I step my stop focus into the hamstring power together that's probably my favorite way to do it when I'm going very heavy if I'm going lighter I might add some fancy things okay I might add a glute squeeze behind angry squeeze so I might go stop lunge lunge in step plunge plunge in so I call those doubles they're very fun depending on what you plan is I think they're fun but those are some fun ways to do walking lunges but again proper lunges first my muscle connections then add the weight then you get the booty it's just like that so guys I hope you enjoyed the home training workout for the bum bum I bought a video if you want to click right here I've got a video called I want abs and booty I know it's helped out a lot of girls on just kind of having a better understanding of how to make the glutes grow what are the issues may be barriers

hi I'm Liza buck Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and today I'm going to show you how to make egg muffins so I'm going to start by setting the oven to 375 degrees next I'm going to put my bacon onto the baking tray and put it into the oven but I'm only going to cook it halfway while that's baking I'm going to spray my muffin tins with Iggy coconut mix now I'm going to crack the eggs put them into the bowl but I'm also going to add my egg whites to that bowl as well let's add a dash of pepper I'm going to beat the entire mix together until it's smooth I love jalapenos depending on how spicy you want it you can do 1 to 2 jalapenos for this recipe you want to chop it up pretty small because you're going to take all of it and you're going to put it evenly throughout all of the muffin tin so each one gets just a little bit of spice or a lot now I'm going to slice up my green onion and again I want to slice it small enough that I can distribute that green onion throughout all of them up in trades now for some spinach I love spinach so I like to go pretty hard on this and add quite a bit so we're going to add a good chunk of spinach into each Cup now that we've got our veggies in we're going to pour the egg mixture and again evenly distributing throughout all of the cups and then take out the bacon only half cooked I'm going to slice that up so that I can sprinkle it again over each muffin cup just on top of the egg mixture next we place it into the oven and wait for it to bake roughly 20 to 25 minutes later we have beautiful delicious high-protein low-carb vegetable filled egg muffins guys they're so good you want to let them cool once they're cooled by in and I promise you they are to die for don't forget sriracha so we're going to start this recipe by using a yogurt I like to use a lactose free Greek yogurt because it's very high in protein but it's easier on the stomach if you're vegan you can of course use a vegan over you're going to measure this out and add it to your small blender 
so I've got my stage makeup on and I'm getting ready to go to the carnival lunch to jump up welcome to caravan Oh lunch I'm going to walk you guys through what it is for some of you that are new to this um basically here in Toronto we have something called caravana Caribana is a Caribbean festival and it's similar to les Trinidad Carnival or Brazil Carnival they're all kind of you know um awesome we jump up we're called masqueraders and we wear the costumes and this is my feathers right here that I'll be wearing on stage or my backpack and it's just a really fun celebration there's soca music playing and this is this is me practicing my stage walk with my big-ass feathers but basically and what the lunch is is the launch is the showing of the costumes for all of the potential masqueraders so I'm showing a sell Deena costume here this is a front-line costume and I'm doing my little stage walk to show it off that's obviously not the costume is just the feathers were just taken in the stage and but I'm there it's all Hourglass girls pretty much in this section and and yeah we're showing this costumes so so there's lots of fun and silliness that happens backstage and there's all my girls and the audience and I was showing you Michelle's picture there because each year there's a theme and our trucks theme for each truck and in our truck our theme was Michelle Montano who was a very famous singer from Trinidad and so each each costume has a different song so our song was big fat fish which was a very popular song from Michelle so we'll be walking out to that this is my girl ask Cindy right here my little sister what we call each other that people get ass next up and my friend Tyrone no nibbles a notary yes Stacey's comment there was a very real thing the abroad they gave me was like a size or two is too small so we were concerned that there might be some light flashing the audience anyways we're backstage we're getting ready to go on stage it's always like a mass of color bad stages we wait to go on and there's the audience these things get fat like basin's gets sold out no joke and this is our little group here going on stage they'll let you watch so this is one of the number-one soapy teachers in the world dr. J all right but um so anyway so this is just a really fun time we all go dance on stage everybody gets to see the costumes and decide which ones they want to get each band has their own lunch and again it's just the mobbin for it and then the actual jump up on the streets happens later it is so much fun and any culture can come out and come celebrate so this is like a very inclusive like everyone that stands together jump up together Oh 
one arpeggio everybody we're here to show us three great exercises to build an hourglass figure everyone please welcome fitness expert Liza Beth Lopez the hourglass figure because it's becoming so popular in Hollywood everyone said right so shape now I'm so happy that it's popular now look at you you've got the perfect hourglass figure am I right about that right Marilyn Monroe I mean she's the classic the classic Jennifer Lopez was my like I looked up to her like wow yeah yeah she's got the ultimate color gloss spray Germans probably like a lot of people ask you now how do I get that hourglass figure and you're gonna go through some exercises so that we can all get it I'm like you look like Jennifer Lopez when we finish this at this exercise mmm right now you know we'll cute in the button okay come back you've knit a lot okay so what's the first one we're gonna do but I'm going to show you is we're gonna start with the shoulders and I know we think immediately the but yeah but there's illusions that we need to create for the full hourglass shape so let's different ways so you won't cut you want the shoulders okay once the late does it better look at them pipes young nation we're going to hit all three head to the shoulders front middle and back okay so we're gonna go up to the side okay off to the side okay they're gonna take it to the front I already hurt ya okay yeah okay can you take a backup now squeezed backwards to hit the rear delts yeah and bring it back down it's a little more challenging so this is what this is this is creating a broader shoulder well what's this gonna do is it's gonna give us a nice rounder broader shoulder which is gonna make the waist look smaller illusion so there's a contrast that's happening here so how many of these do you do and you do them every day well you wouldn't I would do shoulders maybe twice twice a week yeah and I would do maybe six exercises for the shoulder six different exercises maybe show them all with ease and you're just gonna let her wait okay yeah later but remember especially for the ladies out there don't be afraid of a little bit of weight because that's how you build sighs okay want a bit of size on the shoulder to make this look smaller the contrast is what was good right you want to go for this do wider shoulders into a slim waist okay okay the hurt right okay baby now that our shoulders are they yeah now the waist I know we were talking about the waist we want to pull it in there's some X's we want to avoid okay because we can just like the bicep you know here to do have you eights here your bicycle grows yes there's things that can make this wider okay that's a no-no for everybody let me know let me know that you have this not not a fan I'm not a fan I feel like it's gonna block us out just a little bit okay right so we're gonna stick to things that are either forward pulling and cinching like Pilates yes okay so quickly before we start any ABS just quickly yeah hands on the ribs anyone in the audience from their sleep you want to yeah lunch your ribs to wrap the thumbs around the back take a deep breath in now exhale pull your up Steelers snowfield that I pull the belly button in now pull up shoot now take away the hands and hold this shape this is what we do people like magic of the bathroom yeah okay that's that's the feeling you want right to feeling we want yeah we haven't started the exercise yet not done yet I'll do these huh yeah do you think with me we're gonna pull the church articles can you decide on one second I need to embarrass somebody in the audience can here follow me look at this guy's eyes he is on her I saw you okay these are glad eNOS I love a leader travel toys I travel with them always you travel with these toys

hey guys I'm Liza basilica's Regis's holistic nutritionist and master trainer and today I'm going to show you some heart rate training some awesome hit training and I just got a brand new spin bike I'm very excited to break in and show you we've got to put it together really quickly so ready perfect so here is my brand new bike at the average left four goats to do ah so I want to show you an emotion to my heart flutter hold on it's over there [Music] today I'm very excited to show you some great training now why do I like uh tree training because I find one when we go to the gym we can tend to think we're going ham but we may not be and this gives you a little bit of a challenge civility because if you have a heart rate monitor strapped to you it will tell you if you're going ham or not okay there will be no second guessing so let me describe hold on the grab it it is a puller heart rate monitor strap I'm used to wearing the watch one so I'm going to tell you how you use it doesn't playing a little bit so basically what it does is it connects to your phone it connects to the app which is the polar beat you just take that off this is a battery operated so I just kind of twist that pop a battery in and it's good to go and then this part where the connectors are okay right there this I just need to wet it first okay and then I pull the shit up and I apply it right there tap this on so let's just do that really quickly so now my water bottle we poke some holes in it because we're all ingenious and stuff okay so now which is what you need to make sure the polar side is up so we are going to make sure that it's on the skin pop this on so I'm all connected so I'm going to go into my app which I've got right here so this is my polar beat app which is going to connect wirelessly through bluetooth and right now it's set to running I'm clearly doing indoor biking so it's going to hit that little plus button and I'm going to find they're cycling I want indoor cycling did I get but right here I'm going to want to stick between four and five okay so about 85 to 95 percent is what I want to do for hit for ultimate fat burning so I'm going to put this down for now I'm going to get on to my brand-new bike okay because I can still see it from the floor now what I would want to do if I was doing bicycle hit training for kind of that ultimate fat burn I'm just going to be a little cycle and get a little warm as we chitchat and I'm not going to fold up for you but what I like to do is 30 seconds everything you got 100% 110 instant I need 5% and then I'll take a full minute to a minute and a half rest and then do it again you can go all the way up even three minutes rest okay have something in mind that you want to do if you're newer you might need a little bit more time you might need up to three minutes own if you're a little bit more advanced and you want to let push it a little harder you can do a minute-to-minute a half off but each time you go into that maximum 30 seconds you want to be working at that 85 to 95 percent zone so once you do it I like to need two different cells I like to do either sitting on it right here and I can also put my hands on these as well and I can read it right off the bike or I can look down there so I like you to do any here fast as I can or I like to put my hands all the way up here push my glutes back chest up and go really really ham right here notice my upper body is not moving that much it's all happening here those are the two different ways that I like to do this so here's the next thing skinny girls versus thick girls has to be choose how hard you should go catch the rest for my thin girls that want to put size on to their legs I would say turn it up so with a plus sign go through I call it going through mud okay when it's so intense that even though you're going fast you're literally really really pushing through that mud zone and trying to get yourself up to that eighty-five to ninety-five percent for the thirty seconds of work each for my girls they're a little bit thicker and don't want to add sighs turning it down and we want to go faster so we're still getting our heart rate to that 85 to 95 percent but we're doing it differently even though it's cardio and it's not like deep heavy squats it can still change the size of your life you can still add muscle or not so you want to think about that as me as as that thick girl I would do that really really really fast so get into that same heart rec zone your Center you want to go through that mud still sitting hitting the same heart rate zone and you'll enjoy your results probably a little bit more now you probably do this 5 to 7 set ok so that 30 seconds on that rests of 1 to 3 minutes 5 to 7 times and that is your cardio workout and then you are done how many times did you do this week I believe in rotating different things so maybe you do this for one of your hip sessions maybe do the treadmill or outdoors for another one of your sessions you can kind of play and it really does depend on your goals and how often you're doing hits or how often you're doing cardio so you want to kind of look at that in your goal I find the best time to do this is first thing in the morning fasted or if your goal is straight fat loss maybe you do this before your weights workout if your main goal is muscle gain maybe you do this after your workout or you could separate it to this in the morning weights later it just depends on what you're able to commit to the gym but that's kind of how I would play with it I hope that that helps out a little bit I hope you guys try a little heart rate zone training to keep you honest with your training and how hard you're actually going as I said I got I got all these toys I got to my best buy that's PA I've been doing a lot of shopping there they have a ridiculous amount of fitness stuff which is fun I've linked them below if you do want to check it out I hope you guys enjoyed it and if you try it let me know in the comments below and like the video to show some love I will see you in next week's video peace out bye guys [Music] where [Music]

hey guys I'm Liza buck Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm going to share literally my favorite juice it's called the kiwi cucumber I would actually almost call it youth juice this is a slow press juicer which means I'm also going to be able to put it into a little jar like this and keep that juice for about three days and it'll still maintain a lot of nutrient value so get ready now what's so great about Swiss chard is one it's one of the healthiest green vegetables on the entire planet if you're going to have it raw you wouldn't usually have the stems but the stems have a huge amount of nutrients and just like this I'm just gonna put a man off they go these are red grapes and one of the things that I love about red grapes is that they have a nutrient called resveratrol now resveratrol is anti-cancer and anti-aging and it's in the skin of the grapes so I would say try to get organic when you eat grapes usually you're not gonna eat the stem that would be that weird but when we're doing juicing we can actually juice the stem with the grapes and it actually has amazing nutrient values as well so let's get those grapes and that stem in there here we go pop them all in there goes the stem too next we're gonna do some pineapple pineapple is great guys pineapple has again just one cup it's your vitamin C for the full day and vitamin C is literally a beauty food sunflower sprouts now I love sunflower sprouts especially for my vegans out there this is a really good thing to add because 25 percent of its mass is protein a lot of us are low in iron as well so it's a good source of iron Kiwis are you ready for why you should be eating them it's actually really exciting so Kiwis just in this little fruit they've got five times the amount of vitamin C is orange juice they've got two times the amount of vitamin E of avocado and you see those little seedlings in there that actually taste really good they have omega-3 fatty acids which is again hair skin nails all that kind of good stuff just amazing for you they're gonna add such a great flavor to this juice yeah okay so I have an apple but it's not going to fit so I actually need a cutting board right now and maybe a nice butt okay here we go thank you it's magic I tell you it's magic so we're gonna spice up his awesome apple generally when I'm doing apples I'm going to keep the stem in I'm probably not going to juice the seeds now also I'll say some of the things that I love about the Apple is not only is it sweet it is rich in insoluble and soluble fiber now when we're juicing we're actually we're juicing out the insoluble fiber that means we're going to absorb it really we're going to absorb all those nutrients really quickly which is great and it's part of the amazingness of juicing last the cucumber of the Kiwi cucumber sweet juice it's a little mini slice and drop that in now the cucumber it gives it a really nice smooth kind of taste to it but it also is super hydrating and it's also going to help detoxify us but look I forgot my stem I want to put that apple stem into my juice don't miss those nutrients juice right here let's have some okay there we go so I try to have some type of green juice every single day if you don't have a juicer you can do a blender like a good blender would be great as well it's almost like what caffeine does for some people I feel as what juice does for me if you do try this recipe and you love it which you will please post in the comments below let me know what you thought also we're posting recipes and fitness stuff and lifestyle stuff on the channel all the time please subscribe below and like the video as well share with your friends and come back and I will see you in the next video peace out and go enjoy my cheese this one is a great exercise to really build out those glutes and those hamstrings without thickening out the thighs and again this is how you can get heavier so you can really add some bulk to your bumbum this exercise I'm going to show you is awesome and it's an isolated exercise which I do like 
I look fat yeah I'll be a part of it hi now I'm blog not a snapchat oh really so she's getting me a set up and I have makeup on right now I guess I wasn't going to show you me with no makeup your beautiful skin whatever today we're doing micro bleeding and what that means is she senator actually why don't you tell them what that means and dermaplaning-- is a pretty intense exfoliation of the skin and it just helps to get rid of all the surface on fellas hair and dead skin cells so that when you put your products on they become more absorbent abscissa mean but what it looks like guys it's like a blade that she like just says that and takes with the top layer of skin off yes these surgical blade use a new blade every time obviously absolutely against redoing the oxygen today oh yes nice and clear yeah so I'm going to do the vitamin C plus three oxygen just to help to promote collagen building skin brightening and also deep hydration existence sounds good to me make me look 10 years younger and stay there so using oil-based cleanser for first clen because you should always cleanse your skin twice you want to make sure you get off all that surface dirt and oil so the benefits of an oil based cleanser are that oil actually attracts oil like water water and oil don't mix so water Clint water-based cleansers can break it down but it would usually take like a few cleanses to really get all of that off the skin oil based cleanser just breaks through and liquefies all that makeup on the skin can really see how it was just great keep doing all the makeup and I'll show you the pad doctor I don't know if they need to [Laughter] when I do the second cleanse you'll see like how important it is to conjure skin northern woods says it's number two this is number two feels like an exfoliant it's slightly exfoliating because I really want to make sure that like all the surface dirt and oil is off because I want the dermaplaning to be really effective I like this ha ha ha [Music] your version appeal is different [Music] isn't it fun oh my god crazy so did you see that like skin here everything don't mind me crystal you can geek wanted like a you want okay for me it like paves the way for everything else to work better so like even when you do your glycolic peels or you do your other treatments like this is going to make the glycolic to be able to penetrate better because it's not going through all this surface Bella's hair and you guys seem a snatched brows right now I'm the same I have no product on it just the derma blade [Music] if you want to really help your skin with aging hilar and gases give it to me yeah I learned when you when you hear that like a low/medium or a highway is telling you how deep into the skin it's going to go so with the oxidant treatment that we do we do a layering specifically in a less dirty I'm going to be spraying a low weight hyaluronic acid on and then I'm going to be using the oxygen to actually push it into the skin down to the lower levels and then I'm going to be putting a medium weight which is going to sit in the mid levels and then a high weight which is going to the top level and then it locks everything in so it's cool clear you probably already see like how much like brighter the skin is getting just from means how much spray can you take them off yeah that's the other benefit of dermaplaning-- is because you take off all this white Vallot air it actually makes your face look more naturally contoured because white it right like in makeup when you use light colors it actually makes things stand out more so when you have this white hair here it makes this stand out more so when you take it off it makes it like sucking more and that's that this is a combination hydration vitamin C mask masks are a great way to get nutrients to the skin like immediately so they're usually high concentration formulas you can do mask click anywhere from one to three times a week oh really yes okay so some you can do more like if you're like especially the hydration map like I'll tell people in the winter time just a combat like all the indoor heating and stuff to use like a hydrating mask every night oh wow yeah every night yeah for like at least a week or so especially in Canada because we're constantly walking in too my eye looks like walking into like minus 22 and then 30 degrees minus 20 and Thursday right and your skin is just get that all the hydration get sucked out of it so drinking water is awesome but drinking water is not going to keep your skin hydrated through the day I also recommend because this hydrating mask is a gel mask like I've mixed in a vitamin C so that's what's giving it more of a white cast but on its own it's clear so for my frequent travellers I would say put like a layer of this on while you're on your flight I don't know it will help to buffer your skin and keep it hydrated I noticed a lot of people are wearing those have you seen those funny looking masks where they look like on the sheet mask cuz she met me what do you think of Phyllis Arthur they're good I kind of find it waist well just like could be throw it out yeah I'm like because there's lots of really good mask so you can just put on and leave on in your skin and they're going to America and absorb like okay so as far as the planet it's kind of like she should be a lemon ice to the planet kid like if you got like a nice like really biodegradable zone that for sure okay cheer that companies make some Microsoft though okay so we've got the masks and what is happening after the mask oh so I'm going to do some extractions so the reason I put this mask on on was to add some hydration to the skin because when the skin is dehydrated it's really hard to do extraction so for all those people who want to come in and say extract me well a good way to prepare for that is to like hydrate hydrate for like a good week like you should hydrate all the time but if you're going to come in for a treatment like hydrate for like really well for a good week and then I'll be able to pop all those no really easily yeah so it's like actually super frustrating for me when I can't possum of hell so please hydration system that member them what you want to feel like good hydrated skin feels just nice and cool and do and it should feel spongy to the touch especially after German pleating yay we have popping new stuff right now I am I'm not fun to watch I don't know everybody seems to watch that dr. pimple popper no stop is there such a thing you didn't know no I did not know about this is phenomenon I don't see anything coming out but maybe my camera's not like HD enough probably because my bifocals here are totally everything [Laughter] seon-ah strong so much information [Laughter] getting oxygen now and we're chatting signs just relative geology so I'm I'm an Aquarius but on the last day of Aquarius from the 17th also your arm braids into Pisces so does that mean I'm part bye see ya Oh like if just it means you're kind of like like it's like a little bit of an ombre effect so if you definitely have more of a Piscean influence and somebody do it be like right in the middle of a of Aquarius so [Music] we're doing the oxygen treatment so this is that low weight high line of geckos talking about by having an airbrush machine and I put the therm in here and what I'm doing is I'm spraying it on the skin and then I'm using the Aqsa machine to actually like pushing it yeah so notice how much brighter the side of the face is compared to the side of the face what we're doing here is we're using ingredients that are actually helping to stimuli collagen production your collagen is what gives your skin its firmness and then with the microcurrent lift you can also stimulate the muscles so actually like it's like quality through day yeah and you like weight lifting for your face like why am I not doing this I don't know I think you might have just forgot about it so where does the hi-hi ramallah Chiron elect hyaluronic Duran attacks have come from that was years of practice I didn't know I should say that on a really long time ago they used to get it from roosters crowns Wow okay hey guys oh yeah if they don't get it from there anymore well nowadays I'm pretty sure they do it in a laboratory okay all the products that we use are totally cruelty free we do know it use anything that tested on animals or that is made from animals community theft vitamin C is one of the best preventative ingredients so there's all right there's about five ingredients that you should use for a continual repair of the skin on vitamin C vitamin A hyaluronic acid SPF that's an anti-aging ingredient and EGF is really good because that actually helps to grow the skin what kind of mask is going on now I'm actually going to use Mpho mask this is a new mask from derma quest okay yeah it's plant-based stem cells and plant-based themselves are amazing for strengthening and lengthening the life of our own stem cells and they can actually actually have the power to heal and repair our damaged stem cells as well so stem stem cells are the cells that lasts longest are at the bottom level of the skin and they grow on the daughter cells so if you've paid attention in biology classes called mitosis I've never - all right I remember I need Maxon now and then she's going to give me that iron massage so you guys will go away because I'll just relax and chill yeah she gave it to me hydrated and Chloe yeah put the hydration gel which is what has your medium weight hyaluronic acid so it basically creates like a river for the hyaluronic acid underneath to keep grabbing from so it keeps you nice and pumped up all day and then now I'm just putting on the moisturizer to seal everything in also very important after this treatment to like you should be wearing SPF all the time I don't care if it's winter because we get UVA rays all year round and the thing you should know about what the a stands for JJJ sunrise in anti-aging I knew that right UVB burning UVA aging and UVC cancer but we don't get that nigga at in Australia oh yeah yeah I think is they have a hole in the ozone layer so that's why they have high rates of that's actually how long intra suitable oxygen treatment happens it's actually from a

fan gear please I will come back okay that's it 
hey guys I'm lies about Lopez registered to Lucic nutritionist and master trainer I'm going to talk to you about the 10 worst healthy foods out there are you ready as we do this we're going to talk about one that is not so healthy of a health food and then we're going to go into a healthier alternative okay so first thing that we're going to talk about is energy drink so with energy drinks I know that we think that like even just in the title energy like it sounds great right and really at the end of the day it's just kind of glorified soda with extra caffeine and maybe a little b12 added to make it sound good on the label so this is a healthy espresso now one thing that I liked about the espresso is that it is high in antioxidants but you just want to kind of think with these things that is everything in moderation so you want it if you're one of those like six cups a day person that would not be moderation just FYI coffee is one of the most sprayed plants in the planet okay so you really want to make sure that you're buying organic and if you're okay with having just some energy that will last you through the day without the boom and the BAM that is sometimes even with coffee something like a matcha green tea is also a great option now what I love about matcha green tea again with the antioxidants this one has even more antioxidants so the next on the list is microwave popcorn now microwave popcorn you look at it and you'll you'll read it and you'll be kind of mystified by oh my god it's only like 99 calories in a whole bag and it's it's fiber and all this kinds of good stuff in it it sounds like it's a really good healthy treat but at the end of the day once you put in that kind of microwave packaging for the popcorn it is not I'm just the packaging alone actually is full of chemicals to keep oil from coming out of the bag and when you take the popcorn out and you look at what's left in the bag it's it's kind of nasty it's you know a lot of chemicals and stuff and then on top of it you throw it into the microwave and then you've got even more issues because what happens when you put things in a microwave you nuke them you have destroyed most of the value of that food but you can still enjoy popcorn this is a nice non-gmo organic popping corn you can put it into your air popper which cost like 20 bucks generally at at any store and then you can put really fun ingredients on top of it you can use like a raw whole butter or a ghee if you want to you can some sea salt you can put some cinnamon hot sauce you can make it into a great snack which is full of fiber and it is very low-calorie and you can still enjoy your popcorn so my next offender is diet soda and I know a bunch of you're like no because some people are like diet soda addicts if you look at the ingredients and you probably can't read or recognize anything on it because it's mostly chemical just keep in mind that when fake sugar kind of aspartame came to the market at that time the FDA all the sudden was like just so many calls on headaches tumors brain like brain disorders we have something called the brain blood-brain barrier and it's supposed to keep things out of our brain but the molecules in it are so small that they're actually able to get past it instead of doing that I'm going to show you something that can actually be healthy for you and it's very very yummy this is kombucha I don't want to shake it if I my tactually explode that's a real thing I'm not kidding because it's a it's fermented it's under pressure when you open it a little tidbit for you you might want to do it over a sink some things that might freak you out okay just for you soda drinkers because this is not in soda there's something called the mother and it's a little bit I don't turn you off of it I'm afraid to tell you this there so it's a little bit funny okay but it's really good for you the first time I had it and I drank it I Vil like that just at the slimy part the rest of it is absolutely delicious am i selling you on it yet um so you can actually probably make it yourself I might even do a video for you on it it's actually very gut friendly it is full of probiotics I know that if you and me even if you don't know what that means you've heard the buzz word by hearing about yogurt and all these kinds of things it's great for your gut helps with the flat belly it helps with your immunity it helps your skin it helps us so many things so my number four on the list is actually already low-fat muffins low-fat muffins I know a lot of you might kind of get up in the morning and think I'm gonna go and get a coffee and a low fat muffin and you know what you're actually saying in your brain you're saying I'm really tired so I'm going to have caffeine sugar so don't get it twisted low-fat muffins still means cake okay they're probably the same ingredients at the end of the day actually if you go and look at like look up your favorite coffee shop or whatever and you if you're able to find the macro breakdown so the macronutrients calories fat protein all stuff of a doughnut there and your favorite low fat muffin the donut might be better muff and as far as calories one of the things that you can do instead of this low fat muffin is power balls I have these amazing antioxidant rich amazing amazing did I say amazing protein balls and we actually already made them and they're on this YouTube channel and I'm gonna link it just in the description box below a link where you can make them and honestly I've got people all over the web saying I tried it my kids love it I'm addicted so your chin should go try it number five on the nono list is margarine and I know by all the commercials that you watch on TV you think it is the most heart-healthy thing out there would be incorrect okay it is a man-made product they have kind of injected hydrogen into it trying to make it a more stable fat instead they created trans fat tada so instead of going for the man made option let's just go for the real-deal option and that is ghee or butter now ghee is clarified butter and in India it's actually considered medicinal it's like one of their super foods as so it also has a very high smoke point what does that mean it means if you're doing very intense high heat cooking as something like a raw butter or a ghee are much better options and actually have some good benefits to it where this is a little bit of nutrient in it and for those of you that have problem with dairy they are lactose free so just changed your whole life so number six is fruit juice fruit drink whatever you want to call it fruit drink just I'm not even say that much about it it is not a food okay it is just sugar in water and flavor so if it doesn't say juice then run away in the other direction do not give it to your children if it says fruit juice here's the thing some of them are okay there are like high pressure and you know fruit juices which are cold-pressed or hyper though those are those are decent but you want to have at least at the end of the day especially if you're trying to be healthy you want to have vegetable juice maybe with some fruit in it so I'm going to show you my cold press juicer come with me over here to that this is my cold pressor and the reason that I did one that cold press is because when I juice that means it will last about anywhere from from 1 to a max of 3 days I really try to have it same day or next day but because it's cold-pressed I can do that if it wasn't a cold press and it was just a regular juicer I would have to have it within about 20 minutes of juicing it to keep all of the natural enzymes so all right so I think that the next one might actually surprise you brown sugar okay so when we're choosing sugar you might think for my sugar good option I'm going to choose brown sugar and I think for the most part you would be incorrect you have to read the label and see that it can contains so it contains the natural molasses still otherwise I promise you if you go buy some white sugar packets and some brown sugar packets and you compare the label they're the same I actually like sucanat okay what is sucanat sucanat is really just where they took the sugar cane and they just dried it okay and then BAM this is what you have it's so much more delicious than either of their like regular brown sugar or the white sugar brands sugar actually has a lot of vitamins in it including vitamin B which is really important when you're having sugar that is lacking its natural vitamin B so it's not this it's kind of more refined one what happens is when you eat it you need to find vitamin B in the body to actually process it and break it down so it's going to steal maybe from your bones or something like that to have that vitamin B to break down the sugar and then we end up with more brittle bones and so on and disease make sure that you are getting a natural sugar so you're getting the fiber you're getting the molasses you're getting vitamin B okay so number eight is and I know you kind of knew this was coming is all of your little fake sugar options so when you go to the coffee shop or whatever and you're choosing your zero calorie sweetener I'm not going to name any of them but pretty much all of them let's just say that our zero calorie except for the one I'm about to mention are on the nono list we don't know once you taste the sweet what's actually happening of your body if it's really as good as just zero calories when your body feels sweet there is a reaction in there so it may not be the weight loss food that you think it is there is still another zero calorie option and that is stevia so this is our stevia right here and stevia is made from stevia leaf whereas the other ones are made by playing with removing aminos and moving around aminos and a lot of the coffee shops are now carrying stevia packets and if they don't how easy is it for you to just carry a little stevia packet in your purse or something like that so next up we're talking about bread I'm so sorry I'm so sorry even if you had Ken have gluten I don't feel it like it should be a regular thing in your diet I used to have a bread problem okay that's a real thing I used to want to have bread every single day like I would I slowly moved from bread down to what I'm going to show you which is Ezekiel it is sprouted so what does that mean is it's it's a little bit easier to digest when you sprout grains you're basically kind of washing away a toxin on it that makes it harder for us to digest so that goes away and it also makes it more nutrient-dense okay so the nutrients are a little bit better in it it's a little bit easier to digest if you're gluten free you still should not have it as far as I'm concerned but if you can handle gluten and you're slowly working your way down to that not having the bread option here you go don't be scared this is my next step so what once you're done and you've gotten away from these akhil I put things that I would usually have Tortelli trick can I say it for tort tort Ella tortilla corn wrap so with the corn wrap okay you can use something like this instead there is a recipe that will be coming soon to this channel and that will actually be my taco made with this so be excited and look for it let's go to the next topic okay are you ready the very last one the the BAM low-fat peanut butter it is not a good option I know a lot of people are very anti peanut butter I don't mind peanut butter as long as is organic in its natural state and the only ingredient is Organic peanuts just kind of quickly touching on it our low-fat peanut butter when they take out the fat they just add in garbage so they add in icing sugar and other types of sugar and hydrogenated oils and all types of stuff that you do not want to have in your body that your body may not recognize or like or you might get addicted to that you can also do things like I've got my organic almond butter here but almond butter I find doesn't taste as much like peanut butter so if your peanut butter fan then I would say sunflower seed butter tastes very similar to peanut butter not the same not same but similar and it's a seed it's not even a nut crystal for those of you that have met issues and you want to bring it to school and you want to maybe try to trick your kids no I didn't say that you know maker could think it's being a better no that means the same thing anyways sunflower seed butter is a really fun option that you can find and now we've got some of our 10 best health foods whoo thank you guys so much I hope you liked the video if you did please hit the like button below you can also share this with your friends

hey guys I'm Mike Lopez and I am I register still a little bit like budget surpluses nutritionist and master trainer and I'm so excited to share with you I like being okay this is just one of many life days what I do but this is a very good showing I'm kind of a favorite okay when it goes through a little circuit over here to get the thumb all warm up and then we're going to go over to the table you like a full foodie pan stirring everything so I'm going to link the actual workouts down below but right now I'm going to give you a lot of tips and tricks on how to do it the most out of it are you ready there you go so we're going to start off with glute activation now you might already say and I have a whole video somewhere on YouTube that is a whole glute activation video that really just kind of shows you an entire routine like one of probably my favorite routine when I have time to do it because it does take it takes about eight minutes just for activation but some people that is enough for them for the rewards out there just like an my bum is good okay but this solut activation we do it to make sure that our glutes are turned on and firing when we're doing all of our bum stuff otherwise we might just hit our quads so just click note so the activation I'm doing today is this one here I don't know the name for it so I call it glute activation I don't know if I made it up I don't know if I thought in Pilates I don't know if I saw it online I like it so whatever the band is working the top but cheat and the list is working the bottom and you'd think that the top one is working the most but no no it's bottom just same but it feels very painful in an amazing way love it so much I'm today going to do about 15 reps if I was counted which I'm not but we're going to guess I'm going to think I have about four more and then I'm going to switch into my other leg on a regular like me I'd probably do two sets so I would do this on one leg I'd flip over and do the other leg and then repeat that she comes in a row with nothing in between because one leg is kind of resting while the other one is working and you can see I got my toes and my heels dug together okay I'm trying I might not be perfect but I'm trying to keep my shoulder right over my elbows and highlight my abs in and I'm driving my leg up welcome to my hips stacked one on top of the other while doing this I'm also attempting to keep my spine in neutral which means my head is doing this to this it's relatively neutral and I give it a flaxen exhale as I raise the top so let's say that is about 15 reps again cheer answer those yes yes hip swings are a form of joint mobility so why am I doing this because I sit at a computer a long portion of my day I know you think I'm in the gym all damage and money but no writing programs means I'm sitting on the couch with my computer on the lap then what happens is this gets very tight okay now that gets very tight what happens is when I try to do my life day the tightness here doesn't allow me to select there properly which means my glutes are inhibited and it means that I could do all the squats in the world I might not actually work in my bum that's just a tragedy so I do my mobility and I do my oxidation and then I think in my routine I just do one set of those Jenna I think one set is a mass so I just finished my hip swings but another thing that I kind of like to do to kind of just loosen my hips before I start a light day is joint it's kind of just like a what do you call that you know when you roll out the hips I can't remember but I'm going to show you anyways maybe I'll rub you later oh thank you it's the function that's important guys really at the end of the day it looks awkward you're basically putting this under your it hurts and then you're just kind of doing a little rule to find out the part with that has found right now that is tight and I'm just going to sit on it and you might feel like little rolls back and forth okay just to kind of loosen that out a little bit and for those of you before an ABS day before glute day this could be really helpful to have to be able to connect your abs and connect your gluts and I might do this for like 2 minutes 1 or 2 minutes per side before a leg day if I have paid hit if I don't have turnips I'm going to save it to the end of the workout instead okay so that's what kind of gives you a little bit of an idea now what your notice that I didn't do is I don't stretch ever before a workout I'll do dynamic stretching which is kind of moving through the range of motion of the exercise or doing a warm-up set or areas that I know we're really tight like my hips from sitting I will do something like this and pretty much leave it at that okay the rest of the stretching stuff is post workout and the workout okay so absolution and release is all done I'm ready for the actual reckon al come and join me let's go so now we're going to the actual workout and now this is a grouping of exercises because we're actually going to do a superset okay we're a few exercises in a rope now I'm choosing to start out with the TRX jump squat and the reason that I chose this first is because it's an it gets circulation going that's the blood flowing now doing this I like to walk it in so I'm actually kind of like this with lean back I'm going to look up at wherever my chair coming from and I'm going to start in a seated position okay so I want to be able to put my glutes right on the floor to make sure that I'm able to activate my glutes because you want to get low to activate and I'm going to pull and power up okay so a little bit of energy whoo okay so June 15 reps of that heart rates up a little bit everything is moving glass and blood movies to the legs so the next exercise I'm showing you right now is the wall fit with a Pilates ball now let me get into position so position is 90 degree angles generally at the hip and Ed to me okay and now what I want to do is place the ball kind of right between my new knee and my upper thigh about a fist width apart and I'm going to squeeze really really intensely pull my score nice and strong keep my shoulders back okay now why am I doing this exercise one wall sister amazing I really like isometric that says where you just have to hold it's really good to mix them in and everything shouldn't be that concentric eccentric up-and-down movement something should be physical play that awesome held movement but on top of that it also works the vastus medialis which is kind of the inner part of the quadricep muscle and mat can help for some people who have knee issues sometimes their knee issues are because that muscles weak okay so this will help strengthen it it costs next to nothing it's a squishy ball full of air and if you cannot do a wall fit you can also do it in like an ab curl position with it just sitting between your knees and you're squeezing and release it okay guys so we are at the kettlebell area of the gym I actually really enjoy doing that little kettlebells I just I just feel it's a really nice position to really get into my glutes and my hamstrings so here is my array of kettlebells here they're mainly in kilograms which means it's the weight times two point two so I think I'm going to use my 24 so they're just over 50 pounds each so the two of them together will be just over 100 pounds which is a nice a nice weight for just kind of like my warmup for my deadlift and then as I do my double ups I generally kind of increase the weight as I go so one set here and then by the third set or the fourth set if I choose to do that long I will keep getting heavier and I'll probably switch over to an Olympic bar and I'll join 45s on them from here in position chorus strong natural curve in this line at all times shoulders back that's the most important thing I'm doing sumo so my feet are just wider than the tailbone and they're just turned slightly open by some natural way I would stand and my knees are trying to go right in line with that second toe here we go I would make sure my core is engaged first drive my glutes back to engage with the hamstrings stand up and flex lower it down keeping my core engaged so I do that Pilates breathing of course as always now I use the mirror I like to do it at a quarter angle so I can see that my knees are in alignment then I glue stir back and then I'm not allowing my back to over arch or ever round I'm going to get up two more okay so again for warm-up set I don't know I probably do anywhere from 10 to 20 repetitions second set weight goes up reps go down third set weight goes up again reps go down depends on how many sets a new in set after that I might go full and just see what I can do to three max reps and then go and I'd finish on this weight again and max out to failure which means until I can't do them anymore never until my backwards if my back ever hurts which it never does but if it ever did immediate stops notice that even as I'm putting them away this is my stance and protecting my back what a ton of my newbie clients do when they're trying to put their head away or pick it up is they do this and they pick it up quickest way to destroy your back okay so remember whether you're just starting going to get your deadlift or finish up we always lift with our legs okay I'll do this like I don't I don't care if it's cheating I'm just putting it away but I will just kind of support and always make sure they're protecting my back engaging my core next exercise okay so next up I'm going to throw in some kettlebell swings what you want to do is you want to keep your core in driving with sockets as you come up notice that my arms they're like spaghetti noodles they're like a string and my shoulder is the hinge all of the momentum is happening from the glutes so it goes back its thrust forward and the string goes flying and the core is engaged so boom so just make sure what you're not too which I see often is this where you're lifting with your shoulder and then you're working into your black versus using your glutes and your hamstrings which is gold so we have now finished our first full circuit so the circuit was recap ready jump squats on the TRX and then we went to the wall and we did the squeeze degree involves the Pilates wall then we did B head above deathless and then the head loss point so when you're doing this what you want to do is that was our first step that's your warmup set lighter weight more reps then the second set the weight goes up the reps go down third set continues we close up again reps go down and you can do three to four steps with this okay so that is the reps but I hope you enjoyed that if you did please subscribe you put out videos every single week you can also comment below let me know what you thought let me know what other videos you'd like to see and it will see you in a speak because bye 
hey guys I'm Liza Lopez register Phillips a nutritionist and master trainer and today I'm going to take you through a leg date okay are you ready we are going to start off with cable kickbacks I think I've been doing these since I was like 12 years old I'm not even kidding so I'm going to show you how to put it on because even though this seems very simple people have a lot of trouble and going on with you scrubs this is literally like even though this is my gym this is the ankle cuffs that lives in my purse doesn't matter if I'm going out to a nightclub for some reason this might be in my purse you want to strap it around your ankle and put it through a little loop very important otherwise it will come right off and then tighten it up so you still got some room to move and then press down on the velcro and then you're good make sure you put it to that loop but a lot of people miss that part we want to have that one hand here and the one hand here the reason I have this hand up here is to not engage my core I know that sounds weird but I want to isolate my glute this is not an ab exercise you don't need to I know functional movements very popular but the purpose of this is an isolated glute exercise specifically to hit kind of the top area of the glute although it works really well through the hamstring up the glute right to the top of the lower back but really hitting I like to say it like helps to shelf of the button as well as the hamstring if you want to really reach forward drive all the way back and notice that I'm actually leaning slightly this way because if I didn't if I leaned this way my foot would get stuck on the floor I might feel like warm-ups at probably about 15 reps and just really feel the squeeze and just kind of really take him at bringing back fatty subjects 8 then I'm going to take it to the other side let's reverse everything I just did so again that bench is in a component now so that I can swing my leg this way here we go strap the ankle around put it through the loop tighten it up but make sure that there's some wiggle room in there context and same thing holding here with the same hand here abs in pull tight and flex as we come up keeping the core engaged getting my flex through us a little bit and getting strong strong add strong bond a nice stretch neutral spine so my spine stays and a natural curve throughout the whole movement and again I'm probably going to do like 10 to 15 reps so my warmup my final set might be around 8 reps with a heavy weight and then as I finish I might even drop the weight and do a few more reps at the end just to kind of like burn it ok failure next thing we're going to do is a lateral kick going to hold on to my bar knees are soft which means slightly bent core always engaged before we start and I'm going to drive away now when I do this I'm very specific about how I do it I lean my body a little bit this way purposely because I don't want to use my obliques ok my abs are secondary or secondary muscles but my goal is hitting right here so what I'm going to do is think about it I'm thinking about using the muscle but I want to work you don't think about it and you start thinking about your day or just really getting into your music and forgetting about the muscles you might start using the wrong muscle it happens so I'm thinking I'm touching it's my bum I could touch this I want to use your bum you can touch your bumps you want you to feel the muscle field engagement to the core core is pulled in tight and I want to think don't use this section use here to lift okay so I bring it in which around to the other leg which means I'd be turning and facing the other directions same thing knees start off soft core engaged shoulders back sink into the area one or first I'm trying to sink into my abductors I'm going to pull away feel that flex before I start and begin now the smallest little change in angle can change where you work which is really why you want to think of I want to work there if I turn my toe open does it change it right to my heel open does it change it if I come back here a little bit and go a little bit more that way does it change it I do this does it change it which it does a lot different exercise but right now I want to work right here okay working out can build a little bit of mass in I was going to say something around with it so jay-z it is time for your bum in your gluteus medius not a huge amount but some for sure but what you want to do is a combination of exercises for here and here your glutes and then finishing exercise for your waist and then you can have that illusion of that hourglass and really guys a lot of it is about illusions because there's only so much you can do in the gym it's a lot but you've got to kind of work with all the areas you can't just say I want to build a bun and not do anything about this through your Pilates centering so it's a team we're going to do a little combo to my favorite but I actually really like these I hated them a long time ago and now they're like close to my heart and they are a Bulgarian split squats and last night elevated deadlift you ready here we go we're going to start off with the Bulgarian split squats which is this here you need a bit of balance if you're new to this zero wait let me get my shoulders back chest up abs in and I'm gonna bring my knee all the way down as low as flex a little ow and come out my goal is get a little pod and bring it up pause bring it up the reason I like the pause is it puts the weight into the hamstrings and the glutes it just kind of gives it that little oh and then you have to drive up with the hamstrings it's awesome and I hate it all at the same time now I do anything from zero weight to about two like a forty or fifty on my back I find these hard not going to lie who's going to pop her foot in just a little bit and we're going to go into the back leg elevated deadlift now what we want to do is we want to get that stretch and pull it in stretch and pull it in very important that your core is engaged and also important that your foot is further forward than your hips so what do I mean by that I put you down for seconds my hips line up about right there I want my foot further forward than that okay if it's here and I lean forward the weight of the dumbbells is going to go into my back I don't want that I bring it forward a little bit instead it goes into my hamstrings and my glutes which is great okay let's switch like now some of you if you're struggling with balance set your bench up beside a wall and touch the wall don't use it to help you just touch it so you don't fall get that little pause squat hot bring it up high bring it up so again anywhere from like 8 to 20 of these and then you're going to pop it in just a touch and begin your deadlift core engaged chest up feel that stretch little distraction oops pop it up my usual weight for this is 40 pounds per hand I'm using the 20s right now because I'm going superset between the ball bearings flip slide and the back of a yellow deadlift if I do that I will go lighter so that's those two exercises go on to the next one leave and you're back now I have two of them okay so we're going to put one of them at the knees and a minute I don't have to say me times these right now this was nuts what happens sometimes I carry them around in my first and in my purse these are the two that are there so I'm going to put them on with you more intense intense react finding these SK if you have to the same intensity which is ideal then obviously it was using first I want to start off core is always engaged I like to do that before every excess shoulders are back into a little bit of a mini squat so glutes back abs in I'm going to step up really wide I'm trying to track my knee to that second toe even though I'm always in a squatted position when I do this I want the deeper part of the squat as I lower okay as I go across if you don't have your own booty band then we have the link below where you can get some and we do have the different intensities but again I like two of the same it just so happened that have two different ones because I do carry them in my purse no matter where I'm going don't we do it in things like the boxer we we go eight and seven starting to feel the sides in my glutes size for this with that lateral cable is really awesome and to go one more so now that's all there is to that an easy one that you can do at home as well when you take them off do it with care mine lasts really long because I never let them roll up and if they ever should roll up I put them flat again that's an important thing because you want them to last like mine never break and it's just I think it's partly just that little mini bit of aftercare if they do I've hurt baby powder or something can help I don't know what I'm tried it and then you look it up not sure so the next exercise is called a Superman but we're adding an extra little twist to it where the we're going to do a little bit of an upper back contraction as well as your lower back attraction so to do this we're going to lower down to the ground we need no equipment for this at all just excellent okay we're going to lengthen the arms short to reach forward lengthen the legs as long as you want to be as long as you can not as low as you can as long as you can pull the core in shoulders are back spine in neutral now drive your elbows back to contract and reach and extend forward Shh exhale and extend to flex and relax remember it's not about how high you can go it's about lengthening keeping that hover position keeping your core strong and you want to turn off your glutes and let your lower and upper back work lengthening the legs lengthening the arms and you would exhale and you'd inhale here think about driving those elbows back you can track the back and then lengthen and three lengthening the legs keeping the middle hover two and one touchdown guys so that was a Superman again remember trying not to engage the blue-skinned this line I know so we're considering the rest of the day but that one was specifically for your low bass because if your low back is not strong you're going to have trouble doing a glute exercise it's really important to get that it that was the second circuit again we do three to four sets of an entire circuit each set that we do weights go up a little bit reps go down a little bit so the first set was our warmup last set we want to have is our strength set and then if you want you to do a drop set at the very end who so you want to do three to four total sets of that little circuit that we just did which let's recap that it was glute kickback then these side laterals with the cable family does the Bulgarian split squat the back leg elevated deadlift we did the booty band sidestep and the Superman with the upper back contraction you want to do that three to four times through going slowly up and what what you additionally each set and then your whole work cut is done you can finish with a little bit of stretch and that is a look at a kind of a typical leg days for me they usually last anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour and 20 minutes just depending on the time I have and how I want to go but I hope you enjoyed that if you did please subscribe we put out videos every single week you can also comment below let me know what you thought let me know what other videos you'd like to see and it will see you next week

hey everybody my name is Lizabeth lopez and i'm going to be doing an hourglass body Q&amp;A um it's something I actually hope to do maybe once a week it's a pair on my social media I have a lot of people asking questions on just training and nutrition and I thought this would be a fun way to answer some of those questions with a little bit more detail so what I did last week because I posted a question on my Instagram and I just you know asked people to post some questions for me and I've got a great response to over 40 people ask some questions and I got I'm going to choose the very first question that I got on Instagram just because the first question why not is the first block as so the first question was from Cali J - J and her question is building ABS and Billy seems to be what everyone wants these days how do you do that and I thought that was a pretty awesome question they asked about those types of things a lot I do post a lot on blue training and AD training I love training the whole body but to me those are two areas that are very fun and rewarding so let's talk a little bit about that and now this question I'm going to gear it a little bit more towards people who are trying to lose weight and you know maintain or build glutes and to get a six-pack and it'll be a slightly different answer for someone who is trying to gain weight while doing that so I'll try to address both a little bit but I am going to give the answer a little bit more short the weight loss group that want to feel that booty and get subtext so here we go first thing if you have tried to do the fitness thing before and you know you probably are doing a couple things if you're doing it right it's going to be your basics which is follow a healthy eating plan you know add some cardiovascular chewie regime and and do some weight training resistance training as well so if you are doing that one of the things you might have noticed is that your bum area gets smaller which is probably not the goal of a lot of you because if you're like me you like nice you know round booty and so what's happening there is in the bomb area there is muscle so your glutes and then there's also fat so if you're doing cardio and you're doing proper eating but you're not training you glutes properly then they may potentially just actually get smaller and you're going to be upset upset anyways umm so the piece of the puzzle that's missing here is well two things one is time so it's time to you know slowly but surely you're going to see that weight loss yes everything's making it small including the glutes but you're going to get to see more abs and more arms even marches of face all these really nice things that come along with a leaner body from the cardio and the proper eating but also if you do stay consistent and give it the proper amount of time and you are doing resistance training specifically for your gluteus area and then with that time and consistently see you will start to see the building of a really nice set of glutes again if you're training properly and you know proper supplementation food all that kind of get stuff as well although is hand-in-hand so that's the part that people kind of give up on is that time consistency so yes the proper eating you know I have eating plans on the website I'm just saying and you can also find any plans of course with like dieticians and natural fat doctors nutritionists and you can find mine at lads of Apophis comm just thing but but proper eating is huge huge as well as your cardio if you're trying to build glutes you can stick to some cardio that's also going to assist with your glutes or not stick to because I'm a big fan variety but mix in some cardio that's also going to help out with the boots which could include like the step mill which is that set of stairs that keeps moving and you're walking up the stairs and you can also do mixing in some hot pillow walking so like turning that treadmill as high as you can you can work slowly but surely but my clients that have been with me a little bit longer I put the one the treadmill on the highest and cut it up so that goes 15 or higher read up there and then as fast as they can speed walk it through just to get a little bit more activation in the glutes sprinting as well so like hit style Sprint's these are all things of course you know you want to work with a trainer I get your proper form all that kind of good stuff and then mix that in with some some study eight-state cardio as well mix up your cardio but those ones are excellent as well don't intend oh yes so proper glute training as that's where we're at so probably training depends on your body type so it's hard for me to give exactly do these exercises because all of you out there are going to have completely different bodies and so I'm going to say my type of body first I might do a body I'm thicker girl um if I don't train and I don't eat properly I will be a big hair shape like just just big big ankles big calves baby's big thighs with just wide slide um not heat um anyway so takes a lot of training for me to maintain and build a physique that I am happy with and the types of trainings that I do for my glutes is actually surprisingly not dented up at squats which is what everyone likes but squat you won't believe it's everybody squat and squats are great squats are great to me to the girls that are smaller or have skinny legs and want to have a rounder butter just have like you know athletic legs and don't mind a little bit of exercise on the left squats done properly in squats turn properly for glute training in my opinion will also build out your thighs so if you do not want bigger bum and bigger thighs together you can't separate units watts then I would say that that is not the exercise for you if you do want bigger lives and bigger Bambang BAM it is fantastic festive exercise but you generally not going to see me on squat rack you're just not gonna let me catch me there maybe every so often when I don't care that my thighs are going to grow that week because literally that's how fast my thighs grown men would love to have my thigh genetic it's stupid probably from gymnastics but I mean is it aggress um some exercises for my thicker girls for their bombs to you know add with some growth and some size and everything and I would stick more to isolated flute exercises for the glute area you can train your legs you know not separately but you can do a different type of training for your legs and a different temperature if your glutes which is how I train and how in my ethics and so I look for isolated exercises and there are some kind of compound exercises that like the compound X's are like for bleep development for type of girls is more of a back of the leg with a hamstring glute type tie-in like um you know like a deadlift or even like a hip thruster they're not exactly isolated they are a little bit but I'm not I'm making full-on sense right now but exercise I really do like I do like the abductor machine done properly with properly it's building your way up to it um I do like Pilates exercises where I actually add weight to it um I do like using the the bands I have my own blue bands that I can show some exercises with anything where where you can just really contract Lucky's in the stability ball a lot I love cable kickbacks okay without kickbacks I think I do every single glute day I actually carry my ankle cuff with me in my bag at all times it's like most people of their foam and you know lipgloss with them I've got my phone on my lipgloss and my sticking rope and my glute band thing for my ankle it's stupid it's like in my bag mmmm anyways because such a good exercise um but I can I can show some where those exercise I have some on my youtube video I have pictures of them on my Instagram of these isolated leave exercises but that's what you need to do we need to again be prepared for the weight loss you know because again you're gonna lose some fat on your bum you just need to build it back build that bomb back with muscle which is going to be nice and round and it does jiggle okay it does it has movement it's still nice you can still dance it will still bounce I know this sounds funny to people that don't care about this but these are concerns that I hear you know I don't want it to be like that like a table I want it to still be juicy um it will still be juicy it's only like dead-on firm if you were as being can be and you're flexing um just like you know a bicep and let it go even if it's muscular there's there's some shape to it and so you don't need to be concerned about those things and then stars the ABS oh my god Studios getting long I'm so sorry um as far as the ABS as you lean out your abs are going to come in naturally and that's going to be very you know attractive to you and then your training my favorite type of training for abs is actually acolytes and I am a Pilates instructor I adore Pilates why because it does help with that narrowing in of the waist and it also really focuses into form and breathing which proper abs come from form breathing mind muscle connection really think that did strip nominals and and also just stay away from this type of movement side side where you're focusing in to the outside area that might block you out a little bit and you want to focus on to cinching learn how to breathe how to you know do this with me right now so put your fingers on your ribs and wrap your thumb around your back and take a deep breath in and in up spange ribs and exhale bring them together and you should like come really really um close like that that is the type of breathing that I would like you to do when you're doing abs anyways like that that exhale when you are flexing it everything should come tight together and that's going to help teach you how to train and those ABS but abs are made in the kitchen you're not following preface eating you are not going to see into that six-pack even if you're doing fatties on a daily basis and the other trick with for me with ads I'm mixed Pilates with my old-school bodybuilding and style abdominal training which is like hanging my braces cable crunches so I'll do the heavy stuff with the really really good form and really good breathing and Pilate style with my body steps so and that in a very long video nutshell is a just a little bit of hopefully some helpful information on some abs and beauty training again stay tuned to my youtube channel on my Instagram and all that kind of stuff and Facebook where I'm regularly trying to post some information and some teachings and everything and then of course if you are in the Atlanta area I have my hourglass workout which is about seven years strong nail and now seven location strong with a so excited sore all over the GTA now so we are hourglass for calm and you can come and do the workout with us which is a very much abs and booty workout and pleasure get your eating plan all that kind of good stuff otherwise if you're not in the area I am literally working on the online training as we speak I'm shooting the videos for it and about two weeks the website is what half done so I promise I know I've been saying it well but I promise that actually is coming soon so stay tuned I will do another post on Instagram to get your questions so if you do have a question posted therapist from the Instagram and if your questions about this video I guess you can post it I'm and put this on youtube so you haven't post it below on YouTube I probably won't answer there but I will read all of the comments and who knows I might get my question from there as well or at least be able to clarify in the next videos so I'm so sorry it was a very long person video I obviously have a lot to say I hope you learned some and I hope to see that there in social media world train our and people I think they think 
my name don't mind my crazy hair getting ready to come to Atlanta I'm having my favorite super food cereal so I'm about to bring the alibis work out to Atlanta I'm on the way to the airport to meet Melissa and get this tour going Trenholm has such nice Edwards pretty that is get to work you got the full work stations here my fans that's a terrible always I'm playing whatever gonna break in my new sunglasses since it will be nicer in Atlanta than it is in Toronto look at our window you know have to check for bedbugs always when you arrive at hotels this is imperative so I packed few foods with me let's see if it still intact yay healthy food on the go Jim yeah City for a tour date is I check the venue and check out all the equipment I literally count everything like I count every dumbbell every step every kettlebell just so I can spend that night really kind of putting my circuits together because they do like equipment and all the venues that I choose always have equipment because obviously when I'm flying I can't bring like my money kettlebells with me but this was an amazing space here in Atlanta they were so so good to us and you see all this equipment I was like the kid and all the big candy store it was amazing and I think I used absolutely everything that they had we don't talk anymore she just goes on sweet potato fries with marshmallow dipping sauce I'm not in Toronto anymore chicken waffles this is the restaurant in the hotel hi Nelly must get the muscle yeah the marshmallow and then the liver fear attempting to be healthy those are Brussels sprouts but they're fried so again attempting have to say I really like the southern hospitality here in Atlanta it's like every go everyone says hello and you know you get on the elevator people are saying hello it's gym time now started too so we're getting our gym session and of course even though we're on the road we happen to luck out with an amazing gym in this hotel we would have worked out regardless but this was just you know bonus and me and mallet used to film each other for Instagram when Instagram first started and she knows how to get all the good angles on this email now and yeah she's off in New York teaching hourglass I was there and I'm misty belly getting her morning pump ready to teach this workshop so here we go it's class time I taught two different classes here in Atlanta plus the certification and I actually really love doing these tours and getting to go you know across pretty much into the u.s. this time but I get to meet so many people that I just kind of get to chitchat with on social media and get to actually train them and show them what our class is and you know just work out with them and it's it's amazing and I have to say like the energy and the enthusiasm and how hard these girls go it's phenomenal and then it's kind of exciting when the you know write on a comment later on Instagram you say I'm for Chicago workshop I don't remember them and it just makes it that much more personal and kind of takes that social media to an in-person thing so I love it hey day is all done we just did a couple of classes and was so much fun and so I love the girls love them morning you're gonna do day two of the certification here in Atlanta and it's getting ready to watch just about to get started to bring our Buster lentes over in Atlanta there's going to be programs here recently so the first day that I show it was the camp for just kind of anyone that wanted to come out and do a intensive that booty workout and when it's done it knows it's intensive you might not be able to walk for a week but this day this is the certification base so this is where I have personal trainers so all the girls here are all personal trainers who are learning to actually teach hourglass workouts so this is a training program that I put together to teach one of the methods that I've created for creating that hourglass shape so we do a lot of activation a lot of Pilates mixed with heavy lifting and it's very specific to kind of getting the fat burn and the proper shaping to build an hourglass shape so that is what we're doing today so all the girls this is the first well this is the second part they had to do the camp to actually see what the class was like because you know we're not in Toronto they've never tried it and then the second date was this where they actually learned all the techniques and all the styles and all the different all the different kind of I guess workouts that I do and then after this I don't show it but then we sit down for another like six hours and we actually get into the theory part of it and then there's like a full theory part and tests and all that kind of good stuff so our last workout is now in Canada the US and the UK which is pretty awesome because it just started out in Toronto if you want to become an our best workout instructor you can now do the certification on just go to our glassware Capcom forward slash certification and you can do the certification online and bring it to your city we have one day left in Atlanta this is what Melissa want so the real story behind last night's Segway decision was we actually wanted to go and see an Atlanta strip club because I haven't been to him before and apparently if you're gonna go I went is the place because it's actually like a show like a real show but it was Sunday so strip clubs are closed on Sunday because it's a church day so we decided to do segways in in the morning instead so off we go so that there's actual like Segway trip is nerds excited when Melissa was first like let's go do this and I laughed at her I was actually thought she was joking I'm so glad I did it it was so fun my one tip is don't worry feels I don't know who told me to wear heels on a Segway but it made it very off balance and I was actually like the worst person at it where I had to stay behind the instructor because I almost rolled backwards down the hill at one point and there's another point of almost train rolled into traffic but that doesn't usually happen I did catch the hang of it eventually yeah so it was an excellent tour of Atlanta like you just you get to go to places that you probably might not go otherwise in so many places he took us to kind of the area for dr. Martin became his final resting place we also got to see his first house and you know you're just you know you're out in the Sun it's beautiful you're learning something new oh you're doing the Segway at the same time as just I don't know it's just it was just a really cool thing to do he also took us to see here we got um handmade organic popsicles and I started in sign of benches and parked our segways and and then he took us back on a tour and we started to head back and took us through some cool neighborhoods where we saw being at the house where the CEO coca-cola lived which was a big beautiful house in a beautiful neighborhood and I really felt like I got to see a part of Atlanta that I probably wouldn't have seen if we did what my plan was which was to just go shopping so anyways I would recommend this trip it was it was great I hope you enjoy it just kind of seeing what we saw it was funny right now 
hey guys I'm Liza Burke Lopez and today I wanted to share some of my favorite beauty products with you none of this is sponsored this is all stuff genuinely that I love that you guys have asked about so ready here we go let's start with the first thing it's this simply human mirror I kind of love it let me show you what it does watch it Susan is as soon as it senses I'm here it turns on how cool is that you want to have kind of the right light is one of the things I learned cuz in my bathroom it's a very yellow light and I kept doing my makeup and thinking I have enough bronze and all this kind of stuff and I'd go into light and it didn't look at all the same so apparently by using something like this when you look in the mirror you're gonna see a more of a true representations also magnifying so it's great for all those little details of things you might miss but it is Wireless which is awesome a lot of the ones with lights you have to plug in and then a plug flowing across your sink so this I charge it like every two weeks but I can use it while I'm charging it which is great and I just leave it overnight so the next one that I want to talk about and I've shown actually my whole process of this on my snapchat is not on the table here it's my eyebrows I got my eyebrows micro bleeded basically what it is is you lie on a table they do little slices with like like it looks to me like a medical exacto knife and then they put like a type of ink then they rub it onto the brows and then it crusts it takes about ten days to crust so I wasn't allowed to work out for 10 days that was very difficult but now my brows are relatively permanent for about one to two years and it will slowly fade why I chose to do that over tattoo is just because it looks like little hair strokes I'm not good at doing eyebrows so this was fantastic for me and that was kind of my experience I may try to repost my actual experience of mica lighting on the YouTube channel so if I do if you're subscribed you will catch it just I'm the same so guys my next one this one I think a lot of you know about but I'm going to give you a beauty hack for it are you ready so a lot of you already know about the Sally Hansen legs so I'm just gonna spray it right on my arm like that but this is the secret this is like the buff pad and it makes it so smooth and perfect um so this is from proton which is a tan product for stage that makes you really dark if you see it on the site also and you're just kind of like your regular beauty insist or whatever probably too dark for you okay just the buff buff is all you need but it will literally buff it in and make it perfection no streak this color wise gives you that perfect like stockings it's literally like wearing wearing stockings when you spray it on it will change the color of your skin it will stay on all day but then if you want that glitter glow and you want to be a little bit more shimmery I was recently introduced to this one as well which is the Melanie Mills gleam product and this eye layer on top of it okay so I wait for that to dry and then I layer it and then you can use also you can blend a little bit into your foundation if you want to as well and just give yourself a little bit of a glow so I've been playing with that and it's been pretty fun so these all together are kind of they're kind of awesome little kit so just this year I was just literally introduced to purple shampoo and purple treatments it's like a godsend I swear it's literally been life-changing my hair is no longer brassy um but I brought it expert in to give you a little bit more information about it on it can you pop up please so on it is literally she's an amazing makeup artist and an expert on hair color take out that hair show us all of the colors that you've done and she does her own hair yep beautiful all the silver and blonde and gray and tell us a little bit about the syllabus shampoo or slope treatments yes so it's called a purple shampoo so basically for anybody who have chemically treated their hair you're more sensitive to oxidization when it comes to UV rate so a little bit of color theory when your hair oxidize I change into a yellowy and then goes to greeny and then Brown me and for blondes that's you know that's hurtful color yeah so what purple shampoo does is as purple color that neutralizes the yellow and the brass and to make it more like white and blonde yeah again and how should we use it like how long should we leave it on perfect so you should use it on clean hair yeah I would say that I wash your hair you can skip your regular conditioner and just use this instead okay leave it on for about like two minutes if you're like a regular blonde like yourself yeah and you don't want to have like too many of like purple highlights and don't leave it on more than five minutes okay but if you want to like more blonde and white yeah then leave it on yeah and that will actually tone it pretty much okay anyway this way first two minutes gonna take you back to regular blonde yeah and then about three to five minutes it's gonna be like a blondie white okay if you keep going like like longer longer it'll turn purple yeah why thank you dude hair dance okay so I'm gonna show you my one of my current favorite toothpaste this is kind of like a natural health food store or toothpaste and the reason that I use these versus the ones that you get it kind of regular department stores is that those ones do have the fluoride in them some of them are animal tested there's just you know someone have sugar in them I mean sugar and toothpaste wait I know this is my favorite it's Jason so Jaso and this is the sea fresh and it's probably my favorite of the Jason ones but if you want to check the health food store and look for a new favorite hopefully a fluoride free with fluoride you want to be a little bit careful and you can read the different studies on it there's quite a few studies now saying that fluoride may not be the best thing for us to have in our toothpaste or in our water even for my in my shower and my sink I have filters because I don't want that for it in my water and I don't want it in my toothpaste so I'm doing the fluoride free and my teeth are pretty happy with it so the next Beauty favorite that I have is coconut oil so it can actually help with things like dandruff if you have dry hair you can do coconut masks so I'll do like coconut and egg or something that and literally leave it on my hair for moisture and protein you can put it on your body or skin care for moisturizing your skin you can put it in if you're making your own deodorant or something this would usually be one of the ingredients in it you can use it in your mouth for oil pulling so you can look up oil pilling I'll probably even show you how to do this on this channel at some point but you put it in your mouth and you swish it around for a while and it literally gets rid of bacteria people are even saying it's the new flossing right I'm so head-to-toe crazy beauty product I get the extra virgin coconut oil because it is the purest form of it I get the book I have to buy the bulk size because I go through so much of this stuff something a little bit more just fun and quick these guys think they're called short clips they're great anytime I get my hair done I just want to put it in a ponytail if anyone else is that way where you're just like you get home and you just want to put it up maybe it's done and then you'll ruin it these things like I'll just literally just like I can't do it cuz it's up but I'll just do that on each side and then as soon as I want to leave the house I just pull it out and my hair is perfect so no matter if it was in waves their curls are straight or whatever this saves your life from putting it in ponytails when you're home and if you follow me on snapchat you'll often see me just wandering the house with these in my hair you are a fitness person or if you just are looking for dry shampoo these are great these are my two probably all-time favorites for now this one is my favorite powdered one and this is my favorite spray one this one I love because you can see right here the color because you can see the powder right there is a little bit of a light brown kind of like my roots my roots are a little bit of dark brown but then I have blonde hair so you can choose the color of the powder that you want and the title is cake and it smells like cake so literally once you powder this all over your head you smell like a bakery and then this one as far as a spray this is a new one for me and the reason that I really liked this because when I sprayed it on all of a sudden I got all these complements of you smells so good what is that and I had nothing except this so I was like okay this is gonna be a regular post gym and this one you just kind of you just kind of spray just be careful because when you do to the spring it can look a little bit white so you have to make sure that you will end it otherwise you'll see like circles a white or you know spray on your head this one I know that this is my phone I understand that but I'm it's still a beauty thing because if you are like me and you on social media a lot and the lighting is not always great or you just want to be blown out because it looks good this then this is one of my favorite things okay this is my lumi light obviously it's a film case so you just kind of pop your phone in and out and it does that which is pretty freakin awesome and I think it deserves to be in a beauty video this as you can see it's just about empty probably been my favorite perfume I can't even probably for like three or four years now and I keep buying other perfumes and if you look in my my cap in my case area where I've got perfumes there's a good fifteen of them that are all full and I just keep grabbing this one because I just can't leave it so this is called pink sugar and it is it just it just kind of smells sweet and happy and I don't know yeah it's it's it's just lovely like kind of cotton candy for adults yeah maybe something like that anyway I love this I can't seem to find one that I love more than it so it might just forever be my perfume okay so these ones I love these are body products that I absolutely adore this is a shea butter and what I kind of love about it is that a lot of shea butters have a very shea butter scent which some people really like and some people not as much this one it smells so good it is a grade-a shea butter and it's it's an ivory all natural and you want to think about when you're putting things on your body your skin is your biggest organ and I know when we're looking for creams and stuff that smell really good it's easy to go to you know the local mall and go to whatever stores of stuff that have things that smell like Apple and berry and and I don't know really funky fancy names but they might have a lot of chemicals in them and a lot of oils in them that are not as good for us and because it's our biggest organ we have to absorb all of the stuff in those creams and it goes into your bloodstream and it goes to your liver and you know when you say I have to do a detox or whatever maybe instead of having to do all the time just don't put crap on your body so this is a fun way of tuning that this is a natural butter that you're putting on your body on your organ and your skin and it's really healthy for you and it also helps to it helps with stretch marks it helps with all these types of things and to go along with that this is black soap very very very natural it acts as an exfoliant it actually can they say it can help with anti aging and it can also if you have scars and blemishes and stuff like that it can help it go away they are awesome products and I love the way they smell and I love the way they feel and all that kind of good stuff so to wrap it up that was

the gym 
hey guys welcome to my upper-body workout in the condo I'm going to do a mix of voiceover and video chatting so I used a 15 to 20 pound dumbbell for this and I get deep going five times in each direction so I'll show you [Music] the big so now I'm gonna go and do one that sets up the Exodus okay so I'm starting my second super star anise earthquake which today is the new 40 so I generally start exercises either with a warm-up set or with just contractions like this with no weight just to feel the muscle and flex it or I'll do both in this case I'm doing both so starting with the flexes and then going right into my warmup set and warm-up set is usually a weight that you know I can do 15 to 20 reps out and sometimes I'll do super light and sometimes I'll do something like this throughout this video you're going to see me just kind of high-speed through the set so you don't need to watch me do an entire upper body ache that'd be really boring okay so now we're going into ABS I actually love to have my ABS kind of at the end of my superset so whether I'm doing upper body lower body I like to throw a single add movement in this is one of my favorite ab exercises it is BOSU oblique crunches if you do it properly it burns and it is actually awesome [Music] these here are called renegade rows I'm doing them for my toes if you're newer you can definitely do it from your knees and just try to stay straight from shoulders to toes I'm doing pretty decent form I am lifting my glutes up just a little bit more than I should but I am using 20 pound dumbbells and my core is strong and it flexes the top which is the most important thing okay so I wanna start my second side so I'm gonna be holding for now I'm just completely and and it is the dragon ponies so as this is the second set so I'm now going a little bit heavier I'm going to be fifty pound dumbbells because I can't do as many reps I'm going to do one set switch arms and then do it again just to give it a little bit rest but not so so much like not all the way at the end of another superset and then my third set what I ended up doing is again I did my fifty but as soon as I failed instead of switching arms I dropped down and - I think it I think it was a 25 or something and just rubbed out to failure and did the same thing for the fourth set but I'm only showing two sets in this video because really it can only be so long before you're just kind of work so there you go if you noticed in the first set I did this with a bent knee and this time you're doing it with straight leg and I like to do both of these and even other things just to mix it up a little bit love's I'm flexing that's the main thing [Music] [Music] [Music] so again if you're newer to this exercise you can totally start off with um your knees on the floor my Hagin start off with lighter weights and just work your way up to it and it's an excellent exercise for your core obviously I went to failure here which I love so I'm hitting my lat pulldown here and I'm going to show the beginning of it in regular speed and then jump up to bunny rabbit kind of high speed and the reason I'm showing it in regular space is I want you to see how slowly that I bring the bar up nice and slow for that eccentric okay never going full-speed and it's going to look like I'm going really fast but this isn't the speed I'm doing it at I have it in high-speed motion right now obviously but you want to hit that eccentric phase that's important and I'm doing the same thing here on my row where I'm controlling that eccentric which is where you get a lot of the strength so don't miss out on that way back in it is equally important [Music] you next app exercise I feel like this way of doing it I kind of made up with kind of these shoulders and all that kind of stuff and when I'm doing exercise I kind of go with the feeling so I like to engage the core or engage whatever muscle I'm doing and find something that I can really contract I can really feel properly so again I'm powering up I'm controlling my eccentric face down you're going to see again I'm going to high speed on editing so you're not watching my whole set and watching an hour working out but you can see in real time I'm going very very very slowly on that way down and maintaining straight arms to make the shoulders and back click as well put some weight on so as I get into second third and maybe fourth set this is where I start to pump the weight up a little bit I can do full stack on some things and on back and I don't hear this nearly as often anymore but I used to hear a lot of will it make me bulky I mean I'm naturally a thick girl that's my genetics a lot of girls kind of on the scene they're trying to put weight on because they're naturally skinny I'm the exact opposite so no I don't look like them I look like me and I'm a you know a relatively fit version of myself but I go pretty heavy and I only put size on where I want to put size on and doing I'm heavy back the worst thing that'll happen is if you put on more size than you want you just take the weight down or you stop and it goes away so no worries I've trained enough fitness models to know that you don't generally put it on by accident to get that size you're generally working your butt off so don't worry about adding some heavy weight to some things guys it will only add to new cemetry including curves which is what I do and I purposely put heavy weight on certain areas I'm not on other areas so that I can create curves where I want them and cinch where I want to see my waist I keep very small with a lot of Pilates type movements and then everywhere else I kind of do according to my body so right now I'm doing real belt flies very important to not neglect your rear delts especially for your shoulder health and that's what that was right there these are based clothes I love face poles again they're very rear delt and back oriented and you do them with the tricep rope and they're great [Music] these are straight arm press downs are usually do them standing but I don't have machine that works that way and Maconie gems so I'm doing it kneeling with the tricep rope and these are amazing you have to really hold and flex through at the bottom to make them work the way they should okay super sips are done we're going into the first finishing drill which is going to be spider push-ups which I love and it can also be done from the knees with hundreds hundreds are a Pilates move that you are going to see shortly after I do on with my many spider push-ups ready ready and here they come here we go hundred so I'm doing them kind of in between intermediate and advanced and a little bit high I would usually go a little bit lower and go more advanced but I might be being lazy today but the main thing is you want to pivot or not pivot you want a hinge from your shoulder with strong pulses like you're bouncing many basketballs pulling your core in tight and zipping up Pilates style and look how this slips and bunny rabbit speed looks like them anyway hundreds so finish the first little set that we want and you at 17 two more times through with heavier weight a little more intense and then I want to mix superset [Music] so I would say that I work my everybody probably once a week it does get worked in some way or form as well just through drills or maybe too bad as maybe I'll be throwing in to better push-ups somewhere that gonna party day or something but as a general I'd say arms get hit about once a loop for me and this is a pretty regular format that I would do with upper body and which would be super sets which is probably my favorite so every time I do abs I punch myself in the stomach first wait for it ready ready and bam okay so I'm going to finish with a finisher I pretty much always finish whatever doing some type of ensure whether it's just one exercise anyway the drop side set so decided on the fly which is ensure that I do then do Bernardo superb sided with play I went down bones and I'll do that personal topic so type that between the two um I fail I will drop to the other one until I feel had enough here we go [Music] so I call this drill a personal tap out so what I've done is chosen two exercises to get left and downs and the underhand grow and every time I feel like I need to rest and I can't do anymore instead of taking rest I jump to the other exercise and I just keep going back and forth and my timer set to 4 minutes and by the end of the 4 minutes then I get to stop so it's a fun drill sometimes either with partner sometimes I'll do it by myself I can do it with any two exercises but maybe should be something that I can't do for sure for 4 minutes otherwise you're not going to tap to anything but yeah it's a great way to finish and just feel that burn and that's where it and all that good stuff [Music] you okay 30 minutes I'm just doing little bit of sexy so I save I'm stretching for the end of the workout and it's really important to do I am guilty of not always doing it but but it is actually really important I don't really believe in stretching before your workout I do like some kind of you know activation and durability necklace stuff but very end stretching this is an exercise I'm going to show you that my chiropractor has me do and it's kind like you're walking through a doorway but in your arms and cut and throw away and you do that stretch through and it feels amazing and it's really really good for you so I do that one probably every everybody [Music]

hey guys I'm myself as registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm here with my good friend Sofia and our left client with all of her curse sassier is going to model the abductor of machine today this machine here most people to know the basic which conceptual just renovated when you're just sitting and you open any closed and open any book but there's a lot more thank you can do at this machine I know you've probably seen an exercise you keep looking a little crazy on Instagram and you're just like should I dunno if I do how do I do it i just i'll quit clip with a hot chick and maybe a motivational quote life big group i don't know and we're going to show you I can't remember I think about six different ways to use it let's go with that if we end up with five hundo make one up [Music] okay here we go thus after Sena shows a very first one which would be how would you think to use it which is tuning all the way back good and then the one thing that we're going to get is that proper form notice that she's taking her time she's using her muscles to bring out the weeks out okay and then she's getting a flex on the abductor okay right here and then she's squeezing and then she's controlling the weight back hand which is a very typical kind of time and attention rep timing now we're going to show you exercise - are you ready she's now going to sit up straight I like to do this I don't know why it so it's got to be lasting I just find it it lets me to engage my core that's a neutral spine your chest up and now you're going to do it again so now we've got even more hip flexion happening here but if you really drive open and keep this proper core I find it really hits the lose heart you feel it oh yeah and then we really squeeze like when you really contract your position oh boy do you feel it yet oh yeah I'm feeling it okay okay okay we're going on to exercise number three I said no matter we're going to continue we're going to continue forward and she's going to grab one of these guys here she's going to keep her spine in neutral so tschappat at your bum a little bit forward you can find neutral the core strong could be her chest coulis and luckily we don't have the flexibility to this we'll do this I would just say just don't do it if you don't have flexibility yet and what she's doing is she's not just like swinging and open in this position you can really just swing it open and completely missed hitting your glutes you must come open and get a intense squeeze in this position you can also hook the weight quite a bit higher because you have a lot more strength yet and this is your sacrum you might be getting a little carried after but look we're gonna haven't let you rest but just really show them asleep that will squeeze it if you round out too much you might just literally look go fast this is make sure your left again okay and we're going on to exercise number four here we go this one you're going to need to drop your weights because this one is a challenge oh yeah okay I only took for demo okay a little lighter so that you can see our proper form so she's actually going to bring her butt up about three or four inches yeah and now I'm just going to make sure she's get and there she's going to drive for me open I actually like keeping the chest up a little bit more right there and she's going to drive in squeeze open how does that one feel I can totally realize down there yeah it's like almost more isolated and challenging can you lean back now and continue good and it just changes the angle it changes where you're feeling it notice that her reps are getting a little faster if she gets a little bit more tired anyway a little bit little bit please okay we're going to go to exercise number five which we need teacher and ran for okay doing kind of beat if we do it gracefully feel great I'm speaking booty to camera [Laughter] [Applause] one of my most conservative friends is the whole entity okay now the one thing that you want to check before you start this is depending on the way the footing is you could really screw up your knees or you could get a good a booty slap she needs to make sure then her foot can pivot from side to side so that her knee is always trapped in a second post no matter where she opens to her foot is able to pivot but clear your feet on the lower one maybe and it needs to be able or the everyone but it needs to be able to pivot side to side so as you open is pivoting and not when you pivot those toes you nor visiting so if it's open as you open good so very important and drive your knees open so you're in fifth position Sony and I'm a second toe yet yet yet yet but because she's freestyling it so for the harder it will be hole up here but she's how it is it's challenging when you do it right but you gotta drag those knees bulb in and let that knee chest up and you can leave wife wife wife wife wife I'm bringing in in in in good freaking second yes she showed her face she was just like good now the one way you can do it is where she stayed stable okay so her head says here at the entire time the other one is totally blocking the camera at the moment Lisa could be on the other like just kind of harder just push back and see this machine okay so the other one is she's going to come up and down in the squat as she lowers you can either hold the squat the whole time or you can kind of up and down in your what never balance is good freaking me out a little bit though this is a huge advantage you've got all the balance in the world I'm going to say put your hands here so that you don't fall but backwards into dolphin takes place there we go and I'm going to shore alone how does that work feel this is really getting into the group yeah we love hearing that enjoy a little bit boom and we're hitting the whole booty we're hitting like maximum Mediate minimus like and all the other little stabilizers around it and everybody and bring it back that was great to sit give her a little air high-five okay so let's just ask the question so for the viewers who are not on the machine right now but are like I'm going to do that at the gym one which one do you think he's felt the most so why doesn't the most and is my favorite I think is exercise number three okay so this one Yeah right yeah I even go to jail yeah really gets into the glutes and you can look very heavy on it which one did you like the least definitely the one where we completely turned around I think that exercise number five you feel comfortable I found it hard to pivot okay and I think that's really an advanced move it's an advancement what about six-one to learn your app identity I think there's a little bit more mobility because you're squatting and it just feels like a natural squat while you're pushing out with a little bit of resistance so it's almost similar to squat with resistance valence yeah all right so that one was a lot more comfortable than exercise number five I like all of them I'm Nick Sloane some people are a little afraid to do like what do they call that is that the like the reverse cowboy is that a vengeance excuse bending thing and get on it because they don't want their booty up in the air and everyone's cases but what I say to that is if you're at the gym and you're trying to get those results just space put the earphones you know the whole what's up thing your phones on world out yeah do that and you look it oh all of your stuff almost all the good stuff yeah you can't you can't be worried what anyone's going to the gym so give them a try let me know I'm going slow and thought of mammal with your favorite please show Steph yes from that look in the comments area below give the video a like because it helps give some engagement to the video unless other people see it and then feed which we appreciate so much and we will see you in next video don't forget to test it [Music] the [Music] 
hey guys I'm Liza both Lopez registered to listen nutritionist and master trainer and today I'm here with Casey Casey is a personal trainer and she's also a longtime hourglass girl with super sexy legs and booty and we've added some size and some muscle and all that kind of stuff and today that's what we're going to show you so we're going to talk about adding size to the hamstrings and the bum the posterior chain without adding size this way okay which for Casey actually because she's a slimmer girl it will feel nice but for someone like me not as cute so this video is going to be one of the best videos if you want to add it size to your bum and to your hamstring this way so we're going to show you the hip stress and we're going to show you right from the home version right - one of the most intense version all in one video so we're going to show banded which is stability ball and show with benches we're going to show with barbells we're going to show with Olympic bars all the way through show a technique and form and case is going to be our model and there we go so we're going to show the first version I'm going to bring a stability ball which a lot of you guys will have some people call them gymnastic balls and we're going to get activated we're going to do a bit of activation with you so choose the band Casey okay she's going to take the blue we've got a light a medium and a heavy Casey would usually do heavy but because we're doing a video we don't want to her to die because sometimes I just hold people in one spot it's not very nice to me but I think it's pretty funny so she kind of could have come down and what we want to do is we want to have her feet just wide enough that she's got tension on the band even when she's not pushing open what she's about to do serve a few field in attention okay so what she's going to do now is she's going to drive her hips up and as she drives them up she's also going to drive her knees open and hold this so what she's doing right now is she's activating the entire gluteus maximus by doing the hip extension which is this motion from here here it's hip extension and she's flexing but she's also driving her knees open against this band which is also causing to her work her gluteus medius or the side of her bum so everything is getting very engaged right now and I'm going to surprise her I'm going to give her come on back up again we want to give her a little sucker punch and why did I do that because whore must be engaged while she's doing it to make sure that her lower back is safe and protected so go up and down for a few of these so as she keeps driving up she's going to flex open now whether you're doing this on a ball or a bench I like starting with these and she can even centered on where is it where is it I got a kettlebell fairness she can even add weight to this and I would say to a few unweighted first just to feel the Flex now what she's going to do is she's going to add that to her hip and now we're adding weight and you want to have a little bit more weight to add size to the bottom okay so that progressive overload where we're slowly making it more and more challenging so this is if you don't have a bar at home you can use a kettlebell house I feel great the film's left whoo okay so this is the home version we're going to bring a bench over now I'm going to show you a more of a gym version or if you have a bench at home then it can still be home version you ready right here we go okay so generally when you're doing a hip dress it is hip extension so she's going to push her hips back and she's gonna bring them forward and flexure glues together while keeping a neutral spine and a strong core okay so that is the general movement in the hip twisted position now if someone is still feeling their lower back when doing that they Knight might need to engage their core a little stronger and they might need to go a slight bit more into a posterior pelvic tilt so if you see where she is right now all she is doing is a slight tuck under okay of the glute which is going to also engage her core a little bit more and this might help most people when they try that all of a sudden they're back to some sort anymore let's go up into position now one thing I want you to look at right now is where the bench is connecting or contacting her back okay so if we move your arms out of the way just so they can kind of narrow in a little bit I like it to be kind of right below the scapula roughly so kind of like if you're a lady maybe like where that bottom of your bra strap is okay if you're a guy just kind of below those kind of chicken Bowl and looking things which are you scheduling okay so as she goes into hip flexion so she drops her wrist down her spine stays in neutral okay and you can see where she's connecting right there some people you can go a little bit lower as well if that feels good I'm going to show you what not to do now and this is what I see in classes often and I'm correcting all day long here are my pet peeve [Music] one can you show it where you keep your head and neck on to go up into hip extension good and now just arch your back and drop your hips yes this is what I see loaded with a hip and come back up again this is what I see often please don't do that please make sure your spine is a neutral let's show it neutral is again so come all the way up we've got a natural curve in spine just like when she's standing up and once you dropped your hips her head good and shoulders come up in everything stays in neutral so that is there yes mmmmmm walk down until the bench is just kind of below your neck okay even a little bit lower I see a lot of people and they're doing it here okay and they come down and come back up and it's way too high see oh it's kind of like right right at the top of the shoulder blades like almost sitting on their shoulders a lot of people are way up here that's not comfortable and once you add a load if we're trying to get to what she's going to do which is 165 that's not going to be good so those are our nono some options to pad the bar a little bit is if you're if you hardcore you can go with nothing I use a towel that's my comfort zone even when I do like Tareen a pound I just like a towel so I do that and I just wrap it up and that's my happy place some people like to use squat pads you can get them all over the Internet and so that's a squat pad right there just make sure when you get in that this is facing up okay the last one this is a really big mat some people get really small mat and they'll just place this on their hip and then put the bar on top so you know you can see whatever is comfortable for you I know Casey likes this car here so she's going to plop that guy on okay so she's safely standing up with a neutral spine like a deadlift okay and then she's going to make sure the pad is facing up because if it doesn't as she sits down it's going to pop right off of her okay now here's the next point she's got the bench in the right position now when she comes up and go ahead here's the next part now that we've got a bar happening here and I'm going to get you to hold this is why we're going a little light for her - she knows she's going to be holding as we talk we don't want it sitting right on the pelvis we all know where that is I don't need to show you okay you don't want it on your pelvis alone whether you're a girl or a guy very painful a lot of people will have it right there and that their comfort zone and then come back down again and some people will push it away and have it sit just at the top of the side whatever you do not on it now the next thing another reason I gave her a slightly lighter weight for her which is 70 because we're going to show some time under tension is how long it takes to get up to hold and how long we lower so we're going to do one second up we're going to two-second holes I'm going to do two seconds down there you go so it is explode up hold one one-thousand two one-thousand come down controlled woman mm mm she's going to continue on that on her own the reason I like this is glutes do well with explosive movement they're the largest muscle to huge muscle okay and they'd respond well to explosive so we're going to explode up we're going to hit the flex we're going to hold that flex which is right there and then we're going to control the eccentric down which is a great area to get more muscle and I feel especially in the hamstring I feel like it really good hamstring development on that slow control let's do another one okay so now let's go are you ready you're going to go one second up three second hold one second dance so we're going to focus on the flex and really through that entire flex now you're going to get deeper and deeper and deeper into the squeeze and then just come down okay so our whole focus is on these squeeze so it almost becomes isometric that hold how does that feel I feel okay so our pool whole focus right now is just that squeeze I would do this with a light weight because some people find it hard to connect and squeeze really hard when they're doing something like that's an Olympic so this is something I would do with a lighter barbell or sometimes even with nothing or just band let's do one final time in attention let's do 101 so we're just going up down up down up one and two and three and four now this is an awesome burnout you can do this at the end if they all feel different right every single one fit which was your favorite I think the one second I'll pull this up and them down on one okay okay I like that very much a go we like that isometric okay so now this is also equally important she's going to show how to get out of it safely because I've seen some horrible things that are just going to destroy your knees for how people get out of this they just like worm themself out with a hundred pound so she's faithfully wiggled up she sat down and she dead lifted properly off so here's how the Olympic bar goes to thought her pad again to make sure that this doesn't get bruised so she's going to sit down in front of the bench and she's going to put her feet underneath and she's now just going to roll it towards her and while she's doing that what she's doing is she's making sure the center of the bar let's just take the pad off for a second just say to the center bar the son of the bar which is right here it's always marked by little grids is right in line with her belly button because because the lever it's very long we want to make sure that it it doesn't yeah Keter taught her unheard which will work her core as well it's not really the goal okay so again that stays facing up and she's going to slowly just start to jiggle in with her feet until she's comfortable yes and she's an ease up and slowly get herself into correct position and now she can begin her hip thrust now this is 165 pounds that she's doing right now I think her max is just over 200 yeah is that right yes master Justin over 200 and she's only started this was four months ago maybe what's up with the heavier weights so about four months to slowly work to where three months maybe from probably 60 pounds up to over 200 pounds so that's a pretty good progression in short amount of time and you can see her hamstrings are looking great they're shaking a little bit which means they're working she's choosing her own time under tension you can see which looks like she's chosen about an explosive up a little bit of hold and yeah and it looks very down so that's I like that one to use if you'll kind of fix the one you like the best but it is good to mix it up overall that was a hip stress favorite exercise for overall size development of the posterior chain as far as the glutes and hamstrings hope you guys enjoyed that video we do put out videos every single week on fitness and health and nutrition and all that kind of

hey guys I'm Liza Beppo Pez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer I'm going to show you one of my favorite juice recipes today we're going to do it in the blender so it's going to be a blended juice which is different than a juicer juice because with the juicer we're going to take out most of the if not all of the insoluble fiber and in here we're actually going to keep it in which is going to keep us a little bit more full okay so I'm going to start off with some heart of romaine now this is a lighter kind of green versus something that this is a little bit darker but unlike something like iceberg lettuce romaine still has a good punch of nutrients in it so I'm going to throw at the romaine into here next up I'm going to go for some spinach it has amazing anti-cancer properties to it and I'm just going to throw that in next up we're gonna do some cilantro and mint they just so good but they've also got antioxidants and vitamin C which are like beauty nutrients so this is like our anti-aging right here so pretty next we're going to go for the Apple so if you're not a hundred percent ready on going like a hundred percent green juice this will give it a really really nice sweetness and one of the great things about apples is that they also can help you balance your blood sugar so not only do they give you a bit of sweetness but once you're done the drink maybe you're not going to crave as much sweet and I'm actually going to throw the stem in because the stem actually does have some nutrients to it that I would like to have in my juice and when you're eating an apple would you ever like this system so that's one kind of thing that's fun about juicing is you can have all that stuff we're going to do some pineapple and one thing that's really fun about pineapple is they have bromo lean okay what is rolling it's very very well known for its anti-inflammatory properties we've got ginger I love ginger because I love spice and this will add spice so if you don't like spice don't add this much one thing I love about ginger is has anti-inflammatory benefits and also it assists with digestion so it's going to help us with that flat tummy coconut is our next ingredient now I was already guys to use this because this is how I get the water in coconut but I've been challenged literally on just now to use the trail I'm a little scared I haven't used this before her okay here you go are you ready okay well then okay you think I left wait nothing's happening can't wait I would like to challenge this versus my wait just hold on a second let's please try so no people at home are probably like Liza book what's wrong with you it's a drill you just push but watch okay I'm just gonna do my way first that confuse this one he's too it's already working hahaha score please I would say one point zero points it looks like it's all done and I think it is officially safe to take off the safety goggles I'm going to pour all of this coconut water and now I would like to drink some but that would be unprofessional two ice cubes just to make sure that it is nice and chilly we're ready to blend here we go ready so it is thick it's definitely you'll notice it's thicker than normal like fresh-squeezed juice that you get from a juicer because it's blended juice and it has all that fiber I'm so excited guys it is all done right here yeah it's like spicy and sweet this actually gives me so much energy if you're a coffee person first thing in the morning try this instead of your coffee I'm just saying you will love it I hope that you try the recipe please comment below let me know what you thought by all means let me know what other things you'd like to see on this channel we're posting every Tuesday and Friday fitness nutrition lifestyle check us out and and we also have information in the subject line below so you can see the ingredients and everything else I hope you guys have an amazing day Cheers what we do is we shape out curves and to do that I do personally believe that you need to be able to add some weight be able to do a little bit of progressive overload so I'm gonna show you some of my favorite pieces are you ready

I'm coming over here with some lovely Lopez thank you oh I get hot thanks we better than handshake Lopez laser Beth and Lopez I always got mixed up but elves all the elves you are a busy busy woman yes you and I just found this so fascinating when you were 14 you were certified as a gymnastics instructor and then at 16 you got another certification 18 another 120th and now you are a celebrity trainer you trained all kinds of people more than 4,000 women internationally you are a pro athletes you were voted what was it international fitness model kinds of things that you've done so it's wonderful so tell us the hourglass workout what inspired you to do this well I mean what inspired me I guess it does date back a little bit when I was when I was young I actually was a gymnast and I got injured really early and and gained some weight right and slowly but surely all through those years of being an ASUS coach at 14 and a row started 16 person aging I was also anorexic couldn't figure out the diet thing lifted crazy heavy weights with my legs and couldn't understand why they were anorexic legs yeah we're skinny well because I was I was building my sighing it's he has an ex gymnast I still had those okay all right I didn't understand training I didn't understand food I was trying to understand it I finally went into fitness modeling and and I started that in 98 yeah time ago and won your first competition in 99 but but I learned to actually start to shape the physique and understand food better understand training and did lungs a lot of certifications over a few more years okay but I started to understand how to shape people and started to understand all the things that I did wrong with with me afraid of food instead of embracing it what it can do for you and how to train to actually love your body and love the curves and be okay with the fact that the legs are a little bit thick and how to make it you know sexy and embrace it so over all those years of training know men starting to train other women for shows I actually created this whole format of the hourglass workout which was just pulling in the waist bringing out the booty you know rounding out the shoulders and also engaging it with holistic whole eating food fantastic so it was that's kind of the birth of the hourglass where that was long in the making I love it so is the idea to not necessarily diet but to just you know change your whole way you're thinking about food it yeah 100 but yeah like for us you know some girls will say well how many exact calories should this be or you know how much should I be losing and all that type of thing and I don't like people to get to just you know focused in right on exact number calories and exactly how many pounds they're losing because then I find either not learning how to do it they're not learning to eat healthy learning to train I'm learning to love it you know then it's always a diet or it's a goal to get to this weight where it should be I want to love this lifestyle I want to grow into this this shape and learn to love my body and shape it into like the sexy female shape right and the best part its shape for each person because everyone's gonna be different absolutely yeah absolutely so now the sexy curves and all of that let's let's get started the one thing that's different I'm gonna have you put these on okay our booty bands booty be awesome you're gonna love these you're gonna you doesn't want to keep these I may have to give them to you well I think that's a good idea what do i do first which one we're gonna do so we're gonna put them just above our knee the first I need to step into you step into it and then I'm trusting but Lisa matches my running shoes I would sit down if you want yeah did you know there's an idea because getting into this next one hold on because getting into the next one there we go yes but then what you got stands up well get you balanced cuz then you do have to stand up hold on there you go oh there you go okay so up here up there and you can flatten if you can and we're gonna put the other one around the ankle oh wow you're gonna kill me no it's gonna feel good and and this is kind of one of the differences between what we do in some of the places is I feel every workout that you do like anywhere you go that you're gonna get a sweat and you're gonna get a burn and feeling good is great the fact that you're working out so all workouts are awesome I find our workout is just a little bit different where we're gonna focus really entertaining so this is one of our shaping exercises this is the side of the bone yeah that's good okay that's dead okay so we're hit squat position alright so you're gonna push your bum back push the bum back hold the ABS in alright good bend the knees uh-huh and you're gonna open wide with your ankles and your knees make sure the knees open easy okay step together so back together yep and then stuff why so you're just kind of stuck inside side good okay and a little faster now really push your knees open keep your squatted position keep shoulders back lots to remember if you were to do this are you starting to feel here I am now we're really engaging yeah I'm feeling you idiot yes I am yes we're finding that outside of the bum uh-huh which is part of the shaping but you notice your heart rates up a little bit it is okay right and building here okay I'm gonna show you another exit okay and how many of those do you want to work up to you know what have you ever heard of a tree battery I have but tell me more Tabata is I'll keep those on okay pretend I have a stopwatch all right okay and we're gonna do eight rounds we don't have to actually do it but someone might want to do a trio 20 seconds on mm-hmm 10 seconds rest eight times through okay so let's just pretend you're gonna jump ready I'm going to go jump seven six three two and hold for five four three two do it again all right eight seven six five four three two and hold okay I'm Elena got two rounds but you do eight rounds of that okay okay as fast as you can so that's one way you could do it you could just do it for a minute side to side and it's gonna make this burn and it's actually gonna build it out oh nice just stack that up alright okay this one here and do I keep these on so you can take them okay great this one here is called a back leg elevated deadlift alright and I like this one as well because this one is also gonna shape into the hamstring glute and low back area okay which are really nice areas to shape out alright right cuz all other said oh workouts are great one of the things I just really like that we do with our glasses we're very focused on the areas we want to shape okay so this one looks like this I'm gonna put these back here so you want to be here chest up and it's just a very shallow deadlift but it's very isolated into the hamstring so it doesn't look very difficult okay so step a little bit forward uh-huh a little bit more there you go now put one foot up okay so right what yeah okay okay now keep your trust at night perfect keep your core engage all right keep the weights right in front of your leg now you're gonna stick out your booty uh-huh and you're gonna try to find a stretch through your hamstrings so just come forward keeping your chest up oh good and now come back up and do it again now the goal at the bottom of the movement is find the stretch right here keep that chest up shoulders back and come up are you feeling a hamstring yes good now I'm gonna feel even more oh you'd like straightening that back leg like push this leg back and really feel that stretch right here okay so as you push your bum back okay yes okay and come down keep your chest up good yes yes yeah feeling that more perfect and come back up again so that's another fun will love this one give me give me two more two more let's really make the hamstring feel it okay okay I'm craving that now I want to keep these in your hands okay okay because we don't just do bum all day all right it's fun and some girls want to but we do hit other muscles as well we also want to round out the shoulders we want to pull the waist it off another one let me just ask a quick question because you have and this is to give me a nice little rest you have eight different locations yeah that women can go to yeah we so exciting we actually just expanded at the beginning of this year uh-huh and now we're eight locations across GTA so we've got Mississauga of on North York Midtown downtown Toronto anyway and so a person coming for the first time yeah to your class would they be engaged in this kind of thing yes they're beginners classes and you know everyone thing is that we have all these beginner girls and they'll come in for the first time with the girls that might have been there for six years or so we're in really really good shape and the girls that are advanced they help out the new girls oh the fun time and the new girls their bums are like done first week they're just rolling out of bed stuff like that but it's fun and they they still they get a tolerance and there you know everything grows and gets stronger they're able to take it better then talk about we can start them right in okay we start them right in all right it's good next you ready I'm ready to go okay this is called a jumping jack shoulder press oh okay and what I like about this is it's shoulder shaping but it's also fat-burning at the same time all right okay so you're you have the weight so you're gonna put them up here and like shoulder press visit should I move this chair out okay and you're going to do a jumping jack so we're here and we're gonna oh that's coordination open and then everything closed so everything open and then everything closed okay punch right to this guy come on come on babe push it good right to this guy your dumbbells right in line with your ears keep that power back there eat your sweet pounds you'll be okay creaking along you're gonna feel really good you feel good I'm gonna feel good okay yeah you did very well all right now we also do add movements okay okay now I find there's some AB movements that can like square out and you know when you see kind of that more blocky shape versus the glass okay Hynde getting one or the other okay so we've got two more minutes but see what we can do show you so lying down we like to throw a little Pilates in okay me oh you all right what am i doing okay so we're going to do hunter legs in yes okay so what we're gonna do here and anyone can try this at home cuz this is I love this exercise so much so first thing we're gonna do is you're gonna hold on to your ribs where they're up here breath in and exhale and pull your lips together in phone and now an exhale Shh pulling together pulling together there there now drop that belly one two Stein okay hold this position uh-huh and don't push your back into the floor oh but don't let it arch ether and that's a nice neutral spine okay now we're gonna bring the arms forward we're gonna curl the shoulders and head up mm-hmm here we go now we're gonna bring the legs into a tabletop position which it's important that the knees do not come more forward than the hips okay okay now bring the arms up and here we go we're gonna go inhale two three four five exhale two three four five keep this purse still no really curl it up oh oh I feel it drop the belly button and give you a little bit more intensity over right here good give me five four keep breathing three full baths and two and one a little bit longer than that but that's just a nice idea of kind of the glutes and we're kind of try to build out the glutes with my waist and we're trying to round out the shoulder and give a nice fat burn so that's a little bit minute it might be an example of what you think we have to go your website is the Alberta Capcom and there's lots of information there

TV calm and we'll be back with Miri halbert's who's gonna turn nuts chocolate and raspberries into a truly luscious desserts don't go anywhere thank you 
hey guys I'm live with Lopez registered for master nutritionist and master trainer today I want to talk about a topic that I get asked about a lot which is how to keep your teeth nice and white but in a very holistic manner so I'm going to tell you guys about oil pulling this is coconut oil now oil pulling can be done with coconut oil sesame oil olive oil I prefer coconut oil because I think it tastes a little bit better I've tried it sesame oil is kind of be like oil points from aerobatic medicine aerobatic Arab air Vedic era Vedic something what anyways it's from aerobatic medicine I like to use coconut oil okay now it's more traditional to sesame oil and some people use olive oil but for me this tastes the best and all three of them work and there's a lot of benefits to delimit oil as well so I'm going to teach you how to do this and tell you some of the benefits I've been doing it on and off for a while the traditional way to do all pulling is to do it kind of straight every day for two weeks and then try to keep up after that about three to four times a week so I might do this for like six months and then I might switch over to like tumeric type thing or you know just kind of mixing it up there are some amazing stories out there this used to be just very very popular in India and those types of places but it's become very popular worldwide now and really hit the states pretty hard recently just because of a lot of people's stories if you want to google on your computer and search some people's stories on it some people have actually said it like they needed to get a root canal and all of a sudden they didn't need to anymore people showed their before afters of their dental x-ray and you could see the decay and then they showed after oil pulling and I mean I watched with my own eyes as it decreased if you have fillings right and you do oil pulling if you have bacteria like in between the filling and the tooth still the the filling might actually loosen because the oil pulling could actually pull it out and then you might need to redo the cavity but hey you're getting rid of some bacteria so right but just that is your being forewarned also on that one some of the benefits of oil pulling are here's tooth decay kills bad breath heals bleeding gums prevents heart disease reduces inflammation whitens teeth soothes sore dry throats prevents cavities he'll crack lips boosts immune system improves acne strengthen gums and your jaw as well these are some pretty amazing things just from swishing coconut oil around your mouth in the morning and I just want to say like if you want to do some further searching you can always google we all know how to Google but let me tell you how to do this amazing thing it is very very simple you take your coconut oil sesame oil or olive oil as I said you're going to take about I don't I don't measure it but it's about a tablespoon that you want you can start off with like a teaspoon if you want to the recommendation is more like a tablespoon I've seen things that say two tablespoons to me that's that's a lot of coconut oil because I've done this quite a bit and the tablespoon is perfect for me now you want to do this first thing in the morning okay I wore my pajama shirt just for one of my pajama shorts just for this video I kind of do care about the hair a little bit but I just wanted to share right anyway before you brush your teeth before you drink water before anything happens is because in the morning after you've been sleeping and not eating and all this kind of stuff that's when you have the most amount of bacteria in your mouth okay so what we want to do is we want to put this in our mouth or right and then you want to swish it around for about 10 to 20 minutes what this is going to do is it's kind of going to attach and literally pull the bacteria and toxins and everything out of our mouth and you swish it around you don't need to do it aggressively it's actually like kind of very softly you want to switch it between your teeth some people actually call this the new flossing I was so say floss but you know it's it's equally beneficial so they will even say like brushing our teeth we'll get it about ten percent clean and then this kind of helps with a lot of the rest of it but I did actually find a difference when I did this as far as whitening my tongue felt cleaner look it looked very pink and everything so I did notice a lot of differences when you're done after you've switched for 20 minutes it sounds like a long time it's not that bad like I literally I'll do my makeup while doing it like once I get to the cheek or something all the stops wishing and do what I need to do and then you can swish again you can shower while you're doing it you can start to make your breakfast while you're doing it and then when you're done very important do not spit it into the sink do not spit it into the toilet have like you don't need a bowl I'm just because I'm not going to run around and go to the garbage in now Twitter but spit it into the garbage okay because it definitely can clog your toilet or your sink so into your you know but this is so good so again you want to do it kind of like two weeks every single day and then after that you want to try to keep it up probably three four times a week I find the people that have seen that the biggest benefits have been doing it for around six months there are Studies on this so I know some holistic things there aren't always studies there's not a lot of studies because again it's it's holistic but two of the studies that were very interesting one of them said that it was the most beneficial holistic thing that you can possibly do to actually reduce and reverse tooth decay so one of the other studies says that similar to reflexology do you know when you touch the different parts of the foot it can relate to like your liver or your spleen or whatever the tongue is similar so by doing the swishing and cleaning and everything that it can actually help heal your entire body so those are pretty amazing real studies so for all the kind of like Calista caters out there studies got you got you what I like to do actually no I need I'm going to show you what this looks like clearly I'm not going to be able to speak for a minute so excuse me wait just put back on the screen so excuse me bottoms up hmm okay so I'm going to show you how this is done so clearly I'm not going to be able to speak right now so here we go bottoms up some of the benefits of coconut oil include balance and hormone pills candy - digestion moisturizes skin reduces cellulite decreases wrinkles and age spots silences blood sugar and improves energy include Alzheimer's and increases HDL and lowers LDL cholesterol so try to read something off the computer just a wonder Felix she says she this is amazing it feels really really nice in her mouth anyways that's pushing all the bacteria in your system that's not trying to use one yay so 10 to 20 minutes later you spit it out oh I think thank you so what ladylike so 10 to 20 minutes later you spit it on out not into sink not into toilet either but spit it into the garbage there is another thing that you can add on here if you are inclined or if you're you know you're doing it for a while and you're just like what else can I do to even like magnify the benefits and there is something else you can do it's very and one thing you can do is you can add essential oils right right okay so with the essential oils they are extremely antibacterial and antifungal and they can add a little bit of flavor as well so I will link some recipes below I didn't write these recipes I am NOT like a essential mixologist and that is important you don't want to just play with essential oils and just randomly think I'm gonna do three drops to this you don't want to do that so make sure that you're following a recipe I did find these from reputable places I'm going to link them below and I can also link those studies below as well so you can see all that in the description box I'm not like a mixologist of essential oils so these are ones that I did find from other sites that are awesome and I quite liked them some of them taste good and some of them don't but they have different things that they do some of the fun things that you can use are if you're sick or something you can have like tea tree and some other things or you can add like lemon oil and they all have different properties as to what they will do to help benefit your mouth and you do absorb so it's not even just the swishing and the antifungal and everything but they will actually give you benefits so okay and it's just kind of you're already swishing for 10 minutes why not swish some goodness into your body all at the same time so this is a fun fine laughing at me back there going on in here so again this is something that I love to do personally because again I like to do variety of things I probably still do it anywhere from once a week to sometimes every single day like seven days a week it just depends on depends on the mood how lazy I am or not I

[Music] hey guys I'm Liza Pat Lopez register Kalista nutritionist time master trainer and I'm here with my good friend and hourglass girl Saffy app and Satya Sena show us some lower back exercises she is one to be our model now we're going to show you we're gonna focus in on the low back back here why are we doing that and what does that have to do with your booty gain goals I find that a lot of people when I'm working with clients here in studio they're not able to go up and wait anymore maybe they're working on their squats or their deadlifts or some other lifter even just started and they're not able to either do the work correctly get the form correct or go up and wait because either their low back or their knees go on them if you're having knee issues that is not this video but you're in luck because they have a video that I'll link in the description box below which will talk about me health and blue games okay but now we're talking about if you here for this video for back health weather and even if you have no back pain and have never had back pain because all all of the booty moves whether they are compound or isolated need meaning like compound like a squat where there's multiple muscles or like a deadlift multiple muscles or if it's isolated like a cable kickback I'm just gonna use you at doing that and you're isolating the bum still low back it's it's in all of them so if you don't actually take some time to strengthen your low back you're not gonna get all games okay so we're gonna show you my 5 favorite lower back exercises personally I am over back probably once a week with a my training either on a leg do need a back date when do you put your low back step in um I tend to do it on booty day booty day yeah yeah and you isolate and do specific low back exercises oh for sure for sure right so let's do it right because look it's got some booty going on there yeah we're gonna start off with swimming ok Superman these are Pilates exercises he knows how to do all of these so do you vote her off no wait for the start beginner we've made it a little tight here just a minute my little girl okay there we go now she has space this is stolen from borrowed from a lobbyist which is my other favorite thing outside of booty training so soccer is going to reach out when start the Superman now when people exercise yes man so she's like what now when she blows up you want to think that the goal is not how how can I go it's how much can I stretch out okay so I'm gonna reach different I want to reach my legs the back I'm going to engage everything at set here's the thing when we're actually working low back to not button I personally like to try to relax and turn off the glutes so transfer hold at the top per second and turn off your glutes so they're not firing and think into your erector so if they into your lower back muscles and make them do the front instead so come down again and smell that reach Superman let's do this swimming now is another one so she's going to do alternating arms various again we're trying to turn off the lutz turn on the low back to really let it get strengthened and stronger so we're doing a little movement this is strong it can support all of our really intense lips now I'm going to show you the more advanced for those of you that need it you're gonna show me okay and let me go ahead now one thing I like and you can be get one thing I like is can you see her rear delts firing a little bit here as well she has a really nice back thanks back ups as well so this is working the upper back it's working the lower back and then she's also an inch low lengthening Co she's not where I prefer reach that is what we want Thank You sucks that I didn't feel that was a good one it's a good one it's more challenging than it looks especially with those two pairs two points what's happening to men savvy I've had advanced girls one will stay in class okay let's go on to the next exercise which you can stay right here we're going to be bird dog okay I think that and let's trim them a little bit more sideways I really want them to see your core and what's happening and maybe it's move back just a touch perfect and you can begin to notice how to do this properly good so she's again lengthening okay so I love that like just perfect go back and keep going what she's doing that's really important is she's not tilting in either direction she wants to keep her hips in at the same line okay and the shoulders in the same line so even when she lifts there's no there's no tilt in any sorry there's no tell to me the direction and when she's doing this it's very important because or is turned on and the curve I like the arm to come type in line with she's hitting back for yourself and she's working right across the back and out of those directors this exercise here while it looks of a very small movement I would say that for chiropractors and physiotherapists that I know this is one of their absolute making sure it's exercises and they recommend this to like almost all their clients new movies and vets alike so don't overlook this one it's a really good one to do before you do your like thing okay this one I love it's not sent by a lot of people I take it kind of goes back to my gymnastics when we used to lie on the vault like this and our feet came down a little bit lower but with this type of moves in and even start and complete it and bring it up and we used to do this and I feel that my bum and my little back folks but really strong movement way back when I was like 12 years old so I have kept it since X now this one here again she's working through the lower back but she's also getting an added bonus absolute Lulu is not around back okay but it is actually working down a little bit as well I like to do it close where the knees are close together so I'll do some my best and she'll come up and she's going to use blacks little higher yeah and then I like to use somewhere you start with your knees really wide and then you open why it's really actually start buddy really reach up and you feel that what not completely okay where are you feeling it that's up so right here it makes like sexy little marks where you shortstop yeah right there okay so when you're doing this one guys you can also do a banded which we do show in what video did we do that in that was the video which is also an excellent one but we're just going to show this one not doing hips today we're doing lower back now good mornings I don't want you to see this exercise on YouTube here on this video and say now I'm gonna go and I'm going to do it at home this one I feel like even watching her and you feel like you have the form you need to do it with a personal trainer the first time you're doing Y if you do it wrong you could screw up your back and instead of having a happy back you'll have a very sad back and we might not be able to train for a minute because you have a sad back now this one here one thing that's important is she's keeping her spine in neutral you see that neutral spine there the perk that I find and I'm not gonna ask to do bad form with a weight please don't because then I make her okay but what it would look like is it a lot of people and this is the number one error there's people right here they're there which means right there you're having bad things happen okay versus strengthening so she's keeping her core really strong she's really driving her chest up she's getting a stretch through her hamstrings and her glutes flexing her core getting the work all the way to the low back and coming up I like to give the glutes a little squeeze and the important thing to know is when you come up and give it a squeeze the core is contracted as well because if the core is not contracting at that top of the movement what people do is they squeeze their bum and then this tuck is okay which is bad okay so come up bum is strong core strong so I could do that at the top she's golden okay we have the lower back extension oh okay so we have one more movement to show which is the low back extension this is that I'm pretty sure you were - yeah I tried this one that's good okay so we're going to show extension firstly important when you get to this machine is make sure that you have been height set up correctly you can jump in and I'll show you how you know if your height set up correctly you want to be able to bend all the way forward and this you should know the bed board without it digging into your stomach or if this is sitting like here and you're bending forward and there's lots of space at the top it means you need to move it up until it sits right there when you're bending and not digging into so this looks like a good one for you yes I know we're good so let's do no weight first okay hey used to be like more wait wait now when she comes up the way that I'd like to do a couple of different forms with this one you can really get the bum really intensely on this Lexi oh sure squeezing together to another added bonus of hitting that little back on this machine is there's bum and there's ways to make it a whole lot of bum but that's not this video this video is lower back okay so any little back form where she is not arch let's show the note note first why don't you come up and just totally with no wait throw your back the no no okay so this is a no [Laughter] don't do that okay now short properly did that hurt okay that wasn't comfortable because you don't want it you don't want to you've got eight other brave a you don't want to come you know how to constrict them okay one up you don't have press into them like that in that position so come back down especially the cue of the week so what we want to do is we actually want to just slightly contract six attracting your abs and your luck so this is neutral this is slightly forward just enough to flex to your core and then you're gonna come back to her so she's gonna come on should that feel all the goodness through the low back and the glutes and then she's gonna come back down no she's very strong she's very you cannot you're 25 now just continue as a chitchat for a second we're almost there now put in for this for this one we don't want to go too heavy but you can slowly work up to a weight that just feels good where you're really feeling a nice burn through the low back a nice burn through the glutes and the hamstrings this is a awesome posterior chain of hop movement if you thought that this or that video you will know the records that I'm talking about which is a great video so you should also watch that which will put the description box below this one here one of my all-time favorite movements because the loop and the lower back be tired yeah I'm tired okay so you should definitely try to include your back day every single week as sap you said she does it at the end of bum day at the end of bum day and how often once a week once a week okay so all of this hard work I also like to do it once week so even at the end of upper back day or at the end of a leg day if you're not able to do a whole kind of like section dedicated to it just add some Pilates look up some good Pilates videos that include your lower back your whole core and that's gonna help you get all of the booty games because that's what this video is all about thank you so much for watching please show miss Abby has some love in the comments below she sweated it up and worked hard for you to show you great form so comments below also please like the video

[Music] [Music] 
hey guys I'm Liza Burke Lopez and today I wanted to share some of my favorite beauty products with you none of this is sponsored this is all stuff genuinely that I love that you guys have asked about so ready here we go let's start with the first thing it's this simply human mirror I kind of love it let me show you what it does watch it Susan is as soon as it senses I'm here it turns on how cool is that you want to have kind of the right light is one of the things I learned cuz in my bathroom it's a very yellow light and I kept doing my makeup and thinking I have enough bronze and all this kind of stuff and I'd go into light and it didn't look at all the same so apparently by using something like this when you look in the mirror you're gonna see a more of a true representations also magnifying so it's great for all those little details of things you might miss but it is Wireless which is awesome a lot of the ones with lights you have to plug in and then a plug flowing across your sink so this I charge it like every two weeks but I can use it while I'm charging it which is great and I just leave it overnight so the next one that I want to talk about and I've shown actually my whole process of this on my snapchat is not on the table here it's my eyebrows I got my eyebrows micro bleeded basically what it is is you lie on a table they do little slices with like like it looks to me like a medical exacto knife and then they put like a type of ink then they rub it onto the brows and then it crusts it takes about ten days to crust so I wasn't allowed to work out for 10 days that was very difficult but now my brows are relatively permanent for about one to two years and it will slowly fade why I chose to do that over tattoo is just because it looks like little hair strokes I'm not good at doing eyebrows so this was fantastic for me and that was kind of my experience I may try to repost my actual experience of mica lighting on the YouTube channel so if I do if you're subscribed you will catch it just I'm the same so guys my next one this one I think a lot of you know about but I'm going to give you a beauty hack for it are you ready so a lot of you already know about the Sally Hansen legs so I'm just gonna spray it right on my arm like that but this is the secret this is like the buff pad and it makes it so smooth and perfect um so this is from proton which is a tan product for stage that makes you really dark if you see it on the site also and you're just kind of like your regular beauty insist or whatever probably too dark for you okay just the buff buff is all you need but it will literally buff it in and make it perfection no streak this color wise gives you that perfect like stockings it's literally like wearing wearing stockings when you spray it on it will change the color of your skin it will stay on all day but then if you want that glitter glow and you want to be a little bit more shimmery I was recently introduced to this one as well which is the Melanie Mills gleam product and this eye layer on top of it okay so I wait for that to dry and then I layer it and then you can use also you can blend a little bit into your foundation if you want to as well and just give yourself a little bit of a glow so I've been playing with that and it's been pretty fun so these all together are kind of they're kind of awesome little kit so just this year I was just literally introduced to purple shampoo and purple treatments it's like a godsend I swear it's literally been life-changing my hair is no longer brassy um but I brought it expert in to give you a little bit more information about it on it can you pop up please so on it is literally she's an amazing makeup artist and an expert on hair color take out that hair show us all of the colors that you've done and she does her own hair yep beautiful all the silver and blonde and gray and tell us a little bit about the syllabus shampoo or slope treatments yes so it's called a purple shampoo so basically for anybody who have chemically treated their hair you're more sensitive to oxidization when it comes to UV rate so a little bit of color theory when your hair oxidize I change into a yellowy and then goes to greeny and then Brown me and for blondes that's you know that's hurtful color yeah so what purple shampoo does is as purple color that neutralizes the yellow and the brass and to make it more like white and blonde yeah again and how should we use it like how long should we leave it on perfect so you should use it on clean hair yeah I would say that I wash your hair you can skip your regular conditioner and just use this instead okay leave it on for about like two minutes if you're like a regular blonde like yourself yeah and you don't want to have like too many of like purple highlights and don't leave it on more than five minutes okay but if you want to like more blonde and white yeah then leave it on yeah and that will actually tone it pretty much okay anyway this way first two minutes gonna take you back to regular blonde yeah and then about three to five minutes it's gonna be like a blondie white okay if you keep going like like longer longer it'll turn purple yeah why thank you dude hair dance okay so I'm gonna show you my one of my current favorite toothpaste this is kind of like a natural health food store or toothpaste and the reason that I use these versus the ones that you get it kind of regular department stores is that those ones do have the fluoride in them some of them are animal tested there's just you know someone have sugar in them I mean sugar and toothpaste wait I know this is my favorite it's Jason so Jaso and this is the sea fresh and it's probably my favorite of the Jason ones but if you want to check the health food store and look for a new favorite hopefully a fluoride free with fluoride you want to be a little bit careful and you can read the different studies on it there's quite a few studies now saying that fluoride may not be the best thing for us to have in our toothpaste or in our water even for my in my shower and my sink I have filters because I don't want that for it in my water and I don't want it in my toothpaste so I'm doing the fluoride free and my teeth are pretty happy with it so the next Beauty favorite that I have is coconut oil so it can actually help with things like dandruff if you have dry hair you can do coconut masks so I'll do like coconut and egg or something that and literally leave it on my hair for moisture and protein you can put it on your body or skin care for moisturizing your skin you can put it in if you're making your own deodorant or something this would usually be one of the ingredients in it you can use it in your mouth for oil pulling so you can look up oil pilling I'll probably even show you how to do this on this channel at some point but you put it in your mouth and you swish it around for a while and it literally gets rid of bacteria people are even saying it's the new flossing right I'm so head-to-toe crazy beauty product I get the extra virgin coconut oil because it is the purest form of it I get the book I have to buy the bulk size because I go through so much of this stuff something a little bit more just fun and quick these guys think they're called short clips they're great anytime I get my hair done I just want to put it in a ponytail if anyone else is that way where you're just like you get home and you just want to put it up maybe it's done and then you'll ruin it these things like I'll just literally just like I can't do it cuz it's up but I'll just do that on each side and then as soon as I want to leave the house I just pull it out and my hair is perfect so no matter if it was in waves their curls are straight or whatever this saves your life from putting it in ponytails when you're home and if you follow me on snapchat you'll often see me just wandering the house with these in my hair you are a fitness person or if you just are looking for dry shampoo these are great these are my two probably all-time favorites for now this one is my favorite powdered one and this is my favorite spray one this one I love because you can see right here the color because you can see the powder right there is a little bit of a light brown kind of like my roots my roots are a little bit of dark brown but then I have blonde hair so you can choose the color of the powder that you want and the title is cake and it smells like cake so literally once you powder this all over your head you smell like a bakery and then this one as far as a spray this is a new one for me and the reason that I really liked this because when I sprayed it on all of a sudden I got all these complements of you smells so good what is that and I had nothing except this so I was like okay this is gonna be a regular post gym and this one you just kind of you just kind of spray just be careful because when you do to the spring it can look a little bit white so you have to make sure that you will end it otherwise you'll see like circles a white or you know spray on your head this one I know that this is my phone I understand that but I'm it's still a beauty thing because if you are like me and you on social media a lot and the lighting is not always great or you just want to be blown out because it looks good this then this is one of my favorite things okay this is my lumi light obviously it's a film case so you just kind of pop your phone in and out and it does that which is pretty freakin awesome and I think it deserves to be in a beauty video this as you can see it's just about empty probably been my favorite perfume I can't even probably for like three or four years now and I keep buying other perfumes and if you look in my my cap in my case area where I've got perfumes there's a good fifteen of them that are all full and I just keep grabbing this one because I just can't leave it so this is called pink sugar and it is it just it just kind of smells sweet and happy and I don't know yeah it's it's it's just lovely like kind of cotton candy for adults yeah maybe something like that anyway I love this I can't seem to find one that I love more than it so it might just forever be my perfume okay so these ones I love these are body products that I absolutely adore this is a shea butter and what I kind of love about it is that a lot of shea butters have a very shea butter scent which some people really like and some people not as much this one it smells so good it is a grade-a shea butter and it's it's an ivory all natural and you want to think about when you're putting things on your body your skin is your biggest organ and I know when we're looking for creams and stuff that smell really good it's easy to go to you know the local mall and go to whatever stores of stuff that have things that smell like Apple and berry and and I don't know really funky fancy names but they might have a lot of chemicals in them and a lot of oils in them that are not as good for us and because it's our biggest organ we have to absorb all of the stuff in those creams and it goes into your bloodstream and it goes to your liver and you know when you say I have to do a detox or whatever maybe instead of having to do all the time just don't put crap on your body so this is a fun way of tuning that this is a natural butter that you're putting on your body on your organ and your skin and it's really healthy for you and it also helps to it helps with stretch marks it helps with all these types of things and to go along with that this is black soap very very very natural it acts as an exfoliant it actually can they say it can help with anti aging and it can also if you have scars and blemishes and stuff like that it can help it go away they are awesome products and I love the way they smell and I love the way they feel and all that kind of good stuff so to wrap it up that was

Sofia since we're going to need ankle I'm going to show the fire hydrant please get me some bangs open ah that was bracelet one candy so we're going to switch it on you really only need one but you can be pre-prepared and put one on each ankle or if you're hardcore like that yeah it's opposed to on one ankle right softly oh god let's do it right so it's doubling that way so these um these arcs got heavy those early so I'll hop out of there are going all out my light okay so come on up yeah bring it up right here that is where we're trying to hit and bring it back down now the hole is not about how high or whatever you get into the acid you see you know what I love I love the involuntary shape if you can close up that muscle is quivering can you see it can you see I can see right there this is the muscle man it is perfect right into selfishness blessing which means she's flexing your bomb and a bomb off the side of it is which grows which is just a little tip like that energy all rushes and sighs okay so that is your ex can you get higher can you clearly see yes that's really really sweet but notice one thing is a chance keeping her hips quite square meaning she's not opening and children wrong shall we open it yes anybody open your whole body you're no longer working in really important that would be different show me the note one more time when your full body opens and you're just like up you're using everything but your mom basically when you keep it square like she was doing the whole time why she can't wait for us she's in disbelief okay so we've got one more exercise for home and then we're going to show some gym exercises are you ready now we can't leave the ankle weights on for this and just put one on the other leg because she is a very strong girl and nothing was a little bit of weight on this so I remember they used back in the day okay now I love you and we show them in another video as well but I can't get an intensity of it she's going to come up and she's going to sweat good and she's gonna flex I want to open a little bit so as you come up I want you to open and then you're going to do some chance so come up and it over this we can hit so we're hitting a lot of things we're hitting low back riveting booties meaning this side would be where any categories this is fitting like a pool area here and these are probably you love them they're like one of my favorite love me so much so much it also suit a phenomenal deal because fantastic and it will be all kind of crap yet because I'm just letting you know how to pan okay let's show you some gym at all sizes guys and I'm also going to list a little workout thank you with these episodes I do how to work on social equity in Syria here we go just stuff so this is one of my favorite exercises for hitting at the side of the farm and into the hip area so this is the abductor machine because you are obsessing away and here we go stuff is going to show you the basics of it now the one thing that I find that people do not do correctly so let's do the little don't do this okay is they just kind of open it up to do it without sweets just Jeff just open and close and open and close and open a post so kind of it's kind of like I compare it to you in a bicep curls okay okay not very much heavier kind of just stress in your elbow okay so same kind of thing you're just kind of I would feel like if you're not flexing if you just open what you're almost like kind of core that's not mom okay so what you need to do here says do this okay it would be when she opened she flexes so she's actually opening to a purpose as flexing the side of her bum and I hold that a little a second one one thousand what about you yeah how about that yeah and then feel she's controlling into why she comes out she squeezes and then she controls her way in and then be here you hear that he's not hearing clicking up to wait I also hear there nothing diggity noise that's because she's not and let her wait slim at Leslie's plan ready serious and that was a real plan don't waver it's a lazy you don't want to be slim some people with implants slim and I've seen throw throw all of those things there's no so yeah and fear she's touching each time that means she's lost tension you always want to attention so I even would say don't even come in in to a point of rescue want constant tension on those loops so the timing we're going to show you two different timings I'm going to show the time if she was just doing which is out hold for one one thousand and then control in and the second one we're going to show you are you ready we're going to go three seconds out in three seconds seconds okay one two three flex and one two three and one two three one and one two three and how did that feel I could definitely feel that the first time feels different than the first time you have a lot more tension okay so a lot more attention it was more challenging that time under tension and you can play with that and it becomes a whole new exercise yes okay Briana feminine division exercise where you go so we are getting to the litre squat machine now this one here that we have our students leaders what some people might have a half squat they might read on smith machine or they might just be like a typical barbell squat or just a squat with no weight whatsoever it doesn't matter what we've done if we can if you can see it we added a little and around Sophia's legs now where you place the booty ban we let the place it just about the knees but if your band is skinnier or it's not mentioned what's your pant material it may roll up and become a little mini there okay so if it doesn't feel that it's rolling for you above me you might want to put it below the knee so that's kind of get on in and she's in a start sweating the reason we put the blue man on is that when we're doing our squats because what technically they hit the whole leg believes they do just diluted disability of mass with the bat they hit your spot in your hamstring but a lot of people when they're doing on their knees fall in okay so meaning her knees would come together which is not a good thing and that's where we have week we get immediately so or side of the bomb by adding the band here as she squat chance to drive her knees open against the resistance of the band well squatting on the way down and up which makes a spider bump super strong it's also good for knee health and this is an overall great exercise for at ecole booty equaling in the side of the month so another expense okay so that was the exercises that we showed you today for the hips or the gluteus medius and as much as I know you want to look at fattening say this is probably all genetic but I've known South Korea for many many years and I see her in class new senior and training she works work very hard for this this is a lot of lunges and squats and deadlifts and all of these moves she's very familiar with yes yes on a weekly basis yup on a weekly basis so this is something and she doesn't you didn't wait Oh completely pretty heavy weight and she really contracts which is a huge part of it so or you guys if you want to get some lesson tips to remember you can't change your bone structure but you can definitely add some muscle so on behalf of me exactly once a thank you so much for watching please show her some love in the comments real a good job on that hood everything if you liked the video please give us a like share it friend hi Coco up and we will see you guys next week before 5:00 [Music] 
hey guys I'm Liza with Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and today I'm going to talk to you about my absolute favorite fat burning exercise okay and that is a special form of hit okay do we know what hit is already hit is high-intensity interval training it's when you do exercises like let's say you wanted to do sprints on a treadmill so you do like 30 seconds for it and then you rest their second sprint and then your rest or you're doing like you know jumping jacks shoulder press and push-ups back and forth with time and intensity that's kind of your basic hit but this special form of hit is what we're talking about today and that's called Tabata shubroto Tabata is amazing it is only four minutes long your whole workout in four minutes long amazing right like you're just like well that sounds great I will do that and it's super fat-burning fantastic here's why it's so great and here's why I dread it for something okay so the way it works is you set up your timer it is eight rounds in total you work twenty seconds you rest ten seconds okay and it repeats that way for eight rounds you take a full rest because if you're doing it right you will need it was created by Azumi Tabata in Japan and basically what he did is he did a bunch of studies and testing and he found that if you workout a hundred and seventy percent of your max on and off 20 seconds on 10 seconds rest for four minutes you will burn so much fat that's really fast it's really really fast if you get a heart rate monitor and you do your regular run and you look at what you're at and then you compare that to the hundred seven percent it's very fast and if you're not ready yet start with hit and then maybe try to batter when you're doing a true Tabata it's not just about the timing of 20 on 10 off eight rounds it is literally about you going as fast and as hard as humanly possible so again if you do want to try properly use a heart rate monitor not all exercises will work for Tabata they have to be something that is intense that you were out of breath after the first rep that's a good way to know if it's an exercise that you can use for to do better now here's why I love it one of the things that you get is you get that epoch okay which is your after burn and your after burn means that maybe you're only burning sugar for that four minutes and you're just like I don't want to burn sugar I want to burn fat that's okay because for the next 24 to 48 hours you're burning fat at for the next 24 to 48 hours you're burning fat only 4 minutes long all the fat is being burnt so good it is hard it is very hard I'm going to tell you some exercises that you can do at home and try this check your doctor first okay got this burpees are great I personally do Burpee belly flop and I hate it so much until after then I'm good and I'm happy I did it I like court flight or running or like kettle bell clean and press and I like MMA push-up I'm gonna show you what those look like right now are you ready these ones you can try home burpees are you ready whoo here we go I'm just gonna show you two because this is not an exercise video this is a learning video let's go so I'm going to show you just the Burpee belly flop which I like to lift my hands off the ground sorry I wanted to be cute because it was more of a tutorial so pairs down glider running is the next one so I've got my bladders here but if you don't own gliders you can use paper plates or towels on a hardwood floor saved your life right there safety twenty bucks okay so it looks like this and you're just boom boom alone alone alone as fast as you possibly can and that is your lighter running great the core rate for the thighs okay so next I'm going to show you the kettlebell clean and press now these here are kettlebells now I love mine because they're economic which means that when I do my clean which this part is the clean because it's not round it forego nama okay it's it molds to the size of my arm and I don't have to wear those wristbands so just just a little FYI the baby this for those of you looking for a set of homeland the exercise itself looks like this so I like to pop it off my legs and I pop them up and I do the full squat to the floor when I do them so you can only imagine 20 seconds of this as fast as you can if I was in a real one I'd be like what and I mean like killing it right now I was being I mean I'm a lazy right now letting you know but that's what clean car sounds like next one is MMA push-up here we go I mean a push-up also you'll notice I'll probably be out of breath after even just couple reps of it so I'm in plank position top in top out push up pop in pop out push-up or pop into the knees push-up ah uh-huh love those exercises would be great for treta let me catch my breath okay those are four excellent exercises to do for Tabata and again you want to make sure your beat even in the first round so the ones that we did today was the Burpee belly flop then we use the gliders and we did the glider running then we have the kettlebells and we did the clean and press and then we finished off with the MMA push-ups which you can modify to a knee push-up and even those of you that do regular push-ups might need to modify to a knee push-up if you're doing it properly I'm just saying happy fat-burning to all of you I hope you enjoyed this

can you grow your boobs through Fitness what do you think about to find out hey guys I'm Lizabeth Lopez registered to list a nutritionist and master trainer and I'm here with these two lovely ladies here you know I love to bring in at the hourglass girls to show you how things are done so I've got these two voluntold volunteers Christina and Keisha and they're going to help me demonstrate some things for this topic that I get this question all the time and I find it very interesting so I thought we would finally address it if you're doing diet and you're doing exercise together one thing people are concerned about will weight lifting actually make my boobs smaller no it's not gonna make your boobs smaller but if you are dieting dropping calories and dropping fat because boobs aren't mostly made of fat you may actually yes lose some size but but but proportionally right because we don't spot reduce it's not like you're gonna start dieting and all of a sudden only your boobs are gonna get smaller your face is gonna get smaller your waist is gonna get smaller everything might get a little bit smaller so proportionally you'll still look fantastic and healthier which is also great but there are some things that we can do while weight lifting and eating right will not necessarily make your boobs grow because again they're mainly made of fat we can lift them and create illusions of making them just look a little bit perkier and stuff it's the only way that I know of that you can actually grow your boobs if you're watching this video that might be your goal is through surgery of some type okay that's the only one I know of but keep in mind boobs are made in all shapes and sizes and everyone's are beautiful so hopefully you're also very happy with just what you got and you'll be happy to learn some of these tips just to make them a little bit prettier okay we're gonna start out with Cooper's ligaments this is one that I find actually really really interesting and when you hear about Cooper's ligaments what they are is it's kind of like if you picture you're wearing a bra and now this straps are getting loose that's kind of an example of your Cooper's ligaments being kind of loose and your breasts start to Sag so what we can do is we can actually teach you some ways of strengthening them and it's it's almost like tightening up the straps okay except for of just your boobs alone and that's kind of just giving you no idea of how the structure works so these two lovely ladies are going to show you a couple of exercises that you can do to strengthen your Cooper's ligaments so if you guys show the first one where we go in and out so they're pressing their hands firmly together and then they're gonna push away still drawing together trying to feel like that middle of the chest and then they're gonna pull back again this is something that you can do and just keep doing a couple more reps do you feel are you trying to get a home are you trying to like lift everything up and make your Cooper's ligaments a little stronger so they're gonna go back and forth you can probably do like 10 to 20 reps of this how often you could do this like twice a week like maybe add it into some part of a routine like maybe when you deep condition your hair we're all in the shower and we're just like I've got so much time I wish give it to you could do this here's your idea another one you guys can do can you show the second one please so they're gonna do a pulse so they're just going to push push and they're gonna squeeze and relax and then they gonna get and it is Glee's you know and keep going if you want to actually even save more time you could do it your kegels at the same time we could just be like popping everything so you know the kids so that that's like if you had to pee this has nothing to do with boobs to pee you just kind of and you want to hold it in that's your kegels and that keeps stuff other stuff tight down here you could do them both at the same time making your hair soft with your conditioner and tightening your you know Bowie bra straps and your Kegel area it's getting very personal the next one we're gonna talk about is actually a posture because if we let's take the hand off the chest right now isn't this pretty you don't have to years is fine but she did these braids herself by the way I'm just I'm not talking about boobs at all today I want to talk about everything but those that she did better self we're gonna talk about posture a lot of people are rolled forward to the shoulders or they have her fossa switch if you're sideways and I'm just returning her side was good thanks Christina if she's rounds her back forward this is kind of like car posis in the spine area so if we were to find a way to get her to lift up everything looks a little more hey girl he didn't have to do anything at all so we're gonna show her they're gonna show a couple of stretches that not only will you know you know make everything look a little bit more perky without any surgery whatsoever but also it's gonna be great for your shoulders and stuff too and your chest because we're gonna show you how to my favorite stretch out your chest exercise and one of my favorite exercises for overhead for the shoulders so here we go we're big we're somewhere else there like that right right okay so now we're gonna show an exercise to help make your posture all you know so christina is gonna show you here this is one of my favorites not me just for making your posture beautiful see her chest looks all lifted but also for shoulder health because why not double function so again she's got her back against wha her shoulders against the wall and what she's gonna do is she's gonna bring her knuckles and elbows and you don't need to come up they're just kind of while it just kind of like I would like that yep as low as you can and then just kind of out yeah and keep those knuckles and elbows against the wall and what doesn't thing I'm just gonna show you on Keisha once again so if your shoulders happen to be rule forward even a little bit this is going to assist with Oh in that nice with getting me right there thank you so much which is do you see it's right just not too pointer can I'll put that on like a permanent basis because you're gonna train yourself to kind of get here on a regular versus here on a regular let's show you the next stretch thank you Christina okay so now we're gonna show you that through the doors stretch I think that's actually the technical name for it Frazier anyways this one here Keisha is gonna show you so she's just gonna kind of I just like to hold it open with my toe right and then you're gonna put your hands on either side of the door frame yep just about there and you just kind of walk through and notice that she's got her shoulders rolled back her chest is lifted and what's great about this is no again it's not growing your boobs but it is just kind of opening your chest stretching you out and allowing you to be more up and just feel the stretch right across your chest so again know this is not making your boobs bigger it is making your posture really nice and opening up your chest if it's real good if it's tight again you know on the Tait chest versus that lifted it's just a prettier it's just nicer and the posture and it's it's again it's that nice lift so you can hold this for about twenty to thirty seconds I like people to do this after any chest day after any upper body day again twenty thirty Seconds but if you don't work out on a regular basis then maybe just like twice a week just on your own time just to keep that chest up and you can come back to us thanks TJ okay so now we are back at the actual weight training so dispelling the myths cuz some people think that doing weights on your chest is gonna make you look like a man and give you like the Manchester because we have wrists your shoe and weight less testosterone than a man so will it make them bigger again not so much because that is again fat what it can do again is help make them a little bit perk here it will help with the Cooper's ligaments as well as we do have muscles underneath the breast tissue so it can kind of like pop it up just a little bit and make it look all cute so I'm gonna show you my favorite for chest exercises well I'm not going to I'm just going to stand here and tell me what to do which is what happens in class also so they're used to it but they're gonna show you Cristina's gonna show are you showing the tougher version or are you whose I can't remember so Cristina's gonna show the home version and okay she's gonna show more of the gym version so if you're at home you can look over here and if you do gym stuff look over here let's start off with bench press on floor bench press on the first so here we go so kristina is showing it with a kettlebell so if you just have a kettlebell you don't have a bench or anything you can just do this at home you hold on to the horns okay which is the kind of the horns and she's just gonna bring it down and you're showing it same chance to just jump right in there and start working and then they can kind of just look everywhere at the same time it's fine so and with Keyshia when she's doing this she's got her head relaxed on the ball and her shoulders relaxed in the ball she's gonna bring them down just the dumbbells just kind of in line with her boobs and drive it up and when you come to the top don't forget to flex right between your chest so you come up and you squeeze together kind of like what we did when we were doing those Cooper's ligament if says so these are two exercises that you can do whether depending on the equipment that you have which is excellent next we're going to show the chest fly to the chest fly I'm gonna have Kristina do a fun fun way of doing it so now they're both doing chest flies and again I'm giving two to versions that hit your chest and again when you come up you want to flex right through the middle no it will not make it look masculine it's gonna help like the middle of your chest and that like cute line there so I've added abdominals to her is because she's strong and she can handle that if your back is not strong just leave your feet flat on the floor just like this and you can just do the beginner version like so and then Keisha is getting a little extra booty work because she's flexing her bum right now right super flexing her bum well she keeps her head relaxed on the ball but head and shoulders one thing that people do incorrectly when they're doing this is roll back a little bit more Keisha so you have to strain your neck to hold it up now do it this is what people want to do okay all the time I always have to correct and say just walk a little bit more forward to your head is relaxed and your bum is squeezing now your neck is relaxed and you're getting booty work like right everything so much better and they're both bringing it up and flexing let's go into the next exercise which is the dun dun dun Diamond push-ups he's challenging these are challenging they literally did this to see to see to see who had to do it from the toes and you had to do it from the knees I thought that was very hilarious so you lost so she'll be showing it from the toes and I'll be showing it from the knees here we go so they're doing the diamond position which means they're doing this that I feel like I'm at a jay-z concert they're doing this and this hits the chest just a little bit harder focusing in so you can see Keisha's doing it from the knees but she's still straped from her knees to her shoulders she's keeping her core engaged and Kristine is like an umber goddess Kali's challenge a but you guys get the gist so to push up like this okay we're gonna show one more exercise and this is an incline bench press and I like the incline because we do have we got the pest repellers major/minor when you're in an incline position like this where Kristina's gonna go it hits a per pack just a little bit more so if you're in like that dress with the cleavage at the top and you've got a little extra muscle under the fat just just pushing it forward just just love it that would be the incline press so let's show you that so you jump on the bench we don't have a bench he's just gonna try to modify this on the ball it's not super ideal the bench is just definitely better for this but you can fake it at home guys so she's just again keeping in line with her chest driving up and flexing and thinking into the top of her chest right through the middle and driving up and then Keisha's doing the same kind of thing we just kind of have her meaning also so she's just kind of hitting at the top of her chest a little bit more tada okay so finally actually okay so we watched you guys through some of the different stop okay guys so we walk you through some of the different areas that can help you with the perfectness so we walked you through the weights the stretching the exercises and all those trivia Cooper's ligaments but also there are some things that you can do to assist with not letting this a happen so preventative stuff as well so for instance I'm smoking and tanning are both going to break down that collagen a little bit and make things save a little bit more so not doing those potentially could assist with keeping everything a little bit higher and of where you want it for people that do get pregnant the closer you can stay to your healthiest pregnancy weight will help have less sagging or maybe no sagging genetics as well will play a huge role in this for post pregnancy with the babies and then additionally there was a fact that I found and it was really odd to me when I first read it because it like went against everything that I've ever thought to do with bras and I was very confused so I wanted to see if I could find any studies to back this up and I did find I found a study in France it was 330 women ages 18 to 35 over a long period was like 15 years or something to see if bras actually make a difference in your boobs saving or not and as far as I saw the consensus was that for us actually can weaken your Cooper's ligaments and therefore meaning like they're giving you the support so your boobs say I don't need to work or the ligaments and they actually look at week and a little bit seguir so what I got from this study was working out yes sports bra because you know impact thank you are we gonna I'm like talking any little words at a time you guys get any say no but apparently like if you're just home and you're just walking around and doing your thing ever since I've read this I maybe this is too much information but decided to not take the bra at home but while working out yes to the bra behind the camera they're all like but it was it was an actual study that hooked up it was actually very interesting it did make sense when I think about the muscles like for instance when I put this in the thought process that I have where people were like what are those called waist trainers and they say it makes my horse stronger it actually doesn't make your car stronger it replaces your core which makes your core weaker so I guess the bra might be the version of that where it's again doing it for you so anyways I found that very interesting you can continue researching that on your own I'm not saying this is what it is and just saying I read a study it's very interesting and it sounded relatively legit so we'll see but at the end of the day all boobs are beautiful whether they are real they're not whether they're you know big small whatever just love love your boobies funniest ending video so thank you ladies for showing us some exercises on keeping them up and loving them that's all thank you Christina Keisha for being very on display for all of you please show them some very peachy love in the comments below every week on generally Fitness things that's all see you next week subscribe and like peace out Daniel you're not helping [Music] [Laughter] of course this will go on the video 
hey guys I'm lied about Lopez and I'm a registered listing nutritionist and master trainer have you ever done like squats or finished your workout and you're just like I don't know I feel my quads I don't know if I feel my bum these are all issues that I find that a lot of women have when they're doing their like dates so I'm going to tell you an awesome trick very simple and it's called glute activation okay so what is blued activation it's basically doing slow kind of isolated very flexed exercises of the glute muscles before you do your workout or before you do your cardio to make sure that they're engaged are you ready I'm going to do it in Kuwait you can do it with nothing or you can get yourself some ankle weights and it will be even better so once I get these on I will be ready to go now when you're doing activation it's not really the same thing the full workout so doing it with nothing on your ankles is actually fine because the whole goal of activation is flexing so here we go guys and so you're going to get into this position which is quadruped ed you want to make sure I like to actually still do this I'll give myself a little punch in the belly and cut the reason there is a reason to it the reason I'm doing is to make sure that my core is also engaged and turn on because if it is not and your abs are relaxed then you're going to arch your back and then you're going to hurt your back instead of activating your bump so you're going to take yourself to that 90 degree angle at the heel and we're going to do 25 reps okay now I'm going to make sure that I'm flexing out on each one I realized actually a little bit hard to count and talk at the same time I'm knees my fingers there we go were at seven so hopefully you're joining in with me now what we want to think about right now is we want to think about the top of our bump so right there okay and really thinking about engaging and flexing it when you go exercise number two which is this one right here I call it fire hydrant think a lot of people call it a fire hydrant you can make the visual and guess why we call it that anyway anyone yes little awkward okay still accounting so right now what I'm trying to add wait is the side of my bum okay the side of my bum is also known as the glutton eat okay the gluteus medius and a lot of people say can I build out the side of my bum can i widen my hips you can not widen your hips through exercise but what you can do is you can build out the side of your gluts a little bit and that's gonna help a little bit with that curve fill it out a little bit I'm definitely activating my five more reps getting close to that 50 point and writing it with me too and one more okay here we go exercise number three this one involves a little bit of ABS we're going to crunch in so I'm going to contract here and kick away crunch in kick away so now I'm getting the top full part of my glutes a little bit of the erectors but because my core is holding really strong and tight um I'm not hurting my back at all I don't even move feel my back at all if you have a little bit of back pain maybe do this one without your ankle weights but if your low back is strong you won't even feel it and I'm definitely feeling the glutes engage I've got five more I hope you're feeling your bum this is gonna help you next time you do squats and you do this first you're gonna be like oh that's what it's supposed to feel like I've got three and two and one more bottle exercise are you ready we're almost at 100 that's 75 down plus behind and up okay so we're hitting the glutes from different angles and that is the goal in our activation little breathy go ahead so this one we're hitting right to the top all the way through I can feel even the sides activated because I'm feeling the side while I'm doing it and now I'm wondering if I should have done that too and balanced no good good I hope you guys are doing good as well hitting those glutes picture yourself in your little short to mix it all easier five four three two you're almost there and one okay one leg down I have you for leg number two I'm going to switch over to the other side and we need to do it all again ready and we're gonna begin so we're gonna start with that donkey kick okay so again we're gonna is 25 reps and the main thing I'm doing right now guys is I'm really just thinking about the flex so the top of every single rep flex it out control it Shh exhale inhale perfect and you should start to feel those glutes engage if you have ankle weights on you'll probably feel the hamstrings engage as well which is pretty awesome because again I like the double bump so the bump of the glutes the bump of the hamstrings good and I'm really thinking about that contraction at the top of the movement so we're not just kind of lifting and dropping flip for here we go three two superplex thing we got one more okay we're going into that fire hydrant again here we go about 25 reps of these drive it up now when you're doing these again thinking to the side of your bum that's where you should be flexing and the whole point of glute activation is thinking into your Flex making sure those muscles are activated this is how we activate them then you're going to hit thrusters squats lunges anything and the glutes are ready they're engaged the glutes are our biggest muscle but they still need to be activated or other muscles say I'm going to take the work on and that's how we end up with those big thighs because we start doing squats and that type of thing and the thighs just take over and I am feeling this I'm totally getting activated four three two one more here we go next one remember this is abs and bum so we're gonna inhale and exhale away inhale contract exhale away so when I'm doing this one I want to thank you to my core my bum my core boom huh so I'm really thinking about that contraction of the glutes contraction of the abdominals I'm getting I'm not swinging if you swing that's where it's not going to be as good for the low back because remember what we're doing is activation and inactivation we want to flex feel the Flex at the top of the movement so if you're starting to feel it I'm definitely starting to feel it and it feels amazing contract good for three contract too only one more to go guys here we go we're almost fully activated last one so we're gonna put that knee behind the other knee foot is still facing the ceiling pop it up pop it up I like saving this one for last because I feel the contraction at the top of the glute more on this one then in any other one of those four exercises so it makes me feel at the end like super super good now if you're at home and you're newbie you're brand new to working out and you want to do this just as your only glute training exercise sure get some ankle weights they're not very expensive they're very small you can keep them under your bed and you can really hit that bum bum and this is what if this alone will help you with toning five I'm up there are you ready for get excited three count down with me if you want to - last one whoo I feel good I do this type of

hey guys I'm Liza with Lopez registers listed nutritionist and master trainer and I'm here to show you done a new toy that I just got I did a little little shopping spree Best Buy and this is one of the things that I got it is called a power wheel and I love it because it's bigger and it's got foot straps so ho how do you use it so I'm going to walk you through a bunch of exercises that you can do so just in case you see it and you're like I think I can only do the ab roller no no there's more are you ready here we go I'm going to start off I'm gonna put it on first because just putting it on you want to make sure that you get your whole foot in there not just your toes and there is velcro here so I can adjust I've already made it perfect for my foot so I'm just going to slide myself in so if this is an awkward angle operating oh I think I'm in ok so I'm going to pull myself over and the first exercise I'm going to show you it's called a seal walk and you'll see why it's going to look a little bit like a seal as I walk along and my goal is to not have my toes touch the ground and you can go backwards - backwards is harder than forward but all is possible and the tips the core very easy you wouldn't think to do this but it's fun thing to do you know what some of my clients do sometimes because it made me laugh so have them do this and a couple down the first time they do it they'll start to walk backwards and opensees do this and it's very funny anyways I want to conquer companies so that happens - you don't feel bad it's not because you're not ready but you will be ready now - sighs next exercise is called a spider crawl so spider call is something you usually do in a push-up and you do your hands and legs but inscribe string me attached to this wheel so we're doing push up push up push up okay keep going push up and try and you can see the instability of my toes doing this is making my address too now watch my arms with my abs everything's working together actually I just sawed off the top of my head of one more so I need some weight Lenny sweet thank you just what I needed so I'm going to show you how to make this just a little bit supper so same thing we're gonna do that feel lock but instead of doing a regular pillow up now we're adding some weights and now my core is very excited it is firing my arms are hiring and I almost did the roll backwards that I just showed you so there's that okay that's something else you can do and we've also got plank which is pretty basic but it's now harder because there's that instability where I want to try to not roll back and forth plus my feet will roll backwards if I don't keep my core tight then we're going to show the neat hack and there's a lot more like things you've probably seen before now notice when I do this that I'm doing and I'm tacking so I'm not staying completely neutral spine which would be right here just a slight tuck and a flex with that core elected that little tummy punch Shh and I did exhale as I come in now if you make this a little bit tougher and now I can go into a V up or jackknife people call it different things and it's here so that is the Japanese for the dieppe but guess what you can still make a tougher you can turn into your niche atomic push-ups are you ready here we go I'm ready okay three amigos G up and push up and V up and I can make it easier also and push up right so the ways that we can play with that move and there's one more exercise that I'm going to show you now this is the one that you would suck okay this is someone that you would generally see this and think oh I've rollers now this one because it's bigger than your typical kind of small lab earlier that we're used to using it's wider the levers are longer which means it's less stable it's harder okay so the wider my hands are the more difficult but it will be and the close to my hands are together be easier but it will be in I notice when you do it you can go chest the floor if you want you learn from your toes if you want to but as long as you're doing with that good form where you're here and you have that slight crunch that's what we're looking for anyway I hope you enjoyed that that was some fun things that you can do with your power wheel if you're looking for one I'll put the details where I got mine in the description box below if you enjoyed that video please subscribe we put up videos every single week on nutrition fitness house all kinds this kind of stuff and like and comment so I can interact with you have a wonderful day and I'll see you in a sec she's out [Music] 
hey guys unless the sofas registered Holistic Nutritionist and master trainer and I'm here with my chiropractor dr. Lauren so your sink here at Ewa I get a lot of questions from the girls just on things like should I be rollin what should I roll when should I roll all these kinds of things and when I'm hanging out with dr. Lauren while she's hurting me you know it's the best posture making me better go to infer benefit of stuff helpful in highroad practice anyway we'll go inside but you're done if you can say mamas customers a lot of times I'll pick her brain on on the chiropractic side of activation of reliefs as dynamic warm-ups all the kinds of good stuff just if she stays there and fallenness I do as well so we like to chit chat so I thought it would be really fun to actually bring her today and share her warm up of a leg day okay and this is for back pain and booty booty activation what happens if you don't activate and release in all these good stuff before you're doing your like day you can get hurt okay you may not use the things that you should be yang into quadrants of your glutes and your hip flexors instead of your core and etc etc yeah so we're going to do literally we're going to check on the phone out because we're going to time it we're going to do a glenn beck activation so it's going to be exhibition dynamic warmup we'll deal right I have a lot of back pain I've had back pain for a decade now from sports that I played so I have a huge imbalance in my right side my right low back my right everything is a little bit smaller a little atrophied on the right and definitely not as strong so in order to ensure that I'm utilizing both sides this is the sort of thing I do before a deadlift or a squat day or like day of any kind to make sure my glutes are firing my core is on point and everything the whole day and she told me the warmup and I think it sounds great for beginners as well like at the dinner in Chania an advance yeah it's very remedial very very rooted medial exercise okay so we're going to start I've got the timer out we're going to do this in real time so you can do this with us and all you need is a bully man starts to learn decided to do the opening with her band I thought that was weird so I'm going to I don't think it's written I think it seems apparent I'm actually just really prepared for this shoot okay we're going to do clamshell that's going to be our first exercise we actually did a video about knee pain and we do cover clamshell a little bit in that video so if you want to reference that video there'll be a link below to look at that I'm ready to start working out I was very special we're gonna start with clamshell okay so dr. Lauren and I'm assuming is in a Tabata style yeah 27 seconds all around right so normally tomorrow would be eight but we're for time sake going to do it for and it's just a warm-up so we're going to do each side twice are you ready totally ready please explain to us what we're doing okay so with the resistance man making a little bit harder you can do this without a resistance band if you want if you're a beginner and what this is doing is 100% max isolating your glute need muscle which is very important for lunges squats keep it for fall she wants to show off her great ok so right now we're hitting the gluteus medius yeah right the side of the bum absolutely yeah I feeling the Bern I feel the Bern now if we didn't do this and we just started our night day what would happen like why are we why are we doing this well glutes is something that you want to be targeting in a lot of leg day exercises Kootenay will also throw off that if it's not active or not being used it will also throw off the balance of your pelvis so you could have pelvic tilt in areas that you don't want to have pelvic tilt and it could be causing some low back pain with that as well so really most of the glutes are important to activate but this one specifically I find is weak and a lot of people and perform we're reviewing it so we want to have heels lined up with your bun these are about a 90 degree and I like to put my hand right on the glue meat so I can feel it activators and we don't want to go we don't want to rule back or anything right you want to say steady if you're rolling back that you're going to be using different muscles you're not actually using your glue but it doesn't matter how wide the legs open here just as long as you can feel the burn and you feel it activate here okay we've hit the end of exercise one also sent to exercise 2 we're going to do bird dog we're does okay so for dog is an all-encompassing exercise and tuck anywhere I read it with the blue team and not know you can if you want but you can not do it if you want look at all this kind of Awesome oh my god did you say yes we just aerated a new thing really important where you want to keep with upper dog so I'm going to let Liza continue to do this while I'll show you what not to do on her okay don't look out in front us to leave the bed don't worry about them in so you really want to keep a really neutral spine when you're doing this and because I find a lot of people tilt a little bit too much when they're doing this and because they're not using their core and their glutes they're just trying to use their back so they're rotating way too much with with this exercise so really a neutral spine is ideal and you're working upper back lower back and glutes and your core to keep it stable okay so I'll show and I'll also show an alternative movement that I do this makes it can make it a little bit harder we're going to do an isometric hold so lies we keep going with Rex so what I like to do is just bring the leg up arm straight forward and you can hold it you can even bring it out to the side and you're going to get a little more glute activation with that as well I think she can do it I know she's capable of it I showing just doing both options for people we want more producers now on board do I meet that 10 second rest in between if I'm such a mess or should I be doing alright life for two rounds and unless like yeah so you want if you're doing and I like to bastard a lot because it just helps me with my balance can I do a whole cup that in the middle you're at might cool part you could I do the hold for 20 seconds and then I do the rest for 10 that's why it takes a 10 second hmm okay next would be a donkey kick okay with our amantha yeah this is going to get your big one's going to get glute max for sure you're probably having a little bit of a hamstring but again you want to keep everything nice and braced nice and tight while you're doing this okay so we're hitting glute max and what's the timing that you like to do on this you can count if you want some - I like to do three seconds up three seconds down sometimes the slower the better so that you can actually feel in control because when you start to go a little bit faster you get into more momentum and then that's when you start to swing your low back a little grass so as fast as you feel like you can go while contracting your glue and keeping your core stable without turning one way or the other and without overarching although that look how pretty it looks oh my gosh yeah I find I want to make you better just cause you got in there flexing but they're not they're both in their low back instead of their glue on my skin and then yeah Campbell that's how Alice mobility not strength is yes I'll come around actually you can fine I'll come around when we're here in Platte are you ready on the sucker punch you and Alec should walk down a flat round and I just I'll hang but if you're great you feel nothing it's like a flight is ticking off you and that blocks over your conscience to replace as I give a little private practice and I just make sure that this is in neutral which is which is fun for me and educational for them right absolutely I'm abusing clients and patients right no I do it myself all the time I got it working out I give myself a little stuck on your toes oh I got it okay we have what when exercise left to okay with and just similar so then we really do shoulder chapters four core okay Similac are you saying that this guy didn't actually ate it okay another one for glute Meade you're actually working with this exercise glute Meade with every step on both sides so one when you're taking a step you're working your right and you're balancing on your left side so you're working your left - you're working both sides no matter what direction you're walking okay so really important with this one to stay level you want to look at the same spot on a wall the whole time and if you're doing this you're not doing it right so that's what not to do does it say you want to do this you're gonna stay nice and level for that one half I have two girls hold during rest is that oh yeah that means oh please hold and maybe you can show them up on the next one's the half circle one you do with this oh yeah Sam circle and remember when I talk to help teach your classrooms [Laughter] [Music] never do you know my studio and alright I'm the cheater why I Drive I just don't want to get so much major gluteus you're happy happy circle nice to be here and I come all the way across tech all the ways that tech just a really you know hold a little bit again annual I'm holding up a whole-step burn feel the burn I was like this is like the natural hand position that I hold when I do this yeah I'm not really sure why Justin seems to me the wrong hand position without exercising absolutely one more I've desired shoulder top so we would I would normally include dead bug but served there's some other videos that you do dead body you explain that in and shall include those in the link below so I would normally do dead bugs because it really activates my lower abdomen and that's super important with actually Oh Mike my tissue it's actually in my mid thoracic right now whatever okay so really important to keep low back flat and that pulling that robot flat is what's going to activate your lower abdomen which is so central for squat lunge deadlift everything so dead bug just looks like this you want to keep your back nice and flat through the entire thing okay both sides I'm weak on the right so I tend to turn so it's a lot harder for me to keep my backs off but and once we gonna get on the planet plunge just a little more mean but there it is is make sure that your your knees don't go this way you want to keep them kind of right in line with your hip or even to be a little mean just slightly in that means slightly in front of them not me you look even meaner if you have a partner or on arrest is the students with us fine she beats me up so I'm rejoining their shirt again here you go so if I make her push her knees into me while she does this how much fun is that super fun it's fun it's fun if you feel that activation this is what I like during class at all time but we're getting activated it's the mic in my back I swear we go so you can do it now at the end of it you're pretty much set to go or do you still need to do warm-up set I do shoulder top the other one I do learn to do one more exercise the last exercise of shoulder tap starting in today those belly so brutally now I love look at her form and actually perfection and you know why because she's not she'd not go so she's not doing getting like all of it which is which is what I see a lot when people are doing it if they're all here right and that would be incorrect you hold a plank turn your no I do not I do not so if they want to make it more challenging bring your feet closer together I don't know if I can do that can we together you want to make it easier but they're exiting sophistical and no no rotation so it's an isometric work out of your obliques another way to make this more challenging is just to hold it so bring your shoulder AB and just heard for the fire 20 seconds or 10 or whatever the business in the record guys this is your pre workout workout we have seven last one okay so with it right this actually looking a perfect downing description so that after you've done it with us you remember the names of it you can like take a picture do it s Jim or you can just do it anyhow with a person any be already go get that bleep please get it get it get it get it this is poppy hmm now we have completed that's hard pre-med a pre leg day hey I need to work on this Laura just need to go do this right now okay great I'd like to thank guys to learn so much for coming in and again teaching us head opposed to having me do it just ended to the for healthy back healthy back healthy yeah let me back Nick obviously that's pretty much what we always do so I hope you enjoyed the video thank you and please soda for some love in the comments below be sure if you like it helps give our channel from life and comments as well I will see you at next week's video [Music] [Laughter] [Music]

of women to check that out in the description box below or maybe we'll put it up here I don't know I guess we'll see what happens but we're going to show those movement just in short in case you're going to watch it after what we're doing is we're working the transverse abdominus okay what is that it is the deepest layer in our abdominals and it is works like a corset so instead of wearing those silly things that people put on when they're working out let's build our own internal corset and make our waist cinch let's show them as may its benches these exercises that we're about to show specifically work the transverse abdominus layer and this is the layer that goes in it literally I took two to three inches off of my ribs all the way down just like this by learning to use my transverse abdominis about eight years ago when I studied Pilates for three years whew so you're going to do it tattoo get ready it's going to be about a 10 minute workout you can do it at home the only piece of equipment that you can use optionally it was stability ball but you don't need it it can be zero equipment but I'm at who's ready are you ready oh okay we're gonna start there is my ball it's rolled away here we go yeah we're ready so get on the floor with us get ready for the tiny waist workout got my phone to do some timing for us we're starting off with tabletop tabletop who's ready we are starting 10 wraps per leg tabletop looks like this pull your ribs together so we're cinching Shh everything draw make sure the knees are just in front of the hip okay and she's going to control bring you down and up that's two reps we're going to ten reps all on the same leg so three and up super controlled SMA you count the reps for me four which is a 10 thank you because I can't count in task at the same time but not out loud just tell me when you hit then okay you guys do going and I'm going to keep talking now I would like it even more slower than this because the thing with Pilates and the thing with tabletop is it's 100% controlled from what we call our powerhouse does anyone catch her cheating right now do you see her bringing her knee more forward than her hips I do so I'm going to keep my hand here she's on to her other leg control controlled down and control up think about here think about not letting your back arch what we want to do is we want to have what's called a neutral spine so we're not imprinting into the floor or pushing our bass into the floor but we're not not arching we're keeping that neutral curve that happens in our spine when we're sitting and everything is strong hold together and tight how are you doing with Emma here if you're doing it properly this should burn if your knees are too far forward and you're doing it you feel nothing so make sure that your hair is using at ten okay everyone ready we're about eight hundreds level one feet on the floor good slightly curl the shoulders off the floor head stays in neutral right there and we're going to begin pulsing perfect and putting a clock on for thirty seconds which we started now she's doing this movement notice what she's not doing is she's not coming forward and back she's actually keeping this area very still and the pulsing is happening here the breathing goes inhale two three four five and exhale two three four five she's going to let her neck come back just a little bit but we're still curling up here why because we're trying to keep neutral spine from the neck down push that chin back just a little bit more keep pulsing keep pulsing okay and roll over on your hands and feet we're going into bird dog good so quadrupeds position opposite hand opposite leg the fluff is like what we're showing right not what is going ten-four leg you count for me so here we go we're reaching and bringing it in go ahead spine is staying neutral these shoulders are staying level the hips are staying level we want to avoid any rock okay we want to keep this very strong I'm going to give her a little punch we're engaged we're very very strong through the core and she's keeping this again when we're working on a transverse and when we were working on the core slow and controlled movements work really really nice lengthened held isometric movements work really well as well she's switching legs now you can switch legs with her what you want to do is don't focus on up focus on length and contraction such as contraction or glute she's contracting down via rector's she's also contracting at her rear delts that arm to come up just a touch more there it is I like to try to reach it just about in line or just below my ear good as you're keeping that core strong things that start to happen it should get tired as you start to dip okay you start to over our step back because you're not maintaining your core strength ten and ten we are moving on we're on 200 level to roll back over so we started with hundred level one feet on the floor now we're going to go 100 level two it's going to look like tabletop at the beginning so let's come up and again make sure that you're not here you want to be here there to make sure those knees or the are in line with the hip or slightly forward and begin your pulses here we go flashes on everybody no important things to remember is the breathing inhale two three four five exhale two three four five those knees are slow forward we want to give it a little more curl up yeah but not too high keep those keep everything is slightly imprinted good and we're doing that pulsing our chin is pulled in so we're trying to keep in our head is just slightly back to try to keep that neutral spine meaning we don't want to be here we want to stay neutral long and flexing you're almost there's may pump a little bit harder we're going back into bird dog for one more round good we're getting there guys here we go estimate counts down and we're back to bird dog good and we're keeping that neutral fine we're lengthening reaching I can see up here is getting a little bit tired reach estimate yet good keep that core nice and strong and not too high with the foot reaches back good and contract and contract definitely loose on but this is the tiny waist very good that's where folks in but when you have a tiny waist it makes your hips and we look bigger it's the whole illusion hourglass thing a little bit of an hourglass technique training and we're switching legs and arms good and again we're reaching long we're getting that contraction or stay strong through and you ever notice ever punch good now when you're training I sucker punch myself good Morris banks okay we're moving on to hundred level three is the hardest one that's the country the Mogul fun animal to do so no animals fun and listen on so if you need to you can go back and this medium you can go back to level one or two otherwise convocations to level so solution and what you can for instance just calm shoulders off the floor with pulses in your back for everything in swimming people left lower back down here pulling the belly witness pulling the wrists together reading this when I'm doing when I should pull out if you can Foley here we let's change it sounds like I'm like in the landslide ahead bring it down we're flipping over to flank everybody to join us in place there will for once a day crocosec okay in the flank the plane has probably be most popular exercise for the transverse abdominus in remembering and we're working our internal corset instincts our waist permanently makes Chinese all the time okay so right in here just using opening our wrists together both being up early that's specified both temple in the low back in school allows if up all the way through again to the video please make sure to watch that great after this she sinks from the gluts are not in the air just doing a very nice job for elbows or right underneath your shoulders and maybe still touch more advanced and I'm going to have her pan streamlines yes right there perfect she's reached met but she wants to make this more challenging at all cheated also pointer toes and she went for it for almost their ethical low that's in good fun boy do it too we're also gonna flip over and step up to land on your back go ahead if you don't have a ball and also this is notable holding the ball right here push your shins and your hands into the ball and we're going to opposite hand opposite leg so bring it on down we're going to go for 30 seconds purple stars can all start early well as where you now in this one this is amazing for every transverse we're really pushing into the ball you're really pushing your hand on your opposite leg I like to have the visual thoughts stretches pop the ball you can aim your hand and your foot everything is slow and controlled through as you're coming up push in focusing through that powerhouse close the belly button and pull the cable note flattens Lord ask about five seconds left and hope you guys are feeling this code three two back into your plank position but this time was making a plank French this is an incredibly small movement very very small movement as maybe remember how to do it yep buried in Sudan so this one the bump does not go up in the air it's the opposite good so we are exactly three crunching and it's kind of like this so you go neutral and contract so your bum time is dead I call it ugly country tender and everything like services together in a very unflattering way but she's got such a good butt so she's crunching and subtracting her core and then going back to neutral with just strong force to contract and neutr a contract and neutral this one then properly I don't want to make it through a minute you can I squeeze so hard sometimes at Linda 30-second mark I'm now on my knees why don't you show up on your knees just because he's not in here goodness if you can track but and a mutual contract and neutral ethical tense straight again yeah for that form like ten seconds everybody you can do it with pulling the belly when you sucker puncher again and we're good let's go see we went more second three seconds two seconds let's get some party when they're at your running one thirty seconds of mountain climbers I'm going to and again hmm now this way I also like even looks a little bit car delay so it's not as them all the other aspects enjoyment returns or servers slow controlled focus but fear she's keeping that really nice neutral find her body's not up in the air she's almost in a plank but running and a plank how great that we can conservative campers for also getting some other awesome at muscle she's sweating it out she's got 12 seconds I will be better here with her for my hands are right underneath your shoulders look at that nice neutral neck and spine everything is dead about three seconds you guys two seconds and you're going into crisscross is the final master guys I know and get to warn you we too old and I've been ready I am a prince crossing in underneath the booty we're spelling let's do it Oh boom there is there it is there it is and she is contracting and contracting belly button is drop line it's pulled in we tabled a fold up because that is called the what well does it but we are lifting up we're finishing the way she's lengthening her leg pointing her toes thinking everything is coming from the Pilates power out of boom boom make it make it again Bri bit let me hear you there it is Chris neckline is breathing good and go [Music] through again focusing

hey guys I'm Liza with Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm going to show you probably my favorite shot drink that I've ever made and I started having it probably five times a week I haven't been sick and usually when people get around around me and they're sick I might just catch it and I have it and it's been like a year I can feel my tummy feels flatter my digestion feels better and these are all things that this does so are you ready I'm gonna show you my fire shot you see have two machines here this is just like a citrus juicer and a little like a mini blender if you don't have either of these it's okay you can you can hand juice the citrus if you want to and you can use any blender for the blending these are just the two that I have here so we're going to get started with the lemo the lemon and I'm going to cut this in half but we are going to use the entire lemon okay so we got the lemon now reasons that I love the lemon it is great for your liver it's also rich in vitamins of course just half an orange we use full lemon half orange ready I love the oranges these are also great for vitamin C which is amazing for our skin it's like a little beauty food right here and it makes it taste but it makes it taste really sweet so I'm going to start adding everything into this guy here until it's all in there apple cider vinegar or ACV there's like a little bit of funky stuff happening right there that's the mother this is probiotic rich what does that mean it means it's really good for our gut it's like good bacteria not all bacteria is bad there's a lot of really good stuff in there and this is going to help with that really good platforming next we're gonna go for the honey now this is raw honey it has some really good benefits to it there's vitamin B and you can remember this as bees make bee there's also if you get allergies like seasonal allergies in the summertime or anything like that having raw local honey can actually help make those allergies go away tumeric or tumeric look how nice and bright and beautiful that is has something in it called curcumin which is really good for anti-inflammation so based again with that tummy and just the whole body to face everything of just being deep puffed and we've got our ginger the more of the ginger that you put in the spicier it's going to get this is also great for digestion so again flat tummy are we seeing where it's always flat so we think and just really good for our gut so I'm going to throw all of this in I like spice you don't need to go as intense if you're going to do your own apple cider vinegar juice make sure that you do add water I add about half a cup to 3/4 of a cup in my little drink and it gives me more of it which makes me happy because again I really enjoy it but it also makes sure that it's not overly acidic for our throat and our tummy okay and here we go I like to give it a little just shake - sometimes the honey sticks to the top now everything is the bottom ready things noise okay that's about good I usually do about 20 30 seconds if I can kind of see when I do this any big piece of the tumeric or ginger may get a little extra good yeah that looks good doesn't that do you see that color I just love this guy's look at that beautiful rich color gonna pour this in oh my gosh Shammi okay I'll stop sorry it's so good there's just so much medicinal value to it and I'd literally notice a difference in everything little note for you when you do it because you're thinking of that vinegar you drink it afterwards wash your mouth to make sure your enamel is nice and safe little tip tip for you and then about 20 minutes later if I have a meal now I've got great digestive enzymes happening in my stomach if you liked this video please comment below let me know if you tried it let me know if you have some other recipes that you like to do with your apple cider vinegar you can share it on the share links below and of course subscribe to the channel because we put up videos every Tuesday and every Friday nutrition fitness health all this kind of good stuff and put a comment because I read them like it that's it I love you guys peace out bye just like this I'm just gonna put them in austega these are red grapes and one of the things that I love about red grapes is that they have a nutrient called resveratrol now resveratrol is anti-cancer

hey guys I'm lights of a Clopas register - listing nutritionist and master trainer have you ever worked out and you're going hard and you're wondering why is my bum getting smaller big question here it all the time I'm going to give you my top ten tips for this to not happen anymore and actually build your booty properly here we go first thing is that you might be doing too much cardio by doing too much cardio what could happen is you could actually be burning away at some of your muscle I know that sucks right you're putting in all this work and you're actually doing the opposite by losing some of your butt muscle on top of losing some of your butt fat which will give you a smaller but point number two is that you may not be activating your glutes and I've actually done a video right here on YouTube that you can check out put the video link in the description box below so you can learn how to activate your glute but you may not be activating your glute prior to doing your workout and in that case a lot of people will end up getting inc becoming quad heavy what does that mean it means the Front's of your thighs become very big and your bum not so much okay so the answer to that is activating glutes prior to your workout you can do it with nothing you can do it with booty bands you can do with ankle weights but you should do it okay the next one is that your hips might be too tight if you sit most of the day okay you you watch TV you driving your car long distances you're at work at an office your hips might become tight or some people just have tight hips even if they're not sitting all day but if your hips are tight what happens is it can inhibit your glute activation okay so what you need to do is you need to actually loosen them out before you do your workout how do you do that there's two ways that I like to do one is you can use some type of trigger point like a small it looks like a little lacrosse ball and they have like trigger point balls or you could do foam rolling but you want to release your hip flexors okay and then you can also do hip mobility movements point number four you need to look at the whole picture here's what I mean sometimes you might just be so specifically staring at your bum right so every time you go to the mirror you're not seeing your new sexy sculpted shoulders and your abs coming and the only thing you're seeing is I think my bum might have got smaller or it's it looks the same or everything's changing but my bum so to make sure that you're actually looking at the whole picture and you're not becoming like funnel vision just on your bum bum is you should take a picture take a before picture right when you start working out so that you can then look back at it maybe a month or two later and see like oh wait my bum actually is it it's a little perkier than it was before and holy crap look at my abs look at my arms look at my legs like all this stuff has come along but you need that picture otherwise you're seeing yourself every day and you're not going to see the changes okay so looking at the whole picture point number five is that you might be focusing on toning exercise for your bum when you should be focusing on building exercise what's the difference if you're doing things like bodyweight squats or your unfortunately doing something like the squat challenge which I don't like it all sure you're going to tone your bum you're going to tone your legs which just means that you might be getting slimmer and things might feel kind of tight but you're not actually changing the shape we need to have progressive overload we need to add weight to actually see a size change in our gluts okay so you need to be doing things like heavy weighted deadlifts or heavy lated squats and really put some muscle into that bum bum if you want to see it grow okay so that's toning versus building number six is that you might be training your abs like a bodybuilder what you want to do is you want to actually be doing things that are going to simchah waste now what does that have to do with your bum the whole body is kind of based on illusions sometimes so if your waist is a little wider it might make your hips look a little bit more narrow whereas if your waist is a little more narrow it may look mate look like you have some hips and some bootay I'll kind of go in like this but if you're training more like a bodybuilder and you're doing things like really intense cleans and you know really heavy crunches and stuff like that versus doing more Pilate style of cinching cinching breathing then you might actually block out your waist so I'm not saying don't train your obliques you should train your obliques but I just want you to think the obliques they kind of come all the way across and if you're going heavy and you're going right into kind of a lateral area of the obliques to the side of the waist with heavy weights you end up blocking yourself out additionally if you're doing too much of the powerlifting style exercises where it's very core intense you might again be blocking out your waist and taking away from the look and the illusion of the curvy hips and bump up so number seven I feel like a lot of you ladies are really gonna like this one are you ready you might not be eating enough where food and bigger booty but I don't mean in the form of fat if that you know anyway you may not be eating enough and what that means is if you're doing those heavy lifts and you're working hard in the gym you're doing those squats and you're doing all those heavy lifts but you don't have enough calories to actually maintain this new mask that you're building you don't get to keep it it's pretty much that simple so you have to make sure if your goal is muscle gain that you are having those appropriate amount of calories okay so keep that in mind not enough calories goes away okay so number eight is actually kind of like it fits right perfectly after the food one because we're still talking about food and that's that you might not be having enough protein okay so having enough protein here's how I like to gauge it personally everyone's going to be a little bit different I feel that most people should be somewhere between the point six to a one gram of protein per pound okay so for me because I'm a little bit more active I'll try to stay somewhere in the point eight to one gram of protein per pound so how do you calculate that if I was 130 which I'm not right now a little heavier than that but very simple math would be somewhere around the 104 to 130 grams of protein per day would be my protein goal to be able to maintain all of this muscle happening up in here so number nine is that you may not be giving it enough time and I know that that's so boring and we all want it like immediately but building muscle actually does take time so you need to kind of say to yourself this is my goal I'm gonna put in this much work I'm going to take that before picture and I'm gonna have little mini goals kind of like with any goal you want to have the mini goal and then the big goal so personally I've been doing glute training since I was 12 like seriously and I've glute kickbacks and all that kind of good stuff so so give it the time and you're slowly but surely going to see that bumbum form so give yourself some time so that you can actually realistically get to your goal okay are you ready for number ten this is the drumroll finish and this is probably one of the most important ones is again it's on being realistic we all have different genetics guys so the main thing is you need to look at your own derriere and say I want to have my best bum bum alright like your best booty your best whatever you can't look and say wow look at her I want to look like that and then you're sad that no matter how hard you train you might end up looking better different whatever like we're all just different so you have to kind of assess what's going on be realistic with it follow all of the things that we just talked about okay be consistent with it and you will build a great flat okay so at the time we do genetics and you'll have an amazing bum

[Music] hey guys I'm Leslie Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and today I am going to share with you all of my fun well not all of my but two of my favorite printing techniques and to share this information with you I have two beautiful models / hourglass workout athletes here this is Desiree and this is Sarah and they have nicely volunteers but all in told to come in and do these prints so we're going to start off I'm going to have Desiree show I'm going to show you two different roles the desert is going to show the first one so we're going to throw her over onto this treadmill Sarah I will see you in about 10 minutes gosh or the second one do you wanna have your feet safely to the side and out of the way she's a pretty good runner so I'm going to start her off on a two minute warm-up I pretty much always do a two-minute warm-up before my sprints I like to always have a an incline so does let's take this up to an incline of about let's go one and a half if you don't have an incline it does not hit the bum as well should I repeat that you don't have an incline it does not hit the bum as well so I'm going to have you warm up at around seven okay so where you are officially in warm-up mode so once it hits two minutes her warm up for me is done so we're doing a pull two minute warm up here the style that we're doing right now is a really intense challenging style we're all done by watching the treadmill clock the goal is she's going to take a full minute rest okay then we turn the treadmill up and we're going to start our first sprint we're going to choose a number that we feel that she can sprint for an entire minute okay it is a very long sprint most sprinter about 20 to 40 seconds so this is an unusual sprint let's call it but it is one of my favorites as far as really challenging your muscular endurance really challenging your cargo really challenging sprint they've got 20 seconds to go she's about to have a full minute rest and the reason that I'm going to give her a full minute rest is is I want her to be fully ready and charged for this sprint so she's coming on in three and two hands on first feet to the side safely that's what are you usually sprinting for let's try that again over nine hold already we're gonna we're going to do a first grade at eight she warmed up at seven okay so she's gonna go for like a run sprint okay this is the long Sprint's that we do the one that sara is going to do who's coming next Sarah's doing very short ridiculously intense right okay so these are two different styles so what she's going to do in the next 30 seconds is she's going to aim to sprint for a full minute with exactly 30 seconds rest we're just going to go for 10 minutes just so you can see what it looks like and how much we go every ground but in real time I like to do this for a full 20 minutes and she's going to start running with the treadmill here we go and we are running and she's not going to let go until she feels comfortable she should be able to get through at least 45 seconds if not a minute each time as long as she's able to hit the full 45 seconds to a minute I'm going to keep going up each round each time she'll go from eight thirty Seconds rest the next time will be nine feet of nine thirty seconds rest the next time will be ten thirty Seconds rest and for her to do her best Dejan for the full 30 seconds if she can't at any time make it to 45 seconds that's when a number will stay the same and she'll just be challenged to keep trying almost five four three two and now we're going for exactly a 30-second risk so when it hits 4:30 she's going to get back on again so now that means we go all the way up to a speed of 9 we're aiming to get a full minute run each time every time she makes the past 45 seconds it goes up a full number again so we're starting in 5 4 3 2 hands on safely good we don't let go until we feel good with that run for the bolus that we're making it till 5:30 as long as we make the 5:15 that's what we want does so everyone make it to 5:15 this is high intensity give me another pigeon come on come on - you guys you guys you got to keep going at least Alexa Tina you know you got to sing it ok she's still going that can happen good good good good good whoo she's still going she stood line ok so end goal was 5:30 but she made it to 5:15 so we are starting again it's at the 30 second chance starting at 6:45 and we're going up in ten oh yes what ok at 5:45 so she's got 10 seconds it gets more challenging every single time because it's very short rest this is really going to make her endurance insane it's time girl time whew okay Co she held on until she was ready we're going to try to hope that she makes it a good 45 seconds okay so we're hoping that we get till six and a half that is the goal whoa it's cut it's after I know it's fast is bad oh my gosh whew okay so oh she's back on she's back on she she feeling it she's feeling it okay good stuff good stuff good she's got 15 seconds I want you to find it big strike big stride okay she's on rest now she's on full rest so we're going to give her we're going to give her till 7:00 we're giving to give her all the way to seven we're going to stay at the speed of ten okay the reason we're doing this is high-intensity interval training this is an amazing fat burner she's still going to be burning fat potentially 24 to 48 hours from now if she gives it everything she's got about 15 seconds rest going to regain some energy oh my goodness are you ready in for entry into timeout here we go okay goal is to make it to 7:45 you got this you got this you got this you got this here can you take the rest take the rest if you need it it's okay always say safety first now let me tell you when I do these I didn't get good at them for about two months but I got really good really fast like it was amazing how quickly that I got better and like my video to max my energy everything got better so it's something that picks up really quickly so she's starting again in eight and a half we've decided to tennis her number ten is her number so the goal is for her always to aim to get to that 45 seconds to a minute okay I've worked with a thirty Seconds rest in between salmon whoo so she's starting at 8:30 so her end goal is to make it somewhere between 9:15 nine-thirty yeah as I said the first time you do this you're going to feel like it's her first time it's lonely it's a little mean for me to have her do this on camera or China she's ever done it so we're going to do we're going to one final one just for you to get the idea of it we'll take it to a cool-down so we're going to take her down generally as I said I'd like to go right up to 20 minute mark and just give me a little jog doesn't I feel like it's like walking now some people jog over but it feels like it's nothing so your goal guys is to continuously try to go up as long as you can do the 45 seconds you keep going up one okay as soon as you can't make it to 45 seconds just whatever remember you ended that maintains to be your number for the rest of the 20 minutes or so and you keep trying to make it to at least 45 seconds if you keep failing at 15 seconds then you keep failing at 15 seconds okay but eventually you're going to keep getting stronger which banks oh my gosh so much fun oh yeah next up we've got Sarah Sarah come on over Sarah's been excited for this all day she's going to put her feet on the side of the treadmill and we're going to start her off so once again we always have some elevations okay so I'm going to take Sarah up to a speed of 7 over warm up because she she can run so she's gonna put her hands on the side and she's slowly going to come onto the channel she's gonna run while keeping her hands on the side and she won't let go until she feels safe so what Sara's going to do is something different than what does we did okay what she's doing is she's just doing failure test just all-out failure defense so after her warmup we're going to go to a level that we think is pretty pretty intensive some more advanced version of this okay so she says she can sprint at 9:00 so I'm going to probably take her to 9:00 from her very first one okay our goal is that her to go and Bowl failure there's no time that we're looking for we want her to go in so she can't go any more and she has to safely come off the treadmill then we're going to actually let her have a very long rest okay so she gets to rest for about up to two minutes or so if she wants to work she needs it until she feels ready to go again so this is a different style of sprinting until she goes in 15 seconds we're going to keep going up and number entry into hands on the handlebars clap your feet off okay so she's also going to get a full minute rest during this rest I'm going to take it up to a speed of nine so that's going to be our first sprint and our bowl once we start in 40 seconds it's for her to go for as long as humanly possible okay so she actually can't go anymore and we wonder if it out long she can do that don't let it move you've got 30 seconds we want her to get a breath back we want her to be full energy every time she goes starting four three two time on okay here we go so our goal for the first one let's see how fast you can go how long she can stay on and she's staying on again and so she actually can't do any more again this is an advanced one because this one is if you have to know when you should get off for safety so so far she's passed that 15 mark which means the next time we will be going up to 10 I already know that it's already confirm but now it's kind of like a battle against your own brain how long can she stay on how long can she do and this is kind of fun because you can see yourself get better you can see that before started at 9 I can only stance in seconds but now I can get on a 12 in Sam for 30 seconds and that's really fun because you got that you know what I mean plus you're challenging yourself all I want to make it so minute I want to make a 2 minute United step 45 seconds right now as she worked in I'm very impressed right now Sarah we kind of started higher we'll really okay she's about to make it past the minute point which means she gave me the wrong number is what it means it means we probably so she made it for a full minute so I'm going to take it up to 10 now oh my goodness and I'm not telling her when to stop and when I do this or personally Sarah if you want to go for a little walk I tend to go for walk because I'm probably going to rest for up to three minutes is the max well ever read for it's usually about a minute to two minutes and all this back off I'll just kind of walk I might do some hip swings if I need to just to loosen out loosen up the hips but you might need it and books we'll see I do it quite at least a minute you want to see so you're still panting you can't get back on while you're still family so there's something called a pony and that's your muscle energy right now she's still panting I know that she's still trying to get HPV vaccine still trying to get full muscle energy back at 30 seconds you generally gain about 50% of your muscle energy it takes about three minutes to get 100% of it back so right now I know for sure she's not ready yet I want every single sprint to be with almost complete brand-new energy again when you do this you only need to do about five Rams and you're done and you're done and it's she been shown like studies fat-burning wise to be better quality more muscle retention more fat burn better hemoglobin or moans better testosterone building all that kinds with it stuff in this then a steady-state 20-minute run you feeling good yeah okay someone set whenever you want because it's not buy time all right and she's off to the races okay she started she didn't need to but she happened to start at exactly six minutes so it's easy for us to check and see but again this is totally gauged by her and nothing else the main goal for me is I'd liked her to see I'd like to see her do about five of these in the total okay so five in total that will take you anywhere from about probably up to about twenty minutes okay but you're only doing five Sprint's okay so this time she made it thirty seconds okay so that was very good so she's going at ten but guess what still about fifteen know what that means it means you're going up a whole one again so we're going up to eleven now she doesn't look as worn out as I think that she should be if she'd gone as long as she could have so I feel like she she might have wimped out just a little bit feel like she probably could have gone four maybe even five more seconds feel she's not panting when I do this it looks like I might be about to die got it and you look like you're ready to print again okay so this one coming up here into the gallic they say they say don't be all liar the back safety first always I fighter yes okay don't get actually need to okay we're now at a speed of 11 she started at 7:45 last time she mated for a full 30 second print do we think that she can make it for another 30 second sprint I wonder I'm just curious I fear she's pretty pretty strong hump you pretty hard now it's being lured this was the work that it shouldn't look like when you are doing an all-out sprint pretty much you just hit 20 seconds estimation Clara made so so work work work for Sara this is great that was excellent that was really really excellent she made it for like a good 20 seconds at least now do we see that she looks a little bit more tired than last time okay so she's done is up three she's on three we're going to show you one more and she did make it past 15 seconds she made it to 20 seconds so it means we have you ever done 12 before Sarah know you might be very localized so just don't fall right it so Falls there should be no panting she needs to actually be a hundred percent good again so don't start early chill purple right now is just to make it to 15 seconds okay and if you can't that's okay hands in the hands of our safety first I don't want to see you over there this time at home please make sure you stay safe guys get up when you need to get off the last one we're going to watch your guy see how she does Oh give your little boss at home she's going for it those are some nice old guys a very very impressive this one she's gonna make it I think she's not make it okay we love parties okay so here's the next thing now technically because she made it past 15 seconds turn expert would be 13 but out of safety because that was her first time at 12 she just made it to 20 I would probably keep her 12 okay just for this yes yeah we're not going to do another one no you're done they understand that I really hope we will turn that down just so you can hear okay right after this I would take her to two more twelve because she's going to do five in total is that whatever five total sprints okay the next one be twelve and my goal of her instead we just try to hit 20 and just try to do it again then we would have a full rest and take her to her jog at the end and that's what it looks like to do maximal sprint till death okay that's when you know when to move or not to move and the magic of these again is that they're only maybe 20 minutes of your training in the day but they burn fat for the next 24 to 48 hours when you're going at this intensity so they are amazing they increase the update they work with your testosterone they work with your stress levels all of these things they do all of the best things that unfortunately long study states is not they kind of do the opposite of study states so this is where it's at if you want that quick fat burn you did great how do you feel yoga you feel good Dudek so I hope you guys enjoyed that video thanks you Desiree wherever you are thank you Sarah so much for being my victims for these amazing sprints for me I do these a max of two to three times a week never two days in a row you want to space them out if you did enjoy this video please subscribe we do videos that are fitness and fun and nutrition every single week and just subscribe below and comment and please show some love to Sarah and Desiree in the comments because they worked if you try it let me know I will see you guys next week peace out bye [Music] 
I'm here with the beautiful chatty Dunmore now chatty is a legend in WAFF because she is a repeat champion over and over again but she's made a change no bikini and she's moving into fitness model this year now tell us why the change Mirai inspired me categories because I felt like it was time for me to step it up and that's what I did yeah and my training is of course got more intense and mostly eating with diet no more bacon okay what's on a new diet it's really clean I mean I can't take carbs completely out because I have a kidney disease so I have carps in every meal and water depletion is different for me too because of my kidneys so just drink more than usual and actually makes me harder that goes to show you like no matter what's going on with the body there's always a way to tighten up like this no excuses you can do now favorite body part what's the favorite body part to do in tell us your two favorite exercises to build and shape your booty squats for days and lunges for days I think you can't go wrong and you could do them anywhere so if you're on vacation if you're a mom you can just squat your way everywhere and she is a mom of how many kids one have one daughter six-year-old yeah so you said squatting there's a million ways to squat what's your favorite I mean it's simple hey so what kind of what kind of weights are you doing when you're squatting because having people a lot of women they're either afraid of going too heavy or they weren't you heavy so weights have completely changed my physique so I think that it's important that you you have to live you know heavy now that's all good some people already know some of that stuff but they want to know the nitty-gritty of how you build this what do you mix it's 245 six sets of lunges in static lunges too so I make sure I've been the front knee keep the back leg straight and I just go for it yeah and how close offseason do you stay - this physique and if it's close - how do you stay that way four pounds so my I think I gained muscle though so I think that I stay pretty lean all year round I think also it helps that I'm tall and it's a lifestyle for me so I can't really fluctuate my weight because of my kidneys so I just kind of lift heavier and IIE better no bacon no bacon okay when I wish you all thank you so much jack you so much 
and I'm starting a brand-new video blog and this one is going to be focused on Candida so step right to it what does can't get out why are we talking about it and and how can I help you up so Candida is basically that something that is already in your lower intestines and it's okay if it's there it's just supposed to be there in smaller quantities and what's happened is in North America because of our eating style because of the not great diet that we have a lot of us are getting Candida some of the ways that it can be caused is is birth control pills is antibiotics and is our standard American Standard North American diet or the acronym sad standard North American diet which is very fitting which is very high in sugar and very low in in good quality alkaline foods like like lots of fresh vegetables and some more raw foods so let's go right to it why is it that really don't want to have Candida or why is it that we want to work on making it go away so Candida basically it is it's in our lower intestines which our Lord has sent it's supposed to have some good and some bad bacteria it's it's it's supposed to be this kind of like the good bacteria is there in the bad bacteria the good bacteria kind of keeps the bad bacteria at bay it keeps it from partying and then going nuts and having fun and when we get rid of or we lessen our good bacteria through things like antibiotics which kills like almost everything down there and lets the let the bad bacteria party and kind of go throughout the body or birth control pills are just too much sugar this lessens our good bacteria and lets the candida party so that you need a if left to party and to have fun in the intestines what it actually can do is it can actually start to migrate through the body so if you can kind of you can picture I guess back to school when you see the video is on sperm and how it has that tail and it kind of does that to your body it's supposed to really be the only thing that has that tail that does that but Candida left left to do what it wants to do it actually will grow a tail and it will leave the lower intestine and it will move throughout the body and it'll actually grow a hook and it will hook on to parts of the body different organs in the body and it will act as a parasite so if you think of what a parasite is a parasite is actually something that will treat your body like a host and it will latch onto it and it will suck your nutrients and all the good stuff that your body needs so this is an issue because it's going through the body it's hooking on it's sucking out good nutrients and it's also letting off bad toxins into the body so not only taking the good stuff it's leaving behind bad stuff some of the symptoms of Candida and I'm going to read this out to you this is a book that I really like it's gonna appear backwards to you I think but it says I yeast Buster's to the rescue it's just one I like there's lots of different ways that you can help get rid of Candida but I find this book it's a good one it's a short easy read that will give you some good information on what candy is so some of the symptoms are amstead the abdominal pain bad breath confusion cravings for alcohol cravings for bread craving for sweets asthma fatigue cold flu headaches in men impotence insomnia so inability to sleep loss of balance low libido mood swings PMS poor coordination poor memory post nasal drip poor sense of direction it kind of goes on and on there's there's yeast infections thrust in mouth which is when your tongue is is white so there's a lot of things that Candida cause but those sugar cravings are huge one because their actual main fuel is sugar so a lot of times when you're craving sugar it's actually the candida saying be me give me some give me something to eat so it's just this blog I'm giving you an idea of what Candida is and giving you the opportunity to go out and take a look do a little bit of research for yourself and once you've done this you can you can go to tested for Candida with naturopathic doctor some medical doctors so I'm and some MDS will check for it and all and these four naturopathic doctors will check for it so go and check that out and probably in the next blog coming up I'll give you an idea of how we can battle it so just kind of verbally going over that and and then I'll actually be doing that candida cleanse myself interviewing some of my clients who are doing the cleanse right now just on what it's done for them and also the ones that are just starting right now and then of course I'm going to do about a month of it I've already done about four months a couple years ago and it was really really phenomenal some of the changes that I got when I did it just some really cool stuff so I hope you tune in for the next one and thank you for listening bye 
hey guys I'm Liza Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and today I'm doing a real-time workout with you this is gonna be like a mega fat-burning toning sweaty kind of workout that we're going to do together all that you need and this is what I'm using right here is just a set of kettlebells and the set of dumbbells so you don't have kettlebells that's okay you can use your dumbbells twice okay or something heavy that will give you a little resistance and that is our whole setup and I'm going to use a wall as well so hopefully you have either a gym or a wall in your house that you can use now what I'm going to do I'm going to show you I'm going to set up my telephone to be on a timer you can do that too or you can just follow with me and I'll tell you when to switch okay so I'm setting it to thirty seconds of work five seconds of rest six rounds okay so I have it all set up right here and the exercise that we're going to do we are doing them looking this way sir and we'll look at the sheet so we're doing a wall sit with shoulder press after that we're going to do a deadlift we're going to do a Power Lunch on a right leg perryland on our left leg

and let's get started and here we go the timer is on I got my dumbbells I'm going into a wall sit position to 90 degree angles at my knees and I'm hitting a shoulder press so right now I am thinking while I do this keeping my shoulders back keep my chest step keep my weight pushed into my heels so I'm using my hamstrings and my glutes this is the least of the high heart rate exercises that are gonna happen today we've got three seconds left two seconds ready we're going to leave the dumbbells here we're going into jet lift here we go so I've got my to rate these are 16 kilograms so they're probably about I don't know about 2.2 times 16 so around 35 36 pounds now when I'm doing this keep you my chest up my shoulders back I'm being sumo deadlift which means my kettlebells are going in between my feet got five seconds these are my hamstrings and my glutes whew moving on to power lines right starting in four seconds three seconds you ready guys here we go oranges axe power up just

hey I'm Liza the topes registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm going to show you how to make my protein lime strawberry popsicles so we're going to start this recipe by using a yogurt I like to use a lactose free Greek yogurt because it's very high in protein but it's easier on the stomach if you're vegan you can of course use a vegan yogurt you're going to measure this out and add it to your small blender next we're going to add our line and we're going to slice it in half to be juiced if you don't have a juicer you can always just use your hands to squeeze but a citrus juicer is very helpful now you're going to measure out the amount that you need and add it into your blender as well next we're going to shake it up and blend it this gives it such an awesome flavor just that kind of line bittersweet vanilla kind of flavor that's great we're going to take that mix and we're going to add it into our popsicle mold just about 1/4 of the way up next we want to grab our strawberries and we're going to slice them up for display in the popsicle so we want to make them pretty they can be thick or thin slices as big or small as you want just remember these going to be display pieces to get them in you can use your fingers if you want to or fork or something like that and I have a special popsicle a fruit holder that came with my kid and so you can look for that as well and this is just to kind of press the strawberries against the mold so that when it's finished you can actually see them which makes it really pretty I'm going to take the remainder of my strawberries and add it back to my vanilla yogurt and lime mix and this is going to make it a really pretty pink color and also give it a bit of a strawberry flavor when I add this to the top of the mold it's going to give it a really pretty I guess texture where it's going to go white to pink when you take it out of the mold and half it will have the strawberry displayed and the other half will just be pink and this is how it comes out really pretty and oh my gosh so good guys so look good thanks so much for watching guys I hope you enjoyed the video the recipe is absolutely delicious please give it a try it's low calorie high flavor I put out new videos every single week and show fitness nutrition recipes all kinds of good stuff so please subscribe and like the video and I will see you next time it's blended juice and has all that fiber I'm so excited guys it is all done right here um it's like spicy and sweet this actually gives me so much energy if you're a coffee person first thing in the morning try this instead of your coffee I'm just saying 
[Music] hey guys I'm Liza the sofa is registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm very excited today to bring you an awesome workout we've got Liz here this is also an amazing first Rainer and holistic nutritionist as well today guys we are going to walk you through kind of this versus that of training fistic girls things that are going to be helpful to your shape and unhelpful Liz and I are also both big girls okay so we understand the ways of I don't want to do this because it's going to make me bigger versus I do want to do this because it's going to make me bigger we know that there is a difference yes I know that you're all following for so little tweaks and moves are going to help you to have a kind of like rounder posterior and and nice kind of like hamstrings and stuff versus rubbing thighs here we go are you ready the first up we're going to start off with cardio this is doing at the spin bike so so many people love spinning and it is an amazing exercise I just want to say that right off the bat if you're a very slim girl too so great for you but we're talking six girls today okay now I was talking to Liz and she was already letting you know very quad dominant so always use quad no booty engagement so she's feeling all across here Plus that pushing and pulling movement she's getting it right into those adductors with the ad dusters which means the thighs might start to rub if you especially if you're in a spin class and Europe going and they're saying turn it up and you're pushing all up it applaud okay all the boyer to the quadriceps and the inner thigh are all going to potentially grow even though it is cardio okay so for my thick girls this is not going to be a move that is going to lean out your legs this is a move that is probably going to add some size to your leg so sick girl approved not so much so let's take you over to the move that would be the move that you'd want to do a physical and you are trying to lean out your legs let's go treadmills or running outside are probably a better way to actually work your lives without adding some size if you are actually trying to take size off of your legs you have put a lot of muscle in your legs and you want to atrophy them or literally get rid of the muscles doing a steady-state long duration cardio will probably get rid of semester on your legs and all over your body it's not my favorite thing it's not something that I say go on do steady state long duration cardio but if it is a person that's just like I have way too much muscle I want to get rid of some it I don't mind that I'm going to lose muscle and be slightly hungrier because those are things that happen it's not the ideal but it can help break down muscle and make your legs a little bit smaller its muscle but if it's bad and you're trying to get rid of so much size on your legs and you're also not wanting to add some fat burst on your legs that the spin bike will do doing sprints Andrea liz is now going to show us a little sprint why don't you take a little rest and then show us what a sprint will look like although we will have a video on the channel it will be specific to Prince if you want to see that as well you can check that out but will is going to be now it's just gonna focus on Frenchie so this is high-intensity interval training she is going to go as hard as fast as she can until failure whew get ready get ready whoo there shows and this is great for getting the legs leaner and also losing fat on the legs not lyrical but losing fat and not adding work so this was kind of my go-to for that unless like I said many many years ago when I competed I did do the atrophy and I should do some steady state and the work very well my next other skinny whereas this I'll keep the muscle on my legs that I want no thigh rub and less fat on my body and then at any time now she want to slowly start to fail which means your muscles are going to say no more okay I'm going to fall off the back and then she would take a rest probably for at least a minute maybe up to two minutes and she's going to do that again full max I would say that that time could probably go or that speed could probably go up to for her I bought a speed of 12 I'm going to guess not saying you have to do right now if you pick an incline of no one else's Hill she's going to go okay what she's doing right now and I will explain is she taking her incline up when she takes her in/sign up she's getting more booty and posterior chain engagement or the Beast increasing the posterior chain off is going to be in effect she's gone up to an incline of 11 and a speed of 8 she is doing it in interval so she is getting all of the good muscles plus fat burning she's going to go to failure she's going to take a rest about 1 to 2 minutes or so and so she is fully ready to start again she's probably under this 4 five sessions or probably about twenty minutes in total to get through the whole thing because the reps are long students properly and dead thank you very much she's like Allah no home before darkness this will be a good way to again not add girth while taking out some back and at maintaining that muscle so this is a good this versus that for the spin bike versus the running for the fit girl I was good what we're going to show now is liz is going to show us starting off with the squat though the squat is known as one of the best bum building exercises out there I personally don't agree with that I actually feel there's many other successors that will help build your bum a lot harder than the squat because the glutes work at the hardest when you are in hip extensions right here and there's not very much happening as you can see at the top in hip extension you're just kind of flexing just holding weight on your shoulder okay where is at the bottom of the movement where the most stress is and pushing up that's a lot of thigh yes it does work the bum yes it does work the hamstring but it works a whole leg and I feel a lot of here considering the main part of movement is here and pushing through let's show you an exercise that's going to hit more I think posterior chain pop turn to the side list so posterior chain kind of is down here posterior is your backside okay and this little is going to hit more glute and into the hamstring right here and the way that it's going to kind of pop you as a lunge it is going to kind of help you pop back this way versus this way okay if that makes any sense for you so we're going to show you a reverse lunge with a squeeze through so once you get in position for her lunge so one foot forward and one foot back what she's doing is she's really focusing as she comes down to focus into the hamstring right here now as she comes up and she squeezes through as she's bringing this me through to the come on at the side of a real place she is doing that hip extension and flexing her glutes which is where we get more of an engagement BAM and she's squeezing forward and because that means up she's able up with to expand this is for getting tired very list she's good set so as she's coming up she is getting more of that proper hip extension weighted with the knee coming through this will help to as you're coming down or that hamstring as you're doing squeeze through and you're getting that hip extension it's going to work out the glute without hitting as much of the quality you are exploding quad you are still having adductors but not as intensely as you are subscribe making us a better exercise for thick girls that are not trying to build out their quads instead trying to get that posterior pop and band on to the next we're going to do the next exercise as note that's a terrible start the next exercise is deadlift now there's a huge variety about deadlifts that you can choose from this traditional there's Romanian deadlifts they're stiff legged deadlifts there's single leg dead lifts all these types of things but we're going to show you just a couple of deadlifts that might build the legs more versus do the posterior chain pops which we just branded as a thing but your piece of cake I like it actually I think it could be a thing it is actually a thank you for drawing one of the moves but I do love this move actually but if I was trying to make my thighs a little smaller I would probably rather than doing the traditional deadlifts which is a great move but because the action here versus the Romanian that we're going to show you yeah let's get you to demonstrate let's go to bring it up this one does get a little bit more wraps around again a little bit more to the adductor so a little bit into the inner thighs as you get low down here to lift up versus the one we're going to show next which is the Romanian deadlift now with the Romanian she's going to make sure her knees are just slightly bent as she brings it up here she's going to contract the glutes and I - this one is a little bit more isolated - hamstrings glutes versus the traditional which does get a little bit more inner thighs involved okay right here so if you're choosing between the two to get leaner legs and you are a thicker girl I would probably do this one a little bit more often you can still keep this one in like just like the spinning as well but just maybe not as often I will show you one more a doublet as well or Liz will show you one more Devon well it's also super isolated to the hamstring and probably good for just hitting that posterior getting to the hamstrings and glutes without hitting too much inner thighs and quads and that is the single leg deadlift now with the single leg I find that this really hits the hamstring and when I personally do this I like to actually really lift the back leg up high and really intensify the stretch this is great for hitting that posterior without getting too much inner thigh without really getting almost any quad at all eating some core and some low back Adrienne yeah a lot a lot of hamstring so this really hits hard again without growing the whole five so good for thick girls if you want to if you're new hold on to a wall with one hand like hold on to something yeah while you do it get your stretch and then really flex it in and this is a good one for a thick girls who are trying to not grow their size but are trying to get posterior chain pop whoo PCB oh no see see see the next career exercises we're going to show is going to start with the leg press now as always the leg press is an amazing move it will definitely add really nice size to your hamstrings it's also great for the glute ham string tie in which is a harder area to hit and that is kind of that area right here between the hamstrings and the gluts that a lot of people have trouble with but on the other side of it it will also grow your people leg in every direction including that thigh rub the other side of the thigh rub yes that's pretty much it right there so I don't have this is this area left for the studio we do not have a leg press here so Liz is just going to use the smith's-machine here to give you an idea of what the leg press is just for some of you that don't know what it is and we'll just talk on this for a second so we're just turning our smith machine into its form of life pressure and push up here we go so as I said so leg press it's that machine usually about a 45 degree angle where you do this and you can see from the move itself it's excellent we're hitting the hamstrings we're hitting that food ham tie in but again when we push through we're getting quad we're getting inner thighs and are you feeling that feeling the quads from the inner thighs we're gonna take time we're getting all of that as well so for my slim girls amazing move to get a booty pop to get everything to grow so for my fake girls if you don't want your thighs to rub this may not be the one for you at that moment let's show you the one that we're going to do instead of the leg press while we're trying to slim out our thighs so while the leg press is awesome it does as I said kind of work across the entire leg so another move that is also combine exercise but it's going to be a little bit nicer to us pick chicks as far as keeping us slender yet fit is the walking lunge so liz is going to show us that exercise right now just picking up her dumbbells and basically she's going to do really beautiful form for her walking lunges and I'm just going to have her go back and forth for a second while I chitchat so you can see her beautiful form the one thing that I do like about the walking lunge with the thick girls is I know a lot of girls worry like I don't want to go too heavy because I don't want my thighs to explode I feel like you can go as heavy as your form allows with walking lunges and not worry that your legs are going to grow because again I feel they're mainly going to grow here your hamstring is going to pop out a bit more your glutes are going to come up a little bit more but it's not going to do this it is very little quad and inner thigh as opposed to the leg press so this one personally I try to go as heavy as I actually can and I don't worry about my thighs growing at all I don't worry about getting the rub at all okay so this is just a nicer exercise to a stick girls that still want to have muscle on our legs okay so this one you can feel good going as heavy if you want to and I do challenge you guys if you've got good form for your lunges to actually start adding some weight and work on your yeah start to add some heavy I mean what what's your max walking lunge usually my grip gives oh but I can do 30 yeah 30 think I've done 35 is 40 okay so about 80 pounds so about 80 pound loss and lunges for her and what you can do what let's just mention is sometimes her grip Michael is you can get straps if you need to if you want to wear the hold onto the dumbbell you can also throw a weighted vest on and then you can put the bar on your bag yeah so you can play and keep getting heavier and heavier I personally I've maxed out just like what the bar on my back at 110 just because I you know like course you can get it yeah when you work out by yourself moment at a time it's hard to do that but I feel comfortable going up that weight and not having my thighs roll because I don't want them to so this is a great alternative to leg press if you're trying to keep your legs nice and slim with muscle so I really do actually like the leg extension right here it is it's a machine that helps to isolate the quadriceps which is the front of the upper leg but if you are trying to lean out your thighs and make them a little bit plumber I would say this might not be one of the ones that you add to your list if you do you might want to keep it really light like literally and yeah I know some people who literally have you're going to freak enemy like that just crazy talk but we probably do like 30 to 45 pounds if we do it and we'll do like 20 yeah whether like 20 to 30 reps and just really concentrate on the contraction but if you are actually working on leaning out you might want to just even take it out for a little while and and focus in on some of the other exercises that we showed you today we're also going to show you one more that it just kind of is a lengthening exercise right versus versus a building exercise yeah contracting and lengthening so let's show you that lengthening exercise right now so the leg extension as I said it's an amazing move but and this move here I'm not going to say if a super quadricep heavy move but it does involve your quads it does involve links sending up the legs it's a lot of core I love Pilates and because you're doing moves like lunges and Romanian deadlifts and all these things already I feel like this is a great lengthening exercise that does involve the quads with literally zero bulk to them whatsoever so let's let's take a look at what this looks like this is called an aquatic Pilates bicycle so what liz is going to do is she's getting into proper form here so the one thing and then reach it up is she's really flexing her quadriceps exception sucks in her calves she's flexion applaud and she's linked spinning her legs to the back wall so it's kind of like linkedin as far as you can and flex flex flex applause I mean links been linked some niacin and flex flex flex and you're also getting a lot of core involved here you can throw on some ankle weights as well if you're feeling super advanced but that's not just going to make you a quadric it's really going to make the ABS work a lot the point you might need to put your head down but this one here again like I said it's not necessarily a squad specific move it is more of an action tire and where you got the idea it is more of an ad specific move but it is that constant flexion that constant length pinch where when I add Pilates into my routine for trying to slim out thicker legs I absolutely notice a different time notice in my calves I notice some exploits I feel like the muscles because you're doing a constant flex and flex or if I'm doing can you just quickly show single leg stretch if I'm showing some are doing single leg stretch it is a constant flex I'm constantly flexing my calves flexing my quads everything is engaged my core is engaged so again this is not what specific but they are involved its lengthing of the legs and it is going to help to just kind of lean the legs whereas as I said I do love the leg extension machine but it is going to help to add a little bit of size to those legs loaded when coming well this is a little bit more lengthening and a good addition to a leg day routine for someone that is trying to just just tighten up just a little bit you know saying yeah so coming from to naturally thicker girls we've been doing this for quite a while is actually also owns an hourglass workout location yes and she's been doing this for quite a while so we do understand and have tried many different exercise than some Romania yeah something you actually feel like you'll just be like I did some squats and it actually feels like my thighs just grew jeans are tight the jeans are tight everything's rubbing and I know slim girls are out there designed what I want that it's genetics guys it's genetics um some of us should grow up with or so for those of you out there that do yeah if I find you can feel you feel about whether you vote think that they're that feel that you're in the same category is this where you feel it quickly we're trying to just give you a little bit of a these are great exercises as well they just might grow your thighs so if that's not what you're looking for try these ones and says these are the ones we generally stick to to just stay a little bit smaller a little less rubbin and right keeps no rubbing and they work I feel like they've worked well for us and for our clients that are looking for those goals as well absolutely little bit of a hashtag hourglass technique okay and so we hope that you enjoyed that I hope you try those exercises and that you enjoyed the video

I just got to my gym hourglass workout located at Queen and Spadina downtown Toronto morning a little hair and makeup right now morning so I'm shooting today so this is a behind the scenes look at a shoot that I would do I do all different types of shoots at my studio here I've hired a young team you can see them here videographers and and my assistant Jenni also shows up to help out she's awesome but we do shoot here today as a shoot for Instagram specifically I know that sounds a little bit weird to do Instagram shoots well maybe not so much anymore now we've got like 40 these shoots and everything but this is how I shoot my fitness videos that you guys see on my IG page so in one day we'll shoot about 40 to 50 exercises 15-second clips so I bring a ton of outfits with me we do her makeup to look all cute and some of things our outtakes like this but eventually we do get it right and yeah so this is a look behind the scenes and this is all done in the studio that's a perk of owning studio and it's up to you so I use these videos for Instagram but I'm also an online coach and have my trainer busting program that I've been working on a home training program for a really long time and it actually shot I would say eight hundred to a thousand videos to prep for the home training program as well so hmm I just finished filming this a long day is excellent and I'm gonna have some beta in a new capital it's haircut time here at ritual to see Vivian and she's gonna give me some layers there's Vivian hi Vivian is going to work on the hair products that she's missing so like most girls I do Beauty days regularly and when I do my hair I tend to get layers done all the time still shorter the top and then throughout I'm addicted to shellac so I get my shellac nails and toes done um nails every two weeks and toes every four weeks waxing I'm not going to share but that's normal thing and then last I do IV treatment so this is an IV of vitamins that go right into your being and don't look if you're shy but I think white like it so this is one of my favorite recipes I've actually already shared this recipe on youtube so you can find it if you look at what's called like low-carb spaghetti or something flat belly spaghetti but basically I use a spiralizer with a zucchini and that's my spaghetti noodles and then I make some ground turkey and then add some like olives and organic tomato sauce and voila low carb flat belly spaghetti so it's a gem day today I'm gonna meet up with some of the hourglass workout girls and the instructors and we're gonna do a leg day but first I'm gonna head over to the chiropractor to for some preventative maintenance so me and some of my hourglass workout franchisees slash homies my friends we like to meet up at the studio and just kind of messed around we'll usually do a light day of some sort and we might be there for like two hours but we're not working out necessarily the whole time we chat and catch up and you know some people go out and eat we work out you guys miss the beginning here it is very dangerous arms like nobody cousins gonna howl ain't it please it's hot so there must been heard I'm not so sure like maybe a bitch even feels like when I teach our classes and generally therefore I get there - geez - 6 a.m. class and have a little break in the afternoon and some people think because it's our last workout that we only train bum but as you can see we do some upper body - this is a little upper body but we still managed to get some lower body even an upper body because it's our best workouts good morning so I do some time to cleanse about four times a year you should focus in either in a specific organ or I'll do a general cleanse so this one was more of a general cleanse I guess with a little bit of focus on the liver and when I do that I use natural products all over my body just like this so that's a shea butter for my body coconut oil for my hair I'll also let gargle with it and that type of thing and I also do a lot of steam rooms so I'm here at hammam Spa I've got my green juices I've got my coconut oil all that kind of good stuff I'm ready to steam and do some hot and cold therapy for the lymphatic system and there I am hey heading out to my friend's going-away party just taking it super simple and I'm probably not staying out that late because I've got a shoot tomorrow so this is my boo Melissa Lee aka Melly fit this is her going-away party she is an our best girl turned challenge winner turned an instructor turn owner she is heading off to New York City to bring our bus workout over there so if you're in New York go to the class of our Melly I miss you guys thanks for tuning in and I'll see you next week 
hey guys I'm lies about Lopez registered to Lucic nutritionist and master trainer I'm going to talk to you about the 10 worst healthy foods out there are you ready as we do this we're going to talk about one that is not so healthy of a health food and then we're going to go into a healthier alternative okay so first thing that we're going to talk about is energy drink so with energy drinks I know that we think that like even just in the title energy like it sounds great right and really at the end of the day it's just kind of glorified soda with extra caffeine and maybe a little b12 added to make it sound good on the label so this is a healthy espresso now one thing that I liked about the espresso is that it is high in antioxidants but you just want to kind of think with these things that is everything in moderation so you want it if you're one of those like six cups a day person that would not be moderation just FYI coffee is one of the most sprayed plants in the planet okay so you really want to make sure that you're buying organic and if you're okay with having just some energy that will last you through the day without the boom and the BAM that is sometimes even with coffee something like a matcha green tea is also a great option now what I love about matcha green tea again with the antioxidants this one has even more antioxidants so the next on the list is microwave popcorn now microwave popcorn you look at it and you'll you'll read it and you'll be kind of mystified by oh my god it's only like 99 calories in a whole bag and it's it's fiber and all this kinds of good stuff in it it sounds like it's a really good healthy treat but at the end of the day once you put in that kind of microwave packaging for the popcorn it is not I'm just the packaging alone actually is full of chemicals to keep oil from coming out of the bag and when you take the popcorn out and you look at what's left in the bag it's it's kind of nasty it's you know a lot of chemicals and stuff and then on top of it you throw it into the microwave and then you've got even more issues because what happens when you put things in a microwave you nuke them you have destroyed most of the value of that food but you can still enjoy popcorn this is a nice non-gmo organic popping corn you can put it into your air popper which cost like 20 bucks generally at at any store and then you can put really fun ingredients on top of it you can use like a raw whole butter or a ghee if you want to you can some sea salt you can put some cinnamon hot sauce you can make it into a great snack which is full of fiber and it is very low-calorie and you can still enjoy your popcorn so my next offender is diet soda and I know a bunch of you're like no because some people are like diet soda addicts if you look at the ingredients and you probably can't read or recognize anything on it because it's mostly chemical just keep in mind that when fake sugar kind of aspartame came to the market at that time the FDA all the sudden was like just so many calls on headaches tumors brain like brain disorders we have something called the brain blood-brain barrier and it's supposed to keep things out of our brain but the molecules in it are so small that they're actually able to get past it instead of doing that I'm going to show you something that can actually be healthy for you and it's very very yummy this is kombucha I don't want to shake it if I my tactually explode that's a real thing I'm not kidding because it's a it's fermented it's under pressure when you open it a little tidbit for you you might want to do it over a sink some things that might freak you out okay just for you soda drinkers because this is not in soda there's something called the mother and it's a little bit I don't turn you off of it I'm afraid to tell you this there so it's a little bit funny okay but it's really good for you the first time I had it and I drank it I Vil like that just at the slimy part the rest of it is absolutely delicious am i selling you on it yet um so you can actually probably make it yourself I might even do a video for you on it it's actually very gut friendly it is full of probiotics I know that if you and me even if you don't know what that means you've heard the buzz word by hearing about yogurt and all these kinds of things it's great for your gut helps with the flat belly it helps with your immunity it helps your skin it helps us so many things so my number four on the list is actually already low-fat muffins low-fat muffins I know a lot of you might kind of get up in the morning and think I'm gonna go and get a coffee and a low fat muffin and you know what you're actually saying in your brain you're saying I'm really tired so I'm going to have caffeine sugar so don't get it twisted low-fat muffins still means cake okay they're probably the same ingredients at the end of the day actually if you go and look at like look up your favorite coffee shop or whatever and you if you're able to find the macro breakdown so the macronutrients calories fat protein all stuff of a doughnut there and your favorite low fat muffin the donut might be better muff and as far as calories one of the things that you can do instead of this low fat muffin is power balls I have these amazing antioxidant rich amazing amazing did I say amazing protein balls and we actually already made them and they're on this YouTube channel and I'm gonna link it just in the description box below a link where you can make them and honestly I've got people all over the web saying I tried it my kids love it I'm addicted so your chin should go try it number five on the nono list is margarine and I know by all the commercials that you watch on TV you think it is the most heart-healthy thing out there would be incorrect okay it is a man-made product they have kind of injected hydrogen into it trying to make it a more stable fat instead they created trans fat tada so instead of going for the man made option let's just go for the real-deal option and that is ghee or butter now ghee is clarified butter and in India it's actually considered medicinal it's like one of their super foods as so it also has a very high smoke point what does that mean it means if you're doing very intense high heat cooking as something like a raw butter or a ghee are much better options and actually have some good benefits to it where this is a little bit of nutrient in it and for those of you that have problem with dairy they are lactose free so just changed your whole life so number six is fruit juice fruit drink whatever you want to call it fruit drink just I'm not even say that much about it it is not a food okay it is just sugar in water and flavor so if it doesn't say juice then run away in the other direction do not give it to your children if it says fruit juice here's the thing some of them are okay there are like high pressure and you know fruit juices which are cold-pressed or hyper though those are those are decent but you want to have at least at the end of the day especially if you're trying to be healthy you want to have vegetable juice maybe with some fruit in it so I'm going to show you my cold press juicer come with me over here to that this is my cold pressor and the reason that I did one that cold press is because when I juice that means it will last about anywhere from from 1 to a max of 3 days I really try to have it same day or next day but because it's cold-pressed I can do that if it wasn't a cold press and it was just a regular juicer I would have to have it within about 20 minutes of juicing it to keep all of the natural enzymes so all right so I think that the next one might actually surprise you brown sugar okay so when we're choosing sugar you might think for my sugar good option I'm going to choose brown sugar and I think for the most part you would be incorrect you have to read the label and see that it can contains so it contains the natural molasses still otherwise I promise you if you go buy some white sugar packets and some brown sugar packets and you compare the label they're the same I actually like sucanat okay what is sucanat sucanat is really just where they took the sugar cane and they just dried it okay and then BAM this is what you have it's so much more delicious than either of their like regular brown sugar or the white sugar brands sugar actually has a lot of vitamins in it including vitamin B which is really important when you're having sugar that is lacking its natural vitamin B so it's not this it's kind of more refined one what happens is when you eat it you need to find vitamin B in the body to actually process it and break it down so it's going to steal maybe from your bones or something like that to have that vitamin B to break down the sugar and then we end up with more brittle bones and so on and disease make sure that you are getting a natural sugar so you're getting the fiber you're getting the molasses you're getting vitamin B okay so number eight is and I know you kind of knew this was coming is all of your little fake sugar options so when you go to the coffee shop or whatever and you're choosing your zero calorie sweetener I'm not going to name any of them but pretty much all of them let's just say that our zero calorie except for the one I'm about to mention are on the nono list we don't know once you taste the sweet what's actually happening of your body if it's really as good as just zero calories when your body feels sweet there is a reaction in there so it may not be the weight loss food that you think it is there is still another zero calorie option and that is stevia so this is our stevia right here and stevia is made from stevia leaf whereas the other ones are made by playing with removing aminos and moving around aminos and a lot of the coffee shops are now carrying stevia packets and if they don't how easy is it for you to just carry a little stevia packet in your purse or something like that so next up we're talking about bread I'm so sorry I'm so sorry even if you had Ken have gluten I don't feel it like it should be a regular thing in your diet I used to have a bread problem okay that's a real thing I used to want to have bread every single day like I would I slowly moved from bread down to what I'm going to show you which is Ezekiel it is sprouted so what does that mean is it's it's a little bit easier to digest when you sprout grains you're basically kind of washing away a toxin on it that makes it harder for us to digest so that goes away and it also makes it more nutrient-dense okay so the nutrients are a little bit better in it it's a little bit easier to digest if you're gluten free you still should not have it as far as I'm concerned but if you can handle gluten and you're slowly working your way down to that not having the bread option here you go don't be scared this is my next step so what once you're done and you've gotten away from these akhil I put things that I would usually have Tortelli trick can I say it for tort tort Ella tortilla corn wrap so with the corn wrap okay you can use something like this instead there is a recipe that will be coming soon to this channel and that will actually be my taco made with this so be excited and look for it let's go to the next topic okay are you ready the very last one the the BAM low-fat peanut butter it is not a good option I know a lot of people are very anti peanut butter I don't mind peanut butter as long as is organic in its natural state and the only ingredient is Organic peanuts just kind of quickly touching on it our low-fat peanut butter when they take out the fat they just add in garbage so they add in icing sugar and other types of sugar and hydrogenated oils and all types of stuff that you do not want to have in your body that your body may not recognize or like or you might get addicted to that you can also do things like I've got my organic almond butter here but almond butter I find doesn't taste as much like peanut butter so if your peanut butter fan then I would say sunflower seed butter tastes very similar to peanut butter not the same not same but similar and it's a seed it's not even a nut crystal for those of you that have met issues and you want to bring it to school and you want to maybe try to trick your kids no I didn't say that you know maker could think it's being a better no that means the same thing anyways sunflower seed butter is a really fun option that you can find and now we've got some of our 10 best health foods whoo thank you guys so much I hope you liked the video if you did please hit the like button below you can also share this with your friends

hey guys I'm Liza with Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm here to share with you tips for all of my slim girls out there how do we add a little bubble back here how do we put on some weight some of the moves you can do in your house but the amount of weight that I will want you to do I would recommend you actually join a gym today we're going to focus on the training aspect of putting on cytus what we're going to do is I'm going to show you five exercises you need to slowly work your way up in weight okay so progressive overload is what we're talking about here first we're going to look at is called the deadlift what weight should you start off with you should start off with one that is safe for you to learn form and again we're slowly going to move up my usual just kind of day-to-day left is probably closer to about 185 now some of you out there like it left way more than you amazing okay I just like to do it where I'm comfortable so what is the right weight for you again it's going to depend on your form and then slowly getting heavier so what is form here we go I'm gonna grab onto my bar like so now they do not don't don't do this and round okay that's the worst thing that you can use the worst offense of a deadlift I think okay you want to have that natural curve in the spine which is going to come from a very strong core so I have my feet planted very strongly my weight is in my posterior chain I'm going to grab on to my bar now you can either do this as a regular grip and this is a strong grip so see what I do to my hands they're regular strong feet planted chest up very important glutes are back I'm doing a little pull in the bar taking me into the posterior chain my abs are in and my thought when I start is I'm going to hinge my hips boom forward okay so let's see that here abs in hinge hips boom forward okay so that is my typical deadlift let's show you the next exercise squats tada everyone shocked I know they're an awesome exercise for building not just the bum bum but also the hamstrings the quads they're great for the core the low back this entire area here if your goal is eventually to get to a decent weight that is that's challenging for you just feet just kind of I like just a little bit wider than shoulder width apart toes just kind of slightly spread open our knees going to are going to stay in line with our toes so not wider and not closer so abs in shoulders back we're going to drive our glutes back we're going to tear the floor apart so make sure that you're not coming up like this and throwing your form off when you come up you want to make sure that you're just coming up to a strong strees with a nice strong core hauntin on make sure you add that weight because if you think you're just going to be doing bodyweight squats at home and your booty is gonna go back it's just not going to okay you need to add that weight let's show you the next exercise so I love hip dressers like definitely one of my favorite exercises amazing for growth up so this is how we get it on all by yourself we're gonna start kind of like in a squat or a deadlift and just pick up safely and we want to make sure that the weight stays on the fleshy part of our thigh and not the pelvis bone area okay that's really important we're going to slowly at our self out until we're kind of like bra strap area or just below the scapula's now I'm gonna push the bar to the meaty area of my thigh I'm gonna drop down rest up drop down controlled Shh exhale out this is how we just get power to get out of it all by yourself again elbows just safely at yourself back up if you can't bring it up and squat it back down you can kind of just safely put it down so for my slim girls this is an excellent machine they are a full leg and booty builder which is exactly what we want for our slim girls so again you can start off with a weight that is safe for you and you can slowly but surely progressively overload until we get to a good heavy weight that is going to pack on some size get into position abs in and it's basically a form of a squat I like to do a little bit of a pause at the bottom sometimes so it's called a pause squat so I'll hold boom eight to ten reps is a slim girl that means it's time to add on some weight I hope that helped you guys to give you a bit of an idea of how to start packing on some size Pilates and all these things are amazing I love them I'm a Pilates instructor is it going to help you my slim girls put on size not so much okay it's gonna give you that really cute la kind of body but not necessarily that pam-pam boom kind of you know you know right anyway I hope you enjoyed the video if you did please like below don't forget to subscribe I put out new fitness and nutrition and lifestyle videos every Tuesday and Friday and have an amazing day and go build that bootay peace out so what we do is we shape out curves and to do that I do personally believe that you need to be able to add some white be able to do a little bit of progressive overload so I'm gonna show you some of my favorite pieces are you ready I've got the stability ball 
hey guys I'm Liza basilica's registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and we're about to do a real-time work out with you guys Desiree here and Sarah so des just going to be showing modified exercises today so if you have any knee issues or you're more beginner you're going to follow my steps right here if you're feeling advanced and hardcore so yes there is total I so Sarah's going to your girl you're going to follow her cues we are going to be doing a full routine it's about eight exercises we're going to do it return through with a rest in between I'm going to cue everything yours is like a CRX maybe but we can always modify out of that for Claridge more advanced we've got a jump rope and and a kettlebell okay so even if you don't have a kettlebell just switch over deserts and we are rolling you ready to start you have any sense that's so flexing there's gonna get some cardio going to do some jump rope does intend to do some bicycle kick started in three starting in two turns on here we go okay for this where we got our heart rate up so if for some reason you can't do either this exercise is to something that's going to get your heart to pump if you were doing this one here make sure that you are not pulling on your neck you're going side to side trying to contract into the obliques yes there you got the stroke Sarah got a little Mike back and it's like dancing around okay great as long as the fans don't fall down every take is golden you guys have eight seconds this is cardio so we pick it up just a little bit more thank you Dad we're almost there you've got three you guys you we're going to just dive forward push up that's hilarious this arvo more sweet the dive-bomber looks like this again this is the modified and this is the more advanced when you do this think of this cue ready ladies face to the floor chest to the floor hips to the floor and up hips to the floor just the floor face to the floor and up faced chest hips and up hips chest face the others are doing great here we go face chest hips and light go to a downward dog when I hit yep chest and face board second let's get one more one more thanks trip chest rings really good job guys okay we're going into a lunge lunge squat so this is a pretty powerful move right here it goes to run switch lunge what now does the rate happens to have a TRX Pandy if you happen to be working out him you've got a t-rex in your home you can join us chasm in a little challenge so if there were there we were there she's also going to do the London squat and this is the first modification I mean giver I might switch it around for the second round give you another option but what you can see here is this is taking a lot of the I guess to cut the impact out of her knees so it's a little bit easier I find in my hourglass classes a lot of the girls that they can't do this they generally can do that job with their three - whoo okay we're moving into high knees and that is proposed to you everybody high knees are you ready and sore stop keep going she's coughing it's okay it's your way my tracks along with us at home it's just like hey wait back running look at Desiree everybody it's perfect and you going to specific so we got those tiny is going abs are pulled in get the knees up as high as possible I love to do this if you're at home you can visualize that she hasn't hit me yet come on down come on there you go [Laughter] we're going into MMA push-up and frog leaps to hop back and Burpee okay off you go big probably forward good pop hop go ahead hands on the floor to a burpee awesome so this is if you feel good for those big jumps this is the advanced version that I prefer you do if you're not able to do this these are MMA push-ups and they are awesome okay but there's still my second choice because this one is just a little bit more challenging she's doing here in the in the modified version is she's jumping her feet right beside her hands jump in them back and then dropping into a push-up whoo good job lady okay next move we are doing we've got kettlebell swing for you and jump SWAT Creamery for choose which one you guys are able to do at home BAM now what I love about these here is we've got the cardio going but we're also doing awesome glute activation okay so she is wheezing her glue right there and squeezing her right there the core is pulled in super tight she's making sure she's not leaning back at all really good form and over here we're dying keep that chest up chest up pulling down skin tired it's okay I'd be getting tired right now too that's why it's so fun that I'm not having to do today I could just laugh and yell at them great and you pop for two okay moving on guys we've got Clint crosses for both of you so we're in plank position on our Camry and we were going to cross your foot all the way across and I want you to try to get your foot like way up here okay so we're going to watch I'm just gonna make sure that I'm covered yes continue along I'm clearly not good at attaching mics to people so not that she's really able to talk so I could have actually thought of that somewhere along the way there and might just be tired anyways okay they're continuing to go good and then she's trying to reach her foot all the way across engage the core really good okay we're moving on to Jack so flip over let's get you to do plank jacks instead right jack yes and then you're going to do regular jacks here we go so both you're doing abs or Joe's oh you're doing leg raise this leg raises so you got plank jack and leg raises there we go okay so if you've got happy knees this is your guy here and if not we're going to keep our feet together and they're going to come all the way up and we'll pull up and all the way down but not too much to bring it all the way to the floor good now just curl the bum off the floor without lifting ready now just Curl Curl Curl Curl Curl and then control it down oh you guys have made it through round one you get a whole minute rest please have some water at home guys have a little cool touch of water and put in the clock on your minute rest has begun how you feeling [Laughter] how we doing dad's water yeah so far so good okay you guys have 25 seconds rest please continue to drink water keep keep moving as Sarah is raised we're starting in 15 seconds back to that first round again so either getting that jump rope ready or getting ready for those bicycle kicks are you ready your cloth is starting in fact starting in four in three two come on here we go whoo okay she's got a jump rope point over here we got our bus and she has speeded up but yeah squeeze it up that's the word I'm pretty sure I'm looking for she's trying to curl her shoulders off the floor she's twisting that trunk she's reaching the arms forward she's trying to connect that knee to elbow she died in just a little bit are you dying a little bit at home which one are you - come on come on Jo's right sorry we've got nine seconds nine seconds to go there is pretty fancy huh can we do any tricks anything fancy happening up in here 385 - and here we go dive bomber push-up dive bar approaches again if you look doing the knees you can look over it does it need help maybe trying from Latos you can watch Miss Sarah now I thought that they had done this in class before I just felt like we do it all the time they're both hourglass girls by the way they they're regular arrows Isis you can tell by their awesome booties and they were like I don't remember ever doing that so this is their first time and they wanted you to know that information so they're learning along with you stay but the rest of them they know very well so let's keep cueing is you guys have 10 seconds left ready together face to the floor chest to the floor and up and hips to the floor chest to the floor face the floor and up awesome this one is very challenging don't worry I know why you're dying I die too we're going back to that one squat now over here lurk you a different one just in case you want me to arrest you sir you start to lunge lunge squat let's do curtsy lunges alternating curtsy lunges and maybe holding on to a kettlebell for those who just don't happen to have a TRX Simone so this hold it here and this is going to be our alternate right now holding it up as a goblet but this is the move I actually want you to do if your knees don't allow you to do this so you can't do it then you can do this one but if you just don't want it because you don't like it well then you should do this one to go okay because it's never an excuse and actually the ones that you don't like them you don't want to do probably the ones you should be doing and that's just a general rule it's tiny use time high knees here we go here we go I'm gonna pick on you this time because I picked on you last time let's go pop those meet up and up and up yeah yeah yeah are you doing this at home too it is presented in there if you are a female try to get your knees to your knockers if you're a guy just get them higher than your hip oops go go go this is so mean I'll pick on you now pick up yeah come on hit me Henry does three are you trying to get your knees up guys are you trying come on we've got five seconds pull those abs in tight lean back a little bit really good Sikora suitcase okay we're going to the Frog leap to hop forward Burpee down and MMA push up here we go now one day I forgot to show is that Desiree she's doing two different versions so she's doing some of them from her knees let's show the advanced version does come on des just because Sarah's not doing it she can do them from her toes she's actually quite advanced as well she just won the draw as we show the modified who supposed to advance okay we go back to modify it again and it's make sure that you're placing your knees down softly each time and then trying to get really low into that push-up there is still killing it with a big frog leap forward the two hops back and down into your Burpee [Music] okay here we go so we've got kettlebell swing hopping over here I'm going to pick on Desiree a little bit this time to last 7:30 on Sarah so making sure when our during our jump squats we're really pushing our glutes back yes and when we jump up we push away to a big what do you call that big straight jump and then we softly manage our spot we drive our defense we try to keep our chest up as high as we can by engaging our core muscles good Sarah's still working away flexing out the glutes everyone's getting the heart rate up everyone is fat burning and muscle toning all the same time about three seconds I know work feel I know you have to respect it if I could like crosses plane crosses here we go whoa we're in plank position now the goal is to flex your core the whole time and off we go go ahead and there's no push up it's more of just like a bring that foot as high as possible right so you're trying to get your foot up there and straight leg reach it so reach it up here where my finger is that's what I want I want you should try to like if your hand is here trying to reach your foot way past your hand diagonal and up and flex your core at the same time I like to suffer punch my clients lightly while they're doing abs to ensure that they're engaging their court just like I do myself I'd use myself little sucker punches all the time to make sure that I am engaged right ladies whoo okay moving along to Jack's and leg races here we go if you're doing sink jacks Miss Sarah and you're doing leg braces too hands are to the bum and really small movement so her legs are straight punch toes and just so not a pop up but more of just a slight crunch and we go crunch yes and then ctrl down and it comes up and we go crunch good and Cooper controls over here we're keeping plank so the bum comes down just a little bit I know we're getting tired we keep the core engaged we jump open we jump rope we jump open we don't close both of them are getting core and cardio all of the same time and full one-minute rest oh go down and one to go you guys are killing it how'd you need some water to need some water at home because you've got 55 seconds to get it got one more time to go everyone's feeling great yes can we can't talk if we didn't need to my family's with me talking they can't talk now I feel very proud of myself for when I do the right house and I have to talk through them you guys have 30 seconds it's actually best if you move around a little bit between sets versus just sitting on the floor so right now they're just they're just like don't do this everyone you guys should be standing and walking and drinking water thank you so much you guys have 15 seconds so now we're starting to go and get our equipments again so Sarah's going to grab her jump rope accessory is going to get ready to bicycle kick are you ready everybody are you ready for the final round of the day starting in 3 starting in two timer let's do this by the last round what you want to do is chill a little bit because you're like oh my god I was going to go hard but instead you go a little bit faster you say this is the last count I'm going to jump in 5 second I'm warm I am ready I'm going to pull my abs in I'm going to twist as hard as I can because it's the last one and I can leave it all on the floor everything you got right now right Sarah right right I can aggressive what you guys have seven seconds big push breach test reach reach keep going so you got three you got two it's dive bomber push-up time you're everyone's favorite everyone favorite right here we go here we go and we go face to the floor chest to the floor and up and hips to the floor chest to the floor face support up Oh Sarah you want to help keep going guys actually both of you q I didn't even remember to mention you want up your legs really wide knees wide legs wide so while you're even wider why it's there why why does and I mix it a little bit easier and I want it to be Archy so arch that back good for your going head and you kind of arch tied to the floor just the four basic good and up good and hips chest face and comparison the challenging is the challenging one hits a lot of good must way we're moving on to the lunge line squat lends --lens cross-burning let's get on the career X again sure I remember if you didn't have a tear at what she was doing instead was she was doing the curtsy lunge holding the kettlebell so if you don't have a tear X to jump to to make this a little bit easier on your knees if you need it you're going to hold on to that kettlebell and you're going to do that curtsy lunge instead as a further alternate okay but if you do the TRX this is a great move it's actually really challenging so this does make it better for a lot of people for their needs just keeping that in mind you got six seconds everybody everybody's feeling amazing we're getting ready to do our high knees here we go who should I pick on first everyone let's go let's get those high knees high knees seems like such a chill move like it's just running on the spot but it's actually really hard it's actually highly awesome and you know what's really fun about it that you might not realize is it's great for your abs come on I'm right here I'm right here I have not felt or hit my hand even with this was even whenever all the boys your hand I'm fine this is Sun coming look at ah oh look I got two hands come on come on dead pit me yes girl three two and moving along that was great we've got the probably Burpee two back we got the MMA push-up let's go whoo now we already know how this one's done I want Sarah to do the biggest possible frog leaps and she's going to back up a little bit and she's going to use her arms and show me the biggest possible whoo reach yes pop pop all the way back hands on the floor burp me down if she's feeling sometimes she can even add a push up right let's see if she does let's watch and judge oh good god big pots big pots love it I love how far we're going but it's really a big sounding movement that frog jump great shuffles video okay we are moving on to oh kettlebell swing and jump squats ready let's do it with that kettlebell swing I want really big movement this time I want it to keep the chest up reach back and let's try to engage a little bit of hamstring as we come up super thrust the boots together without any lean back whatsoever how do you avoid the lean back you flex your abdominals so the top of movement you're flexing your bum you're also flexing core to the top of the movement you're very straight but everything is flexed and that's how we work on that booty well get in all of that cardio and all that fat burn and you're doing amazing - give me those big jump big jump big jump and we're moving on to plank crosses don't sign crosses almost feel like an awesome rest at the point where you're like percent gods and junk okay here we go reach it all the way across now when you're reaching across the whole bowl is as that foot comes through you are flexing so like super pull those abs in exhale contract as hard as you can and make it a really really really intense flat so as I'm coming through I'm flexing all through the opposite side of my core you guys feeling that okay keep going keep going get through you have four seconds left and we're almost at the end this is the third round guys it is the last exercise we got plank jack we got leg raises let's destroy it at home let's go max 35 seconds move bam bam bam Sarat get that booty down booty nice and low you want those shoulders right over the elbows you want to jump nice and wide we want to pull those abs in come on Desiree you like this good and she's controlling it and she's reaching and blessings good and reaching and flexing but not popping just control and flex you got this you got this we've got ten I will count with you let's go a little harder night everybody work it eight seven six three go five four three two made it I love this so this is like one of my favorite things that happens ever I love it so much so they enjoyed the workout I hope that you look like this at home too I hope you guys can say thank you to Sarah and thank you to Desiree down below in the comments tell them what an

hey guys I'm Mike Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I have a special guest today this is good ten horns she's my personal chiropractor is just mine nobody know you can have her - yeah it's always the same but it's not just treating in Texas this is a Silurian first time on Cameron she's nervous with the neck you sorry I had to I just launched the not summit right she's good she's all right enough anyway the topic today I'm very excited I wanted to bring her very specifically and this is the reason teaching here at hourglass workout I see over a hundred girls in a day and I find at least 10 percent resemble at some point say they've injured something or structurally something and they've knee pain so we try to do squat and I'll see them do this and I'll say are you okay and this only needs are swollen it is and people always want to just hustle through it they're just like okay though don't worry I'm going to keep going that would be and that would something that wrong from right right pain is there for a reason it's telling your body that something is not working properly never work to pain because you're working out to make things better and if you're working through payment you're going to make things worse some international doing anymore and dr. learn is here to tell us why so this video is entitled remember I think we specifically said knee pain I know anyway something was squatting building that booty meet Eenie p.m. you day we got it we had it is it okay you know is knee pain stopping you from building that as that's that's what I actually came up with supplements with that so okay so I brought back along here because here's what I always tell people as a trainer and you need to understand this because people write to me and my comment they'll say I have needs what can I do I'm a personal trainer I'm not a chiropractor or physiotherapist and we have defamation okay I can help you with the exercises that the chiropractor says and I think work features with good to know definition where I will say you should check with a chiropractor to find out what exactly is causing your knee pain because everyone is different so she's going to run you through the most common knee pain issues go awesome so I just want to reiterate our lies both said and processes by seeing if you are having a knee pain even this video may be too general for what's going on with you so please do seek out somebody who knows what they're talking about chiropractor physio sports medicine doctor someone in the lines of treating knee pain okay okay I'm going to talk today a little bit about why you're going to have knee pain so there could be two different reasons one of them being structural structural is the way your body is made you can't really change for example have some wide hips what's it that would be a structural issue that you're not going to change analyze the best would say that's a good structural issue but what that can create is a functional imbalance so a muscle imbalance that could be causing your knee pain so for example if you have wider hips you may have a weaker medial quad and not something that we can influence so we're going to break the body down into a few different structural things and then talk about some exercises that are going to help change the function of that or help the function so that you can avoid any pain am i showing all the ones that I can do at home right pretty much like food even BOSU ball maybe a stability ball and I think at the end of the video so you have to watch to the end I think at the end we're going to do a little bit of a modification of a squat that you can do if you are experiencing any pain that you may experience the less knee pain with so you can get that booty even if you have knee pain is that what you're saying so units up so say and girl here we go I do want to preface this by saying that I don't anyone self diagnosing so self diagnosing is something I see every day people coming into the I am sorry avocado pie awesome what that was they would have no idea they just they have it exactly WebMD is is one of my biggest enemy though WebMD and for let's say that I'm a person again and I'm experiencing any pain when I'd swap who would I see first what would be the first like really whoever whoever cultist look at you can see it you can see anyone I have safe enough that if you're not seeing the right person that they like in their professional that they will know who to refer you to right so if this is like like exactly like you're doing your trainer you're not a chiropractor so it you know if someone has knee pain you're and you've sent people to me before yeah she says you need to go see dr. Lauren like I can help you it a little bit but like you need to know exactly what's wrong so in our possession like I know when it's not me I'm like okay like I can't deal with all this you need to see a massage therapist or you need to see a physio or you need to go back to your personal trainer and do some of these exercises with them it all comes full circle really when we talking about knee pain and if it's not knee pain from you fell or twisted your knee playing soccer and you tore your ACL like that is a traumatic injury and that needs to be diagnosed with imaging so if you're just having general knee pain you're not really sure why it's very gradual onset we typically call that something called patellofemoral pain syndrome and what that really just means is that your knee isn't tracking properly so your knee wants it you want to track up and down right but when you have muscle imbalances or structural deformities wide hips lower leg knock-kneed foot like over pronation or over supination you can have the tracking of your knee displaced so we wanted to go sort of up and down but when you have these other issues that can be pulled laterally which I typically find this most common or it can track medially depending on whatever is going on with you specifically anyone who comes to me with any sort of lower body injury first thing I'm going to do I'm looking at their feet so lies I'm going to get you to take one or both shoes off for me so we can look a little bit closer so one of the most common things I have this issue add to about 70 percent of the population has this issue is over pronation and what that means is that instead of your feet looking like this when you walk they kind of go inwards like that and I'm going to demonstrate on Liza because she does have some over pronation although she thinks her feet were perfect and she's doing it right now just standing here so when we're looking at the foot what we're looking for is over pronation or supination this is really where her foot should be neutrally let me do it there you go so she likes overpronate and so when do you get over pronation it looks like that so the feet are collapsing in now watch when we go from neutral to over pronation watch the knee now so the knee is actually in turn or you have an internal rotation of the femur and the tibia here so then you turning in the same thing that happens to the knee happens to the hip so when the Fed is in neutral and then you overpronate the foot you're actually turning the hip in as well so we'll go back to neutral and just demonstrate this one more time very subtle but it can make a large difference and huge impact on you pain so what we're going to do we're going to show you a couple of the solutions that I commonly use in my practice one of them being orthotics so I'm going to grab an example of those and we're going to show a few exercises and you're going to demonstrate for me you cool that awesome okay so if you don't have access to a BOSU ball go buy one got it they're awesome so awesome so dynamic for a lot of things especially if you're an avid home workout ER these guys you can do a lot of stuff with yeah so this is um so again overpronation is structural so one of the things I addressed because think about holding your arch up all day think you can mentally do that for you know 10 hours that you're on your feet a day or whatever one of the things that I give a lot of people with over pronation who are having knee pain is an orthotic okay what this does is to help support the arch but it will also help to lock in the heel which is a lot of time where the over pronation is stemming from so even if you stand on that formulize a-- stand right there i put your heel right in that cup there right so it's going to be a lot less ability and less tendency for her to over to overpronate so helping to support that arch actively okay okay you can step off what I usually put on the orthotic as well as a heel post for those who have pronation so it helps to support that even more then with anyone who has or pronation issues I really really always prescribe exercises for your feet so not only do you want to be strengthening or using not to support your foot but you want to strengthen your foot as well because you're not going to be on your in your orthotics 100% of the time so you're going to need to do something on your own so typically one the first thing I do is I help to strengthen their the muscles within their toes within their feet that are help supporting the arch they're called your intrinsic foot muscles okay and I do a little exercise called short foot and it's very hard to capture and it's very hard to see but essentially what it's doing is teaching your foot grip strength for the floor and I find that people can improve their balance in their form and their technique if they learn that so what I'm going to show is just it and it's I might have to demonstrate it myself but we can see if you can do it basically they're going to pull the arch of your foot back like that so the balls of your toes back to your heel without curling your toes this isn't so and you're not going to see a lot but just squeezing that arch in there that's like trying to really actively grip the floor with your foot that's going to help to strengthen strengthen the muscles in your feet challenging yeah it's hard it's a definitely a hard movement to get down because you want to curl your toes okay so she couldn't do it it's hard yeah it's pretty hard I feel like I might cramp hold at all time sorry some rep okay I was doing it kind of like kegels nobody knows exactly I'm doing great identify breath she's doing really good I can see her feet her feet are like all veiny to her socks and stuff my feet how often should someone do that how many reps you can practice this literally all day every day no one's going to do that so what so trying to do it like if you're having issues and you want to learn this it takes probably three to four weeks to create any sort of a habit you want to create that mind-muscle connection yeah so I would say you should do it at least every day for a month every day for how long and you wrap up three sets of ten and three sets of twenty if you're sitting at your desk at work if you're on the bus whatever you can do it standing or sitting or with shoes on you can okay repeat Atlee right well you may you may not you may not get the same feeling out of it as if you're doing it on a air sort of hard floor yeah I like you're still working on it because inevitably you're going to have to be able to do it in a shoe as well okay good I know how many people do their chiropractor exercises not liar that wasn't an inclusive of her sir I actually have a lot of good patients here in like the 10% and not a good patient is a terrible business okay so that's that both and I totally actually feel like I feel like I need to stretch now would you actually use a ball after work if you're tight or something should release or yeah you can I be no waste you feel like your feet are tight after five reps no good for you nevermind next question okay I mean you put your shoes back on because we're going to get on the BOSU and you don't really want to go in the boat to a Sox base safety safety hazard you can go barefoot help shoes or barefoot whatever you want I love shoes and I'd like to say I didn't I didn't realize I was taking my shoes off in this segment right away which is why I have the white top and the black shoes what an idiot [Laughter] hahaha okay what am i doing good okay so that is in we're training with that we want to strengthen proprioception and proprioception is the body's ability to react to a change in movement walking hiking running anything like even being pushed off balance John for you that was an invitation though so she has greater receptive skills so on what I do and it's kind of fun for me to I usually have my patients to stand on here and I walk around and push them and see what their reaction is to movement and Muslim fall off which is fun for me so it's easy to stand on two feet but then what we do is we get them to stand on one foot right in the middle of the ball there hey do you need help - no my hands wait wait I have to make sure I'm centered because I know I'm gonna be judged rightly someone oh they're for sure okay so when they're struggling to do this I instruct them to do their short foot exercise so really squeeze the squeeze your foot into that BOSU ball and quite often with that cue they wobble less but maybe not today yeah so then again this is tread this is training not only you didn't get a little bit of core in here too but after 30 seconds a minute she's probably going to feel tired in her foot see there you go you're getting good at it the more you do is honestly if she does / - MS she'll be better at it try the other foot I don't want to I was looking pretty good at the end there you got this girl is super fitting you okay squeeze that foot into the ball switch quickly okay now in the middle do you want me to do I really gotta I was great on that verse but okay now I'm good then once you get better you can start to throw stuff at them have them throw a ball you can even do boss liam is always like get a ball to go back to my good pitch and this can be for specific training as well so if you play basketball or soccer or whatever you can do headers or touch the ball and throw it bounce it dribble it slam it whatever you want to do can you got a knee on there you can just I knew it about okay now I gotta wait for her to bounce again [Laughter] we should do amateur and pro after this professional shot after this awesome another thing you can do when you get really good at it and I'll show this one because I'm really good at it so when you get up onto the ball when I give people as well as I call them jumbo jets or 747s when you start to do like other sort of balancing thing move your foot you can even get into like a single leg squat on here that type of thing and do your exercises while you're strengthening your foot or kicks the money we're going to move up the chain a little bit we're going to talk about structural just deformity that can be at the knee so there's a couple different things that can go on within you when you have your feet together we talked about our baguette or knock-kneed and literally there's nothing you can really do about them structurally but again like I said we adjust a functional dysfunction the functional dysfunction however that sounded okay so typically when you're when you're knocking is when your feet are together and your knees are touching right that's going to put a rotation again similar to the over pronation a rotation on the the femur that's going to pull have your knee pull a little more laterally and more rotation of this particular circle the other one would be bowlegged and it's kind of hard because it's more of like a credit of this wave and knees out it's hard to demonstrate in somebody who doesn't have it but and then you would have the opposite issue than you the femur would be turning out and then you'd have more pole immediately so those are two structural things again we're going to address the functional but those are two structures structural problems that can cause functional problems and even the hips so the lighter the hips are the greater the angle is of the quads on the knee so you get a lot more lateral pulling and women are typically about six to seven degrees wider than men mostly for childbearing what does predisposes us to as women is a lot more we're prone to more ACL tears so you'll see a lot more soccer players and basketball players and women with ACL injuries but also patella femoral pain because the tracking of the knee is a little bit off too and most common things that I see are weeks VMO so vastus medialis versus vastus lateralis to your quad muscles so weak medially strong overdeveloped overused overactive lateral quad so how do these strengthen you specifically so there's a couple different ways we're going to show one to just sort of activate an isolate the VMO and then we're going to show another exercise that uses both of these muscles equally so the first time I'm gonna have you show is I'm going to show you to throw your ankle weights on and I just want everyone to keep in mind that this is something you can do on a leg extension machine at the gym as well but we're just going to demonstrate here for people at home to do again there's a million different varieties of this exercise but I'm going to show you the angles that are sort of best for this always just single leg when you're when you're trying to train in a bound so we can really really focus on the side that's weaker because typically the imbalance is from left to right not even necessarily from quad to quad so you want to focus let's say your weak leg while you're not balancing great on this side so we'll call that your weaker leg so again you can do this with a resistance band tied around a bent or with a leg extension machine so what you want to do in this position you're just you can do it on a machine you can do it sit it seated you can do it with ankle weights it's great you can do it with a band as well you're going to bring your leg out extend the knee and you're going to turn your leg about 20 degrees outwards so you can specifically target this muscle here okay and you can do it isometrically and hold it or you can do press with it [Music] well we're going to get Liza to do you're going to sit on a wall squat but she's not going to go like deep into it she's going to go to about sixty degrees okay so this is one ensure that both sides of the leg are equally activated and she's also going to squeeze some things between here she's gonna squeeze the Pilates ball between her legs to ensure that she's getting the VMO ezp you can start with thirty Seconds three sets of that are you feeling it feeling the burn this is a good one for your bum too if you want to drive your heels into the floor to make sure you're activating those glutes with this exercise the research out there shows that this is one of the best ones for equal ratio quad activation how often should they do this and how long the county right so when you're talking about rehab or something you're trying to fix you want to do it on a daily basis okay like I said I tell my patients to do it daily and yeah usually I get three to four okay there's a week which is better than zero yeah so as many as possible and then like three sets hold for 30 seconds the better you get at it the longer you can hold it for okay and just a couple things can they use like a big pillow or something you can anything what are some get mulch and they can use if they don't have a bloody ball yeah a big pillow works great or a towel I've seen a towel would actually be better because it's rolled up towel because it's a little more firm than a pillow measure that's one more right yeah okay okay so when we're talking about evening things out and balancing things I like to look at the glute because we sit on their butts all day and don't use them and they actually away and we don't want that definitely not an hourglass so we want to work on strengthening that because that will definitely that can definitely influence attraction of the knee as well as balanced as well squat form technique everything so I actually include glute and when I talk about core I include glute as part of my core Lola yeah so you won't see me prescribing core low back exercises without addressing the glutes anything very rarely would I do that I must have over developed just kidding never over the will be hair bomb pretty good pretty good actually we can show that later cause it very good angle my best angle okay so the specifically we talked a lot about gluten me because gluten need is present when you're trying to stabilize your pelvis and also I find it one of the weakest things in squats and lunges and stuff because you're overusing your quads again yeah so I'm going to show you a couple functional tests that I do for people to see if they like to see what they're doing is they're having glute need weakness or if that's something I need to address one of them is just a simple lunge forward and from that I can typically tell a lot tight hips weak glutes you know tight adductors weak female type of thing so I get them to step in and off most often I see if they're not if they're need isn't collapsing in when they're going down it's collapsing in when they're going up and that is one of the biggest indicators of a weak glute I also get them to do a single leg squat and you can tell right away what side of their bodies they're more comfortable using because they're they'll be really weak on one side and not so much on the other even from a orthopedic perspective we do at rest hall a test called Trendelenburg which you just kind of see in here and then let's get them to lift one leg and if they have a weak glute needs they'll do like that they're publishing tell anything yeah so one of my favs a for a lot of say things is the demand I like to use them specifically freeload activation and one of the things we're going to show today you can a progression of the exercise is using a booty bend okay so I'm going to get you to do a clamshell you know do clamshell okay so I want you to demonstrate that for me so you sort of want your heels you knees at 90 degrees heels in line with your bum okay and I get my patients to put their hand right on their glute need so that they can feel it activate okay keep there keep your heels together and biggest mistake I see is rotating back and forth okay so they try and open their leg and they're like I need to open it wider and they just got and said and that's not doing them any favors really so it doesn't matter how high you go as long as you feel that contraction that activation eventually when you get better at it you'll be able to climb a little wider yeah exactly and that's all you need to you can make this a little bit harder if you want by putting the blue band on and charging that way give yourself a little bit more resistance so and then another one you can do is you're going to do this properly an idea process okay so great such a great clamshell another one you can do is is sideline just straight leg lifting your leg abduction again this has a really like research out there showing that this is really one of the best exercises for activation of that glute knee muscle yep I find sometimes people if they're too tight in the quad though however with this they'll have trouble with this and they'll use way more of their quad so that's why I get them to start with the clamshell but some people really feel this a lot if they have good control but we're trying to teach control but some people feel this great and and again it's another good exercise we have a extra bonus that we're going to show of the slide just through that if you have needs it hurt that you can do instead we're going to show it I think it's time okay okay okay okay so if you want about the stability ball do you want to show do you want me to show it okay okay so I'm going to put these on this again the table this is do not feel that if your knees don't feel good this is a squad that you should still be able to do so this is very exciting because you saw people out there they just don't get to fly anymore I know that's a shame so one of the main main things to remember when you're squatting and you have knee pain you don't want to go past a certain point so you really don't want to go past 90 and you don't want to load up your back so this is going to help take some of that load off with the ball behind you so you can lean into the ball and you can drive your heels into the floor to activate your glutes the band is there as a reminder to drive your knees out I'm not going to activate your glute meat as well okay so when this band starts to get loose and collapse in that's you know when you're doing it wrong so all you have to do is sort of sit in the squat here drive your knees out turn your toes out a little bit and remember on your way back up it's really important to keep your knees out as well so driving out keep the knees up - and that's why I find a lot of people have the pain when they get to a certain point and then their knees kind of collapse in when they're coming up that's when they're not actively using their glue please so above this exercise for those of you me pain this is a really good guide for you guys to get started if you're having trouble with any of the exercises again like I said see somebody out and and these aren't only the ones these are just a general of what I find are the most common problems with people with patella femoral pain or anterior knee pain and just in it with metalic I don't have any pain thank goodness but pretty much all the exercises that she's shown I just incorporate them into my regular workout routine which is probably why yeah then I need to buy the thing on preventative and pretty sure that's why we hang em no it's all about the preventative even if you don't have knee pain I would say try to incorporate those exercises for sure because they can't hurt you they can only help you yeah they're not just going to be her knee pain or knee issues or they can be addressing other things as well yeah i prescribed those a lot too back pain knee pain whatever yep okay so thank you so much to dr. Lawrence and thank you saw it you started some love in the comments down below we're also going to put her information in the description area so if you're in the Toronto area you can check er out but I'll loosen up videos every week if you make sure to subscribe like the video share it with your friends and let us know if you tried anything if you have any more questions for us in the comments or what deflects in the next video and we will see you next week people making fun of me [Music] 
hey guys I'm Lizbeth Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and I'm going to talk to you about the worst cardio that you could do if you're trying to build your booty this is the thing guys when you guys are trying to choose which cardio trying to choose which what weights to do all that kind of stuff you have probably have full-time jobs you might be a mom or you know you have other things to do than trying to figure out okay if I'm trying to do this which cardio showed you which way it's a lot of stuff there's so much to think about so I'm going to tell you exactly which three you should not be doing and then at the very end of the video I'm going to tell you the three that I like the best so you got to stay tuned all the way to the end see how I did that you see you see the very first cardio that I'm gonna say is like can't do this one is jogging and I'm so sorry because I know there's you know certain running groups that are sponsored by people and stuff like that that are really fun and they're great stress release I'm not saying it's bad to do I'm just saying it's not great for trying to build your bum and actually it might actually make it flatter okay the good thing is if you're trying to lean out your legs it will probably make your legs look a little bit leaner and smaller but if you're actually try to build your bum not the one that you want to do if you're really insistent that this this makes you feel good you like it at least add an incline okay maybe take it up a hill you'll get a little bit more gluten gage Minh to kind of give you a little short story on how I actually know from my own clinical trial on me that this is true is back in the day when I had built my legs so much because they didn't know about glute activation all this stuff at the time and I had some pretty big thunder thighs they were like rubbing and ripping jeans and all that kinds of stuff I decided I'm gonna stop all leg training and instead become a jogger and I was running for like an hour every day and my legs got so skinny like I'd never seen them so skinny but my ass was like it disappeared it all went away I managed to get it back again but it was it was gone so not helpful for the bum bum okay so the next one I'm going to talk about is are you ready long duration cardio in the fat burning zone and you may think I don't I don't know if I do that or not if this is you you go to the gym and you sit on the exercise bike or the elliptical trainer or you do a nice jog on the treadmill or an uphill walk and you're doing it for like you know thirty minutes plus and you're at that zone where you're just feeling good you're getting a nice pump and you're feeling great about yourself then yes you are doing it this is this is you yes you're doing some fat burn but I want you to think about this so when you're going that slow duration for sure you're burning calories and for sure you're burning fat but you're only burning so many calories because you're going at that nice comfortable pace you're not super challenging yourself so the percentage of fat that you're burning overall is still probably less than if you were to do something like intense Sprint's where you're burning so many calories and even though the percentage of fat burn might be a little bit lower for that amount of time possibly the overall amount of fat and calories and everything is still going to outweigh it and be better so that's just one thing that makes Sprint's better not that I'm saying Sprint's we're better but Sprint's you're better okay so my very last one for you guys before I get to all the good stuff the three favorites is actually that 90s year 2000 style of you know grapevine okay all of that cardio in a group class where you're kind of fit dancer size it's really fun it definitely does have some benefits number guys I'm not saying this is like bad bad so I'm just saying it's not gonna help build your bum grapevines and knees up and and like light jogging on the spot is literally doing nothing for your derriere what do we have in common with all three of those is their long duration their low resistance and low intensity those three things will not help that bum bum do we get that is that all coming through I hope so it's not only not building muscle but you might actually be atrophying your muscle and what does that mean making it smaller and that's part of the reason that it's not only not helping your mom it might make it shrink oh my god all of that hard work all of those squats and then you're making it smaller so that's definitely not what we want to do so let's move on to the things that we want to do new oh no is guess Sprint's it's Prince okay I love Sprint's so much I do them on a very regular basis myself if you watch my snapchat are you watching my snapchat lives of a slow PES on snapchat I actually walk you through how I do sprint so so really really intense bursts it's probably a total of maybe like five to six prints over maybe 15 minutes with little rests and stuff in between a little warm-up this it's you burn more calories you burn more fat it's muscle sparing so I'm burning the fat and maintaining my muscle and on top of it it even activates the glutes that power off of those Sprint's it actually helps you build your bum bum on a tip on top of keeping your bum bum like everything about it is booty building okay and fat burning so Sprint's is number one so my next one that I love and especially for my slim girls out there slim girls are you listening you want your booty and you want to be lean and tone it's bike sprints okay so there is the running sprints was the first one by experiences the second one why do I love his bike Sprint's especially for my thinner girls is because one it's fat burning it helps with the bum bum it's muscle sparing but it also does build the thighs just a little bit which for some of you it will look so sexy and so feminine so bike Sprint's are amazing full intensity when I say sprint it's not faster than but you know the the heart rate zone it's everything you've got so I want you to really learn to slowly progressively get to that everything you've got mode what I'm going to tell you as well is with the two forms of Sprint's one of the things that I really love about it is even though you're only going for a short amount of time if you're doing like a Tabata or you're doing the Sprint's you might be going anywhere from four minutes up to a very probably maximal of about 20 minutes and even though you're only working out for that amount of time it boosts your metabolic rate so much that it takes about 24 hours and you're burning calories that whole time so it's actually way more effective than if you were doing kind of that steady-state cardio in your heart rate zone where you're burning for the 30 to 40 minutes and then right so which one would you rather do okay let's go to my very last and favorite one for building your bum bomb through cardio throw on a weighted vest okay if you're a little bit more advanced and we're going to do some intense running up the stairs with the weighted vest so we've got the activation of the gluts by going upstairs we've got a little bit of weight and we're doing it in first okay make sure that you're coordinated before you try this we don't tripping on the stairs maybe try it without the weighted rest first get climate into the type of stair that you're doing and then go for it so full-on bursts take your time back down the stairs just like if you seeis furniture they sprint sprint sprint and then they take that nice walk back they get their heart rate back and then they do it again so those are my three top ones to build that bomb bomb I hope you enjoyed that and I will see you in the next video please comment below if you have any questions something you'd like to see in the next video like the video subscribe because I put out fitness nutrition and recipes every single Tuesday and Friday I hope to see you there peace out so first thing that we're going to talk about is energy good so with energy drinks I know that we think that like even just in the title energy like it sounds great right and really at the end of the day it's just kind of glorified soda with extra caffeine and maybe a little 
hey guys I'm lied about Lopez and I'm a registered listing nutritionist and master trainer have you ever done like squats or finished your workout and you're just like I don't know I feel my quads I don't know if I feel my bum these are all issues that I find that a lot of women have when they're doing their like dates so I'm going to tell you an awesome trick very simple and it's called glute activation okay so what is blued activation it's basically doing slow kind of isolated very flexed exercises of the glute muscles before you do your workout or before you do your cardio to make sure that they're engaged are you ready I'm going to do it in Kuwait you can do it with nothing or you can get yourself some ankle weights and it will be even better so once I get these on I will be ready to go now when you're doing activation it's not really the same thing the full workout so doing it with nothing on your ankles is actually fine because the whole goal of activation is flexing so here we go guys and so you're going to get into this position which is quadruped ed you want to make sure I like to actually still do this I'll give myself a little punch in the belly and cut the reason there is a reason to it the reason I'm doing is to make sure that my core is also engaged and turn on because if it is not and your abs are relaxed then you're going to arch your back and then you're going to hurt your back instead of activating your bump so you're going to take yourself to that 90 degree angle at the heel and we're going to do 25 reps okay now I'm going to make sure that I'm flexing out on each one I realized actually a little bit hard to count and talk at the same time I'm knees my fingers there we go were at seven so hopefully you're joining in with me now what we want to think about right now is we want to think about the top of our bump so right there okay and really thinking about engaging and flexing it when you go exercise number two which is this one right here I call it fire hydrant think a lot of people call it a fire hydrant you can make the visual and guess why we call it that anyway anyone yes little awkward okay still accounting so right now what I'm trying to add wait is the side of my bum okay the side of my bum is also known as the glutton eat okay the gluteus medius and a lot of people say can I build out the side of my bum can i widen my hips you can not widen your hips through exercise but what you can do is you can build out the side of your gluts a little bit and that's gonna help a little bit with that curve fill it out a little bit I'm definitely activating my five more reps getting close to that 50 point and writing it with me too and one more okay here we go exercise number three this one involves a little bit of ABS we're going to crunch in so I'm going to contract here and kick away crunch in kick away so now I'm getting the top full part of my glutes a little bit of the erectors but because my core is holding really strong and tight um I'm not hurting my back at all I don't even move feel my back at all if you have a little bit of back pain maybe do this one without your ankle weights but if your low back is strong you won't even feel it and I'm definitely feeling the glutes engage I've got five more I hope you're feeling your bum this is gonna help you next time you do squats and you do this first you're gonna be like oh that's what it's supposed to feel like I've got three and two and one more bottle exercise are you ready we're almost at 100 that's 75 down plus behind and up okay so we're hitting the glutes from different angles and that is the goal in our activation little breathy go ahead so this one we're hitting right to the top all the way through I can feel even the sides activated because I'm feeling the side while I'm doing it and now I'm wondering if I should have done that too and balanced no good good I hope you guys are doing good as well hitting those glutes picture yourself in your little short to mix it all easier five four three two you're almost there and one okay one leg down I have you for leg number two I'm going to switch over to the other side and we need to do it all again ready and we're gonna begin so we're gonna start with that donkey kick okay so again we're gonna is 25 reps and the main thing I'm doing right now guys is I'm really just thinking about the flex so the top of every single rep flex it out control it Shh exhale inhale perfect and you should start to feel those glutes engage if you have ankle weights on you'll probably feel the hamstrings engage as well which is pretty awesome because again I like the double bump so the bump of the glutes the bump of the hamstrings good and I'm really thinking about that contraction at the top of the movement so we're not just kind of lifting and dropping flip for here we go three two superplex thing we got one more okay we're going into that fire hydrant again here we go about 25 reps of these drive it up now when you're doing these again thinking to the side of your bum that's where you should be flexing and the whole point of glute activation is thinking into your Flex making sure those muscles are activated this is how we activate them then you're going to hit thrusters squats lunges anything and the glutes are ready they're engaged the glutes are our biggest muscle but they still need to be activated or other muscles say I'm going to take the work on and that's how we end up with those big thighs because we start doing squats and that type of thing and the thighs just take over and I am feeling this I'm totally getting activated four three two one more here we go next one remember this is abs and bum so we're gonna inhale and exhale away inhale contract exhale away so when I'm doing this one I want to thank you to my core my bum my core boom huh so I'm really thinking about that contraction of the glutes contraction of the abdominals I'm getting I'm not swinging if you swing that's where it's not going to be as good for the low back because remember what we're doing is activation and inactivation we want to flex feel the Flex at the top of the movement so if you're starting to feel it I'm definitely starting to feel it and it feels amazing contract good for three contract too only one more to go guys here we go we're almost fully activated last one so we're gonna put that knee behind the other knee foot is still facing the ceiling pop it up pop it up I like saving this one for last because I feel the contraction at the top of the glute more on this one then in any other one of those four exercises so it makes me feel at the end like super super good now if you're at home and you're newbie you're brand new to working out and you want to do this just as your only glute training exercise sure get some ankle weights they're not very expensive they're very small you can keep them under your bed and you can really hit that bum bum and this is what if this alone will help you with toning five I'm up there are you ready for get excited three count down with me if you want to - last one whoo I feel good I do this type of thing every single leg day before every sprint that I do and that's how I get the size and stuff that I do with all my clients I hope you guys enjoyed that video and we put out videos every Tuesday

hey guys I'm light Smith Lopez and I wanted to do something a little bit different today someone to do a story time and tell you guys about how I left my government job and became an entrepreneur so this is kind of like the beginning of my career and yeah I know there's a lot of entrepreneurs out there I was actually recently speaking in an event the event was called whip um and it was amazing I had the best time it was I was speaking on a panel with other entrepreneurs and to a group of women so the woman were all it seems like kind of like up-and-coming Millennials and I was so excited with all of their questions and their energy and you know it was a pretty big like club night in Toronto I camera was going on it was like some big weekend but all of these young women were here to listen to us about starting your own business so it kind of just kind of got me excited about sharing some information on that so I thought I would tell you guys about um when I quit one and how I quit my kind of cushy government job to become an entrepreneur so here we go and I'll just quickly just for those you that don't know me um now my business just so you know is I own I'm a workout it's called hourglass workout I initially started it and I now partner with my husband and we have a large gym in downtown Toronto so forth biggest city in the world and it's the second trendiest neighborhood in the world as voted by both magazine is where our gym is which is kind of cool just now we have 14 locations here in Canada and then there's also locations in the US and the UK and I also have a you know good online training business as well I guess I could call it successful which I adore I love my little twl team and I'm working on more projects now but um but you know I've moved to a place where I'm not saying we're like the biggest and best entrepreneurs but we you know we live off it we do well we're very happy and we have an amazing team and like great great great team not just me my husband we have a team which I like love you guys so much but anyways so I will tell you how I got from working in the city to quitting with the city to getting to where I am today I think I'm going to do this in a couple of parts I think that this part I'm just going to talk about the initial believing and and starting so just kind of going from the government to to getting it on its feet and I think I'll separate it into maybe like four different parts just because not everyone will be interested in all the different segments or if you are you just might not want to listen to the top for that long that - so here we go um so I started out I have a background in basically like kinesiology and fitness and recreation um that's what I started school and nutritional sciences and holistic nutrition so um I was a kid that grew up in the rec center system so meaning I spent almost all of my hours at the rec center hanging out and my goal because I just loved my my recreationist fabbi and you know Sandra had really amazing recreationists which were the people that ran the community centers where I used to hang out like all night so I wanted to be a recreationist when I grew up so um so in addition I went to college and I did recreational leisure services with Jimbo doc who is like the bomb professor fYI anyways so I did that and I became probably one of the or the youngest recreationist I was hired as a full-time recreationist right out of school and I wasn't even finished school yet when I passed everything and was signed on and had my own community center that I ran and I have to say I I literally adored that job like I loved it I worked with the community I work with you that was reviewed that rich worker and I got to make a difference every day and feel like so good about you know getting to do things with these kids and I just loved it when I did that job for a long time I've started with the city from like when I was 14 teaching gymnastics and then I taught aerobics when I was 16 and I've always been a rat girl so in you know then I got my job like right at school so I was there for a long time and I absolutely loved that job while I was doing that job I also personal trained on the side and taught fitness classes and stuff like that and I loved that as well and I was also competing as a fitness model so was competing in Fitness competitions shows and I was competing as a pro and additionally judging shows I I always have like five jobs at least just FYI I have been that way since I was like seven um so I was I was competing and I was teaching these workshops on how to walk and pose I was like I think what's her name again hmm I can't remember she's in I'm Florida but there was there was one girl before me that taught walking and posing and I think I was kind of the second person to do it Kathy Savage Kathy savage was the first I think I was the second person and I would lead workshops here in Toronto who will travel in to take them and everything and I would get girls ready for shows and I would train them for shows I would teach them how to walk and pose and that was my thing um initially was was a show prep outside of working for the city so that was my side hustle and I was competing and everything and eventually with my city job I got a promotion okay and my promotion was go to the city hall and when I was at City Hall all of a sudden I was no longer working with youth I was no longer working with the community munity they knew I all sort of fitness background and had studied it in school so I was now doing policy writing for fitness and basically I was I was on a computer and typing and I was I was a paper pusher so I absolutely hate it I hated my job so much like did not like it it was it was literally what went from being something where I would spend way more than the eight hours required because I loved it so much I moved to City Hall and saw the bureaucracy and I hated that and I already didn't like the budgeting and stuff that's another another story um I'm very Pro youth and pro youth you know so there was some stuff I thought I didn't like let's not go there anyway so I did not like my job so when I was competing I was one of the first pro fitness models in the history of the sport and they wanted to do the Federation that I trained with they wanted to do a light with Lopes classic show so I was like it's amazing so we did the slides of a bulbous classic show at the CNE which was pretty cool it's a pretty big place here in Toronto and at the same time I was also doing my side hustle my personal training I did out of knock us a name out of a gym in Toronto so I had those two side hustles and when I was doing this classic show they were just like you know this is going to take a lot of work and I know that you don't love love your job right now like why don't you take a little sabbatical and really like work on this and really go in on it and see if you like it so I was just like oh that's a really interesting idea I hadn't really thought about that type of thing before I knew that when I was at my job I was always doing extra work like creating events and stuff like that because I just I just like doing stuff um so when she said that I'm like okay let me ask and I asked and they said no so I was just like okay well they said no and so I was talking to my friend Carlotta and she's like well why don't you look and see if there's other ways of doing it and I looked in there was you could kind of only take part of your pay and have part of it held off or whatever and then you could choose to be off for a while we use that pay so I decided to try to do that and then eventually they actually said no okay we will give it to you and I was just like okay cool um but I would be off for six months with zero pay and I was like okay okay so maybe um and I did it I was just I was scared I was just like oh I'm gonna not be at my regular job that had been it you know I've been working through the city since I was 14 and at least in school and working in the full-time working so that was kind of crazy but that was step one was saying okay I'm going to do this six months with no pay because I've got this event coming up and I've got this um you know the side hustle of doing my PT here and then I've also got my fitness model camps that I do so um long story short and I don't want to you know hurt anyone's feelings or anything but the event there was hundreds and hundreds of athletes that came out and dancers and everybody and things happened and nobody got paid including myself so so there is that so I was off already three months and expecting this payout and that didn't happen so I was just like home like bye welcome to the world of entrepreneurship and then at the same time with the gym that I worked at and had I didn't know that they were struggling but um again I had no income whatsoever and then I kept asking him I'm like guys like are you gonna pay me are you gonna pay me and the next thing I knew they've kind of snuck out in the middle of the night and a gym shut down so I was sitting there I think this was three months into being off and I now had no money from the city no money from the event and no money from my personal training so I was just like whoa that that's just crazy like that was quite an eye-opener to what can happen like off the get-go in the world of entrepreneurship yeah so um so that was a little bit of a wake-up call and the only income I had was doing my fitness model prep classes and I thought to myself okay I could kinda like put my tail between my legs and go back to the city after three months and just say hey can I come back like I know you've replaced me for a minute but can it come back um I didn't really want to do that and I also didn't want to be a personal trainer like I'd already been a personal trainer in like high school and college so I was just like I didn't quit my not quit I didn't leave my job to personal train um I did have a waiting list though because like I said I got girls ready for shows I'd helped a lot of girls become pros and so I had this waiting list of girls that wanted to train with me so I was just like okay maybe I could do like a camp of like a bunch of girls together and I could prep them at the same time you know and I was talking to another girl friend of mine and she was just like oh yeah yeah absolutely I'll come out I'll bring like 15 of my friends like 100% like just start next month so it was like okay let's give this a go and just see what happened so I came with the name hourglass workout and I bought the domain for it even though I didn't know anything what web sites or anything yet but I bought their domain and I started to make like flyers and stuff and I opened up that next month and not only did my friends friends not come but she didn't come so luckily I've done a little bit of promoting myself and I got seven girls out so I had those you know those girls that were kind of like in the city and on the wait list so they all came out to that that first class and even though it was small and even though you know a lot of chips are not falling in a row I had like the best time ever it was a lot of work it was like it was a lot of work um but I kind of loved it so I was just like okay this is this is pretty cool um and I thought okay I need to actually really start promoting this so I went to Apple and at the time I don't know if they still offer this or not but they had these one-on-one sessions so I got in there at least once a week and I would try to sneak in to get in there because you're only loved once a week but somehow I managed to like get in twice a week every so often and I would each time I would do a lesson so um I would learn iWeb how did how to make website so I built my first hourglass 4.com website with like PayPal and everything and and built that site I built my first lines with Lopes calm so I was managing and building both of those and created the emails and all of that kind of stuff which was just absolutely new to me I was a government girl you know like I worked for the city I had assistants and staff and everything like that like I ever saw like 40 staff when I worked for the city um so I had people to do that stuff and I was in I was very confused I was in like a whole new space I had to learn basics of graphics of stuff I didn't have a budget like there was there was no budget to be seen to do this um so I was my own graphic designer I was my own I was my own blog designer you know I customer service everything so so it was it was a big learning experience but I have to say there was this one job I've always had five jobs by the way so this one job that I had when I was in school which was working for which one is that Red Lobster no the steakhouse anyways I can't remember to the cake it was the tech um so I worked at the keg and the one lesson that I really loved that I learned when I worked there was your very first I can't remember it was like your first three days or something like that you have to spend a shift with each different area of the restaurant so I think I don't remember the order but I think the first shift I worked a whole shift with the bartender right so before I was even allowed to waitress there so first shift was at the bartender and I saw everything they did everything they went through when they were slammed what it looked like then I worked with the bussers and I did the bussing and then I worked with the cook staff and then I worked with the manager and literally I think it was like a week before it's actually on the floor serving but the best thing I just thought it was so cool the best thing was when I was waitressing and it was slammed for there with lunch lunch is most acceptable by the school when I was waitressing it was like if something was backed up or something I knew why and I knew what they were going through and I really had a sense of what each person in the restaurant you know have going on and that was like just one of the best business lessons along the way that I've learned is just to see what everyone else has to do so that you know you just have a better understanding of that of the rules so when I started my own business having to be the web designer and the graphics person and the you know promoter and the teacher and the schedule and the assistant and everything now like later on in life now when I have when there's different people doing all of those roles I know I know kind of what it takes to do all of those not what it takes to do them but kind of you know why things might take longer or what struggles they might go through so that is one tip for my entrepreneurs out there is just to you know no matter how high you are up it's good to know what's going on and how to do each area but anyways so when I started out I had to figure out all this stuff so I was I was literally if I wasn't teaching I was out at like different clothing stores leaving flyers they're going to different businesses and saying hey like can I come and do a lunch and learn with you and you know maybe you guys want to come and check out my program and try and figure out free weeks and being on social media and taking videos and put them and you know just kind of like non-stop trying to hustle and just get the word and the name hourglass out there so I was do muscle so when the six months came up eventually um that you know I was only supposed to after six months so one six months eventually came up I remember my friend Carla is just saying to me so like are you coming back or not and because she also worked with the city with me and I was just like dude I don't know like I'm kind of liking this but that's a government job like that is pension and good pay and unlimited like busy land Cairo and you know dental and massages and just you know like and security you know vacation time and maternity leave like all these things that I would not have been sick days like all of these things that I just don't have as an entrepreneur just running a little boot camp you know and on top of that like this was just a boot camp you know like I didn't have my own location I was renting space in someone else's gym what if that gym shut down what if boot camps weren't trendy anymore what if you know someone else just with more money just copies my idea and these ticks on my clients what if I get injured like there was just like a million what-ifs but I have just gotten started and you know if if I would if I was going back to a community center I don't know I might have gone back because I really liked my community centers but because I was going back to the government building that I didn't like I was just like you know what um can you help me and see if I can get a further extension can I do a full year in that is six months so there was a lot of nose until eventually it became a yes I don't remember how he turned that no into a yes but somehow and managed to extend it to a year so I was like okay I've got six more months and that's probably it like at the end of that six months I don't think they're gonna let me stay off longer so have to really go in and make sure that this is something that I want to do and something I'm gonna be able to be successful at so the next thing that I started to do was I started to try to find trade shows and trade shows are really expensive like they're like three four thousand dollars like they'll charge you $800 to use their internet and they'll block your internet by the way so you're just like oh I'm not gonna write into my own internet they block it so just to get tables and tablecloths and carpets oh so everything's an extra like nothing's included so I rely I cannot afford trade shows back then so I was looking for small trade shows in which I found and I found little local things I found one called the what women want show which was by my friend Shanae and girl that was such an amazing event I wish she would bring that back again it was like fun but anyways so I did the what's what women want to vent which was just like you know local women everyone more dresses and let me tell you like you learn as you go okay so I showed up to this um this what women want event and it was it was tradeshow style and I showed up with me and business cards I think that was it so everyone else had these I'm watching and they're just like we set up time is better than I'm just like oh okay well I don't I don't know what I need to set up and when I got there everyone had backdrops and and display cases and I'm just like hey my five I feel like such a good thing me and my business cards so I sat down at my booth I was down I had nothing to set up at all I felt really stupid but once I got over feeling stupid I realized I'm here I have an opportunity look I'm here so I'm just going to talk to people and I did and even without all the fancy stuff um you know I just kind of moved the table and just brought chairs over and just made it like a little social area and I just do sat down and talked to girls and we taught from the love fitness and stuff and I got a lot of new clients and I got a lot of amazing clients like Shania me and Carrie I'm pretty sure that you guys all came from what women want show and it was it was great it was it was an amazing event and the next time I came the following year I did have some backdrop so so I learned from that mistake I didn't want to feel stupid like that again but um but I still took that opportunity and I got people to to come in and be a part of it and build that business I found that the biggest thing that helped build my business was weird enough I mean I used social media I used Facebook I made flyers I put them outside I gave out flyers they did all that stuff but the number one thing was we're milk when you care and you like it's your baby it's your business um you'll you'll really you'll you'll put 100 in and people will see that and and it was just referral after referral after referral I had one class in the morning and one class at night I'll tell you what my day look like actually my day looked like I would get up I would have PT clients a personal trainer incline at 6 I would teach a class and then I would have probably like 4 or 5 more personal training clients so teaching another class and then I have another personal training client and then repeat it was I was tired I remember my last client of the night which would be from like 9:00 until 10:00 p.m. when the gym would shut down I would be like like that like just like trying desperately to keep my eyes open and I felt so bad but you know these two girls they wanted to compete in a show when they were out of Glassboro so it's just like okay I'll open up another slot for you I was beat but I kept going and at the same time I didn't understand systems yet so I was doing everything individually and by hand so um so I wrote each diet individually and when I only had like seven girls it was fine but when I had like 30 girls to write 30 individual diets based on that person's questionnaire I was up to like two three in the morning and client at like six writing the diets and then feeling so terrible if the girls forgetting them like a week two weeks late because their handwriting luckily every single girl no one ever like I think when they know that you're not you know chillin you're really like trying to help them nobody ever got upset that they didn't hit their diet on time everyone was just like okay I I know it's all right they knew I was I was working they knew that I cared and that was the main things that I really I really did care about them a lot I still do to my boos my original tonight we called him HT oh jeez I got from all like dog attacks they say htog on it our glass original thanks anyway um we still show love and yeah so it's so building that business from from ground up it was really important to kind of make sure having in that program was loving what's happening because those referrals are everything and then the local stuff was really important so I remember just like not even realizing how quickly was growing and just showing up one day and being like oh my god there's fifty girls in here like I can't teach fifty girls this isn't even safe and I just looked at them and I said okay who wants to call me tomorrow at 6:00 and it was ago at 7:00 and we just split the group into two and that was how I first started to actually grow the classes and eventually it was to class in the morning two classes at night and even eventually I had to cut off the personal training which was like the hardest thing to do I love a love personal training because you really have more of that one-on-one you get to really see you know them progress and everything like that but I actually had to stop personal training because hourglass was growing so much and I needed to wake those diets because individual diets and and I needed to grow it and so eventually this is where I actually decided I don't remember is every this was years ago so I don't remember the exact order the way things happen but I remember deciding eventually I need system like I'm dying here I have like a thousand unit literally a thousand emails behind I'm like 20 diets behind and I have to teach for 10 hours tomorrow so I could just stop sleeping um so that's a good problem to have that man you know it was definitely growing and things were good so I hired a virtual assistant that was my first staff person ever and I was just like oh my god I have a staff person I was like so excited um so I hired this girl Robin from West New Jersey I want to say and she was great she was she was excellent and it was it was such a godsend oh my god um so she would answer like all the emails and stuff like that and at first I was you know when you have your own business and it's just your baby you are so scared to have anyone else do anything touch anything because you're just like oh no one can do it better than me because they don't they don't know my girls they don't but they can you just need to find the right person and you need to need to take the time to train them and let them know what's important to you and and they will be able to do it but that as an entrepreneur it's a really hard thing to grasp that someone else is going to be handling my clients and stuff like that but it was one of the best decisions and in a right direction um so Robin came on and she handled that stuff and the team now is like it's it's a big and anything love my team Calamity amazing team so we started there don't have Robin anymore Robin if you're watching what's up but um yeah so that was the first person that I brought on from there like fast forward to a year where like the big decision lied my friend Carlota again to my friend Carlota worked for the city as well she still does um and she was just like okay she's like I know they want to know what you're doing are you coming back and I was just like dude I I really don't know like I'm loving what I'm doing but there's still there's all those what UPS like what if I get pregnant I can't teach class and be pregnant I can't afford to have a full-time instructor you know if I was a city I had not leave and I think I could have a litter of kids if I ever wanted to and they would cover me every single time but if I break my leg what if I get sick like all of these waters start coming back again what if the business goes under with the gym shuts down and I'm just like so i sat with hubs and we talked about it and I talked with a lotta and she she said to me she said you know what she said I'm gonna write your letter of resignation and I'm gonna he know it to you and she said if you want to you just hit Send and I was just like still feel like I could feel the emotions coming right now I was just like oh my god like because there's no going back when you work with city there's seniority once you quit your senior and he's gone I will never get that job back so it wasn't like well I could always go back you know that door would get closed done someone else has that role someone the lineup has become like thousands of people long again um so I sat there and I just remember just like a really I knew in my heart that I wanted to stay with our class but it was a big decision and I remember hitting send on the you know that Carlotta did from your - thank God because I wouldn't been able to put that together myself at all interest rate and then I - I actually ran to the bathroom because that's when you're just like this is like this is it like this is now this is this is on me and this has to be successful like this isn't just like a one foot in and one foot out anymore this is like this is all in and I think that that's I think it's a good thing I'm really glad I left in the first place actually but you know you know but once you go all-in you you have no choice but to go like straight ham and I did and it built and it built in a built in it built I would say my my advice for people out there if you're like really trying to decide and you're just like you know like I have this dream but you know I need this day job or you know and that day job could be like me it could be what you went to school for it could have been your original calling or click your job that you just hate anyways and you're just like how do I get started I would say if you are trying to make that decision just to know that becoming an entrepreneur it's it's um it's very very different than having that nine-to-five for someone pays you and you get that paycheck and you do what you're told you create what it's supposed to be you create your day and your day could be anything I mean my day could be sitting in computer all day writing blogs it could be learning to do my makeup for tutorials for stuff it could be being in Miami talking with sponsors it could be teaching classes all day it could be writing workouts it could be editing manuals like every day brings something different and if that's something that you thrive on then that could be something for you but you're the one creating what needs to be done also there's no one's - you like okay you need to have this on my desk by this time and go that you need to be highly motivated you need to have Drive you need to have goals and you need to be able to kind of put you know okay here's where I am now here's what I want to be here's the steps that I need to get there and I need to be consistent at it and some people think they can do it and then when they realize it's it's a lot of work like it's a ton of work like again I had to learn to be a web designer teacher you know a Lipsky everything um so if you feel like you're ready to do that it's such an amazing experience um I love I love being an entrepreneur so much I love that I can create my destiny I just think it's the best thing ever I've had a lot of really tough lessons along the way I'd like to do um some other parts to this series that because you know I don't want this to go too long but um you know I'd like to do one that I'll call the day that I lost one hundred and twenty thousand dollars that did happen just a couple of years after making that initial leave and where I lost everything that I'd made and had to decide if I was going to continue and and kind of how that happened and how I overcame it and and just also another one I'd like to do one on franchising so how we decided as a team because by this time I know a team on how we decided franchises and how we did the franchise and kind of how that all works and just like ups and downs and that type of things so anyway so that was my first story time I hope you guys liked that I hope that you learned a little bit from it and I'm not really sure what people's questions are so I'm just kind of going on this was my initial experience at the box of how I went from this job to this job and so a few of questions that you'd like to kind of see include on the next video because like I said I'll try to do at least two more that just kind of give you a little bit I'm an inkling on how I built there how my team and I built this business then leave a comment below and yeah that's it I'll sub my youtube channel cut out lots of different videos fitness nutrition all that kind of good stuff another part of this role so I would love it if you check those out subscribe like comment share all that good stuff and I'll see you in the next video thanks guys 
hey guys I'm lives with Lopez and I'm going to continue on this video where I left off in the last videos the last video I talked about um basically leaving my government job to become an entrepreneur start my own business and so if you haven't watched that part I would say watch that first and then continue on to this one and otherwise you can just hear this story which is I'm gonna entitle the day I lost one hundred and twenty thousand dollars and it was actually more like one hundred and sixty thousand if you count kind of the end end and end um so here's how it went of basically I mean if you're an entrepreneur you know that there's ups and downs and all that kind of stuff I bought a lot of the downs right off the bat but I stayed on it and it's all good there's been a lot of ups too so it's it's okay but um but starting off where I finished um basically I had left the city I started my own business and I was running my boot camp which was hourglass workout out of a gym so I was running space at a gym and just a fast board so you don't have to hear this whole story but basically over about a three year period following that um I had to move from gym to gym about six times that was very hard on me it was also very hard on my clients with each time I was like oh my god where am I going to take them you know I have this business that's grown to like about 200 250 girls a day showing up for classes so it's not like I could just like find any gym and plus there were certain time slots that people are used to like before work and after work which is also most gyms prime time so just to say to a gym hey can I use your rent your biggest dance studio from like 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at night and you know 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. in the morning most gyms that's when their classes are so this wasn't an easy feat to have to move those six times each time was incredibly stressful um anyways so um I ended up at this one gym that I really liked and because they weren't really busy with classes they were more busy with memberships it was like a fantastic marriage and everyone was pretty happy until death sentence until one day were just like the most freak accident ever where are them the gym was on the I guess 2nd floor and on the third floor they were doing renovation so they were like drilling into their floor which was the gyms ceiling and a big chunk of concrete fell out of the ceiling and onto the only member in the entire gyms head and yeah so um lawsuit right so um that was where we were and that's when I realized you know what I think it's time do you have my own location so um so this is why this is where it all starts this is where story begins um so I decided I'm going to open my own gym and I did the search I was um I was excited to have the pasta a little bit bility of having my own space and I finally found this one space that I really liked and I went in I had a in-person assistant now if you're watching the other story I had an online assistant I had an in-person assistance so she came with me she had recommended a real estate agent so I didn't feel the need to look into this person because it was a referral from my assistant who I trusted and so so this is where it all began so we went into the space and I decided yeah I think this is the one I think I like it and she gave me this agreement to lease so I said okay cool I'll take it back to my lawyer and you know we'll go from there and see what happens and she said no this isn't a lease it's just an agreement to continue talk so it's just so the landlord knows that you're interested and I was just like oh but you know it still has to have me sign and stuff so I'm like I'll just stick to my lawyer and she was pretty insistent but like friendly insistent like oh no no you don't have to worry like really it's nothing that about of that I'm just like I think we went back and forth about six times because I was still just like not so sure but she totally 100% assured me that this was not at least it clearly said agreement to lease and it was just just so she could go back to the landlord and say that I'm willing to talk about it so that I could get something to take to my lawyer so I was just like okay well I don't want to be like an ass about it so sure okay I'll sign it so for those of you that have never rented a space before or not in real estate what I had just done was sign a lease without reading it or giving it to a lawyer because I was built into it by a shady um what I thought only was um I thought it was just her in it at this point there's more to come so um yeah so apparently I had just signed a lease um and now had a studio I hadn't even read the contract because I didn't know it was a contract anyways so obviously so we got the after an agreement to lease then you look at the lease but generally you have lawyers and stuff look at this so anyway um yeah I don't want even go back into that so anyways um so we started the build-out because we had three months to open so so we started the build-out and me being this like total green just like okay well let's at least just get the starter this is I got trust me I'm not I'm going to talk about the tears and stuff that happened after that once I realized what I had been like yeah suckered into um so we started the build-out and I didn't like I'd never built a place out before I didn't know that in a commercial situation that the landlord wasn't supposed to be as involved as this landlord wanted to be so he chose my contractors for me which because he did that and was pretty insistent again I was just okay like I had my own contractor but that I used for everything but they seem to make it pretty clear that notice you have to use our contractors so I was just like okay um and I kept getting bills for things and I just didn't know I didn't really understand anything of what was going on because I was so new and and I didn't realize that I was being conned at the time so that's kind of the key to what's happening here is is I was involved with the con artist and didn't no way um so yeah so I kept getting all these bills and you know I was being told like lighting should cost $70,000 and I'm like I don't I just want to do really simple pendants like I don't want to spend seventy thousand dollars on lighting and yeah there was just all of these you know I'd come in and my space had been used overnight and there's beer cans and stuff all over the place and I was just like I don't think people are allowed to use my space like I'm renting it him I'm paying for it and it was just like the most utter confusion ever and because because I didn't know better and I was being taken advantage of to just make this long story short so after about three months of Tears and the most confusing build out you've ever seen in your entire life because again I was being conned I didn't know I was being conned I just knew that something wasn't right but eventually I turned in office space which is what it was into a gym so I turned you know it was an office and there was showers and sinks and lockers and padded floors and elliptical machines and weights and you know it was it was a fully built out like lighting and everything so throughout all of that I built up the whole space and don't think it was easy I would go and teach my classes I taught like you know probably like six personal training classes clients and for full classes so I was working you know eight to ten hours of actual work a day plus emails and dead of that and building out the space and going through this like what is going on stress of not understanding what's happening in the studio that I'm building but eventually through all those tears and fakes my not all fake smells I will say the one thing that was like my saving grace outside of my husband and and family um was that when I would go to the classes the girls just gave me such good energy and they were just like they were so excited that I I'd have to start the day with faking the excitement because I was in such a low place that they could eventually turn my low place into a high place so that was that was one thing that was those life blessed in that whole situation was that I was surrounded by positivity so it was impossible to not let it affect you and and let you you feel good for at least a portion of that day and then in the middle of day I go back home cry anyways eventually the space was built um and I was excited that you know finally let's just let's just get this started I was still pretty terrified because I was just like I'm a relationship with this like you know it's not not a happy place for me to be like I actually didn't enjoy going to that studio it just felt so negative and is just an upsetting place to be so anyways but we were ready to open it was built we walked up the stairs me and all the girls and you know it was their first time there so we were trying to spread that excitement and I went to open the door and I was like why why won't it open like what's going on and we looked up and the doors had been nailed shut like they nailed the door into the ceiling so that it was not open a ball and I'm just like I know that I'm paying rent like I I followed every single thing that I'm supposed to follow even things that didn't even seem you know to me what what's going on so I called and there's no answer and we just we couldn't figure anything out so luckily I was able to go back to fitness one and teach my classes and while I tried to figure this all out but let's just make this very long story into a shorter story and just say that I later found out that the landlord was suing the people below me and they'd sue the people in the book in the space that I was in before me as well and basically this was a con so they they get a building and they um have people rent it and the people finish the spaces and then they don't let them use the space and then they sue them if they leave so the his goal was for me to leave so that he could sue me for not like paying rent and then he's got his finished space probably a settlement and then he can sell the building for more money so um the problem is and I was ready like I had I was like you should see me I was just like I've got my audio recordings I got on my video recordings I've got so much stuff to show that this whole situation was so wrong and you know what I mean but because here he knew what he was doing in advance he was he was ready with everything like the accounts were empty even if I was to win I win nothing make big heads for empty you know what I mean so it was just like there there was no winning situation the only thing and trust me for I think two years I fought this and and the end result was was me paying a settlement which is pretty crazy so I never got to open so it was about $100,000 in Renault said I did about another 20,000 in the legal fees and then about an thirty thousand in settlements for a studio that I never got to use even once so that was um that's what I call a true learning lesson in entrepreneurship um that yeah like even the people it's a really sad lonely to just to really realize that you can't trust people you know that that was my real estate agent that I couldn't trust in my assistant that I couldn't trust and you know just just so many things and to be lawyered up and to be ready and all that kind of stuff but it definitely taught me perseverance um you know it showed me who around me that really like loved me and all that kind of stuff and who was there for me in these types of situations because you really see that like when you're at your lowest low you really see who is still standing with you at the end of the day because it's hard it's really hard and I mean my girls like my hourglass girls oh my god like how amazing are they like we move all over the city over like oh my god over like five years I think we were in like seven places and you know there's so many of them that were with me from like day all the way through so I love you guys if any of you our glass girls are watching because you're like the freaking bomb anyways but um but learn so much from this and I mean as much as I wasn't a person that just signed contracts even at that point like I was fully ready to be lawyer but you know I I trusted her after her going back for six times I just like oh hey you know I still can visualize that and be like no don't sign it obvious it's too late but since then since then you know it I I still had the business and there was still nowhere to go because as much as you know Fitness one um loved me and they were there for me and everything they were still they were in their home a suit um and I was moved to this basement of my studio and now at this time my team had grown a little bit and Hubbs had come on board with me which was like the most amazing thing ever and we were once again with this decision of this just happened to us are we are we going to try again like we can't we can't have our glass of grown this much we'd already franchised at this point and you know are we going to stay in the basement of a Muay Thai store you know we can't we can't do that we can't have the flagship there when we've got franchise locations that are standalone locations so we decided we're gonna have to try again we're you know we've recovered some of that money let's let's let's do this again let's let's go for it whew that was scary and so we got in agent again obviously a new one that one she's lucky that I'm not saying her name in this video because I would really like to but I'm just not that person yeah I want to though if you're watching anyways anyway I take cress so we had to we had to go in again so um so we looked for studio again and we found an amazing place even better than the first place right right on clean west um you know second trend reason aber hood in the entire world is bloated by both magazine I'm just saying just saying um anyways so we found this space beautiful beautiful beautiful space and we built it out and we had such great helpers like so many the hourglass girls helped and like drove cars and drove equipment from place to place like men we have the best squad ever and plus my team's amazing but anyways let me talk about story um so we did a full beldo this was an empty shell and when I say an empty shell I mean like there was no plumbing there was no it was just a concrete box with nothing so we decided to rent this space and turn it into a gym so I flew in again and and you know everything was was was pretty good you know things were relatively on track and everything like that you know it was tough the Muay Thai study was was tough it was it was nice and the owners were amazing it was so nice of them to help us out but when they flushed the toilet it smells like sewage so we needed to get our studio running because that was not okay for our girls so we did we finally got the studio up and running and then we were open for a good two or three months before we got sued again so this time even though it said in our lease that guess where boot camp will be making noise we'll be playing music we'll be jumping will be using weights all of these kinds of stuff they still decided to sue us for noise issues because the building was built like not not not built for a gym and then they decided to put residents above us so it wasn't really built for gym and residents at the same time so we got sued again and and um luckily it ended up okay I mean it was it was really tough like I'm just gonna smooth over the tough part it was really really really tough for about six months I like totally um got overly stressed and I couldn't move for about two months like literally like I was so dizzy that I couldn't I couldn't work out I could barely work so that was that was really really tough and that was like the stressful part of the court situation but once we did get past that and I am gonna glaze past that and just say it sucked so badly but then once we got past it it was fine um you know we ended up the lawyers and not the lawyers the the landlord and us we resolved everything and I think I think we work together very well I think I you know they understood our side we understood their side and we just fifty-fifty split putting in shutting down to shut down the entire studio but they gave a space downstairs which was very nice of them and we split the hundred thousand dollar cost of putting in sound to flooring and soundproof ceilings so we had to like everything had to go eat a vulture and and we put in Sanford Florida from pursuing that was now a couple of years ago now come what the relationships been very good now with the with everybody because everyone we all know everybody's trying so it's good but um but yeah so add that all together with legal fees and soundproofing and the first time in the second time that's like an over two hundred thousand dollar loss and you know what you just have to go with these things happen it's not whatever it's not like it's not like I just make that like this because I don't and that first hit it was just I didn't have a team yet that was me and that was my personal training money the second time at least we grown a little bit we franchise add a team there's more people to Lina and I'd been there before but it was still tough and again like you really see who's got your back when you're in those types of situations cuz it was it was really really hard but um but yeah we got through it and things have been going really well and you learn like you learn from all this stuff you know everything is a learning situation and I love my business and even with all of these incredibly crappy lessons that are you just want to die when you're going through them once you get to the other side you know you it's so cliche but you're better for it you're stronger you're ready to hopefully not have to deal with those things again like hopefully you're smarter and you know you know that there might be something lurking around the corner hopefully not but you know you hope that you're more prepared for it and and as an entrepreneur we see these things happen to people like I'm just one story there's stories not as bad as me their stories much worse than me um it is what it is I would I trade it and would I go back to working for the city and not have to go through all this hell no Wow no um with with those stories being like here's some crappy things that happened to me those are just some things crappy that happened to me there is so many amazing things that have happened and the way that I get to live my life and work with my hubs and you know change lives of amazing women and work with amazing women and feed off of great energy and provide awesome services and you know just all of the positives outweigh the things that might happen and it did happen and you know I just I'll never look backwards and say mmm what if I'd stayed at the city no you know these are the things that go along with well not hopefully not for everyone but these some things that could go along with you know there are Conners out there which means there's people that are gonna be victims of con artists there are you know lawyers out there and court systems which means people are going through them like these things do happen you just you get smarter so that is the story of the day I lost and I don't even know why I'm only say 120 the day I lost over $200,000 or at least the period of I lost over $200,000 but um but became better for it should be the end of that sentence and I hope all of my budding entrepreneurs out there do not take this as something to be scared of just just be smart be smart surround yourself good people read your contracts don't trust people just because they work for you get second opinions um you know I think that's it for now um I will probably talk in the next video about franchising and it's another sad story that turned into a good story but the sad story that turned into you know it's kind of like a that's no good how am I going to fix that and turn it into a positive and then it turned into an awesome positive so that will be more of a happy story for the next one but I did want to share that just because I know a lot of people will just look at things from the outside and be like everything in their life looks amazing well like they're always on vacation and they're always doing this and you know like know their struggles there's absolutely struggles and there's tears sometimes behind those smiles but hopefully those smiles turn into genuinely happy smiles and good times okay I'm over talking now so I'm gonna head out I hope that you enjoyed that if you did um please subscribe like comment definitely comment below I would like to know anything else you'd like to know I guess about entrepreneurship in this situation or you know just you know that kind of stuff if you have a story you'd like to share or link you'd like to share to your story um I'd be curious to see it too and thank you for watching especially committed all the way through my chatty self okay so guys thank you bye

going for bench V up you're going to hear some beeping noises there they go we're going for 35 seconds and these are the vs now with the V up what you want to make sure is as you come up you are just kind of contracting at the top to really hit that core and make sure that you're not just bringing the knee in because that hits the hip flexor okay so what she's doing is right here is where the hinge is happening and she flexes and it's very slight it's not rounded here but it is a contraction how's that feeling you got six seconds until we do weighted rock crushers and now she's going to grab her dumbbells grab your dumbbell or something if you have it if you don't have a dumbbell do with know about dumbbell here we go so she's going to bring the barbell in just over her knees she's going to crunch up there we go and this is the rock crusher BAM whoo she's hitting the court as she comes up she's exhaling as she comes down and she inhales really important that you're actually contracting and selecting the core so as she comes up she exhales and she flexes okay I'm gonna give her a little sucker punch at the top ready here we go here we go oh they're good very good we always want to make sure we're flexing and not just moving around because if you're just doing this you're doing nothing Shh you want that and very good Casey we're moving along too hiccups so she's going to flip over for hiccups adding that cardio and we were popping in and out now what she's doing is she's plopping nothing she's popping in and out from plank couple not a whole house popping she's popping her toes right towards her hands and she comes up now let's make it even more intense keep going she's going to fall extra core at the top select so she's doing a little ab crunch so as she comes up it goes shh shh so it's almost like an ab crunch every time she pops her toes towards her hands she's got really good muscular endurance which means she can do a long distance up and I could hear the panting which makes me feel like she's working very hard which makes me very happy it's on two jacks so we're doing jack jacks are also known as V ups but I am an ex gymnast and we've always called him jack so I'm sticking with it okay so she's driving up she's reaching right up towards those toes now if you're a beginner and this is challenging because this is a more advanced mode can you jump into Jill's for me this is the Jill's move so if you need an alternate you can do this one instead where you're reaching for your ankles and your knees are bent and she's exhaling she's flexing report out at the top we've got seven seconds guys I hope that you are sweating and feeling the core just like Casey as I could see her she's still smile and though what a trouper we're going in 200 guys and we're doing three rounds of this all together so we're going to start with the most easy so we're going to do yet so right here hands at the side and it's like we're bouncing a little tennis ball now I like it to be even a little bit more yes right there and we go we go inhale two three four five exhale two three four five inhale two three four five exhale two three four five continue on that breathing now if we want to make it a little more challenging we curl up just a little bit more but we keep the spine in neutral so that had compressive that's nice and we're just kind of like gazing up that way we've got four seconds and we want to make sure that these are burned up away like I said okay we're moving on that was good that was a level two of that and then we're going into reverse current resist ability well I thought it I thought it gave me here we go here we go we're in there get stability ball guys hands underneath the booty so she's very strong so she forgets to put her hands underneath her bum because you doesn't need to but most people do most people need to put it right here and then they pull their core in like so to try to get their spine to not arch okay to keep their their their back close to the floor so I'm slipping my hand underneath her back right now to make sure that she's kind of pulling her abs in dropping bellybutton to spine to keep her spine safe as she does this move we're getting there Casey we got Pilates ballet crosses there as well we'll get it later okay looks like this point those toes this I love I love this Pilates movement it's all about lengthening the legs so she's reaching her legs as far as she can away from really thinking mentally you can't just make your life longer but you're thinking about how long that they can get pointing your toes she's pulling her abs in she's curling her she left curl them up even a little yeah where I'll select it but keep the spine neutral keep that neck in neutral and that's a little bit more text boom-boom-boom-boom I love it you've got six seconds keep crunching keep crunching this is just the first level of it there is another level who's ready for that okay we're going to have a little rest we're about to go to a low hold I know fire as and low hold so she's kind of she's I want to have extra to touch so she's kind of looking towards her thighs she's lengthening I don't mind a few point or flat so she can dorsiflex or she can she can plant reflect either one she's pulling this and strong now let's do our Pilates if up you've got 14 seconds we're pulling the ribs together through loin Shh I'm pulling in we're dropping the belly wasn't fine we're pulling the cables up we're doing a full Pilate zip up she's lengthening she's flexing she's squeezing her life together true that was great for this we're going to store triplex and we're going to Pilates flutter kick here we go scorpion strong and bam bam now I like to movement to be focused down so kind of down down down down down to really did you feel that engage in whoo and again we want to make sure everything is coming in and Pilate if you want to make sure hold and ribs drop bellybutton kegels pulled up it does get harder you might need to take a little rest that's okay and we're breathing and we're breathing and we're cinching let's get a little more aggressive for that last eight seconds with a boom boom boom I know I know you got it you got four you got got it three to rest again you got a six second rest before we do another low hold I know I know like we are going to get balanced okay reach those nice nice and long there you go we're stretching we're flexing now I'm going to show you I want you to squeeze your sides together I'm going to try to pull her legs apart which look I can't I and I'm actually trying look at that earth but in suit um she's really squeezing them together you could also if you're not sure you can hold like a yoga block or a little Pilates ball to really squeeze together as well to focus on getting into that involuntary flex I love that so turn up flex down boss you're in shape script like right there it's so good you go - you got one you got another rescue one more exercise we're going to do some swimming where you ready to swim roll over onto that gun tongue and we're going for the swim so nice and lengthened really good now the goal in the swim is that you don't want to think arch or lift too much you want to thank stretch so reach your arms to the front well read select the back well point those toes lengthen and we're working the erectus rightness we're working through the lower back I like to actually try to turn the booth off and it lets me in a strange and we were always trying to work the booth but we actually want to work the low back in this one you had another seven seconds but fun is in neutral had it in line six it's not popped back up and we're in rest mode you made it through round one you only have to do it two more times lower rest you want to do a little active mobility stretch so she's going to lie on her back she's going to learn a little side to side window so hands out to the side knees are bent and this is not a workout exercise we're just kind of getting keeping our spine happy so she was just going to drop beside his legs to one side good and then over to the other side perfect good enjoying your rest knowing the stretch it's going to do one more to each side you guys can join in on this little stretch and now she's going to curl up and sit up on her bum and she's just going to roll like a ball for a second so she's on her tippy-toes she's nice and tight pulled in and she's just going to round her back and roll back good and then pop back up good and the goal is that your core is actually taking this so you don't just fall forward good and we'll do one more guess what time it is everybody is time for round two it's Burpee time let's go whoo it begins so again you've got those different options which is the three push up with the six mountain climbers and you can do the other version is freaking me out with how closer for this for that bitch I'm filming the benefit you keep going you keep going but everybody keep going out there makes you safe and have a safe little area she's staying strong look how she's still staying I her toes that's what happens when you have a camera faced at you is she doing it anyways I'm just kidding she's like come on Liz you know I'd be doing it now a couple of things we want to keep in mind here are some ways to know if you should be dropping to your knees if you're feeling your low back if you're not able to get at least 90 degree angle at the elbow okay if you're dropping your head too much uh-huh I still get Nash recommend keeping the core really strong if you're if you're not able to engage your abs anyway then it's okay to drop to your knees you guys have one minute left one minute of cardio left getting the heart rate up now why is this drill cardio into this ab workout because it makes it a little bit more of a metabolic conditioning workout which i think is really fun because when you're doing abs it's not just about working the core and hitting the muscles we also want to hit that little bit of fat burn so you can see what's going on under that layer of fat because you could do amazing core strength exercises you saw the layer kind of sitting on top of it you're not going to see it so that's where a little bit of metabolic conditioning comes in along with making sure we're flexing and doing all the core work and all of it together with a good healthy eating plan all works to give you a really nice midsection you guys have 15 seconds 15 seconds to go how he's feeling Casey true she's feeling amazing now you don't see this but on us is behind scenes and if anyone remembers Anna from her Tabata workout she is understanding and feeling case to you right now aren't you Anna she's saying yes I am it didn't see you Beca that and time and time you made it we made it to the beginning around two okay here comes the Tibet o'clock Casey are you ready this time I'm going to have her do the the cherry bomb with you instead the bench pieps are you ready sherry Benton we have started the beeping is happening these are cherry bombs how much fun are they if you're doing them at home I know that you're just like what is this and where did it come from we actually had an instructor here hourglass named Keegan that brought this to our little family about five or six years ago and we've been loving them ever since silently Casey loving loving this exercise it looks really funny but it's actually awesome fits a lot of power a lot of strength just make sure to do an exhale and ash and a brace and a pull in at the end you've got three you got two we're going to the weighted rock crusher there we go and again Kevin you don't have a weight you can do this with no weight that's totally fine you're still getting an excellent workout good and the goal is on this one if you can try to get your whole upper body off the ground and you're reaching for that so and you're exhaling at the top and you're flexing and as your knee comes in you lotion you've blessed and you come on your cable and you flex in Pilates we do a lot of that like sama flight I hear a lot of martial arts people insist and do that as well it's a really good just it just helps you exhale make sure that you're hitting that muscle for me it's almost a little reminder of I feel it let me hear it there it is there it is three two let's do the jewels this time so we're going to do the more beginner version so rather than Jack for those of you that are doing the jack bring a ceiling and you're on it go for it but we're going to do the beginner version this time it's still challenging and some of you may still have trouble getting your upper back off the floor that's okay everything was time to me I always say as long as you're moving that's great and you're going to get there slowly but surely and you're going to keep getting stronger and eventually you're going to say I remember when I couldn't do one of those and now I'm doing the most advanced version that's so crazy but you're not going to get there unless you start off in your beginner versions and you just go and you just say I can do this and I know you guys to do this Rey Casey they're rocking it at home okay we're going into Russian twist Russian twist did we forget that on the last one here why talk about it you guys shot nothing mr. muth but now you got to do it now Casey's of course starting with the most advanced versions because that's what she knows okay we're going to show a couple more vision persons as well so let's this is the advance for those that need it when I put feet on the floor as well but some of you will need to do feet on the floor now the one thing that is a pet peeve of mine is when people just drop the weight drop the weight and they're not engaging at all when you're doing this remember this all the time with ABS you just make sure your brace you hold your weight and reflect and then you twist the flex and twist the flex so you're really engaged in 100% I'm you see it to scale those muscles hopping or even our shoulder started to pop we're going in 200 here comes the Pilates we're going to a higher level if you're ready you can stay at that one or you can start to come here here we go Casey's turn it out good so she's not this is this is the most advanced when she's all the way down here so we're going right here we're going to do that one next time but right now we're here if you need to you can go back to the version where your feet were at a 90 degree angle and if you're very new I'm just going to populist per second feet on the floor this is the most speakin or version okay but I want more I want you oh no bringing down for a second to speak for the newbies give me those hands pretend you are really bouncing some two tennis balls and we are done go to the reverse cards with the stability ball on I give accessibility well here you see okay for this one I'm going to now take you to an advanced version since she didn't even know that she wasn't doing it the last time so she's gonna pop her feet all the way up and now she's going to control as slow as possible then they come all the way this far oh yeah bring it all the way up now reach it up high as you can now control control control control did you see the involuntary shakes love the involuntary shake all the way up now you can also stick to what you were doing last time can you think she can go slower because that's what I want I want so slow I want the what last the next want to take one of the last three sessions that we have that was better that's what I was looking for now you're blocking me from the camera okay Pilates valley processes right here we have it to me hands underneath the bum good core engaged she's kind of gazing I heard sighs but her fine is still she's still trying to keep her neck in neutral if she's not lifting too much you see the caps - I didn't even realize those kinda see the boot girl she was in it X dancer yes yeah X dance your calves yeah that's that'll do it okay so I want to see even more boom-boom but yeah let's get some cardio in there we're really making sure that the abs are not going to pop up the ribs are pulling together the belly button is dropping down the kegels are pulling up we have sent another three seconds I'll explain Hazel's next time here we go reverse crunch Lily boss weddings all prizes holder yeah that live it and are you up there and in and reach bring the head down just bit yes so we're just gazing at the thighs the spine is still in neutral now here's what I'm trying to get you guys to avoid is when you're in that position you want to make sure you're not like this or this ever we want to keep that wherever the spine goes the head goes to so every time you hear me saying neutral I'm just trying to keep her spine and her neck all in the same alignment and there's none of this funky stuff I'm just playing as she's dying I'm so sorry it's coming it's how many you got five seconds for you squeezing your legs together he's blue even he's got that five second rest cool before the flutter kick we're getting there we're getting there almost under burn two guys here we go flutter kick we got that door size left which means those totally kind of reaching and spacing at you good we're pulling in and what is our emphasis dances dances Jim Jim dance dance and that made for a core really turn on she was working the ABS are pulled in she's got their hands under the bum she's driving her back towards the floor just a little bit just to stay in neutral so it doesn't arch for making sure teeth black we are breathing we've got 11 second flat to envision you're doing great how are you doing are you put in probably I would have been so right now right because she's finished pretty fit okay rest so close so close to got the low hold again who's excited she's excited here it goes stretch it out good and we're going to point those toes we're going to lengthen lengthen now we're going to think about the zip up so let's talk about zip up cuz we've got 24 seconds ribs fall together belly button drop pull that belly button to spine while flexing so if I do this you so mean it means one two this fish came strong now we're also don't pull the kegels up pretend if you were peeing okay but you want to stop it but no okay that is leaving the kegels up and I want you to do that I feel no abs in there good job very good and rest we're going to get ready for the final one which is the swimming with a low back she's almost there it's almost rest time again here we go we're a long gating we're reaching forward we're lengthening the legs so we're trying to get as long as humanly possible remember look the cue that we're turning above off so we're trying not to flush the bottom and have this left the bottom guy is a big muscle is going to be like I want to lift the leg and you say no no I'm going to let it back to it this time so turn off the glutes and make the lower back and the upper arms move some of you will probably have trouble getting the arm up and it's just going to want to stay in the ground these are very small underused muscles back here which is another reason why it's a good move to do to strengthen them and your unrest for a minute you do let's do those stretches again so let's start with roll like a ball this time Jen Trenton and senton and your timer has started for your rest well roll like a ball good so again it is it stretched we're just kind of like massaging the spine it's been doing a lot of work so we're going to do the opposite of what we just did which was the swimming and just give the spine a little massage let's do one more of those and then we're going to do the little side to side so we're going to let the hands go to the side perfect knees at about 90 degree angles or so and we're just going to go side to side just giving the spine a little spine twisting love spine loves this it's just like Oh since it's so good it's so nice and what I like to do sometimes is even the Contra level just kind of like bring the head to the other side if it yet and then as that goes that way that goes that way and you're enjoying your 20 seconds of rest remaining oh the rest - Casey do you need a water after you okay don't forget to drink water guys so during these rest instead of stretching you can also drink water but guess what we are at a time and it's time for round three are you ready can I get a high five over here - only me hanging thank you so much I wouldn't blame you if you dead but it's okay ready weight is out of the way it is I'm three and begin burfi two three push up to six mountain climbers and she's still on her toes whoa she hardcore she's hardcore it was a real time we're doing no cut to she's making it all the way through it's not like she's just like okay I'm just going to take a little rest in just pretend she's she's going she'd go on like right in right Casey whoo and she's not even breastfeed when I talked her should I talk to the whole time see that they would be a little bit funny okay I'll start talking to their you go into that form on this last one this is where you might start to get a little bit tired we're going to say no no I'm going to push harder set I'm going to get lower and my push-ups I'm going to jump higher I'm going to reach further in those mountain climbers because I'm almost done so I'm going to get even more excited I'm going to go even harder right Casey we're exactly what she was thinking exactly what she was thinking we've got ten seconds left guys if you're at the knees that is okay if you need to take breaks that's okay but just do your best try to go as hard as you can you got three seconds two seconds to one minute and one more minutes to go that was Jimmy Adams really mean it was actually a mistake on my part but it just ended up being funny so whatever money or me funny for me which is always what counts when we're doing these little work out making sure that were really pulling her core in hard as we can we've got 40 seconds to go do you think we should get Casey to speed up what would happen would it be it would be fun what about you at home you think we can go a little faster she's slowing down just a little bit oh there she goes there she goes she's up for the challenge are you up for the challenge oh ho ho she is speeding up can you speed up along with you there's only 25 seconds ago I feel like you can I feel like this is where we're really going to get that metabolic conditioning in we're really going to get that fat burn going because at the end of the day it's not that long workout but it's perfect for if you can only have a little bit of time at home and you pop it in and use oh there we go case he is alive 10-second let me count down with you got eight that seven pushes little faster eyes you hear me counties with five they've pushed before big three two and we're going on to the ads that would span creaking size to give them a little like air head by piece to give a little bands yeah okay let's begin slipped to the floor again I feel like a lot of people are going to have a bench we're going to want those chair bumps again are you ready your timer starts in three in two screws here we go to Bob and cherry bomb and everyone's like thanks again for having us all do this exercises at sandwich this we could perfect now if you can't do the sex says if you're having trouble get your back off the floor just make sure can we just scan over to I'm sorry it's just a little bit funny you go bro keep going we've got eight seconds just do your best if you're just trying to get your back off the floor just do your very best and you're going to get stronger okay we're going to hiccups flip it over flip it over hands on the floor here we go pop it and pop it out and go pop it in pop it out now remember as you're doing this it's not just figure just popping your feet in and out you want to do two things you want to reach out to that plank the best you can the bottle the movement is a plank which is that position right there and as you're popping in I want you to just like you are doing an ab crunch on the floor I want you to crush every time she comes in she crunches and she was and she goes right there that's a Shh okay no different than if you're doing that crunch on the floor so you are getting abs you are getting cardio who are getting legs it's a pretty intense one hugs oh yeah more into let's do a half Jill's and half Jack so we're on the floor when you do both of the levels so you can follow along through advanced or beginner and here we go

we're going to start the Jill's now let's do those Jill's there we go and you're going to reach for your ankle I like now right now I'm going to say she's actually being a little bit lazy it's not her fault I didn't cue it I like it when there's no collapse see the full collapse happening let's go to a hover ooh this is where I like it and remember nice and strong let's do the two levels - let's start with feet on the floor and then we'll go up into advance so contract now make sure I like your face like the neck kind of stays neutral is fine but it's not it's not this okay it's it's about finding a contraction and moving through the contraction and then the head just stays neutral to the spine and the eyes to stick the eyes can stay kind of forward cuz some people will get dizzy and now she's moved into more advanced can you do the most advanced can we do it's fun challenging people when they're on camera I love doing it really mean okay that's Sophie's two hundred hundreds were

much I love you guys you can see that eyebrow is penciled and that one is not failed as like bases and stuff so we're going to fake where my brow goes because my brows kind of go down and they close up my eyes so she's gonna fake it a little higher to give me like a bit of a natural I left all through eyebrow okay let's go to the mirror is pretty bit different then not done but not done yet this is just a look she still has to do the blade I like it but your natural hair is tied to right here so I like the look of the right one as long as the last one matches okay Mary I'm using my noggin it's really everybody gets a different result into it and how they lifestyle or how they take care after care is really important Liza bill is like a fitness a superstar and does a lot of exercise so normally instructor or someone does a lot of exercise it's faded little faster than others or oily skin people it doesn't last as long numbing was part one drawing a part two and measuring is person next you're going to fear draw some really weird lines all over my face and that's part three is measuring to make sure that it's kind of like all those through Bree said does it hurt I've had it before the numbing helps a lot it doesn't tickle guys just dude you know you have to you got to be a little bit mentally prepared but it is bearable it doesn't feel great but it is bearable it's and it's 100% worth it [Music] maybe I'm painting job Lisa asks what kind of credentials should you look for in a person when they're doing your eyebrows so some people they like to bring some picture and then they wanna have exactly those kind of shape but it has to go with your natural face feature bone structure change your muscle and expression so I don't recommend like you know if you want to completely change like a what you don't have I like to working with what you have and around it and make it better Heather what's the average cost oh I charge about 6:15 that include a conversation 45 minutes what do you think all right guys I need to make sure I love it because it's gonna be on my face for two years that has the people our life better so now the funny measurements this looks hilarious guys so this will be a little bit entertaining turns my phone in your way no problem so these are measurements marks guys so she's like measuring my nose to my eyebrows of course I have a broken nose so good luck Heather yes that's my name is Hannah crazy [Music] and then things to think about guys especially from my workout bus to on my page that might be some workout people you cannot sweat for ten days after the procedure oh my god second let's drop mindful in on myself that's how you know when you lot to work out again once all lipid has scabbed up because it's going to scab then you can work out again but until it scabs even if there's one scab left you cannot train well you can try and be canceled it okay in from pretty can you make sure can you have a sit I like it you like yeah I feel good we are going medium brown I think it's good yeah I think this color will be it is a little won't told it has a warm you I want it to be warm yeah [Music] I'm getting scared now what's going on my eyebrow right now so I'm applying numbing cream again before we start oh this is more numbing cream okay amazing and thank you for that no prob old so I'm just checking in this is where we're at um it isn't we did the first part of this eyebrow off line just so we could both concentrate a little bit so she's already kind of done some bleeding on this and now she's adding ink and how many times do we do each brow all mixed fruit max three times so just kind of depending on what had to thanks my brownies maybe I'm changing [Music] whoever pretty yeah yeah I'm just really sharp so I like it yeah I like it too okay guys so she went we're going to do the whole first pass off camera so she can like make sure that we get the shape perfect and then once we've done that then I'll let you actually watch the bleeding part is there bleeding yes the opener will be a little bit where's that light pretty late okay so once we come in for the third round you'll actually watch the bleeding part of it and there will be a little bit of blood but you'll see how it actually happens so I'm going to knit again and now with the blade mm-hmm you see it in her hand [Music] maybe I'm painting [Music] I think I need to look in the mirror okay oh you already put it in or no I do oh is it that little guy right there so right now she's got the pants and she's just great the bigger might go into the scoop there you go there you go yeah it's like a tattoo except for look it's like little mini hairs you know I mean so it looks like little hairs because I don't pluck my eyebrows I just don't have a lot of eyebrow naturally and I kind of love big high road what are you applying right now so this is so lacking agency you will have to close the pot and helps to stick the pigment into your skin make it look like little hairs as like actual eyebrows I think it looks great yeah I don't want to overwork when your skin - yeah I say shave is good I think the tumors color is pretty good I like the thumbs up thank you guys so I think that is it for now thank you I'll probably be snapchatting for like the next well I always thought Shepherd for like the next few weeks I'll just kind of show the recovery Chile otter and the healing process and then once I'm done that I'm going to put a whole blog together of the entire process from start to finish and youtube it because I love YouTube thank you for the heart thank you the thumbs up thank you fine and I'm glad that you thank you 
hey guys I'm lies about Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and today I'm going to answer one of the great questions of the world how do I get my water in I know you know you've heard it a million times drink your water and you're just like yeah I'm going to and every day is tomorrow I'm gonna drink enough water and then you don't so I'm going to help you to figure out how to actually do it this time and stick to it are you ready let's first start off with some of the amazing benefits of water just in case we forgot or didn't know water can give you shiny healthy hair it can give you bright skin it can give you energy there is faster metabolism so fat loss and that is a real thing yes all of the things that you probably want in your life water will bring to you but yet we all struggle every day to be like oh did I get my water and I know it's not like the sexiest topic just drink your water okay just drink your water I am gonna make water fun for you are you ready in fused water try making it it is one delicious and two it gives you added benefits to here water like antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and less disease and all of this fun stuff rolled into one thing so let's do it we're going to start off with watermelon and basil sounds so good right but I want you to imagine ah it's like honestly I'm smelling basil is like waking up in like a fresh garden I'm not it's just the nicest most invigorating scent so not only are you getting benefits of basil oh my god basil it's literally like it's so good and it's anti-inflammatory and cancer-fighting so tada tada I like to let it sit probably about two hours before I will start drinking away at it and that's when you start to get flavor you can actually refill it a second time with more water and still get more of that yummy taste imagine this like at parties or you know you're just walking down the street with your water and people like whoa what's that you know you're all fancy and stuff what you want to do and of course all of this is pre-wash is you want to you want to scrunch it okay and why am i scrunching up my basil it lets out more flavor this for our wafer I can still smell it and it is I just want to drink it and as it it's just so pretty this is something that you can have for your kids too I think people will be more likely to want to drink this because fruit drink or fruit juice is definitely not something you should have in a place of water because it is not not healthy we have another if you watch the M ten worst healthy foods also on this YouTube I'll link it below you can see more about why you don't want that and you don't want it for your kids either so here is numero uno again these all come with lids just move them up they do close oh hold on there we go but it came with this like how am I supposed to know it tastes okay guys just the scent of it it just like it just wakes you up and you're getting all the extra benefits of it as well and for me I'll sometimes just eat the watermelon afterwards because watermelon so you know so the next one we're going to do is strawberry and cucumber something about cucumber in your water it just gives it this like smooth taste I think that's why spas use it all the time it's very relaxing kind of flavor so again I'm just popping my cucumbers like how easy is this the strawberry lasts well but it doesn't last as well as the cucumber so I would try to do the one with a strawberry you know within like 2 to 4 hours so pretty rate I think if you add mint it doesn't become a maketo am i right I think it looks kind of Mohito ish I do have some mint should we try that am i wrong are people that drink laughing at me and saying that's not anywhere close and where's the alcohol well not what we're doing here we're making water this is I'm smelling a lot of the strawberry but the cucumber scent does start to come out later and again that like really really nice smoothness now when you see this you're going to want to drink your water right like think about it you have this which of course we know we have to drink but on those times when you don't want to how much fun is this right it looks all special like I'm on vacation the flavor already came through I didn't even have to wait the two hours so good okay guys who's thirsty now you know that you want some of this it is it's just so good okay so the next one I'm going to show you guys is already grapefruit ginger and basil with citrus here is something that a lot of people don't know now okay I'm Pinterest and Instagram when you leave the rind on it looks prettier so people do that for the photos but in actuality the rind can actually get bitter relatively quickly so I'm going to leave it on for this one just you know you leave it on for the grapefruit one but we're going to do a lemon one as well and you can see I cut the rinds off for the lemon one and when I make it myself even though the rinds have a lot of nutrients in them they do taste bitter in the water so I would recommend cutting off those rinds like if you leave it overnight I would not recommend continuing we're going to throw in our basil and the grapefruit is like helps with anti-cancer anti colon cancer and stuff again that basil is so good with the immune fighting and descent of it and then I'm going to throw on some ginger ginger is great for digestion great for digestion it's great for inflammation isn't it free with all those colors in that mix but this is a really really nice one okay today is not nice you might have even tried this one before and that is our lemon and cucumber so the lemon and you can see that I've cut the rind off of it because I don't want it to be bitter and lemon is great for liver detoxification lemon is great for liver detoxification which is really important because we live in a toxic world so we just we need that little love of that liver detox I have lemon probably at least four times a week so this one has kind of that lemony flavor with a little bit of that smoothness added to it from the cucumber it's really quite lovely it's a very popular one you'll see this at spas really often I'm just going to show you with watermelon I do this in my house like all the time you can get this at like kitchen stores all over the place drop things all the time but watermelon is one I do very often for this and you just do this and presto so the reason that I like this is because obviously if I'm pouring it out you're getting just the water with a fusion of the fruit versus if I'm drinking it out of the if I'm drinking it out of something like this without a straw right then I'm going to get hit in the face with the fruit and that that's actually what happens so that's why I've got the straws in there also maybe it wasn't just for pretty set design I really like these no this is not sponsored this is just like a vitamin C water there's a lot of crap out there that you can put in your waters and I'll tell you what this doesn't have in it it doesn't have artificial sweeteners it doesn't have artificial colors what it does have is is just basically vitamins and stuff yeah so it is busy and we were just going to pour it in like so and now I'm getting a little extra dose of vitamin C a little bit of a nice flavor it is actually really tasty with my water okay now you don't want to have eight of these okay it's just a little excessive in your vitamin C maybe you want to have like one of these every so often or one of these a day maybe but I don't like anything every day but again nothing with artificial flavors or colors or or especially artificial sweeteners okay here's another one that I'm actually okay with which is this one is the calm again stevia-sweetened you'll see it has zero color it is a white powder this I actually like having this at night sometimes as like my before bed water the magnesium in it helps you sleep it relaxes your muscles a lot of us are magnesium deficient so this kind of helps to make sure that we're getting our magnesium in and it really does help with your sleep in a more natural way okay and it's actually really delicious this is a lemon raspberry flavor and it is a naturally based one it's one the alive Gold Award and alive is I don't know where you guys are in it where I am alive is a kind of holistic magazine so it's one a holistic magazine award I'm gonna have one more sip sorry cuz you know I got to get my water in right right right see the wink wink dun dun dun so this is chlorophyll okay this is like kind of like plant blood now can we please close up on this glass I like watching it kind of dissipate in it's kind of pretty can we can we take K watch I'm not going to beg a cup of water I'm going to show you how pretty but this is just sweet be prepared are you ready for the prettiness hold on whoo okay so pretty as it slowly just kind of does its thing and it swirls and they're nice it's kind of like art okay and why do I love chlorophyll it's great for detoxification it's a cancer fighting it's great for our skin it does a multitude of things it tastes basically like water there might be like a tinge of like I think I taste something else but I'm not sure what it is you might be able to find a mint flavor I like the mint flavor better when I went to search for a new one they did not have the mint flavor anymore and this is something I take this to the gym with me I think it's actually really nice post-workout as well tada the lemon water this is my favorite and I do this I can't can't focus this is the one that I do probably more than anything I love lemon water which is why if you watch me anywhere on social media you will see me making my lemon water on a regular basis because it's such a sorry it's such a normal part of life everybody it's gonna be noises for a second sorry okay I insist on having a citrus juicer just because you get so much more like I remember the first time using my citrus juicer and I was just like I am getting way more lemon than ever before doing like that and just like squeezing and squeezing and squeezing so much I love I just love the flavor of lemon but it also again liver detoxify the liver lululu the liver dick toxifying I use this like probably every morning like I'll do something like my oil pulling and then afterwards I will do this often I'll bring it to the gym with me if I'm doing empty stomach cardio just so good for you to cleanse your limit or an 11 I can't speak any just love with lemon lemons so it cleanses your liver I usually don't do a full lemon in such a small glass although you can I'll usually do it like in a big like liter thing of water and I'll do a whole lemon and I'll just take that away with me can't help myself so after you finish drinking it you want to wait about 20 minutes before you brush your teeth so a lot of people do love and water in the morning make sure you don't do lemon water and then brush right after rinse out your mouth with just plain water afterwards and then brush your teeth otherwise if you brush your teeth right after it's actually not good for your enamel so you'll hear a dentist kind of say be careful the lemon water it's not necessarily lemon water specifically it's lemon water and then immediately brushing okay so be careful of that and then also like I'll brush my teeth first usually like my order might be something like if I'm doing oil pulling at the time I'll do an oil pull and then I'll brush right after and then kind of as I start my day I'll have lemon water and some people think lemon water tastes gross after brushing your teeth or any citrus oranges hitting that stuff if you're using a natural toothpaste it doesn't usually taste bad so just kind of like things to think about you know whatever at night you might get hungry okay and - you might not have drink enough water so sometimes what I will do is I will have some tea it's called forever nuts I do not kid you when you make it I'm doing I'm gonna do this like you can smell it to picture the scent of apple pie come closer come to the screen close your eyes and smell the apple pie that I'm like sending your way it's like waiting at you wafting is it wafting or waisting wafting wafting wafting towards you who knows these things though this is just such a good thing to do when you are just it's that nighttime and it will it will help fill you up and you got the scent and all that kind of good stuff and then just go to bed okay this is another one tea wise that I really like this is a matcha green tea don't have this at bedtime because it does give you some energy but this is a great one that you can do throughout the day to give you a light natural energy okay I hope you enjoyed if you did and you get to try any of it please comment below let me know what you thought if you have some recipes of your own share them below even if it's links to your own stuff that's fine share it let's start a conversation about getting healthy go drink and water all those kind of good stuff if you liked it comment subscribe we put out more videos every single week thank you so much for tuning in guys peace out and drinking water [Music] maybe not so good all together stop okay that's enough haha yes so drink your water guys buy these out and I'm going to show you an awesome recipe today it is for almond L almonds are actually really really healthy when you purse to the store generally they are pasteurized whereas here because it's raw we get to keep all of that good stuff first thing that you need to do you want to get a cup of almonds put them 
hey guys I'm lines with Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and today I want to talk to you about some natural healthy supplements for building those muscles those muscles there are a lot of supplements out there and especially if you are new to lifting you may not know kind of the direction to go someone might be saying hey you try this or try this I know when I started my career there were some things I was told to take that I did not I didn't take them but if I hadn't done a little research I could have been like fully on steroids and people were just like that was great and when I looked it up I'm like oh but that's stewart's you're like yeah everybody takes it and I mean like skinny girls like a lot of females are taking stuff that is not so natural so this would be kind of as far as I go when I'm in muscle building mode okay and I don't take any of you all the time just FYI but are you ready let's talk about some good and healthy muscle little stuff let's top protein this is probably the one that most people are taken out of everything here okay some protein companies out there might add things in that are not listed on the label they want to be cheap and they want it to taste really really yummy there could potentially be cake mix in your protein powder another thing that might happen is they could spike the protein powder with something like tribulus and the reason you'd be like well why would they want to add that in there and I mean when you think about it especially if it's like a first run of a protein if they add something in it that's going to give you way more muscle and stuff like that and you might tell all your friends oh my god I tried this protein and I immediately had all these like great gains or whatever and then you you know continue to buy it and then they take it out because they don't want to get caught because occasionally these things are actually tested but some of them do get caught doing it so just kind of do your research before you buy protein don't just go to the shelf and just grab whatever has a pretty package one thing I want you to think about is this is not a replacement for food to me protein powder is more of a backup okay so you kind of decide what you're going to eat in the day you're citing how much protein that you want to have for your goals and just like quick sidenote what I do with a lot of my clients is if they are like super in and it's going really ham in the gym I might have them do somewhere around like the 1 gram of protein per pound ok so if I'm 130 pounds then 130 grams protein right and if they're a little bit less active like they're just kind of like gym goers maybe 0.8 times their body weight and if they're a little bit more sedentary maybe 0.6 okay so you can kind of play with that I find females in general don't get enough protein in if you're really struggling and you can't get it in and food and you tried then this is an alternative now with way it is a good source but you also want to make sure if you're always doing it on a regular basis you might start to get sensitive to it you might start to get bloating or gas that usually means either try a better quality one this one is actually fermented which which will help with digestion but you can also try rotating two different types of protein so I've got like a bone broth protein here I've got a collagen one at home I've got the fermented way one we've got a vegan one with rice and pea so what I like to do is I try not to have like I don't aim to have it in my diet but when I do I'll start maybe with way when this bottle finishes I might switch over to a bone broth and when it finishes I might switch over to a vegan even though I'm not vegan just to keep everything you know not getting blody and stuff like that there's also meal replacements where there's lots of carbohydrates in it so just make sure that if you're trying to get a protein powder it is a protein powder it means it's generally pretty low carb pretty low sugar and relatively some are usually in the range of like 20 to 30 grams of protein per serving try not to have it more than once a day if you can you can do a lot of fun things with it you can make it into ice cream we've got a video look we'll try to list it below for you you can make it into lots of things you put in your shake you can add greens and stuff into it so protein is a fun option there you go let's move onto the next one we're going to talk about you say is branched mean we're going to talk about BCAAs which are branched chain amino acids the three amino acids are leucine isoleucine and valine now the most important one is leucine and that is because it actually can help with protein synthesis and protein synthesis is how we get bigger muscles blue but I probably have this more than any of these and I know most people probably have protein more than any but I think I'd be saying more than anything because I like to do a lot of vested Sprint's in the morning I like to do weights in the morning probably before I have any food and one of the things that BCAA does is it helps to be muscle sparing so when you're working out especially if you're someone that does do that fastest up in the morning so you're burning fat but you also might be burning some fuel if you're you know this one here is just the fermented white powder and it it smells see that doesn't it does not smell great it equally does not taste great but if you're going to take BCAAs this would probably be my top choice this one is more of a mix but it probably smells more yummy okay it smells kind of like strawberry ish this is a mix you need to be careful because a lot of them have like a lot of colors artificial colors artificial sweeteners aspartame so don't just take it because it's the only one you could find okay do you actually search out to find one that is like stevia-sweetened you don't want the most okay stevia is probably your best bet or go for the one that smells like yeah Mulla and then for my vegans out there I found no I don't know 100% because like I haven't had a chance I'm sorry to look up the the exact science on vegans on BCAAs versus EAS so for this one for vegans from I think it was the two or three girls in my class all that tried it they were just like wow I feel so great partly what that tells me is they're not getting enough protein okay so this is just helping them get more of those essential amino acids so for my vegans maybe you can try this one versus this one okay if you're not vegan I would just say do this one because you're going to get a lot of your essentials just from eating meat so you want to make sure when you do look that you do have more leucine than the other two than valine and isoleucine although you do want all three and just kind of a little side note on that if you're going to buy a protein powder and it says with branched chain amino acids or glutamine you get all excited and you're just like yay two-for-one no that's that's a way of spiking protein so do buy them separately yes BAM let's go to the next glutamine is what we're going to talk about next what I like about glutamine is that it kind of helps with that post-workout recovery and it's a non-essential amino acid you can find it at things like grass-fed beef and you can find it in fish and stuff like that but not necessarily the concentration that you'll want it in for that intense muscle recovery other reasons that I like to use glutamine also is it does help with you know your digestion and stuff like that it's kind of like that healer our muscles are made of a lot of glutamine and when we're working out we can kind of diminish some of that glutamine so taking it after the workout helps to replenish it and allows you to maintain and have those bigger muscles at the end of the day yes yes spirulina is next on my list that I'm going to show you it's very green it smells very green it tastes very green you've been forewarned oh yeah whoo that's that kind of like seaweedy kind of smell and taste can you see it can you see it so fear Alena is not directly a muscle building supplement it is not something you're going to take and be like roar but there's just me okay I'm not saying don't take a multivitamin ever saying I don't take a multivitamin instead of taking a multivitamin and I usually kind of go back and forth between something like sea vegetable either spirulina or chlorella or I'll do like bee pollen or royal jelly but just kind of as that like insurance policy on top of our healthy diet I would do something like this because if I'm lacking something like my magnesium or my vitamin C or my calcium my lifts aren't going to be as good or my magnesium so this is just kind of like that insurance policy to make sure everything is working nicely I'm actually going to read you some benefits because I'm not going to remember them all and reading is good so excuse me while I reach for my computer spirulina contains about 10 times the calcium of cow's milk several times more iron than red meat sea vegetables are easy digestible chlorophyll rich alkaline forming they're packed with minerals sea vegetables are the richest source of natural occurring electrolytes known by right right I just wanted to make sure that you got that little information so you understand why this is included in this odd combination but yes okay so I will put a link below in the description box where you can look a little bit more into spirulina and just kind of see vegetables in general okay and the reason I chose spirulina out of the sea vegetables is this one's a little higher in protein than chlorella and some of the others but I would rotate it anyways I want to talk about it just want some faith so I want to talk about creatine this is it here okay it is in non-essential or it's three non-essential amino acids of methionine arginine and pullback yes three non-essential amino acids which means that our body can make it on our own you can get creatine basically from like grass-fed beef from fish it's not a substance that's going to make it like you take it and you instantly like get muscles I think people think it's that it's not a steroid okay and I think even stirred you probably still have to work out I don't know that much about it but with creatine the way it works is it actually just kind of it gives your muscle energy like a little bit more than you might have had so for instance let's say I'm at the gym and I'm doing squats okay and usually I would fail at eight reps okay if I'm taking creatine maybe I can get to 12 to 14 reps instead which means I can move up and weight a little bit earlier because it just kind of gives me a little bit more like that HTV it just kind of lets it last a little bit longer other things that can assist in as well is for my ladies and for my guys too we like to do Sprint's cuz Sprint's make the booty look good and the ligands good for fat burning everything it can actually help you with power so it can help you with your Sprint's it can help you with your jumps it's why a lot of athletes will take it as well some things to think about with creatine and you guys can do your own research out there because there's a lot of studies and the studies contradict just a little bit just just a little bit so depending on what study reads some will say to load first some will say you do not need to load and it's just trying to make you buy more there's also studies out there that will say you should stop at three and you know give your body a rest because it could be damaging to your kidneys if you take it for too long and some other people that will say no it's fine to take long term I'm just going to stick with how I took it and how I took it was I did do a little bit of a load to get it into your system because one thing with creatine is it doesn't like you take it that day and have an amazing workout you need to get it into your system a little bit and whether you choose to load or you choose to just kind of take it over time and then it does start to work eventually it needs to be a little bit consistent it's not one of those sub ones you can say I'm going to take it today and then maybe I'll take it next week and then expect it to work no you got to do a little bit of sequence most people can do well on like 3 to 5 grams a day when you're taking it it just kind of depends on your body weight as to how much you're having generally so you can kind of look a little bit more if you decide to take it I would still personally recommend not to take it more than three months at a time and do a little bit of a cycle with it just in case there's a ton of types out there if you choose to go a different way that is okay too but that would be at the end of the day this is kind of like a little kit okay my great for my skinny girls trying to put on mass and also for my thick girls you know you've heard about what the different ones do you can decide which ones are best for you I hope this helped if you guys have tried in them and you want to share your experience please do so below in the comments if you have questions you can also post them down there I like to be interactive and chitchat with you and see the conversations going on please subscribe to the channel and like the video we put metal videos every single week on nutrition fitness help stuff everything thank you so much guys and peace out bye I can feel my tummy feels flatter my digestion feels better and these are all things that this does so are you ready I'm gonna show you my fire shot you see have two machines here this is just like a citrus juicer and a little like a mini blender if you don't have either 
hey everybody I'm Elizabeth Lopez I'm here ready to shoot I'm gonna be representing Venezuela and the calendar and we're just getting ready to go into hair and makeup this is me getting ready for the shoot I'm try makeup free ready to get everything done it's important to me to get really good photos and kind of try to find the best to shoot with the best because I don't have a lot of time to do well the in-between stuff so when I saw her photos I contacted her and I you know asked to shoot she's just too busy right now so sorry I spotted the this search so I thought it'd be a perfect opportunity to to get in and carry on so it all worked out I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome that's it look around fed everybody it's like a lens cap you want to know what's really really funny and I'm gonna say this down I hear it from every girl when they say they hear they're like oh can I trust you do they really trap it's your jungle accessories like every good jungle girl should have yeah did the set design put it together did all the shopping around with Ricci getting all the materials put all together make sure you got the look and making their vision come to life I used to compete a lot in Fitness competitions so always liked to stay busy really enjoy the modeling thing that I really enjoyed it in the pictures and kind of looking through and seeing what different photographers can do to and bring out different aspects to be a personality I lost him to photos so it's just to kind of a fun to keepsake for the future that was a very difficult shoot to do now I was the model naked but we have to work around first of all nothing could cover her breasts so we had to keep using ours proposing I'd say at the same time but the snake wasn't doing what it's supposed to do never working with that snake again she was a diva and a half but it went went to sleep interesting or theme it's interesting working with a moving 
hey guys I'm Liza both Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer today I'm going to show you how to use this machine I know machines can sometimes be daunting so let's walk through it together I like to call us the kickback machine because it's the same motion when we do kickbacks with ankle weights or just on kind of quadrupeds hands and knees position one thing about this machine first when you're looking at it this focuses on the Shelf you know where you put the drink okay this is going to help pop that up what you want to do keep your core nice and strong you're going to bend for it you're going to hold on there's little handle area so I'm going to hold on and it's just one leg okay so I'm going to start with my right leg now what you want to do is going to bring the leg up and flex and control it down drive it up and flex and control it down so I wanted to gain size I might really pump it up and maybe even try to do full stack and you like four to six maybe four to eight repetitions and if I was just trying to do more toning or just really working on high rep stuff I might go more eight to fifteen reps I'm trying to add more mass I would probably go really heavy and just take complete rest in between so I hope that helps take some mystery out of the glute kickback machine I'm here to show you the hamstring machine and hopefully take some mystery out of it for those of you that are not sure exactly what to do so to start off the first thing that we want to look at is actually the height of the leg area okay so right here now mine only has one adjuster which is how far this is going to come in or out and a lot of the machines will also have a second adjuster here mine doesn't but it would say small medium large and what it does is it'll take your start point from low a little bit higher or a little bit higher and that just kind of depends on your comfort of where you would like it in your flexibility when I set this one if it was here I would probably go to about a medium because I feel like if it's too low what a small it over stretches the back of my knee and it doesn't feel comfortable so when you go in what you want to do is you want to come about here and there's a bend in the machine and that's where you want kind of the bend of your hips to go there's handles here you can either hold here and stay flat or you can hold here and pull your core in it's just them it just changes the movement a little bit as I go heavier I like to do here and when our lighter I like to go here so I've set it to 50 just that's just a teaching weight for me I'm going to take a deep breath in before I start another exhale I'm going to slowly control and come up focusing on my hamstring which is the back of my thigh you want to do a slight pause here and then you want to control that eccentric down but not let your weights click okay so you want to have it just about there there's still slight bend in my name and inhale and exhale up Shh flex and control it down now for some of you you might want to change this up I'm going to show you one other thing that's really fun to do on this machine and I'm gonna take it to a slightly lighter weight so let's take it to like thirty pounds and I'm going to do single leg now if you're not strong enough to just do a single leg like so what you can do is you can come up with two legs and then release one leg and control it down with just one leg this is a great way to work on strength building and actually adding size to your hamstrings that was how you use the hamstring curl machine so again that works the back of the thigh I'm going to show you this lovely machine the abductor machine which is every girl's best friend if you're not using it I'm going to show you how and then you will start using it because it's awesome and you know why because it builds out some of the sides of your bumbum no you cannot make your hips wider through training but you can add a little bit of mass adductors which is when we do this like we're the opposite of this when we have the machine here and we're trying to pull in think add add together for abductor and abductor you're trying to abduct take away and that's this machine so now you remember forever for the rest of your life the first time I'm going to show you how to use it would be a little bit of a slouch okay so I'm gonna slouch into my chair a little bit keep my core strong and open so now I'm hitting one angle of my glutes always control it in okay and then push out again exhale flex feel the Flex control it back in the next we're going to do is actually sitting upright and this is a gun gonna change the angle of how we do it but the rest of its gonna be the same so inhale exhale flex control it back in and inhale Shh flex inhale it back in third way ready don't be shy do this at the gym no matter how you think you look just do it anyways chest is up holding on right up here and we're going to drive open we're going to flex our glutes and control it back in drive it open and flex and control it back in one more you're going to stand up like this you're going to hold right here you're going to first put your feet in a position where this is the most important thing your toes are always neutral with the direction of your knee so what I want to do is drive it open Shh and bring it in drive it open and bringing it keeping my spine in neutral my core is strong I'm flexing at the outside right in here the sides of the bum okay and bringing it back in so that was this machine right here one machine for exercises awesome awesome all of them hitting those abductor muscles that outer side of the bum bum remember we want to work on progressive overload we want to slowly get heavier because we want to build that area not too interested in just toning it let's put some more muscle mass there this is the adductor machine meaning it works your adductors or your inner thighs this is how I like to get in so I'm literally gonna kind of like straddle over the machine put one foot into the first fit hold my bum is all the way against the back put the other foot in and then I'm going to slide down as I sit down and now I can go about doing the exercise so I'm gonna inhale at the beginning I'm gonna exhale shhh drive it closed and really squeeze like really think about those inner thighs and flex I'm going to control it open until I feel a nice stretch inhale exhale so some of you use this machine because you think I want to have smaller inner thighs guess what if you go heavy on this machine you're going to build your inner thighs and you know what you might get bigger inner thighs that rub in your jeans so make sure when you're choosing your weight you choosing something that you would do maybe like 15 to even up to 30 reps if you want to just have tight inner thighs and not bigger inner thighs if you want to have bigger inner thighs which some of you might that's when you can go really heavy and work on the progressive overload of slowly getting heavier this is going to either tone or add size so that's how you're going to choose your weight and that's how you use the machine I hope that was helpful if you want to kind of debunk some other machines in the gym please post in the comment below which ones you want to know about I will help you out and show you the ins and outs and all that kind of good stuff and also please like the video you can use the social shares below to share this with your friends and also subscribe to the channel I put out videos every Tuesday and Friday on nutrition fitness recipes all that kind of good stuff I look forward to seeing you the next video thank you guys peace out you can choose the color of the powder that you want and the title is cake and it smells like cake so literally once you powder this all over your head you smell like a bakery and then this one as far as a spray this is a new one for me

welcome back to the show everybody here to show us how to put together a really inexpensive home gym as fitness expert Elizabeth Lopez equipment no and you know what I chose things that are very multi-purpose I'm not a fan of things that just do one thing necessarily right so all of these we can do a lot of things it's it's small so you don't need those big huge massive home gym things you should just keep it under control you want to have one of everything no it's real dirty the foam roller only because I actually like to start my workout with the foam rollers okay to do with these things and why we have them well as I have one but I don't know what to do with this yeah now what if you picture like a shirt when you iron out the shirt you're ironing out the wrinkles it's like we're earning out our muscles okay you know like there's not some stuff like that were just ironing them out get in and prep for the workout adding oxygen and it's gonna help us with recovery not so mine's basically like a meat tenderizer with your so called the rumble roller and because you phone rolled before I felt that you might be bomb right away I don't think I'm gonna ever let the IT band because this huge area deity Ben is right here kind of a split between the quad and the hamstring okay so let's go just above the knee foot in front yeah be careful that's one it's intense Darrell over there it's like these two I'm a professional date roll up and down okay Artie okay okay so right - how do you feel this is impressive I can't when you try it with the first time I tried it I just got stuck like this yeah well that's your nuts I like it looks awkward roll into the hamstring okay she's good for the areas that you're going to work right if you see buddies there's full workouts on the foam roller perfect so come and descend this costs like what how much 20 to 40 depending on what you guys we've got your basic yoga mat they're all floor work right all cleric is done on the mat so we're lying down we're doing abs or whatever just rather than being on the map on the floor yeah it's just protection okay if you got Mike with the spine I have a Lourdes spine which means that I dip in the back here you do one of those straight down some people have the karposev switches where it pushes out here so if you light on the floor and it doesn't feel good yeah you may want to do a thicker mat like what I have this is actually if you feel its memory foam these are fantastic versus those ones if your back is is quite strong and it doesn't have any of those funny curves then you're fine with my mother used to skip five thousand times everyday watching the young and restless all her life yeah she is so fit she's still this but I came downstairs during her lunch time and she'd be doing five thousand escapes every day okay so the jump rope let's start jumping I watched her for that hour this is basic bounce when your feet are just kind of side to side and what's great about the jump rope is you're burning a lot of calories right which means you're like two toxifying so jumping motions like a trampoline or a jump rope it also gets everything moving so second internal massage shouldn't internal massage burning it's fun she could do that at a hotel room this one's here these are great so we've got our band the bands we can work pretty much any muscle with this like we can do compound movements if we stand on it there are different intensities so I think you got the light one watts and shoulder press boy it's my stomach so just tell me but then we can hold the top and we can go into tricep presses right go right into side laterals Wow can you go online to find different exercises because you could do a thousand YouTube you can go online but it's just that it you know you can fold it up you can throw it in your bag it's basically like a whole stack of weights about ten to twenty dollars twenty dollars gonna cost you let's keep yeah you can get different intensities maybe you wanted to different intensity okay and then the ball with your ball I just like sitting a bouncing on that's all I like that's good for your lymphatic system doing something but we can if you want to roll out we can have it it can be like a bench we can bench press coffee table it's we can do our abdominal honey how much is this time gonna cost all together how much you together I would say probably about maybe about a hundred bucks for the whole like this is like it's like a bench yeah we can lie down we can do abdominal stuff with it so we can grab it you know pull it up 
we'll talk about creatine now creatine is something that some of the girls and guys out there they want to get a little bit more above and a little bit more muscle more quickly or add some more power to their performance this is kind of some things that creatine is no for now it's not one of those magical things it's not like a steroid or something where it's just kind of you know changing your hormones this is something it's different so what it does you have to work so you take this stuff to work so what happens is in our muscle we have something called ATP okay now the ATP is kind of like the energy that's in our muscles so when you're working out you're doing your set and your your gut energy and all the sudden that energy starts to go away it's the end of the the ATP is started to play ok so you've lost some of the phosphates that are and in the lactic acid starts to come in and we use aggressed now if you take something like printing you're taking in your creatine and it adds the cream is kind of what got away from the ATP when when it got tired so you're adding on phosphates so that what happens is your ATP is now going to last longer right so if you were able to get out 10 reps doing those bicep curls and now you've added creatine you might be able to get through maybe 17 reps ok and when we're doing the 17 reps are go a little bit heavier or something like that then you're able to get a little bit stronger because you're able to put in the extra work so you still have to work but it's giving you that little bit of advantage it's a natural advantage creatine is found in in meat in and lots of different things very very naturally we're just taking a higher dosage of it so now the one that I'm recommending is the ATP or something to be the one that I'm recommending is the the creatine ethyl ester now the creatine ethyl ester what's different about it the the monohydrate was very popular in the past and the ethyl ester I think is kind of like the new kid on the block and what it is is it has this the C part of it and it makes it better able to get into the muscle it's able better able to absorb so you can take less of it and then additionally because more of its getting in and you're taking less of it there's less kind of water retention of stuff that can't get in and it's all sitting outside the cells so it's now in the cells it's doing what it used to do we're taking less of it so it's just kind of a better all-around product as far as I can see right now anyways so it looks like a pretty good one and it's also it's going to help with if you're an athlete new to trying to get your jumps and that to everything else can help the power it's a great product you do need to cycle it make sure it's not something you would ever take on an ongoing basis talk to your doctor first but it is product they do have quite a few my fitness models taking and I do recommend it as part of a natural healthy way to get lean 
hey guys I'm Lizbeth Lopez registered holistic nutritionist and master trainer and this is Ken our Ken art is an hourglass girl as you can see she's looking out yeah look at all hot um Canaries gonna help us today we're going to show you proper form for ab training okay so what does that mean to get abs to get that whole six-pack thing going on here um it's not just your eating okay your eating is very important but it also is your training now from training so many women here at hourglass workout I would go as far as to say about 80% of women are not training their abs correctly but they think they are okay so even if you think you're training the right this could be you so I'm going to show you 2 flex I'm going to show you how to breathe and I'm going to show you how to do 3 of my favorite exercises correctly ok are you ready here we go we're gonna start off with an canard that she's all she I just pulled her I'm just like hey let's doing a video so she's just like surprised yes but canard is great so we're gonna do breathing to start off with this is Pilates breathing it is my favorite thing to do and you do it while you're doing abs so you can sit up or stand up and do this with us right now are you ready I'm ready okay so here we go what I want you to do is wrap your fingers on top of your ribs and wrap your thumbs around now take a deep breath in now when you breathe in I want you to widen this way and exhale pull your ribs together Shh pull them tight okay do you feel that definition kind of right in there yeah okay now we're gonna take our hands to here so right in line with the belly button same thing when we breathe in we're gonna widen this way okay so inhale right in this way and exhale pull together Shh good now hold that feel that muscle okay now next one we're going to do so we've got here we got the ribs we've got the middle of the waist now I want you to put your hands right here okay and we're going to work on the Kegel area now the kegels are if you were to pee okay you would pull the kegels up to stop the flow of urine or pee okay so we're going to and we're also going to flatten this area so take a deep breath in widen and exhale flatten this pull this and with your muscles and pull the kegels up okay so this whole lower area is engaged flattened hold up okay now we're gonna do it all together ready relax inhale widen exhale pull the ribs together Shh now hold this we call this zipped up okay you're still holding whereas we're talking we go breathing make sure you're pretty big okay what I do and when I first learned this when I studied Pilates many years ago is I would hold my zip up and I would walk one block holding the zip up and then I would release because that's a lot right you can release and release okay but and then I would walk a block without it and then I would do it again inhale why didn't Excel shhh and I would hold that for another block and slowly but surely no word of a lie my waist cinched like here became tighter here my ribs used to actually stick out and they became flatter okay and everything got a little bit smaller and people want to have like all the booty that Kenard has cuz she does she's got it she's got a nice fun but it's also the illusion of that cinch smaller waist from breathing that can do that and instead of getting a waist trainer okay this is this is way more effective because one you're actually creating your core okay so we have an internal corset okay our muscles and if we train them to be strong and breed that way it's so much better than a course in so many ways one of course it a lot of people say that it actually helps your low back it does not it replaces the muscles in your low back so as you're walking around and you think oh I feel so supported with this corset on and it's cinching my waist what it's doing is it's taking the place of your muscles working and you muscles get weaker so there's so many reasons that we do this but we are going to do it in all of the ab exercises that we're about to do are you ready I'm ready lie down on the BOSU so what c√°maras going to do is she's going to take her bum just cut it to the bottom the BOSU right there and she's gonna lie back and her goal is for her to have kind of the middle of her back on the curved part of the ball so that if she sits up a little bit so she does a little curl up she should just feel her abs turn on and not her lower back okay so we're trying to avoid hurting the lower back and a lot of people right away what they're going to try to do is do a full sit-up here okay and that may not feel good on their back so all you need to do very small movement is just curl the show sweetie boob grab her shoulders up and stay there sorry the other thing we want to do is she's just gonna curl the bum up as well yes what kind of like exactly so see how she just kind of flexed her bum cheeks and curl the shoulders up and now do the breathing Shh yes and the ribs come together the bellybutton comes down this pulls in and the kegels pull up and now we're fully imprinted and really flex it flex a flexible exit that's where it is see now I feel all of the muscles going off this is perfect now let's go into the move but that all of there without that you might as well not do it okay it's that serious saying how do you feel Connor good you feel the ABS yeah I'm not the low back okay perfect we're gonna bring both hands overhead good and bring them even further back there you go okay now we're going to do opposite hand to opposite leg so let's go this arm and this like so straighten out this leg totally totally straight now just hold here and we're going to put this hand flat on the floor okay so what you want to do is you actually want to push into the floor with this hand and push in the floor with this foot now what we're going to do is we're going to inhale first widen those ribs I'm going to exhale ribs together and as we do that we curl up okay now the motion is that neck is neutral to spine good the shoulders curled up we are cinching shh shh sure and really hold that like really and I'm going with her hold it extra long we want to curl that bum off of the BOSU so you have kind of this C shape okay this C shape from the shoulder to the bum we're really getting that flex good and then we're gonna come down to a hover the whole time she's pushing into this foot and pushing into this hand one more time inhale exhale curl it up ribs together belly button down flatten out curl that shoulder up head and neutral really squeeze it and lower it down again right you feel your abs did you hear that yes go bed now I'm going to show you how people do this wrong the one thing people mainly will do when they do this wrong is they'll try to sit all the way up okay and that's not a nice angle for your baguette necessarily it hurts your back okay and you're not working your abs guess what you're working your hip flexors here not as sexy as here okay so come back down again remembering guys small is fine it's a small curl of driving curling the shoulder up driving your back and imprinting it in and then doing that proper breathing Shh good and then the inhale as you come back down inhale and widen and exhale and come up Shh there it is everything flattens everything pulls you hold that flex and you come back down and you stretch okay first one done awesome so I would usually do ten on one side ten on the other side and I would probably do maybe three sets that that's super setting with other exercises so much fun oh yeah cuz you did it good so we're going to show the ab roller now I'm going to start off and I'm going to show you some of the ways that it's used incorrectly okay because I think that's just as important as seeing what is correct so the worst offender is this one here mainly because they've completely taken the abdominals out of the exercise and instead made it more of a stretch for their arms okay so not doing anything so we're gonna have Conor show us how to do this properly are you ready Kenard Hey okay before you start you want to pull your abs in so it's that same breathing effect where she pulls the ribs in really tight pulls the waistline in really tight and she's gonna know that even though she may want to go right belly button to the floor she's gonna stop when she start if you start to feel your low back you stop you either pull and harder or you just roll back out okay so let's start to roll out we want to keep neutral spine with a slide that have flex to that core now I can tell she's feeling it so now she's gonna pull her ribs in and she's gonna crunch slightly as she comes up that was perfect okay small movement but effective we're going to start to roll we're going to start to reach reach reach bum is coming forward once she feels it see the shaking the aunt Elvan pull the ribs in and wrench crunch crunch crunch right now one should see right here here's another issue people have people relax here see I can punch her and not hurt her that means she's engaged in the core I love doing this to people if she was not engaged I might have knocked the window didn't punch that hard but you know she wouldn't be able to handle that and want to stay engaged and actually crunch even deeper at the top so as she comes in she contracts like she's doing an ab crunch scape the tension and she's going to reach for it and do it again where's the inhale here's the inhale inhale and then exhale Shh pull it pull and pull in and pull it in crunch crunch crunch crunch like you're doing a full AB girl and inhale forward far as you can without up too upsetting in lower back let's go one inch further now crunch crunch crunch crunch crunch watch see that see I didn't even warn her but I'm doing some pretty good punches right now she is engaged that was great thank Skinner Thank You Deb feel good yeah I'm gonna feel better yeah okay amazing one more exercise this is the Russian twist now they're wrong I wanted to show this I wouldn't say it's my favorite favorite of all exercise I do really like though and I do do it often and you guys know in class my favorite one it's your face it's her favorite one one of the reasons I want to show it is because it's probably not the number one one for being done wrong but a lot of you do it wrong and I'm going to show you what to me wrong is okay so wrong is where a lot of a lot of my girls and a lot of guys I see at the gym will grab the heaviest weight they can find I have a little eight pounder which I don't even mind if people do zero weight okay but people will go and grab like a 20-pound kettlebell and they'll be dropping it and dropping and dropping it and it's just not the goal of the exercise the goal of the exercise is to again Shh I do this before every exercise I give myself a little punch so I know I'm engaged and it's to contract and feel the contraction so I want to feel it and then I'm gonna twist Shh and I'm gonna breathe and cinch Shh breathe and cinch breathe and cinch verses this whole throwing of weight which is just it's kind of retching your back like it's just this there's so many things that it is doing that is not making your abs better okay so can our strong so we'll go with an eight if you were new I'd have you to zero this one you're perfect okay so what we want to do is we're going to have a slight sit back okay and you just want to sit back far enough that you start to feel the engagement of the core okay that and then of course you're going to still give yourself a little yeah just make sure that we're engaged those abs are turned on okay now keep them there but breathe okay pull them in now I want you to think as you're coming to the side let's go that way as you're coming to the side think right there can you guys see this right here this at little area contract that pull it in and make your waist as small as possible as yeah but feel do you feel it are you crunching at dipper now maintain Shh feel every part of your muscle as you twist she's now gonna crunch in this part so the same thing right there and then she's gonna bring across but even that bring across Shh she's thinking all the way across her core and there's that exhale and then Shh exhale take the breathe in right before you head across and exhale all the way there deepening and you can even do a little bit of a a slight curl forward into crunch into it a little bit deeper but what we're getting to at the end of the day keep going who's to do a few more just for fun and you can still speed up while crunching let me see that exhale and let me see that crunch crunch good and breathe exhale Shh good now she can get faster with this as long as she maintains the tension so she can change and that loud breathing I'm doing is very much based from Pilates okay if you hear go into a flattest class you'll hear a sounding like we're doing Lamaze okay I know but it is that proper breathing and it really does you're like an snob and it really does cinch I hope you guys enjoyed that workout thank you so much can are you're amazing so the three are sizes again we showed was the BOSU I call them single leg be ups and they are amazing for all the way from your upper abs your lower abs your obliques everything they're probably my favorite exercise the ab roller which hits all the way again upper through lower which is great it's also stabilizing for your low back and then the Russian twist is very good for your obliques so I hope you enjoyed that I hope that you understand now that whether you're at home or you're the gym of you have equipment or no equipment the main thing is that you are contracting and you're breathing properly I hope you go and have
