[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's welcome back to my channel today we are doing this look right here this is very much inspired by the PSL that just came out but my first PSL is not with Starbucks because you don't have to have Starbucks to have a PSL I actually love Pete's coffee so this is not a sponsored video today is my first day with a pumpkin spice latte so that means it is officially fall I don't know when fall actually starts but today it's my fault I just got my huda beauty palette in it is so beautiful look at this packaging is always amazing with huda beauty this is my first actual human BD palette she has a lot of warm colors in here that I absolutely love unfortunately my Cosmo came in a little broken but that's okay I still have some glitter around the edges and I'll make it work a lot of these colors are very warm red so I'm like okay I just got my first pumpkin spice latte for this season there's a lot of pumpkin warmth going on right here this looks like a the first leaf that dropped off of the tree and fell on the ground it's right on my eye right now with the pop of blue that's what's going on in my eye right now we are doing the first fall makeup look I'm gonna have a ton more fall makeup looks because I love fall makeup I think it's so gorgeous and it really accentuates the eyes I think it looks beautiful on a lot of skin tones have a pop of blue on the lash line to mix it up a little bit I think drool colors look really beautiful in the fall as well so I have a little bit of that so if you want to see how I achieved this look right here this pumpkin spice latte on my eyes / xxx hot cheeto then just keep watching don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bow so you could be a part of the quad family and without further ado we are gonna get on into this for yourself of the season this moment is very special right now I'm gonna start off with my brows already moisturize my face and I'm gonna get straight into the eye makeup first because I like the way my makeup is been coming out when I just do my eyes without doing foundation or anything so I am gonna start off with the eyes brows I'm going to be using the goof proof brow pencil in the shade number four kind of in my jam lately I've been using this for my brows in my videos lately because it just it's so fast and easy if I sound a little weird muff ly it's because I'm a little sick a little on the sticky side today hoping I'll get better and a few days already been kind of sick for about almost a week so I'm hoping it'll get better soon okay I'm gonna put this underneath my eyes before I start on my eye makeup this is the benefit puff off it's a instant eye gel that I can't seem to so it looks like this it's called the puff off just gonna use it underneath my eyes because my under eyes I haven't been getting that much sleep because I've been coughing all night coughing my brains out and my under eyes are looking a little tired with the tart shape taped in medium to set the eyes this tiny little Beauty Blender right here and I'm gonna work that in all over my eyelid I'm gonna cover my entire eyelid with a desert sand which is this shade right here I just got my nails done I'm very excited about these nails I told him I told my nail person just give me something mocha pumpkin spice fall latte inspired something like that and this is what he came up with and I really like I'm gonna take that all over the lids and mister at the base of the lid and work my way up so this palette is pretty warm gives me fall vibes the only thing that made me sad when this palette came in is the Cosmo shade which is the only glitter press came in completely broken apart so I looked at everyone else's that got theirs theirs came intact so I think it just me might be something wrong with the way mine came in I don't think everybody else's was like that but from what I see everybody else's Cosmo was pretty nice and pretty the first shadow that I'm gonna go in with is ash is eaten just to give us warm us up a little bit in the crease so I'm going to take this with my luck see 229 brush and just start to work that right in that hollow area I just want like a pumpkin spice first leaf falling off of the tree kind of rustic I look today so that is what I'm going for the next color I'm gonna go in with is blazing right here so I'm just gonna pop that on to the lid I'm gonna lay that down all over the lid and work that into the crease [Music] and when I start to blend this out I want to work it in an angle and this is because I want to give my eye more of a lifted appearance so especially since my eyes are kind of I feel like my eyes are kind of droopy and like sickly looking so I just want to lift them up next color I'm gonna go into is amber work that into the outer part of the crease like the outer V area for the next color I'm going to take saffron I think that's the way you say it I'm gonna take that color right there and I'm gonna pop that on to the outer V as well but I'm still gonna keep it to where you can see the amber the shade amber smaller brush so we can get a little bit more detailed with this so I'm this is the M 506 for more feet I'm going to take that one and start to focus this a little bit closer to the hollow I'm actually gonna mix that shade with this shade as well I don't know the name of it so I'm just gonna mix it with this brown shade just to make it a little bit more intense and deep this ilyich almost reminds me of just like a little fireball or that a little lit fireball and instant stories for the next shade I'm gonna pop it on right in the inner part of the eye I'm either gonna take Turkish delight our Blood Moon I'm just gonna swatch them on my fingers first to see which one I this is how I decide which one I think we're gonna go with this eyeshadow look so far is reminding me of an extreme hot cheeto for all you hot cheeto lovers out there this one's for you I think I'm gonna go with this guy right here put that on to the inner corner of the eye and take it into the inner third I'm gonna leave that center part matte because usually we pop on that Center highlight but this time I'm gonna change it up leave it matte I'm just gonna take a little bit of this medium concealer and this concealer brush right here from the makeup shock 286 and I'm gonna clean up the brow bones now that the brows are cleaned up I'm gonna go in with desert sand and I'm just gonna set the concealer in place and bring that down into the shadow now I'm gonna go in with eyeliner so for the eyeliner I'm going to use as I've been loving this eyeliner so much the hardest liner from Tarte it's the double take liner I'm using this side because it is extremely black and I'm going to I'm gonna put on some mascara the mascara I'm using is from roller LA or just from benefit the roller lash mascara so I'm just gonna coat my lashes with a few coats of this mascara okay so our lashes are on and I'm gonna start working on fixing this face right here and oh I just got this new primer from Smashbox I just came back from Fiji and they showed us this rhymer that works amazing on the skin it's super hydrating it's a primer and a moisturizer all in one in anything that has to do with moisturizing your face you know I'm all about it I need to try it and I need to put it on my face immediately so I tried this out I really liked it and I just like the way my makeup lies on my skin when I put this on it just goes on so smooth the feeling of it as soon as you put it on it's just like your skin is drinking water and it just glides on the skin so easy and it literally feels you can feel your skin soaking up the moisture instantly so now that we have our primer on our face is ready for foundation the foundation I'm using today is from L'Oreal this is the infallible Pro matte and I am in the state in the shade Sun beige start to cover all this redness discoloration mosquito bites hackneyed okay now I'm gonna cover my under eyes and to do that I'm gonna go with medium today something a little bit more on the natural side of things I'm gonna go ahead and highlight with that too so we're not gonna have like an intense bright highlight so now that we're concealed our face is looking good so far we need to bring back out those the contours of our face so to do that I'm gonna be using this shaping foundation from Smashbox and I'm not using the foundation part but I am using the shaping part of the stick I love this shade for contouring and I love this shape of this stick right here if they could just you make this by itself I wouldn't I would use this all the time this is in the shade soft contour 2.2 so I'm gonna go right underneath the hollow of the cheek bone and bring it down right about there see it has that ashy undertone is I usually gravitate towards more of the a sheer tones for the contours I want it to look like a shadow go ahead and blend that in blending it upwards and then I'm gonna go on with this smaller end make sure it's nice and wet not too wet so if it is too wet then you definitely want to go and dry it or at least get a napkin or towel and just kind of press it and then start to work in your products so I'm just making these really short and balancing motions so it blends into the skin like it's actually a natural shadow and on the other side and voila contour I'm going to take this little angled brush right here I think they want this to be a brow brush but look how thick that is it's not gonna work for me so I'm gonna use it on my lower lash line and check amber and I'm gonna work that right on the lash line so on the waterline I'm gonna go in with this a blue pencil right here from Marc Jacobs it's in the shade wavelength I'm gonna add a little bit of the brown on the outer part of the lash line just to give it a little bit more warmth okay so I'm gonna set my under eyes with the Too Faced I want candy banana pudding powders so cute it's the brightening face powder so I'm gonna try this guy out for my under eyes and basically where I would want to brighten any anything up if I could smell which I can I can smell the banana so I'm gonna use this guy right here load up my brush I love the whole candy collection it smells like candy and pudding and just amazing sweet happy things just like candy she's just a big happy ball of sweetness so I'm gonna go ahead and use that underneath is that I I love yellow powders on my face it just makes me so so happy this also has a little bit of purple and pink for a color correcting brightening color so I think this is gonna work great as a brightener without it being really intense and bright it's still giving you that that fresh awake kind of look I'm gonna go in with this highlight from Becca this is the shimmering skin Perfector in opal and I'm just gonna pop that onto the cheekbones half red from Mac it's a lip liner [Music] and then immunity max hickory north on the outer edges and I feel like this kind of ties in that red fiery warmth that our eyes are giving us without overwhelming the lip and then right on top I'm gonna do a nudie you would this nude just because it is super new Andy collaboration a liquid melted matte liquid lipstick in the shade I scream okay so now I'm taking all the lip liners that I have to create my own custom lip look right now so I'm taking root in color pop it's the lippie pencil and I'm also taking it on the outer corners of the lip um the only thing I forgot oh my gosh I was about to go on with my life without using a blush or bronzer the Kylie blush in x-rated just because we have a very peachy eye so I'm gonna go with the peachy blush I'm gonna take this guy right here it's very matte just the way I like my blushes I'm gonna take the peach blush and just press it onto the lips I just feel like it's gonna mesh the entire look together and it's gonna keep everything in place I feel like I'm a very powdery right now so I'm just gonna spritz some of this Elsi Hydra mist almighty so Wow [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did give me a big thumbs up and also if you don't want to leave yet and you want more videos from me or you just want to check out some other things I have them over to the side and before you go I want to let you know that I love you and you are amazing you're beautiful you're shining go and get yourself a pumpkin spice latte and say Cristen Dominique sent you okay guys so much and I will see you in the next video bye Dolly's 
[Music] [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be doing this look right here do you see this drama happening this is so much drama for me this week I actually just last-minute put my hair up like this and it's not fancy I literally was just playing around I was like posing and like you it just cute and this is what it looks like fancy huh I like it I really love this look I feel like it's something I've never done everything that's on my face right now is drugstore something you can buy super affordable in stuff that I actually really really like some things I'm trying for the first time and you'll be able to see how I feel about those later in this video and then some things I found that we're just like did this entire look using one palette this palette right here this is the maybelline city mini palette collaboration with Shayla Mitchell aka makeup Shayla on Instagram and YouTube this is such a beautiful palette I was very usually these paths the city mini pallets are all shimmer this one has a nice combination of a little bit of everything this can go from day to night after hours you can go through every type of look through your day with just this little tiny palette which i think is amazing so congratulations to you Shayla I think this is a beautiful palette this is the look I created I love it I just want to go watch Netflix now because that's my life I'm gonna show you how I got this I look right here if you want to learn how to get it don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video the first thing I'm going to start with is foundation and that's because I have all this going on right here I just got extractions this morning on my face from Yoli glow she does these extractions and then two days later they look they're completely gone and it looks amazing so I want to cover this up so I want you guys to like run away from my channel right now if this is the shade natural beige I like the shades are on top of the tops so I'm just gonna put that on real quick I'm gonna use elf brush to apply it to my face now I'm just going to do a very light coverage I just don't want you guys to keep looking at these crazy blemishes and I like that this has like an acne treatment in it so it's not going to clog my pores or anything especially since I just got a facial this morning I'm gonna put on a light layer and then I'm gonna start working on my own these brows because look at these brows for the brows i'm gonna use this hairy eyebrow pencil this is the Loreal brow stylist definer in the shade brunette so I'm just gonna fill in my brows ever so naturally and then usually if I fill them in and they're pretty like natural-looking I'll go in heavier towards the end depending on how intense my eye look is so I'm just gonna go for kind of a natural brow right now try not to look too close because sometimes when I look too close this is just my personal experience with myself when you're doing your brows super close up sometimes they come out a little bit more extreme and harsh and sometimes even bigger than what you would normally do them if you had a further away mirror and then when you've been back the Barrow away it's like oh my god look at a mirror from a distance so you're not getting like a crazy amount of brow in places you don't need it okay so my brows are filled in the first thing that I'm going to do is work on my eyes before concealer I'm going to be using this Rimmel London one it's called match perfection and it says skin adapting concealer hmmm this isn't shade medium I'm gonna use this as a base for my eye and this is actually kind of dark I thought it's gonna be a little bit lighter no medium is medium but I just went to go look for a lighter shade and I have this one in light medium which is right in the middle I don't want it to be too light but I don't want to be too dark and then while we're here I'm just gonna go under the under eyes really quick and just tap top that in there from the inner corners so now that we have concealed face basically because I concealed my whole face they were gonna get into the Maybelline X makeup shayla collab this is the palette that she created with Maybelline I think it's such a nice palette I've already swatched everything it is very creamy and I'm really liking the pigmentation on these shadows and there's enough math in here so that you can create an actual full-on look with just one palette so this is the only I'm gonna be using for this look so this is the base it even says it on the the pallet look how pigmented that is take the base color apply it all over my eyelid and the brush that I'm using is from ELF and since we working are really good so now that everything is set in place we have our base down so now I'm gonna take this brown shade right here with a blending brush and I'm gonna work it on the outer part of the lid and into the crease and the first layer is gonna be pretty light so it's just a very light wash of color at first and then we're going to build it up that's a great thing about this palette is that it is very buildable you can start off light as light as you want and you can build up the intensity to the darkest that you want so that's a really good thing about this palette because it is very buildable so in case you don't want a ton of pigment at first and I'm just gonna use circular motions and work that on the outer part of the lid now I'm gonna just build up that intensity on the outer part of the lid so the next shade that I'm going to work into the crease is this purple right here okay so now I'm gonna go into the deepest darkest shade which is this black color right here and I'm gonna hit right in the outer V and we're gonna focus this really low build it up as we go we don't ever want to just BAM with a bunch of black in our eyes I'm gonna bring that all the way in actually right into the inner corner and then for the lid I'm gonna take this shade right here these shadows are so soft and so creamy and so pigmented she did an amazing job on these shadows hack that on to the inner part of the lid for the brow bone I'm gonna go in with that base color and start to work that right underneath we're gonna that's basically gonna clean it up and redefine the brow and if you brought too much too high we can or get back down now I'm gonna start to work the purple on the bottom lash line to give it a pop and I'm gonna use this little smudger brush for that the pigmentation on these shadows is insane it's crazy crazy pigmented for the inner waterline I'm gonna take this Milani purple liner in fixed on plum and I'm gonna work that right in there so I'm gonna take this Maybelline master precise ink master precise in the shade black comet so we're going to use this to make a very fierce intense dark wing now I'm gonna bring my lashes to life with some mascara because they are no gala actually also has mascara as a part of her collection she did a blue a purple this is the purple one and a black one and I love their names there so her this is popping purple and the baddest black I'm actually gonna mix them together because I want to have a little bit of that purple pop into my lashes I think it's a really good contrast for brown eyes so I'm gonna first put on the purple and by the way this I mean the colossal Big Shot is one of my most favorite mass Jerez other than the l'oreal lash paradise this one is absolutely amazing so I'm so excited to use it and that the fact that they have it in color is even better and then I'm going to take the black and also mix it in with the purple the lashes that I'm using are not drugstores so I'm just gonna pop them on off-camera but they are I will let you know what they are they're the huda beauty lashes and scarlet the number eight they look like this and I will be back with some fam lashes I'm actually gonna add a little bit of this Rimmel nude eyeliner right in the middle of the wing and the purple pop on a highlight because I feel like we need a little bit of highlight in her life by a little I mean a lot so I'm gonna take this Maybelline strobing stick illuminator highlight and I also have this dewy stick thing from ELF it's called targeted natural glow stick so I'm gonna take this it's like a bomb so you kinda gives you like that natural glow then oh so now we have our highlight on I feel like it's a very subtle glowy dewy kind of highlight now I'm just gonna make sure everything is stuffed in place and doesn't go anywhere so I'm gonna take the Maybelline fit me foundation in light so I'm just gonna go ahead and use that right okay I just put it on my hair if you want to see if something is your color which I think this is gonna be my color even though it says light always test it right on your jaw line this is gonna look a little pinky on me but most drugstore powders do so this is kind of what we're gonna deal with today I'm gonna use this elf duo and Saint Lucia I'm gonna take this to contour my face so I'm just gonna go right on the cheekbones though then did up snatch those cheekbones and then go around the sides for the nose I'm gonna use the same one and this is something different I wouldn't normally want to use something with any type of shimmer like super super SuperDuper matte but we are trying new things out today stepping out of our norm and it's actually not like crazy shimmery everywhere so it's not so bad even for the nose this is a really nice contour color actually and then for the blush I'm gonna take this side right here because we have so much going on with the eyes I do want to keep it more on than actual side for the cheeks and the lips for the lip color I'm gonna go in with this Rimmel lip liner in innocent it's just a nude this is one of those lip pigment cancelling kind of shades for me so I'm just gonna use it to my advantage and cancel out my entire lip color I hate talking and doing lips why do I do that to myself is then we'll be able to see the true color of the shade we're gonna put it right on top for the lip color I'm gonna take this maybelline superstay matte ink and Loyalists I haven't seen this before we are going to pop that on top oh it smells so good I think I want to go get dessert this almost feels like it should be a gloss so I'm really interested to see how it's going to dry down it's not like dry it doesn't feel dry okay it's drying down and I feel the difference it does dry kind of sticky but um when you first put it on it feels like a gloss so that's really interesting I don't mind it it's a matte lipstick so it's gonna feel a little dry and I'm fine with that this is the final look I hope you guys like it watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it you know what to do give it a big fat thumbs up if you missed some other videos I'll have them hanging out over the side for you guys to watch before I let you go I want you to know that I love you and your amazing agent for watching and until the next my belly 
[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I am in my element I'm back home it's my first makeup tutorial on YouTube in November like regular basic B makeup tutorial I'm very happy to be doing this I miss it so much I was like what am I gonna do first of all I was like okay so I've been doing so many crazy videos what in the world am I gonna do like what makeup look Ryan gotta come back at I was unboxing and I found the kylie burgundy palette and I was like yes this to me screams November I'm gonna be showing you how to get this look I feel like it's a pretty spotlight eyeshadow look and it just highlights your eyes and just brings in something to your eyes that is so flirty and warm and sultry at the same time I love it so so much and I know you guys are going to love it so if you want to learn how to get it then keep watching I'm just going to go ahead and jump into the foundation concealer so I'm going to be using the Clinique beyond perfecting foundation and concealer I don't have to use an extra concealer because it's already acting as both so I am very excited to use this my first time trying it this is actually provided to me by Clinique thank you guys so much for sending it out so I can try it let's go ahead and start to put this stuff all over my face this acts as both concealing and a foundation so it has a really good coverage and I don't have to I use like an extra layer of makeup on my face so this is this me super full coverage 12-hour wear and it has a doe foot applicator which makes it easy to apply I love these dofor applicators I'll go ahead and work that onto my face this is the number four cream would you need to do little lines I like the doe foot applicator because you can cover more space with it and it's just a lot easier you know it's precise so now I'm just going to work it into my skin with a beauty I like the coverage and I also like that it doesn't feel like it's weighing down my skin because it is very full coverage you can tell it like cleared everything up like that but it also doesn't feel like it's heavy so I like that love full coverage foundations because they make your skin look so flawless but if it doesn't feel but if it feels like a full coverage thick heavy layer of makeup I won't use it I don't care how flawless it is I'm only going to use it for Halloween looks you know I mean so I wanted to feel comfortable when I'm wearing my makeup and this is one of those foundations where you're going to forget you have it all right now I'm gonna go into my eyebrows I'm just gonna comb them up first I'm going to be using my favorite brow pencil which is the precise in my brow pencil from benefit so I'm just going to comb them and then I'm going to fill them in as I fill in the sparse areas I also brush through them with a sweet just to make sure that everything is blended in there so now that I'm done with my brows I'm going to go ahead and set my lid area just so that everything is nice and clean smooth and it'll be easier to work on I'm going to take this Sigma blending the e25 brush and I'm going to take my Kat Von D powder I'm going to go ahead and pop this on to the brow and then and work it down all the way to the bottom of the lid this is going to work as a really nice base it's going to set this area so that there isn't any creasing in the lid space and I'm also going to just even everything out and I'm just going for a very natural brow bone so base powder works just fine for this I'm focusing more of the brow powder right underneath the brow bone so I want this area to look very clean and defined so I'm going to go ahead and pop this shade right here it says the shade name is going to be penny but I think it's naked I feel like it's switched but we're just gonna call it penny I guess so I'm going to pop that on right on the brow bone and I'm going to stop this right before it gets to the crease I wish this had a mirror in it I feel like it needs one but it's okay now that we got the brow pretty much done I'm going to go into the lid space I'm going to take Beach right here this is going to be our base shade and I'm going to start to work that on the lid and on the crease and i'm just using windshield wiper motion motions just going back and forth to kind of blur the edges so anything that we put on top of this is going to look nice and warm and what I like to do is take a clean brush just to make sure that we have no harsh lines clean blending brush I'm using today is the morphe r39 brush so the next color I'm going to pick up is this one right here this is naked but again it could be penny either one because I feel like it would be penny it would make sense if it was penny but it says naked so we're going to pick this one up right here and I'm going to start to work that from the lid to the crease so what I'm going to do now is take my morphe 514 brush and start to work this area a little bit further up to the crease I don't want to bring all of that I shadow up all the way to the crease with this densely packed brush because then that's going to look really crazy really fast it's gonna be really hard to blend out so I'm gonna go with this little bit and then we'll work it all around just so that we can get a nice soft blend you know what I mean really be my mommy Sassoon you know what I mean jelly bean she says things like that I'm barely putting any pressure down on the brush so I'm holding it way far back out here please ignore ratchet Rachel nail right here we are just going to ignore her I'm going to take my brush with a very soft like I'm barely pressing down so I'm holding in the back when you hold in the back you don't put down as much pressure as when you're holding it like this like really close to the front so I'm putting my hand way back here and then I am taking some of that shadow and working it upwards towards the brow bone in circular motions this really soft circular motions and then bring it in bringing it around the inner crease area right here if you close your eye you can see where you need to blend also you might want to open your eye just to see how it falls on your lid you want this part to be very smoked out soft and blurry you just want you want to look like you took the blur too much so now I'm gonna go ahead and go way down here to this shade this is almond and I'm going to use a morphe 503 brush and I'm just going to pick that up and start to work this on to the crease as well I'm also going to work this shade right on to the inner corners right in here I really focus and pack on the shadow right in this area so I want it to be a little bit darker on the outer and inner part of the lid I'm actually not connecting these two because when I close my eyes you can't really see it and when I open it it's just like a soft connection already so I don't need to go any further with that so I'm going to leave it where it's at and then I'm going to go ahead and bring it in right in here take a clean fluffy brush and start to blend out the edges in the next shadow I'm really excited about this was kind of like the hot spot right here I really it was excited to use this one the burgundy shade in the palette and the reason why I wanted to use the palette was because of this shade mainly when I go ahead and pack it on with my Mac 239 and work that onto the outer and inner part of the crease for the center of the lid I'm going to take this shade right here this is called Dubai I feel like I'm lying to you guys telling because I feel like they should be switch like the names are switched but it's fine just going to take the other side of this brush right here and I'm going to pop it into Dubai and I'm going to pop it right onto the center of the lid just so that it acts like a little spotlight it's just like highlighting your a lid it looks so pretty I already love it so I'm going to go ahead and do the other side I like that these are very pigmented and there's not a lot of fallout okay so now I'm going to work everything I did on the top and working on to the bottom so I'm going to do is take this side right here and start to work it on the lower lash line I'm actually going to take this little baby fan brush into the Sigma lash fan yo4 brush and what I'm going to do is take that maroon color actually I'm going to take let me show you I'm going to first take this shade right here and I'm gonna work that onto the lower lash line first oh my god it gets so perfectly right on the lash line I'm going to bring it all the way into the inner corners of the eye somebody actually tweeted me about this brush or like you always ask for a fan brush for your lower lashline and here it is so I'm happy they made it I just if I were to make my own fan brush for the lower lash line it would be a little a bit more fluffier just a little bit so that you can really smoke it out if you wanted to okay so now I'm going to take this brush right here and see how I'm making it into a little fluffy fan brush it's a little bit thicker and just going to help blend out the edge and now I'm going to go ahead and take that really pretty burgundy color and I'm going to work that on the lower lash line I'm going to add just a little bit of this pigment in the center of the spotlight just because this is max Rose pigment looks like this and I'm just going to add a little bit just to see what it looks like I'm very curious to see what its gonna look like so I just got to do it I'm just going to lay that right on top just to bring a little bit more light in this area and then I'm going to go ahead and take the honest Asya liquid gold metallic luster liner and we'll work that right on to the waterline this would also look really pretty as like an inner corner highlight now I'm going to add some mascara this is the new mascara from Mac it's called false lashes it's a really cute handle apply pretty generous coats of mascara to the lashes like I could wear no lashes with this but I'm just gonna add some because of course I want that extra volume but oh my god this is a good one okay so now that we're done with the mascara I'm going to go ahead and pop on these lashes these are some new lashes that I got they're called lash boss the box looks like this the style Kate very pretty and wispy so I'm going to take these guys right here I'm so I'm going to be using the Estee Lauder Victoria Beckham collection bronzer looks like this the mirror is really really nice called Java Sun it's a nice matte warm bronzer I'm just going to warm up my cheek and temple area and then for the blush I'm going to be using this Smashbox blush collection but I'm going to go ahead and pick up true flush pop it on to the apples of my cheeks I'm using my morphe 53 brush and then I'm going to work it back into my hairline right into my hair just so that it looks a little bit more natural and then for the highlight I'm going to be using this highlight palette right here the new glow kit from honest nausea and I found the most gorgeous highlight whites and I'm going to be using my morphe 510 and I'm going to pick up some of white sand and just pop it on to the tops of my cheek bone put some on my nose and that is it for the face I'm going to go ahead and move on to the lips and for the lips we're going to be using a new Kylie lip kit this is the shade moon and I'm just going to lie on my lip if I don't like the combination of the lip and the eye so add on to it contempo I feel like this is a little bit more pinky I'm just gonna layer it on top so I'm just going to choose this is stone from dose of colors me see what that looks like I always prefer to add on top and add more because then you create your own custom color or the center the list and we go for something nude I'm thinking Jeffery stars I'm nude in the center of the lip so if I can find that that's what I'll be using and actually see it right now so I will be that I'm going to pop that on to the center of my lips okay so now I'm just going to layer on the Too Faced lip injection and this is in angel kisses thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed the video if

drink every time I say foundation you'll be drunk so it's gonna be like full-on cake are you guys ready hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I am gonna be talking about something I am very passionate about that is my full coverage foundation I've said it so many times on this channel I am a full coverage girl full coverage I love the cake I love just to look like I have perfect looking skin because I really really don't so I've always really loved full coverage foundations from the time I picked up a foundation I was like what is this I need more coverage so I've always loved that I've used so many foundations that are full coverage and I've searched all of my life time that I've been wearing makeup in this world searching for the best full coverage foundations and I have brought them here for you I asked you guys on Twitter I put up a poll which one you want to see drugstore or a high-end and you guys basically said we want both so I have that for you in this video so if you want to see what the best of the best is keep watching but before we get into the video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bells to give you part of the quoi family and without further ado we're gonna get in to the video first foundation I'm gonna talk about is jus a essential high coverage foundation so this retails for $38 and you can get it on jus wacom the one that I'm wearing right now and it's currently my favorite very new it's very very new I literally just tried it like a few days ago I became obsessed immediately I actually used it for the first time in my last video so if you want to see that reaction to this foundation I took it on a shoot with me that I did and in blown out lights looked beautiful on camera it lasted a full eight hours did not budge I've actually had this foundation on for a full 10 plus hours it looks great I did touch up under the eyes and I did a little bit of bronzing my skin looks so so good with this foundation I just I love it so much it is like my new Estee Lauder Double Wear feel like cream is the best way to describe the way this looks on your skin in the way it feels on your skin it is like butter on toast you don't need to this thing on and I layer the most fullest full coverage foundations out there that I've tried I still layer them on this one I don't layer on like that because literally with one pounds of your Beautyblender you can see it in my last video it will make things disappear it's like magic I can't talk it up enough I just I love it it dries in matte it covers all the blemishes fills in all of the large pores and if you have oily skin this thing is going to work dreams for you comes in a pump pumps are amazing anybody who makes the foundation please make it into a pump you can really control how much comes out this is just a tiny bit but if you work it over like I have really bright green veins all over my body but if I just work it over my hand instantly it covers my vein like a tattoo I mean I can keep going I'm blending this out if blends out like a dream and it just feels so light on the skin it's not drying it's not uncomfortable I don't see it oxidizing much but it's literally covering up my veins and making my skin look so airbrushed and flawless jouer has given me my own code which I've had for a long time but since I'm talking about this foundation so much I decided to let you guys know if you want to use it it's down there somewhere and if you're thinking about buying the foundation it's going to give you a nice gist the next foundation I'm gonna talk about was something I found when I first found my first full coverage foundation and I fell in love and still to this day I swear by it foundation that I'm talking about is the Revlon Colorstay foundation by the way this foundation right here is $12.99 this'll last for 24 hours and I honestly haven't worn it as much to really remember if it did last 24 hours back in those days I did not wear primer on my face at all so I just put on foundation on my dry skin I would try all these different foundations from the drugstore and I would always find myself going back to this one one annoying thing about this foundation is that it dries so freakin quick and if you use too much it can really cakey and crazy and it smells kind of weird it smells like chemicals but it goes away and the good thing about this is if you're working out or if you're doing something where you're gonna be sweating or if there's a lot of humidity in your city or whatever it is your makeup is not gonna budge this does not move and it's actually a little bit hard to take off of your face like you're gonna need like five Neutrogena wipes really hard to remove but it does the job and I love it this foundation will cover everything up I promise you and it's going to last you a very long time has a SPF of 15 it does not oxidize and that's one really great plus about this because whatever comes out onto your skin whatever you blend out onto your skin that is the true color that it will stay which is awesome and very hard to find so I'm gonna try it on my hand right now let's see if we can cover up this these green veins right here put a little bit on my hand and as you can see it definitely covers the veins you have to work really fast with this foundation because it dries super quick you cannot move it once it dries so you literally gotta go in there and just beat your face with a Beauty Blender within like 10 seconds or less because this is how it's gonna stay that's the only bad thing about it but I mean if you can work fast and I remember it took me a few times but I love the coverage so much I learned how to use this foundation and I used it till its fullest coverage because it says it's supposed to be a medium to full so I'm gonna put on another layer with the other foundation you just need one layer but this one you can actually do two for a maximum coverage it may enhance fine lines and wrinkles it's a little bit drying so you're gonna want to use a hydrating primer and right now my favorite primer that's super hydrating and really makes your foundation just glide on so beautifully is the Laura Mercier hydrating primer it goes onto your skin it's so nice you can just feel your skin soaking up the moisture but my skin just feels so much better so much plump like I drink eight glasses of water it prevents all these full coverage foundations from making your face feel like cracky but this foundation has basically dried now and as you can see it dry - very fast it will not blend out at all so you have to really work fast with this but if you want a full coverage of drugstore that's gonna be one of the ones you're gonna sew the next foundation I'm gonna get into is my all-time favorite foundation this goes for $42 it's the Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation oh my gosh this foundation is so good it is worth the money if you're looking for a freaking full coverage foundation because I want to tell you the good with the bad so you know what to expect when you're buying the foundation it almost reminds me of the Revlon foundation without it drying super fast this one gives you some time to work it in it doesn't ever really dry to the point where you can't move it but the only thing about this one is that it leaves your skin feeling super dry like tight like it's gonna crack open that kind of dry at least that's what it does to my skin my skin is dry to combo so I do have to use a very hydrating primer or a long-lasting intense moisturizer on my face before I put this on because it is extreme it is intense but it works really well also another option for you because this just does look really freakin drawing on the face I get the cover effects hydrating drops or any kind of serum to mix in with this to make it a little bit more thin and just go on a little bit more smooth would work well if you have oily skin this is perfect for you you probably don't even need a primer because it's gonna do the job for you in every aspect it does last a full day and now I have not it says it's supposed to last for 24 hours I have not tried this foundation for 24 hours because I usually take my makeup off before I go to bed I can't really tell you if it really lasts 24 hours but I can tell you it lasts through the morning tonight so that's a really long time my skin ends up feeling a little bit like Grandma sorry grandma you're here no offense but hey she's actually in the other room but it does feel very like tight and it does get into your pores to where you can see the fine lines which is not the best but it is going to cover up all the wishes and make you look like a porcelain doll like so let me just put it on my my hand and I actually have a scar I have my finger from when I fell in Fiji so I'll show you how it covers that as well it does a really good job at full coverage if you have a scar on your face it's going to cover it up this is just one little swipe and it's basically gone so this is a very very good full coverage foundation depending on your skin type you might have to change your primer but overall this is a very good foundation and I highly recommend go for the next best full coverage drugstore foundation out there it is going to be l'oreal infallible Pro matte this is also a 24 hour foundation and it has a demi matte finish meaning that it isn't completely dry matte which actually works really well for my kind of skin because I don't really like to look like I'm super matte because I'm already really dry so I always like to put a little bit extra highlight in places or or do a mist at the end of my makeup so that it looks like skin again so I like the fact that this doesn't dry completely matte this foundation is $12.99 as well same price as Revlon if I were comparing the two I would just get this one so I'm gonna just put it on my hand give it the test I'm gonna work that into my skin as you can tell this is another extreme coverage I feel like it's very comparable to the Estee Lauder Double Wear if not a dupe to the Estee Lauder Double Wear so you can go light and still get a lot of coverage or you can go a little bit heavier and get maximum full coverage it doesn't feel drying on the skin and it doesn't feel like it's heavy so it's not weighing it down so that's one layer I'm gonna do a second layer and honestly I feel like I don't need a second layer but I want my green veins to completely disappear and I'm gonna try that on my red scar to make sure that it covers it so again if you have scarring on your face this is obviously not the right color but if you have scarring on your face it's going to cover it up and imagine just a second layer of this completely gone it's not heavy not drying not completely matte but it does have that effect on your skin and you want to cover up deep dark circles redness blemishes zits this is gonna do it for you I highly recommend this drugstore option highly it's a good one so for the next high-end foundation I'm going to be talking about the Urban Decay all nighter foundation and this is a waterproof the long wear foundation I said foundation like 30 times drink every time I say foundation you'll be drawing so be careful but this foundation is really good it's super full coverage I like the coverage it lasts but it does oxidize so be careful with this one really test it out before you buy it test out the entire range if you can if they let you wherever you're buying it at if you're worried about your fine lines if you're worried about large pores then definitely get this Smashbox photo finish primer something that has silicone in it that's going to sit into your pores and make it look like a smooth even surface or something that's more hydrating if you don't have that issue but you don't want it to feel dry on your face because this one will feel that way it's very long wearing this foundation is $40 in case you guys are wondering we go ahead and put it on my hand so here's my hand before it's a very thick foundation and that is intense that is actually more intense than a lot of these foundations so if you're really looking for that full coverage this is definitely like an event kind of makeup picture day makeup again you want to test it out before you buy it because it does oxidize a ton so it gets so much darker than this for the last full coverage foundation from the drugstore that we're gonna be talking about is Milani the Milani conceal imperfect two in one foundation plus couldn't see this is another crazy crazy foundation a very similar to the Urban Decay all nighter because it is that intense and I was I forgot how intense that was like I know it was full coverage but this is just like I don't stay this work very often but it literally had me shook to the core it has a pump which is amazing I love that it has a pump so easy to apply so it's not less messy it is a little bit thicker and we're gonna just start to work that into our to our hands right away it is very similar in coverage to the Urban Decay all nighter this is the most affordable foundation that I am talking about in this video it's $9.99 and it looks like the Urban Decay all nighter literally looks like a forty dollar foundation this one is extremely full coverage this is only one application if you let it die down it does oxidize a little bit so you got to watch out for that as well but play around actually I don't know if you can play around with drugstore foundations they don't just let you try them um but try to see what your color is if you're getting married and you're on a budget and you have like scars or something that you really need to cover up or you just love full-coverage flawless skin get this foundation this foundation is beautiful but make sure you get your color and it does not oxidize on you on your wedding day but it is extremely full coverage and I wish I knew about this back when I was in high school because I would have been buying this and saving so much more money that's pretty much it those are all the foundations that I have for you guys today these are my favorite ultimate full coverage foundation most of these I wouldn't use every day besides the jouer and the infallible Pro matte I would actually use this every day and I wouldn't mind it but the other ones I would say definitely save them for an event a big event like a wedding or picture day or anything like that because it is gonna make you look so flawless but most of them are gonna feel really heavy on your skin and it's not gonna be comfortable for an entire day unless you're trying to look like Beyonce the entire day then you do you watching I hope you enjoyed this video and if you like this type of video this is the first time I'm doing this type of video let me know in the comments maybe I could do more maybe it's the best concealers because that is another passion of mine covering these dark under-eye circles let me know in the comments what you want to see and that's it that's the end of this video before I let you go I want you guys to start believing in yourself today if you don't believe in yourself or if you're having any doubt just start doing it today you can do it I love you and I wish you the best of luck until the next video bye dolly 
[Music] oh wow hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I am gonna be doing this look right here which I ended up really loving and didn't know that I was gonna love it this much but it's a full face of what I think is fall first impressions to create this I want to go by a campfire in Tosa marshmallows and cozy up and still a blam kind of look as soon as I saw this palette right here which is freaking adorable I already saw this look right here oh my eyes but I love this look I know you guys are gonna love it I can see it on your eyeballs right now you look good I can tell your future self is gonna look so good ready first of all we're using the new una Beauty beau filter foundation there's some Kylie in here a bunch of stuff benefit New York color pop there's a lot of things and you're gonna love it so let's keep going with this video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bow so you could be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video the new benefit foolproof brow powder in number 5 so they have this brow with the lightest part in the front and the darkness in the back I think that's really cute and it also comes with this brush right here to fill in the brows I honestly don't know how I feel about it I'm gonna try it with this brush just see what it does because obviously it comes in a certain way so I want to use it the way that it comes packaged you're supposed to achieve more of a soft brow with this powder and now I'm gonna do the back hmm I don't know if this is gonna work for me I think gets to be really precise with this I mean I could see where it fills in but it's just and it is filling it in and I'm sure like you can work at it and get fill it in the way you want it um I think I'm just even off my brow pencil but I see how it fills in it is soft but I just I just want it like now but I'd rather use my own brush you know I just need a little bit more practice like this little guy please hold I will be back with some brows okay so for the primer I'm going to use this guy right here which when I first saw it I'm not gonna lie I was like I'm not gonna use that because it's black it looks weird how was it a primer but then I looked closer and it says it's a moisturizing primer and it's a hybrid between the two so I like that idea of having a moisturizing primer you guys know I love moisturizing primers so I decided to use it with you guys and it's black so I thought it would be cool to use on camera this is from the brand make help shield against damage caused by HIV and the impact of IR light while also aiding in vitamin D synthesis I really not sure what that means still but it seems like it's just really going to protect your skin put it in my hand like so okay I see it's a gel it's like a black gel so it's not gonna come off on your face like a black well sort of but it blends in in the skin oh my god it feels insanely hydrating I feel my skin soaking it up right away and it has the most amazing bounce back kind of feeling like a little babies but I definitely love the way this feels on my skin and I'm glad I did it and toss it it would be really sad and I'd be missing out on your really good primer so I'm glad I used it so that's cool we like the primer I'm gonna let that sit and dry and I'm gonna put on the huda beauty foundation I'm really to use that I've heard so many good things about it they gave me the shade a latte and toasted coconut I like the bottle she always has really nice packaging I like the fade right here how it's a black and it fades up and it's a little bit matte towards the bottom at the top it's a little more glossy the nice bottle of foundation I'm going to look up this brand before I use it on my face because it I'd hate to not say the print look how huge this is first of all I'm gonna be using this new beauty sponge that I got in my PR packages I don't know the brand I'm gonna look it up right now but this is how huge it gets like really freaking huge this looks like a doorknob like I can open or I can like pick a lock with this it's so freakin pointy and I thought it would be really cool to get into these little areas so I wanted to try this out it's also really easy to hold is how it comes which looks pretty big and then it gets even bigger when you wet it and it feels really nice almost like the Beauty Blender so really interested to try this but first let me look up the brand okay guys I just figured out who this is from this is from LC cosmetics so I know it has to be good because I'll see how some bom-bom products that I am I'm very excited about this no wonder it's from LC makes sense it is humongous it's pointy she L see the owner of LC is Lily and she is an amazing makeup artist so it makes sense that she knows to make it this tiny and sharp because she gets it she gets it she's amazing I can't wait to use it this is the full filter high coverage foundation let's see how high coverage this really is let's go ahead and put it on the hand and then we are going to pick it up with this side this looks like it is big enough for my face it hasn't really pretty floral sent to the foundation so if you're into floral scents you would love this if you're not into floral scents it might bug you a little bit but this is high coverage for sure is this too light for me I feel like we need to go with toasted coconut I love the names this is gonna get all over my 50 necklaces that I have on my neck today excited to try this in my inner corners let's see oh my god I love this thing my initial thought was that it was going to be a little flimsy getting to the inner corners because this is super narrow this thing is absolutely amazing it stole me right now in front of your guys's eyes with this little inner corner I knew it was gonna steal me with this thing I want to go around my nose I want to go in here I want to go everywhere with this thing oh my god I love it it's almost like you can use this instead of using concealer you could just use foundation this is more amazing than what I thought it would be and I thought it was gonna be really good but this is like life-changing okay it's dried and I do feel like my face is getting a little tight around my cheek area and a little bit around my eyes just like feels like a little a little bit of a facelift kind of feel I honestly don't even want to use a concealer because it covers so well under the eyes I think I'm just I was gonna use a new concealer but skin it there are so many palettes that just came out I mean so many it was really hard to choose which one to use but for some reason can you take a guess why this palette just kept calling my name like how can you resist this palette look how adorable it is the owner of Too Faced jared has a dog named clover he's in love with and his dog is super adorable colors are so pretty Eugene is just adorable and the colors are vibrant the colors the first Cottam I start off with is Chihuahua and work it right into the crease and work it down onto the lid as well it's just a matte taupe shade see how that doesn't really look like much but it's gonna do miracles whenever we worked in and those other cliches it's gonna look so beautiful and smooth like a celebrity makeup the next car my go into you is good boy which is this yellow color right here and work that into the crease as well that's a little bit of a shimmer to it you feel like this is a very sheer color like a mustard yellow color mixed with that Chihuahua shade very pretty especially for fall I'm gonna take the yellow and work at the lower lash line I almost feel like I'm about to do a Halloween look right now next color I'm gonna use is cuddle bunny and work that into the crease as well or the lid I'm gonna go with save them all just a really pretty rich brown with gold flecks in it I'll add torch okay that makes me look like I have an eye infection instead of that I'm gonna use this brown shade for rubbed on the inner corner I'm gonna take this glitter right here from Urban Decay it's called ac/dc I was like a little bit of a rosy undertone I couldn't seem to be so proud of me because I have a cousin who's awesome ik fartist and she is always find me to use color glitter she's like loves that stuff I just got in litters from la splash like this is a little bit more rosy kind of the look I want to go for it so I'm gonna take some of that violet Voss glitter glue and put it right on top this glitter right here from le splash this is called the crystallized glitter in the shade blushing bride it's a really pretty rose color dab it right on top I'm gonna do a wing I'm gonna do my wing off camera because I don't have any new eyeliners that I'm excited to try I will be back with some wings and then I have some new eyelashes to show you guys that I can't wait to try out so I got a lot of new lashes that just came in from a bunch of different brands and I was really excited to try them especially this brand right here because it seems like the hairs on the eyelashes are really really nice this is from less saline I'm gonna go with this style right here this is the Shanti or chantey what are those two I'm also using a new eyelash tweezer this is from the Saline and I'm gonna try it out because you guys know I am pretty loyal to the Tarte one so let's see how this works I like how it just grips and it's kind of curved already okay I like the fact that you can turn it on inside and get really precise with how you want the eyelash to sit I'm just finding all these really amazing products I did not know about before the next thing that I'm using that's new is this palette right here this is from Koki and this is actually the first time that I'm using this brand on my channel but this is a powder contour palette and you open it up almost reminds me of the Kat Von D shade and light palette first I'm going to brighten up these under-eye circles so I'm gonna go into this shade in the middle and at this one it doesn't go on as strong as the Kat Von D but I'm not complaining about it it looks really nice and it kind of makes my skin look a little bit more soft than what it was looking before so I'm gonna go ahead and take this Sigma extreme structure contour brush and I'm going to take the middle shade right here and this dark shade and start to cut my cheeks this is a new blush from colour-pop it's a really cute package I really liked the shade of this blush and I thought it would work really well with this look so I'm gonna go ahead and pop this on my cheeks okay I totally forgot to contour my nose let me just do that off-camera really quick for the highlight there is two highlights that I want to try and I'm really torn I either want to do the new mannery collection from NARS this is a gorgeous highlight it's called double take and just the packaging is so beautiful I want to use it so badly or Dior just came out with nude air illuminizer x' which look gorgeous oh I can already tell this is gonna be more intense okay made my decision we are going with Dior I kind of don't want to highlight this area just have so many bumps from trying all the skincare products like try it on my face yesterday but I can tell that this is something to be good very very good this a plus a plus I don't want to show you this side it's just extremely bumpy it's not cute so I'm just gonna stay like this I'm gonna put some on the tip of my nose but I'm gonna use my finger so I could be a little bit more precise with it and right on the bridge of my nose I really love this look I now I need to figure out what lip to do there's some new Kylie lips and there's some new NARS lips there's some new color pop lips I don't know which lip to do but I will figure it out in two seconds I figured out a lip I'm gonna go with the Kylie liquid lip in hazel and the lip liner so I'm gonna put the lip liner on first this look makes me want to like go by a fire and just cuff some marshmallows or something thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you liked this video or if I helped you in some way or if you just you

saw it at Roscoe's chicken and waffles I saw it on a billboard it's crazy how many times I've seen this little say I like the message behind it so think about that today I love you guys so much from the bottom of my heart thank you for stopping by my my little home here on YouTube and I will see you guys in the next video bye Tully's 
guys welcome back to my channel and welcome to my crazy messy hair day if you are having a bad hair day all you have to do is mess up your hair even more so many compliments all day I promise this video is not about my messy pony this video is about this cool tone pastel pink look and I'll be showing you guys today I have done a lot of warm looks on my channel lately and I wanted to mix it up a little bit I was inspired by this palette which is so funny because it's not an eyeshadow palette but I saw it and I was like oh my god this is what I want to do on my eyes this is actually a cheek palette from NARS this is called unfiltered - it has whole tone pinks in it and I like that it has like mattes and shimmers so you can use it on your cheeks you can use it as a highlight and they also have a warm tone palette this is unfiltered one I used a highlight in here and this on my cheek excuse my little boy hands let me show you guys how intense this is so I'm just going to run it across just watching it on my wrist like that that is the highlight the blush and then I use these guys on my eyes today and so so pretty very pigmented very very pretty it's such a multi-purpose palette you can highlight with it you can add blush eyeshadow it's you do so much with it if you want to learn how to get this look then keep watching this is good I've already primed my face I'm going to go ahead and go into some foundation I'm gonna be using this one from la girl it's the pro coverage HD foundation and I'm just putting some on this little plate mixing it with a lighter one just in case it's a little too dark not the greatest smell but it's okay I'm starting to like this foundation this is from NARS it's the light 275 Cannell I'm just going to work that in underneath by doing this triangle underneath your eyes is going to make your eyes look more lifted work that in with my beauty blender I'm gonna do my brows off-camera I will be right back okay so now for the eyeshadow I'm going to take this NARS palette right here the narcissist palette this is actually a cheek palette the unfiltered two palette there's this really pretty pastel peach shade called Conquest it's a matte blush but I feel like it would work right all over the lid just to set the eye and give the eye like a really nice whole tone look so I'm going to go in with my morphe r39 brush I also like to use one either flesh tone shade or a shade like this anything that you want to use as your base I like to use that all over my lids just so that we can set the creams on the space because if you just go on top of it with eyeshadow it can look a little bit uneven the next I'm going to take the morphe X Kathleen lights palettes I'm going to go ahead and take this shade right here and pop it onto the lid and I'm just gonna do a light wash of this color on the lid and then for the crease color I'm going to take this shade right here in the palette and like a charcoal gray I'm just going to use windshield wiper motions and I'm actually loving the shades in this palette so much so I'm going to go ahead and take a power-play which is this really pretty matte vivid pink I'm going to go ahead and put that on my inner for the inner part of my crease taking a morphe m42 two brush and just going to pack it on right so I'm going to go ahead and pick up that charcoal gray color and I'm going to start to work that a little bit more heavier on the outer part of the eye and now I'm going to go ahead and take a clean fluffy brush I'm going to take this matte shade right here and start to work that onto the brow bone then I have this other morphe brush as the F 5:17 do you see how that looks that's not cute I'm going to take this brush and I'm going to start to work that shadow down and you can see as I'm blending it into the darker shade it's becoming this really nice soft gradient look and I'm going to be using the l'oreal voluminous Alenia or noir now I'm going to put on some mascara and just prep my eyelashes for false lashes so I'm just going to put on some mascara really quick and I will be right back with some blush and then for a highlight on this inner corner of the eyes I'm going to take this shade from the Marc Jacobs palette it's this one right here it has like a purple reflect to it to brighten up this inner area and then on the bottom lashline i'm gonna go ahead and take the charcoal shade and start to work right on the lower part of the outer lash line okay so I have this really pretty pastel purple shot of eyeliner from colour-pop and it's called cry-baby and I'm going to pop that on to the waterline I'm going to set my face now I'm going to use this pop Beauty setting 101 palette and it has a chance loosen powder a bandana and a peach I'm going to take the translucent all over the face and the banana underneath the eyes for the all over the face I'm going to take this morphe e41 brush and just pass that all over just lightly patting it to set everything in place and then for my under eyes I'll take my Sigma powder sweep brush and I'm going to pick up the banana shade start to set my under eyes with that so for bronzer I'm going to take this rhodiola bronzer right here and it's just a matte bronzer this is a natural sunkissed glow and I'm just going to sweep it on my cheeks this is just going to give me some color and then for my cheeks I'm going to use the NARS narcissist unfiltered one palette if I'm going to take this shade right here it's called out there it's like a deep rust matte color and I'm gonna use that as blush on my cheeks and I'm going to take my morphe five-30 brush work that on the apples of my cheeks and I'm going to focus it on the hairline because that's where we want it to be the darkest and then you want to lightly fade it out to the apples I like the way it looks when you bring it around the temple not all the way up it just about half way it gives you a really pretty glow I'm gonna use this one as a highlight this is watch me watch me is like a opalescent gold Sheen color and then I'm going to take my fan brush and just work that on the tops of my cheekbones I like this highlight it's not overpowering it's just a nice natural glow to the skin I really like it and it meshes well with that warm I'm going to go in with this pinky beige a lipliner from NYX it's called soft pink and I'm going to work that on the lip line and for some reason I have been loving to accentuate and overdo my Cupid's bow over that I'm going to take the colour-pop ultra matte lip in knotty and then over that I'm going to put on this colour-pop ultra glossy lip and it's in nonsense it's a sheer gloss kind of using it as a highlight I'll keep everything else matte just like the little highlighted area and that is the final look thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed my messy hair and my look if you did thumbs it up and don't forget to comment what you want to see next I've been reading

oh my god I'll be right back things are getting real crazy today we're going nude on our face hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be doing this super glowy all nude makeup look using a ton of new products that I got in my PR package and I'm very excited about this product I have a bunch of other new stuff but this is like what I'm most excited about right here I cannot wait to show you the k'kaw contour powder kit and honestly this kind of whole packaging inspired my entire look today so thank you Kim Kardashian I did a semi cut crease here and I really just focused on a peachy bronzy taupey brown nudes before we get into the video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on thing I'm gonna start with today are my brows I'm actually gonna do them on camera I'm gonna use the benefit goof proof brow pencil and this is in shade number 4 so I'm just gonna comb through my brows really quick and I move my brush back and forth like this I just feel like this looks a little bit more natural it's not like super perfect and I use a very light hand and I'll just build up the fullness and the areas that I need to and then I'll just brush upwards Laura Mercier just came out with these little eye pencil or eye crayons oh they're called caviar stick eye color and they have this matte cream shadow right here it's called vanilla kiss and I'm gonna take this and use it as my base for my eyes so I'm so excited when I saw this I was like yes this is exactly what I need for an eye look and work that all over the lid it's right honestly it is a little it's a little too bright let's see how this blends out and if not then re probably are gonna have to use a concealer that's similar to my natural shade cuz I'm just gonna look kind of crazy never mind I think we're gonna use this later though because the look I'm going for today definitely requires something like this scratch that we're going to use the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I just got these in I haven't used this concealer in a long time this used to be like a ride-or-die for me and then tart shape tape came out came out and I've been using that like it's a necessity for my under eyes but I want it just go back to naked skin and just check it out see how it works because I kind of forgot and since I have these huge long Chloe's I'm gonna go ahead and use a brush to pack this on with I'm ready to get into the eyes I want to do something that is a little bit more dramatic but still have that nude kind of concept to it so what I'm gonna use is this palette right here from Marc Jacobs this is the iconic palette so it has some nice nudes topes and browns in it and I thought it would be perfect for this look it came in with like five or six other palettes that were inspired by the Marc Jacobs runway show so it's really really cool it really intrigued me so I'm gonna go ahead and use this guy right here and then I'm also going to use a little bit of this one work from Sigma the wild flower palette I can basically only use these shades right in here sorry it's like not focusing because I want a little bit more of a peachy tone I use this to set the concealer I'm gonna be using the Browns and the topes in the Marc Jacobs palette I'm gonna go ahead and take this shade right here which is infamous and I'm gonna put that all over my lid this is very very nude this shade is like the color of my skin take that with a flat brush and just wash it over my entire lid so I'm gonna go in with this brush I've been using this a lot actually it's one of the Kylie Jenner brushes from be birthday collection I really like it so we're gonna work that on the lid going up into the crease like so and I like that it has a little bit of it's not super flat so if you want to blend something out you do have that ability to do that and make it really nice and soft so it works really well to just apply the color and also to blend love new lipsticks I love nude looks nude everything nude heels then I'm taking this brush from dose of colors the blending brush and just going over the edges really soft just to make sure we don't have any harsh lines there I like the rosy peach looking shade in this palette so I'm going to take that into the crease use that just on the outer half of the eye it's just a little light wash but I feel like all these little colors add up to this beautiful gradient so I always dip into so many different shades the next color I'm going to use is this one right here I'm gonna take that and also place it in the crease this is the shade seeking and you want to keep these underneath the brow bone I'm actually gonna bring this guy and a little further I haven't used a taupe crease in such a long time I'm so used to warm tone shades that this is so different I almost feel like it can look a little dirty once the other colors come into play it's gonna really make the look pop I'm gonna take this Brown right here and I'm gonna work that in with a smaller brush this is M 507 from more feet and just gonna take a little bit of that shade and start at the bottom circular motions and gradually work that into this outer V making like a C shape like that I'm actually gonna bring this in a little closer to the eye like right there just to give the eyes a little bit of a different shape and with the same amount of product that I have on the brush and on my lid I'm gonna start to work this a little bit higher we have this going on right here so I'm going to take that blending brush ozz earlier and just soften this up so just eases into the next color if you have to can close your eyes so it makes your eyelid space a little bit more taut and then your brush can really glide on your lid a little easier and then you open your eyes and it's like surprise hopefully a good job so I'm gonna take this guy put it on the back of my hand we're gonna go ahead and use this concealer brush right here from the makeup shock it's the t 86 and start to clean up the brow okay so what I decided to do is grab this hourglass stick put a little bit on my hand and mix it in with that vanilla kiss shade because I'm the liking the color it's giving me it has like a nice thick opacity I'm gonna mix these two guys together but use any concealer that you have I just want to use something that's a little bit more thick that's gonna create the line easy so I'm going to put my head back and follow the natural curve of the eye then I'm gonna go ahead and fill it in with that concealer but I don't want to work it in all the way I just want to do it about half way and then once we get to this point I'm gonna start to blend it out with my finger so that it becomes a gradient into the rest of the colors and the warmth of your finger is really gonna help with easing the color into the skin and into the other shades I'm gonna go ahead and apply a winged liner I just got this in two from Tarte it's their TARDIS - double take eyeliner and it's super super super dark black [Music] now I'm ready for the lashes the lashes that I'm using today are from the Lily lashes these are the NYC once looks like so up close I will stick it on my eye try not to drive your eye liner down and change the shape of your eyeliner I always end up doing that and just press the ends of your lashes to the false lashes so now I'm going to go ahead and do the rest of my face and it is hot in here first put down this primer this is from Urban Decay it's the complexion primers it's one of those primers that's gonna fill in any fine lines and texture and make it look like a even plump smooth surface rub it in my hands this is a new foundation from Estee Lauder it's the double wear nude water fresh makeup so I've tried this out and it's a very light weight it's completely different than the double wear that I normally wear because this is a lot lighter it's not heavy it's not drying it gives you a nice even coverage but it's not a full thick coverage so I'm gonna pop this onto the back of my hand oh oh my god okay I just wasted all of that foundation the only thing I don't like about these foundation from Estee Lauder is that they have these huge freaking gaps and it's so annoying because I end up obviously dropping it everywhere some clumsy and it just gets everywhere it's so messy that's such a good foundation I'll be right back because you know things are getting real crazy around here I have a new fresh Beauty Blender so I'm just gonna work this on my face actually this is not bad it's like a medium coverage it feels like nothing is on my face which is good and then I'm gonna go in with the Naked skin concealer and hide those under eyes and highlight with this too I forgot how nice and smooth this glides on your skin [Music] okay I'm loving this concealer again I love how it blends out so easy and brightens it's not heavy it's not thick it doesn't crease I think I found my love so the next new product that I got in the mail was this one right here I was so excited to open this box it's the k'kaw contour powder kits from Kim kardashian-west so I'm gonna go ahead and take medium this one is this is what medium looks like right here I love the sizes of the pans they're pretty large and I like that large and in charge I'm gonna go in first with this bronzing shade right here very creamy soft I'm gonna take this color and bronze before I contour up those on my cheeks and around the temple I was honestly a little scared that this was gonna be too orange but actually like the way it looks it's not too orange it looks crazy in the pan to be honest on your face it looks really good I'm loving the way the powder is gliding on my skin it looks like it just melts into your skin like it's it's so beautiful I'm in shock because my first saw these I was like I wasn't sure how to feel about him because the head looks like it has a little bit of shimmer in it but you can't see the shimmer on your face and then I'm gonna go in with a contour color is this one right here I like the fact that you can make it two bronzy I feel like contour should basically be the same color as the natural shadow that your face cast you see that natural shadow right there I'm flipping the brush to the clean side and working this up so now I'm gonna go ahead and pop on a highlight let's see which one do I mom I think I'm gonna go with I'm gonna go with the brighter highlight and you take that on the cheekbones right there and then I'm going to take the yellow shade of highlight kind of it forms like a gradient into the lighter shade I'm also gonna take it on the inner corners of my eyes so I'm going to take pearly shade yeah loving that freaking palette so good oh my gosh I didn't use the brush okay I'll just blend it out with the brush since I forgot to use the brush the brush is cool though it has like a dome-shaped side and a flat side use this for the contour and this for the highlight or for the the bronzer for the lower lash line I'm gonna go back into this shade right here and I'm gonna take this brush which has the darkest shade on it and it has very little since we blended so much with it and I'm just gonna work that on the edges of this this mascara works great for the top and bottom lash because of the formula not being super heavy and wet it separates lengthens it's just super black I love it okay I'm gonna go with oats a very natural brownie nude so I'm just gonna line my lips real quick for the lipstick I'm gonna go in with the Ardell lipstick from that crazy I think are dull and anything clashes but now they have a cosmetic line which i think is pretty cool and it's the Hydra lipstick that I'm using it's the shade nude you say thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did you know what to do give it a big thumbs up also if you want to check out

[Music] today I am inside you hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be doing a get ready with me for you guys and this is kind of like what I do before summer hits I prepare my skin I test out different makeup looks for the summer so this is kind of like what I'm doing and I have a bunch of new stuff too that I want to try out oh my god by the way you guys these lips are absolutely amazing and perfect for the summer I don't like stain lips I never have I don't like the way it feels on my lips I usually feels like it's not supposed to be on your face until I saw these guys from colour-pop the blotted lips and the ultra blotted lips I have it on right now and I am obsessed with it it looks like you just ate a popsicle and it's this is the remainder of the popsicle on your lips it's so pretty and I'm also showing you how to get a nice color going before the summer stars a nice glow so don't be scared because the next clip is me in the shower welcome to my rest room since it's almost summer time I also wanted to include this step into my routine because I do do this everyday or every time I take a shower after I wash my body and rinse off I turn off the shower and I grab my Jergens natural glow wet skin moisturizer I can be a little lazy I'm not going to lie so I do as much as possible while I'm in the shower what this does is it boys Rises my skin at the same time it's going to give me an all-over even blow it's super easy and then I just walk out of the shower and dry off as I normally would the cool thing is that it doesn't get on your clothes or transfer onto your towels and it isn't a self-tanner and some moisturizers that give you a gradual natural looking color every time you use it and you'll start to see the color in like 3 or 5 days so it's super easy you don't have to think about it too much it's not messy at all and then after this I just brush my teeth apply my face cream and then I start to get my face ready for the day and let's walk into my Beauty room [Music] all right so now it's time to do my makeup for the day I have some new stuff in front of me so I think I'm going to use just all the new stuff that I've gotten my PR packages so I'm gonna do my brows first because I like to do them when they're dry and clean them up it doesn't get like mixed in with a foundation or anything summoning is that our austalia pomade in Ebony and I'm going to work that in with a blink brow and liner duo brush love this brush so so much is my favorite brow brush ever it works so well on either brow hairs it just pulls around hairs up so I'm gonna go ahead and take this guy right here this is the pomade from Australia and I'm going to just start to fill in my brows I'm going to start back here back by the tail end and then I like to brush through just comb through the hair so it doesn't clump up in any spots wow you can really tell how bald my eyebrows are I try to stay away from the areas where they have a lot of hair and just keep it on the sparse areas this pomade is very strong and it will make any area that you put it on super bold if you have full brows and you're just trying to make them even I would go in with a brow brush but I just I like using this just a little bit faster for me I'm gonna go ahead and film some primer I thought this was really interesting I got this in a PR package it's called j1 jelly pack basically it's called the foundation glue and supposed to feel like really tacky on your skin meaning your foundation because to stick to your skin like crazy it says dramatic firming skin with improved elasticity and poor smoothing but the package that I got said foundation glue so I was really curious to try this out and he actually had an Elmer's glue inside the package which I thought was really cute and actually gave it to my son I'm going to go ahead and try this out and see how this works oh it does look like glue that's what it looks like look at that oh that looks wrong it's like tacky so I wanna try it I hope it doesn't mess up oh this is weird my screws to do it like that imagine if I was putting glue on my face right now and I had no idea no I'm sure they wouldn't do that it's very tacky like it my skin my foundation is probably not going to move is either making me feel like I'm going to have our time blending this out onto my face because it's so tacky but yeah let's just go with it let's see what is that it's weird it's really really weird these are the new tart clay stick foundations it supposed to be very similar to the Amazonian clay foundation which I really really love it's completely full coverage feels really great on the skin almost feels like it fills in all your pores it does really great things so this is supposed to be just like that but in a stick so I'm going to try medium neutral yeah medium mutual night-work apply it to my face on top of this really sticky glue-like primer wish me luck you guys let's try this out it's gliding on pretty nice let's go ahead and work that into the face I'm just going to pack it in there pack it into my skin wow it actually looks really good and natural the foundation feels really comfortable on the skin and I don't feel the primer anymore which is good but it definitely feels like that primer is going to last me all day looks like tart shape tape is going to be our concealer as well that's just our go to go light medium then do a little bit of highlighting cut it in with a Beauty Blender and then we'll work it onto my lid that tan deep honey works really good as a contour stick this is a 3d HD Beauty fund from Sigma and just going to Pat that contour in if you guys happen to be shopping on Sigma or want to get this little guy I have a Co you can use for discount I'll have it below for you guys I'm also going to put some right on my crease right here now I'm going to go ahead and move on to my eyes for my eyes I'm going to be using this Carli bybel palette from BH Cosmetics this is the 21 color eyeshadow in a highlighter palette it looks like this it is so so beautiful it's like marble I'm still impressed with you shadows today I'm going to go ahead and get into this guy right here I'm going to work him all over the crease and I think what I want to do is do like a halo eye today just taking a fluffier brush so that we can blend out the edges and this is a clean blending brush so you're not moving that shape further out you're just keeping it where it is in cleaning up the edges I'm actually going to start to work this shade right here so for that I'm just going to take one of these flat shader brush as a weeba 234 brush so I'm going to grab that shade right here I'm going to pack it on to the inner and outer part of the lid so I want to keep that Center open so I can add a really pretty highlight follow the crease so these Browns are really pretty okay I'm going to go in with this shade right here this one right here oh so pretty it's like a pinky pearly champagne I'm just going to follow that Center highlight in the light is actually naturally bouncing off of my center of my lid so that's what I'm going to go off of and as I go I'm just going to deepen up the intensity of the inner and outer corner so I'm going to go back and forth into that brown just connecting the two sides I'm going to go in with that clean fluffy brush and just soften elf edges on my eyelid I'm only really using those two colors that transition shade that you see around it looks like a little halo a little glowing halo and then I'm just going in with that one Brown shape softening it and cue the edges of that highlight then when I get to the crease the outer crease I'm really just packing it in there and concentrating it right in that area so I get more intensity there so I'm only using one color for this because of the way I'm using it it looks like I'm using more than one color and then for the brow bone I'm going to take this matte bone color right here I'm going to use a heart brush right here this is from the unicorn collection and start to pack it on to the brow bone and then I'm just going to blend out the edges of these this really bright white shade right here and pop that onto the inner corner now I'm going to go ahead and go in with a gel liner in just a sec I'll a gel liner and brown for the wing I'm going to go ahead and take this brush right here this is the Sigma bent liner brush BB 12 I've never drawn to using brushes like this so this brush is pretty new for me so for that mascara I'm going to use the Tarte lifted mascara and it's like a black brown shade I'm just going to work that on our lashes so I'm going to put lashes on right now so so I'm going to go into my waterline with this Coco shade from Marc Jacobs and then I'm going to smudge it out alright so I'm going to add some some eye shadow on the lower lash line as well I'm going to take that Brown that we used earlier so this is going to be a really nice transition from our little smudgy that we created these are just Samantha number seven lashes from Buddha hooda so I'm just going to put the black mascara on the tips of the lower one well I'm really liking to new Beauty lashes so length the style is so so nice and then what I'm going to do just to add a pop of color I'm going to add this Mac green mascara this is in no pain no gain oh that is bright especially for this summer as a pop of color without having to actually put eyeshadow on your eyes at colors I connect them and go in with liquid highlight so I'm going to use this Marc Jacobs do you do drop it's a coconut gel highlighter looks like this i swatched it and it is gorgeous it's a liquid gold basically this is a drop I've done I just made that up so I'm going to go ahead and set my under eyes I'm actually going to use the naked skin powder I'm going to take my morphe e49 brush in this powder right here I'm going to look up because I don't want to get any creases under my eyes and see how this it's not as bright as I like it to be but I actually am building it up it does make your skin look really soft I'm going to go on with this bronzer it's a new browser from LC cosmetics it's in the shade medium I love Matt bronzers like so I'm going with that bold highlight from the Carli bybel palette this one right here and now I get to top this all over my face look at that highlight so I wanted to use these new color pop blotted lips they have these guys and they also have and the Ultra blotted lip let's see what he looks like this is bee's knees it's a little bit dry but stains aren't supposed to be moisturizing at all so I'm gonna go right on top with this I'm just going to go right in the center I like how color pop doesn't only come out with a ton of different shades but different formulas that haven't used this yet this is from benefits the California blush gives a little pop of pink Oh before I go I'm going to set with the new

[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel sit today I'm gonna be doing this super glam makeup routine this is my go-to glam makeup routine that I do if I'm going to an event or a night out

it just looks beautiful on every eye color I'm so excited to show you guys how I got this look and not to mention this is the second look from the latte palette super exciting because today is the actual pre-launch if you're watching this right now I'm probably at my launch party you can check that out on snapchat you guys want to see behind the scenes of what's going on but for now I'm gonna

the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video my brows in my last video so I'm gonna do it in this one I'm gonna be grabbing my like go to products that I use for my brows so I always like to start off with the foolproof brow powder in number 5 right here I have no nails because my nails have had it with me they fell off they broke they're very fragile just start to fill in the areas that I want more brow it doesn't give you a ton of payoff right away you can build it up so I really like that and then with the precisely my brow pencil and number 5 just gonna go in to the sparse areas I'll just go and hit this spot really quick with a really light hand and just sketch in that brow back and forth so it just looks like normal wild brow hairs I just love that look lately this wild brow hairs I'm just gonna fill in the very front part of my brow I'm gonna make them look a little bit more sharp of by putting on some concealer so I'm gonna take my heart-shaped tape and use on the lid with a consider that we have on our lid just gonna take a brush and go right underneath and I feel like for me a very defined brow shape is my go-to kind of glam brow so along with the rest I'm just gonna work it in with my finger since I have the opportunity to use my finger at its full capacity does that even make sense so the concealers gonna work for us in two ways it's gonna give us a nice base for our I shadow to stick on and it's also going to define the brow and make it just look more clean and the shape look more prominent once the concealers dried down I'm gonna go ahead and start to work on my eyes and when I'm doing more of a glam look I like to save the face for later where I start working on the eyes I'm gonna put on some primer so that it by the time I get to the face it'll already dry down so I'm going to take the cover FX blurring primer comes out just like a nude shade it's one of those silicone based primers that you kind of press into your pores so that whenever makeup a lies right on top it'll just glide over it and make your skin look really even and smooth so I'm just gonna press that in and then I'm gonna take the Porefessional pearl primer and I'm gonna use that right on the cheekbones and underneath the eye just to brighten up the eyes a little bit more and right across the nose I like that this primer smooths everything out but at the same time it gives you that illumination so really really like that about this primer so now I'm gonna start on my eyes and by the time I get done with them my face will be completely dry and prepped ready for foundation I'm gonna take the latte pallets I'm gonna do the second look with it today the first color I'm picking up is vanilla cream just to set everything in place and also set right underneath the brow bone I'm definitely gonna bring that right on top the inner corners just because I have been looking a little sleepy lately and this is definitely gonna brighten up that area the next color I'm picking up is caramel start to work this right around the crease coming down towards the end of the lid bringing it all the way to the other side of the crease so this is to be the first shade were laying down to transition into that purple oh I didn't tell you I was gonna use a purple today but I am gonna use double shot which is such a beautiful color first we want to transition it so I'm going to lay that brown down really nice all around the eye skip the center of the lid because we are going to pop on one of the foil shadows in the center take your hand put it at the back of your brush and just lightly use circular motions to blend out those edges I'm pretty good with that intensity that I have on the case right now so I'm gonna start to work in the purple shade I'm so excited about this so now I'm gonna go in to double-shot which is this shade right here Zeke until I've been using it and I'm taking a Vasanti contour eye shadow for brush like this this has actually been one of my favorite brushes that I've been gravitating towards so I'm gonna start right here at this edge such a beautiful purple I swear double-shot is gorgeous so I'm gonna take it right on the corner and then I'm gonna start to bring it in bring it right through that crease and all the way over to the other end of the eye and you guys can blend however you feel comfortable you can either do these windshield wiper motions going back and forth or you can do circular motions like this they some people even do these rocking motions do any one of those and just blend that eye shadow in it blends out so beautifully I'm so happy with these shadows I'm starting off pretty soft and then what I like is to go a little bit softer right in this crease area right here I like to soften this up but I like that corners of the eye to be more intense when I'm doing a halo and when I do this I sometimes I like to keep it kind of rounded and just put lashes on like wispy lashes but I also don't mind doing a wing I don't mind bringing the glam wing out with a halo eye now I'm gonna take a little bit more on my brush and build up this outer and inner intensity make sure to keep that soft hand that's the key to making your eye shadow looks super-super blended soft celebrity kind of makeup so make sure that you guys are using a light hand I know it's kind of hard especially if you're in a rush you want to just kind of get in there and just you know but take your time promise you using a light hand will change your eyeshadow game I promise so I'm gonna dip the same brush back into caramel and work that right around and blend it's just gonna look so seamless and beautiful with caramel right around it it's gonna make people's eyes just instantly look into yours so I really like to make sure that I have this nice pretty glowing kind of halo around the entire eye it just draws people's attention to your eyes around and I'm gonna deepen it up a little bit more so I'm gonna take a smaller densely-packed brush this is the makeup Shakti 14 brush intensify this outer corner even more see when you have something that's densely packed like this you're automatically gonna get more pigment more color payoff in that spot so just be ready to blend this out so I always have a clean blending fluffy brush on hand once I apply the amount that I want then I'm gonna go ahead and blend it out you can even take some of the caramel and help and that'll help blend out those edges and make them really nice and soft so now I'm gonna pop on the halo shade right in the center I'm getting really excited about it and this is creme brulee right here sorry for my janky nail this is the color that matches the palette spoil and I'm gonna work that right in the center this is really gonna bring all the attention to your eyes and I absolutely this love this color so now I'm just gonna add a little bit of vanilla cream right on the brow bone so I'm gonna take this Sigma firm shader brush and just work that right below so I grab my the balm Schwing liner and I'm going to give myself a wing my favorite mascara right now is the LC lash for mascara I'm gonna grab that pop on some mascara to my lashes lashes I'm gonna pop on our from the makeup shock they are called mad eye and they're so pretty wispy fluttery and fluffy at the same time you can see your eye shape in the makeup so they're perfect I'm gonna pop these on really quick and I will be right back alright so I am done with the okay so I am done with the lashes the brows and the eyelashes so now I'm gonna move on to the rest of the face the face is very prepped and ready for foundation right now so I'm gonna grab my jouer essential high coverage foundation this is my go-to for a full coverage glam foundation look so I am in the shade almond when I'm not fake tanning I'm just worth this and you don't even need that much of this foundation because it is extremely full coverage it covers your whole entire life and one application yeah I'm gonna work that all the way down to the neck always work it down to the neck so that everything that looks like one even human gain rather than two separate pieces so I'm going to take the tart shape tape in light/medium and just work that right on the I'm actually putting away too much you don't need this much but we are going for a full coverage of lamb and honestly this is how much I put on if it's a full coverage go I am but routine kind of thing this is the time where it's extremely it's still wet and tacky and ready to pick up powder so I'm gonna take the this has been ever since I found this wander beauty foundation powder I have been loving it so much it's super full coverage it makes your skin look just like a blur filter like it just looks super filtered so I love it so I'm in the shade actually medium but I'd actually like to try a lighter shade so I'm just gonna swirl my damp Beauty Blender around it look up and then start to Pat that in really fast that's when it soaks it up and just looks so buttery and creamy it makes your skin look so beautiful you know what I'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing I did to the top I'm gonna first take caramel I'm gonna bring it all the way in to the inner corners too every time I look at caramel in the pan I just want to pick it up and chew it is that weird I think it is so delicious looking I think because I looked at so many different caramels when I was trying to make this color that every time I look at it I just see like a chewy salted caramel just ooh okay now I'm gonna go back into this tiny brush from the makeup shock and work it into double shot and start to blend that into the lower lash line this is gonna be closest to the lower lash lines you still want that caramel to peek through brush fits in there perfectly so these pan sizes are large and in charge so I'm gonna take some a caramel and I'm gonna start to work that on the cheekbone just to bronze up and it'll make the look just tie together really easy and flawless so okay so now I'm just gonna grab Kat Von D's shade and light palette you guys know this might go to never lets me down so I'm gonna take the middle shade then I'll go straight across to give me more of a button turned up nose right underneath so that it doesn't look super elongated and I'll use a darker shade of contour right on the bottom just so that it intensifies that round look I'm trying to go for and I'll bring these edges you know like I'll curve it in so it looks more rounded [Music] then I'll take the banana shape I'll just put it right on the end of the nose here so that everything looks nice and even and blended and voila we have a new nose so for the highlight I think this would be a perfect perfect match to the latte palette this is coffee and cream and this is the elf collaboration with heart so I'm gonna take both of these colors right here and pop them on to the tops of my cheekbones and I'm sure you guys know this but I love heart with all my heart I'm gonna go ahead and work that on I don't know if you I don't know if you guys saw this when my family turned off I went ahead and popped on ad highlight to my Cupid's bow and did a very light dust over the top of the nose I'm gonna be taking the easy way sable lipliner this is such a soft creamy lip liner and then for the liquid lip I'm going to do the huda beauty bombshell liquid lip so I know works on the lips that's been formula [Music] thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did give me a big

[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today we are going to be doing some face surgery we're gonna be cutting those cheeks carving that nose our face is gonna look snatched to the gods my nose and my double chin are completely gone I literally feel like this is face surgery you're cutting into your face and sculpting out the shape that you want you don't need surgery all you need is a cream and powder contour some brushes and sponges and you're ready to go are you ready I'm very excited for this video I've gotten a lot of questions from friends from family members from subscribers about contour conundrums it'd be really difficult especially for the nose so I really wanted to break it down for you guys and show you how to get that flawless looking scalp to face that you can get at home no cost well a little bit of class but not as much as surgery so I'm gonna show you how to get that before you keep going on with this video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado we're gonna get on to this video we did my foundation everything is nice and covered up it looks even but the only thing is it looks a little flat so what I'm gonna do is go ahead and add dimension and death back into my face I'm gonna change up the shape of my nose a little bit before I get into contouring I'm gonna add a bronze my bronze up my face you don't have to do this you can actually runs your face up later on whenever you set everything but I just like doing this step personally I think it I think it makes everything kind of flow and look a lot more natural-looking so I'm gonna take this terracotta spray from Geralyn right here I'm gonna work that right on the cheekbone this is just going to bronze up our face and this is going to be the transition into the contour so that's why I'm starting off here you don't have to start off here I just love the way it makes everything kind of ease into one another it makes everything look super super natural starting off right on the cheekbones gonna hit right above try to ignore it in between my fingers you guys I really tried to take that off with oil oil strips like tan it just would not come off it was actually worse than this can you believe that I think it started with my cheeks first if I gain weight it goes to my arms in my face so my face will get more rounded and so that's why this part of my face is where I want to really cut it up and make it super define basically fake that I have a skinnier face than I really do so in order to do that you are going to need is something to contour with the contour color that you want to use is something that's gonna create a natural shadow so it's gonna be more on the gray tone side try to stay away from those orange e shades like like this one that I used earlier what this is gonna do is just give you more of a bronze look bronzers are meant to be used in more of a general space on your face contouring is more specific to one area and you want to be really precise with it so the difference is you're creating a shadow so that's why we want to get something that's more on the gray tone site or the ashy ur side so for that I have the Smashbox Studios skin shaping foundation I absolutely love the contouring side of the thump this is a foundation on this side I use this side I really love this type this is the shade to point to just in case you guys are wondering I just love how it's already curved it just fits right on the hollow perfectly start right at the hairline and I'm going to go straight down at an angle because I want to cut through the cheek I want to make it look more defined you have kind of already a slimmer face and you're just looking for a little more cheap definition you don't have to go as far down or if you're looking for a more youthful look you don't want to go at an angle you want to go at it like a a curve right underneath the cheek you want to cuff it because that's gonna make it look more soft and rounded if you go at an angle like this it's gonna give you more of a defined look some people may think it's masculine I like the way it looks on my face personally and a lot of people with rounded is usually like the way it looks so I'm gonna go on the other side right here starting at the very beginning of the ear and just work my way down you gotta kind of play around with contouring and see which kind of contour style works best for your face because there are so many different styles that you can do also gonna go in to the temple just so it looks more connected someone goes through the temple like that and I really don't feel like I have a big forehead or like it goes up very far I don't like to focus too much there but I do like to add just a little bit more of a shape here it doesn't have to be perfect I know an Instagram a lot of us I'm gonna say us because I'm one of them we like to show like cool shapes and stuff but it doesn't have to be perfect we're gonna blend it out anyways but you do want to keep it in the area that you're going to contour if you want a more defined jawline go ahead and do this if you feel like your jaw is pretty snatched already or you're just you're fine you don't need to add extra makeup to that part of your face you can skip it but if you feel like you want more definitions here at the jaw line you want to start right behind the ear right here if you have a double chin go ahead and take a contour shade and just go right underneath it and then of course you want to blend it down to your neck so I'm going to take my stick and go straight up so it's gonna connect everything together I actually I don't really care for this too much but if you want like a pouty bottom lip you can do a line right underneath the lip I mean I can show you guys so that your eyes can look a little bit more deep set on the hollows of your eyes like so and then for the nose everybody has a different nose you're gonna want different things out of your nose personally I feel like my nose is small so it doesn't need to look smaller but I do feel like it's a little asymmetrical so you can see it is more on this side I have a deviated septum so what I'm gonna do is take the brush and I'm gonna start right here at the bridge and just work my way down it's always a little bit wider at the top and it goes in as skinny as you want it to right at the tip then I'm going to work it in to the nose so I'm basically cutting off all of this extra nose right here and forcing the eyes to really focus right on the center I also want to shorten the tip of the nose a little bit so what I'm gonna do is bring this shade down so that it covers up in the tip but if you want it to look a little bit more termed up and rounded you can always put a little curve here it lets you know what let's just put the curve what the heck go ahead and blend this into my skin now it's really easy to blend you want to make sure you also blend it right into the hairline or you can use a beauty blender which I have it right here on hand and you just use it very lightly so you don't remove the entire contour like to work my contour upwards so you don't accidentally get it down into this area and you can either cup your cheek here I already have very rounded pronounced cheeks so I like to make sure it stays at an angle and if it doesn't I'll bring it down like this blend this in with the brush first and then start to work in the beauty blender and with this you just want to push this back try not to get it in here now I'm gonna take my Beauty Blender and just lightly pounce over the contour so now we're gonna get into highlighting the purpose for highlighting is to bring forward something make it look bigger brighter and use something a lot lighter because I really want it to show up on my face so I'm gonna go ahead and use this heart-shaped tape and light neutral and I'm gonna go underneath my eye and create a triangle like that fill in this area right here so let's just fill it in with a little tip doing this little triangle right here really lifts the face this is what's gonna make your face look like you got a facelift I'm also gonna go right on the center of the Cupid's bow and right in the middle right in this area up everything outside of this little funny-looking heart should be deepened up that's generally what everybody kind of goes for and then everything within this little heart you want to look highlighted and bright so I'm gonna go ahead and also do the sides of my mouth and this is going to help turn up your lips and make them look bigger you feel like your chin isn't as pronounced as you'd like it to be then you can also add a little bit of highlight here and then I'm going to take my L C sponge because it is very precise here I'm just going to pounce it right on the bridge of the nose [Music] I'm also gonna go right along the side of the nose this is gonna help bring the sides together and I also have the sponge that I bronze which is gonna go right on the edge of the highlight just so that everything blends together really nicely set everything in place this is important because if you don't do this part if gonna look like a sloppy Picasso kind of mess at the end of the day it's gonna look very scary I'm gonna go ahead and use the peach perfect from Too Faced so now that is set in place I'm going to do the powder portion of the contouring look out a little bit of my mouth taste it taste we did I'm going to be right back I'm just going to do something with my eyes because I feel really naked right now my favorite powder contour palette is the shade and light palette from Kat Von D and we are gonna start off with the contour so I like to contour my face with this color right in the middle evening NARS brush like this and I like to work this right down the cheek right in an angle and you want to use a light hand so that you're able to move the product easy on your face if you push down too hard it's going to press the product further into your face and it's gonna get really hard to blend it'll skip and look patchy so if you just use a very soft hand and move the product up it'll just move like butter and then I'm going to go into the darker shade right here it's the darkest shade in the palette and I'm going to focus that on the upper portion and blend this upwards and we don't want to move this very far it'll look a little bit more natural if you just keep the darkest shade closer to the top of the ear and then gradually work it down but still blending upwards and then I like to take this guy for the nose and just go over the contour we did on knows and this is really gonna make your nose defined and then I like it to get a little bit wider right around this area of the nose now we're gonna highlight I know this looks really harsh we're gonna go back and blend that out in just a little bit but to highlight I'm gonna take this yellow powder and just a touch of this guy and I'm gonna go right underneath for the eyes and this is going to set everything in place and brighten it up just a bit more also if you take this lighter shade and go right on the side of the nose it's going to push the nose together so that it looks more narrow and I'm gonna go straight down the center this little brush right here and I'm going to take the darkest highlight shade in the palette which is this one and I'm gonna go right on top of that contour and this kind of helps blend everything together after this you can go in and highlight your face I have this one right here from ELF this is the elf X heart defense you're a coffee and cream one I really like this one and you can just go over the little areas of your face like I actually like to take my finger and just work that on the tip and then just go right here this is just gonna accentuate the high points of your face even more

and you guys is crazy it's kind of getting in my mouth a little bit and I'm not mad at it hey guys welcome back to my channel so today we are comparing high rated versus low rated makeup of course I split my face into two I saw this video floating around from rachhloves high rated low rated makeup so I'm like you know what I'm gonna put them all in one video and compare them and really see if they are high and low rated or if these should not be low rated and you guys is crazy you guys can compare with me I just want to see what it looks like on my face you may even find dupes pause on this video and let me know which side is high and which side is low just let me know we're gonna see what worked what didn't can you tell there is no secret there's no hiding it one side sucks one sides bomb and let's just get on with this video before we get into the video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you could be a part of the quad family and without further ado I'm gonna get you straight in to this video alright the first product we are gonna start with is foundation so I did my research and the best foundation on Sephora right now is the Estee Lauder Double Wear which I completely understand why one of my old favorites I definitely understand why it's still everyone else's favorite the coverage is amazing so this is one of the top-rated foundations it's $42 know if this is my shade anymore because my tan is almost faded completely but I feel like I can definitely still make it work so I'm gonna just work that into my neck one thing we definitely know about this foundation is that it is full coverage you can tell from this side to this side that the coverage is on point most of everyone loves the full coverage on this foundation it's long wearing it doesn't transfer anywhere throughout the day so that is a huge plus and it's just super matched so if you have oily skin this foundation is great me personally I have dry to normal skin so sometimes I feel like it is a little bit too dry but you can easily fix that with putting on a moisturizing primer or just a really good moisturizer underneath I totally go back to this from time but it's been a while since I've been back to this location right here when it's more of a Matt I feel like it just makes my skin look softer and more filtered so I don't mind that at all the only thing about this is that it does oxidize a little bit you might go a little shade lighter than what you think you are but most people seem not to care about that too much because it's so freakin good in full coverage and I am not mad about it the lowest-rated foundation on Sephora right now is this guy right here this is the bare minerals bare skin foundation in my shade is bare natural 0/7 it was reviewed by over 2,000 people almost 3000 people and it was all mostly really negative and they did mention this is $18 foundation by the way most people did not like the design of the bottle because it is kind of messy because you have to shake it the product moves around a lot and because the product is very watery kind of it gets everywhere it didn't get everywhere right now but when I was testing it out at the store it definitely was super messy the product was coming out of the bottle so a lot of people said that he wastes a lot of product with this bottle design and I could see why because there is a huge gaping hole right there and it's a very watery kind of product that you do have to shake but I also noticed that if you don't close it properly because you have to hear this click it's not really getting anywhere and I'm gonna flip it upside down so maybe it's people not closing the bottle right this is a very light light light light formula wow that feels like nothing at all it's evening out my complexion honestly right I don't like how wet it's making my skin look still and I feel like it just emphasizes more of my texture honestly not my favorites alright so moving on to the brows I found that the Dior brows Tyler was highly rated in Sephora and that made me really happy because I actually already used this and I loved it so freaking much because it's just easy portable there's just something about this pencil that is just so perfect it has just enough pigmentation it's easy to move around your brow it's not stiff its smooth and has a spoolie on it the color it just meshes really well with my brow I just really love this pencil so it made me really happy that this was highly rated and that I already had it and I didn't have to spend the money on it so I was really excited about that but I really do love this pencil there there are so many good things I can say about it and the reviews were insane it just glides on your skin it's so easy it's easy to blend into your hair there's just something about this pencil that works in every single way possible I'm going to move on to the lowest-rated side of my face it sounds so bad this is the NARS brow Perfector and the shade I cannot pronounce which I can never really pronounce much of the beautiful names that Norah's has for their products but this is spelled caucus ass this is a 3 star rated product it is $24 and let's go ahead and try this on our face most people said that this was hard and stiff and there is no color payoff I would say because there's um this is the darkest shade that they have I would agree that there needs to be a darker shade but I feel like you can see the color it's just not as pigmented as you'd like really I guess I'm not really feeling this much because it's just not really doing much to my brow but if I clean it up and keep going back in hoping that at all build up okay something else that I'm gonna does seeing back to the foundation is that it's super patchy right now my face it's just clumping up in little spots around my face oh that is not good especially on my forehead nose and around my mouth I just feel really old on this side I'm trying to get as much pigment as I can out of this it's just too light for me I understand this was a fail alright so the highest rated Sephora eyeshadow palette you guys ready for this and I'm so excited about this because it's an indie brand I'm very proud of this dbrand I remember when they were just glitter so here we go the violent Vasa pro-rider die palette is one of the top-rated palettes this is a $75 palette but it has so many freaking eyeshadows in it you see this transition shimmers day to night file a boss has really nice quality shadows this is a for almost a five-star product this is 4.9 stars that's really really high I totally understand why this palette is so amazing and I have to make sure that the look that I'm doing can correlate with this other palette that I'm going to show you guys and it actually it correlates like there's cool tone taupey shades that it's going to work perfectly with so it literally has everything from warm to cool I love it so I'm gonna first go in with setting my lid I'm gonna take April right here a lot of people just love the pigmentation on this palette they love that it blends so easy the feel it's creamy so I definitely agree I'm gonna take Skylar which is this really pretty taupe ishe dry here's topi gray color I'm gonna go in with Jamie which is this shade right here so creamy so pigmented all the things all the good things with this palette those are really pretty coated so I'm gonna take the black in the palette which is right here her name is Cara Lee then I'm gonna just clean up the brow area so for that I'm gonna take April again the lowest rated product in Sephora and I was honestly surprised I haven't used this palette much but I'm very curious to see why people aren't loving it because the color scheme is really nice so the eyeshadow that I am talking about is this one right here this is the Smashbox full exposure as you can see it's something that I already had and I dug it up just realized that I really didn't use it much and I don't remember why I didn't use a much because the color scheme is really nice so this palette is $52 and a lot of people are just saying there's just no pigment no pigment no color payoff now things so I'm really curious to see how it's gonna work for me a lot of people said there's a lot of fallout with the pallet let's go ahead jump in and see how this is gonna work for us so we started off with setting our eyelid so I'm gonna take this middle shade right here which is very similar to April in the other palette in the pan it's similar and just put it on my eye almost like a translucent powder so maybe that's what they were going for I don't know now for that grayish taupe I'm gonna take this gray right here mix it in a little bit with this brown to give it more of the same type of look because as you can tell they're super similar but there's just something more warm about Schuyler in the violet vos palette so I'm gonna take a little bit of that Brown just a very light sheer kind of powder and I've I'm trying to build it up and I feel like you can build it up but you can still see right through it you know it's just these days we go for a big punch whenever we're using shadows like this day and age is all about high pigment so I totally get the whole pigmentation thing so for the next shade I'm gonna take it's this shade right here okay so I'm gonna take me morphe this morphe pencil brush right here and dip into this black well let's just say the black is very pigmented it's just it won't move from this spot and almost chalky the black is just spreading all over my face and I could definitely tell there's a bunch of fallout with this black I'm gonna go back into this shade right here you know it's just that this the shadow is so loose like there's no real pigmentation and it's very hard to blend out you see it's just not as pigmented like it's not sticking on the skin the shadow is just kind of going everywhere very hard to blend out so honestly just feel like this became a really crazy mess and the foundation underneath it does not help the shadows are not pigmented the foundation isn't like Stables kind of smear around my face so this side of my face is a little frustrating to be honest but I'm gonna go ahead and do my eyeliner pop on some lashes and we are gonna move on to the rest of the face one of the high rated concealers is the YSL all ours concealer this concealer had eight thousand hearts a hundred and something reviews I personally I use it and I like it it has like a doe foot applicator notice another thing that people really loved about this concealer is that it was very light weight but it's full coverage it lasts all day it goes on smooth and it's not drying to your under eye which is a big thing smooth lightweight effortless feeling hydration and that is something that is so important especially for the under eyes because this is a very delicate area of your face and you want to keep this young as long as you can so the fact that it's all of those things plus it's full coverage that's just a huge huge plus but my only thing with this concealer is that I have to build it up a little bit and there's other concealers that I really don't have to do much to work up the pigmentation and full coverage but it is a very good concealer that doesn't just wipe off your face okay so for the worst or lowest-rated sephora concealer it's going to be this one this is from Laura Mercier and this is the candle glow concealer and highlighter looks like so I have the shade number two and you have to click it up from the bottom to push the product up into this little spongy thing right here so the major thing that people complained about was that you had to click it like a hundred times I've clicked it a bunch of times too and it's still not up oh I see it it's coming up it's coming up it is up we have some product on the sponge I am so excited alright so let's try and see if this is going to hide my panda eyes this has a three point two star rating on Sephora and it is $32 right oh wow translucent powder and primer is amazing I like a lot of Laura Mercier's things so I'm really curious to see what people are talking about when it comes to concealer so let's go ahead and try this under the eye maybe I should have got shade one this is shade two I just figured I'd be shade to really like the applicator another thing people said was that there was micro glitters in the concealer I'm actually gonna put it right here I'm gonna need some help from this foundation I put on earlier I would say I can't really blend it in with this so I'm gonna take my Beauty Blender I know some people said that there was micro glitters in there that were pretty chunky but I don't see them at all I wish the second shade wasn't as dark it does kind of have like a drying effect and let it sit for a second you can definitely feel it's drying like it tugs on your skin and I'm not really liking this side of my face at all like everything is so so bad about it like there's no brightening effect I have to move on okay so I'm gonna set my under eyes one of the highest-rated transition powders that was not Laura Mercier this this actually had a higher rating than Laura Mercier this is the Too Faced peach perfect powder some mattifying loose setting powder and people loved it so I'm gonna bait on this side I personally love the smell of everything that Too Faced comes out with and that you can eat it because this is kind of getting in my mouth a little bit and I'm not mad at it a lot of people said they like the brightening effect that the powder gives you that it goes on smooth and it lasts all day a lot of people like the scent the taste and all of those things I definitely say yes that is one of the reasons why I love this but um so we're gonna let that set and see how it sets in to the skin I already know this is kind of a good one but we are still gonna set the lowest-rated powder in Sephora unfortunately was the Sephora beauty amplifier setting powder this was two stars on Sephora it is $16 and a lot of people just said it had a funky smell to it and it was cakey and it took off their makeup that was like one of the hugest things that people said just want to show you what it looks like like so I'm just gonna get some in there looks like that oh it does have a really bad smell anyways we are going to set this side of the face there's a big mess going on hmm it doesn't really go on the face very easy you see what I mean we're gonna let that sit there and let's see what happens yeah this thing is so messy or bronzer the lowest and high rated is the same brand the highest rated bronzer was the NARS Laguna the good old NARS Laguna you can never go wrong with this guy this bronzer always kind of made me feel like I shouldn't use it because it has little gold flecks throughout and I really don't like those light reflecting things around my cheeks because I have textured cheek areas I never wanted to try it but once I started using it I fell in love because the shimmer completely just goes away bronzer it was almost five stars is four point seven has 3000 reviews most people just like that there was no orange kind of look to it it just looked like a really pretty nice tan like a bronze tan but not an orange tan so I think that's why I really enjoy this bronzer as well I just love the color of the bronzer and you're just glides on the skin the powder is just so smooth with glides on the skin so nice and gives you just the really pretty color you can really blend this powder easily into your skin so great things about the original NARS Laguna they have the lowest rated bronzer at 3.6 so it's not like crazy bad but it's still a three and this is a forty dollar bronzer this is thus NARS Sun Wash diffusing bronze the difference is that this one is matte also there's like a different design on it but that's pretty much it so I was really excited when these came out because that's kind of what I love matte bronzers for my skin type so I was really excited about it and I never really noticed a problem but people say that there is no pigment in this bronzer so we're gonna give it a try is there pigment oh oh there is some pigment so what will mines is good I don't know what you guys are saying but it's pigment okay I'm gonna wipe away the baking powder and see what where you are left with one of the top-rated Sephora lippies is the NARS power matte lip pigment I think it's called this is American woman so we are gonna put this on this side of the face the good side I actually really like the scent and I really like that it has a pointed applicator so nice someone to go ahead and put that on my lip on this side yeah I really like this applicator it's just so easy and so precise a lot of people said that they love the pigmentation they also said that it was super lightweight smooth and just not drying at all which is very interesting for a liquid lip one of the lowest rated Sephora not the worst but the lowest rated lippies is the sephora cream lip stain right here and I have the shade number 13 it was just a regular doe foot applicator I'm gonna pop that on to this side and hopefully it's the same color very close honestly I I don't mind this phone this lip that's really weird it's not like heavy it's not drying so far I'm gonna wait till it dries down but the pigmentation is really nice while this dries down a lot of people said this is super drying it was patchy I mean in the tube I can see it's kind of breaking apart a little bit but on the lip it applies really nice it is pigmented and I don't feel like it's drying I must have got a really good batch because I don't think it's bad at all so I'm gonna say I don't agree with the reviews on this lip stain thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you

[Music] [Applause] [Music] he's good hey guys welcome back to my channel I feel like two different people at the same time 2018 vs. 90s makeup boom I really like both sides of the face honestly I can wear this I'm actually gonna wear this look tonight this look is way more rounded in smokey and kind of grungy and this one is a little more winged out arched still soft but very highlighted and just something if you grew up in the 90s as a teenager or as a young adult let me know if I'm missing something or if I got it right and on this side this is my basically my everyday glam kind of look this is 2018 for me so let me know if you want to see more of these videos because I think this is so freaking fun you can't wear this look out I mean he can if you want but people are gonna look at you like you are awesome you guys let me know if you want to see different eras eighties 60s 70s I'm here for it and let's look at the comparison in these two makeup looks I think it's so fun mom are you out there I hope you're watching this grandma we want to see how to compare towards each other then let's keep watching don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family you know what if I can bring my quad up I would but I'm not that flexible yet I'm working on it alright so let's get into the video on the 90 side they like to keep their face SuperDuper matte everything was matte no highlight nothing so I wanted to start off with a base mattifying primer so this is from makeup forever from experience you have to kind of work it in quick as it will dry in that little spa and it will not move if you have oily skin you're gonna love this on the other side of my face we are gonna use a moisturizing primer I'm saying this is something that we like to use these days because we all like hydration radiance supple young youthful looking skin so I'm gonna go with a Smashbox photo finish primer Iser primer and moisturizer in one so this is one that I really like Smashbox the like kills it on all the primers with this primer on and I actually have really dry skin so this works really great for me for foundation I am going to start off with the 90 side my favorite foundation right now is these UA essential high coverage foundation and I chose this one to mix into this one just because in the 90s people kind of went for a lighter skin tone just so their eyes could really stand out so I have my new clean fresh beanie blender really excited to use it I always love using fresh Beauty blenders and then I'm gonna mix sand right in there just a little splash oh my gosh I'm just gonna take a tiny bit this is such a full coverage mattifying foundation that I just thought it would be perfect for a 90s look even though I currently love this foundation but I always end up using highlight and a radiant spray or some kind of illuminating spray along with it just so I can bring back some of that luminosity back into my skin but the coverage on this foundation I've said it so many times I'm sure you guys know how I feel about this foundation by now but the coverage is just absolutely amazing he's good another favorite of mine is the NARS natural radiant long wear foundation this is a medium to full coverage I can definitely build this up to a full but it never looks matte or it never looks super cakey or full it just looks like your skin but thirty times better this is a really good one because you keep that fresh look and this is kind of actually a really cool way to compare makeup you can really get the full effect of comparing from one side of the face to the next you can see that on this side it's covering up my darkness it is covering up my blemishes but you can still see it has like a dewy kind of finish to it well my face kind of sits and sets I'm gonna do my brows brows are a very interesting one for the 90s 90s brows are very thin basically if you ever seen Pamela Anderson in the 90s Drew Barrymore I'm going to take the precisely my brow pencil from benefit because it has a very narrow tip and my hair is just everywhere using a brush through and naturally I have thin brows so this isn't gonna be too hard for me this is just basically embracing my brow I think instead of doing that really intense brow nowadays we're just keeping it pretty fluffy and natural looking so I'm gonna take the brow is from honest Asya on this side because this is the soft brown and I'm just gonna go back and forth like this just to fill it in super natural but I am gonna go a little bit lower just because I do want more of a full brow and I'm gonna use a softer hand and it's not gonna be too hard to create like a natural looking brow because this is the color of this pencil is just so perfect like a natural effortless color for this brow so then I'm gonna take foolproof brow powder I love this powder it's so natural and soft lifting on the brow and this is in shade number 5 as well I'm just gonna go over the honest Oz is a little too light blink neutral shadow fusion and palettes which looks like this I thought it was perfect for this 90s look because there's a lot of neutral color dip into citrine which is this first bone shape and just pop it all over the lids so that we eliminate the crease see I was looking at makeup in the 90s and it looks like the eye shadow was very minimal taupey shadows so it was a very basic basically so I'm gonna take a moonstone which is this shade right here and I'm gonna use that excuse my nails by the way they're so bad I'm giving them time to just recover from all of the fake nails I put on them for the crease area and just basically all around the eye nothing was super precise with eyeshadow back in those days or with eyeliner and I'm gonna work that all over the eye in general the eye shadow looks then we're very rounded so I'm just gonna make sure to do everything that I do here bring it in a circle right on the lower lash line okay so now that we have that color down I feel like I put my dark circle back on my face but that's okay at the end of the look you will see how it makes sense and then I'm gonna take Tara right there that really pretty brown matte color pop that right on the lid and I'm just gonna take that all the way around the eye from the inner corner to the outer corner just one big circle of eyeshadow I'm gonna keep it pretty matte cool tone neutral looking so I'm just gonna take that black shade in the palette just touch the the top of the lash line because this is our super densely packed brush you're gonna get a lot of product right away so I actually put way too much on there so I'm just gonna go back to moonstone again and start to blend this through and then I'm also gonna take it on the lower lash line so bring it around I'm going to use the dominique cosmetics Lottie palette and I'm gonna take caramel which is a warm tone Brown a lot of these top shades are warm tone and that's what's kind of trendy right now and just work that all the way through the crease I'm also gonna pick up some pumpkin spice right there with this eye I'm just gonna take this down halfway I'm not gonna go all the way through just going to take it on the outer lower lash line I'm gonna pick hazelnut in mocha and mix them together but I'm gonna focus this on my outer V and I'm not gonna take the dark all the way into the inner corner of the eye which actually works great for my eyes because they are a little bit more close together so I wanna keep darker shadows towards the ends of my eye they make them it just kind of balances my eye shape out a little bit better and then for the top lash line I'm gonna do kind of the same thing I'm gonna use mocha to trace out so these days we like we love our wings I'm just gonna do a shadow you can start off a little bit lighter and then build and intensify this wing to be super super dark so I'm just gonna do that I actually really like how that looks I'm gonna take a little bit of this right down on the lower - or the inner corner I just want to take vanilla cream and pop it in right there just so this area looks nice and right and oh wait I love this shade for the inner corners the inner third just all over the lid in general all right on top of your concealer it just makes everything look so bright and even it looks so pretty and then we really loved our glow these days we love our glow there's no doubt about it I was thinking of putting something right on the lid but I kind of liked it matte like that I'm gonna do macchiato on the inner corners so this shade right here which is really pretty as a highlight - now I'm gonna go in with eyeliner on this side stay pretty close to the lower lash line and just start to inch my way in there was no wings back in the day maybe a tiny tiny flick but definitely not a full-blown structured wing it was very just natural and enhancing the lashes kind of a thing and then I'm gonna take this guy right here and smudge the eyeliner back and forth I'm gonna do the same thing to the lower lash line I'm gonna smudge that downwards I'm gonna make sure that everything is just there's no harsh lines and everything's kind of messily blended out let me take the Maybelline Big Shot colossal mascara in baddest black this is the Shayla collab this is actually one of my favorite mascaras other than the LC one so I'm also gonna do that on the other I'm just putting on mascara in general because we are gonna really work those lashes today you don't move your mouth like this you don't get points so getting on to lashes on the 90s I'd I don't really think that lashes was a big things so I just got these in from house of lashes they're very big and PC just like I like them and flared out these are the house of lashes posh noir I think that I will have it listed below since we're going for the all matte very high coverage kind of look I am just gonna go with the Tarte to shape tape in light medium on the 20:18 side of the face I'm going to use the Mack water wait conceal it use a little bit around the mouth the chin Cupid's bow and right on the top so I'm gonna start with setting this side of the under eyes first because it's still kind of almost it's almost dry but it's not quite so this is a perfect time to set the under eyes with translucent powder so my favorite one to use is the Laura Mercier translucent powder you want to do this part kind of fast before it drives down all the way and this is gonna brighten prevent creasing and set the under eyes so beautifully and in pictures you're not gonna see a shadow at all at the same time with this you're not gonna have flash back when you're taking pictures which is a big plus when baking and that's kind of like a thing that we do these days we like to bake different parts of our face for the other side we're just going to set the entire face overall so for that I'm gonna take my own wander Beauty powder it's actually a powder foundation very mattifying and full coverage makeup in the 90s I noticed that there was a little bit of a light flush of color on the cheeks so I'm gonna go with the Oprah flush and bone meets a very light pink and then for this side we love to contour we love sculpted cheeks noses everything is about the contour nowadays I'm gonna add some of the banana shade right down the nose and on this side also just add a little bit right in here I'm gonna skip blush on this side and just do a bronzer I think bronzer is something that most people tend to gravitate towards rather than blush just because it's more natural-looking sunkissed and we just love that tan sunkissed look these days I'm gonna take my NARS Laguna bronzer and work that all over at this side of my face on the 20:18 side of my face we are all about the glow and I feel like we're looking a little matte at this point so I'm gonna take the Urban Decay X Kristen LeeAnn Beauty beam highlighter palette which is extremely glowy it'll definitely blind your haters so I'm just gonna run my brush through all of these shades as v-two a 38 brush take that right on top of cheeks oh my goodness we go right above the brow bone on the tip of the nose on the Cupid's bow and some do it on the chin I'm actually skipping that this year I want to intensify the Illuminati in the radiance so I'm gonna take the cover effects illuminating setting spray and only keep it on this side of my face we are done and then for this side I'm just gonna leave it Matt I think the powder did a really great job of setting it in place so I'm gonna leave it how it is and move on to the lips so for the lips on the 90 side is all about the berry Brown kind of lips so I'm gonna go with the color pop new lipstick and this is in the shade friends and it's actually so cute I want to put it all over my lip but we're gonna keep it on this side this is looking super punk rock so I'm gonna mix a little bit more of a berry tone in there this is from colour-pop as well it's number 20 it's called 27 so I'm gonna take that right on top they take these you a lip liner in the cherem have been using this a lot this is sable it's really pretty I'm just gonna line on top of that I'm gonna take the em cosmetics French nude lip and pop it right on top I'm gonna pick up this gloss in from dose of colors it's called

[Music] [Music] really gucchi game oh my leg is falling asleep hey guys welcome back to my channel so today we are doing this face right here when you see this face you know it's a vs. I am doing American verse Arabic makeup and I fell in love with the Arabic makeup I think it's so gorgeous Arabic for one is a language it's not something that is a style it's not a style but we when we google it what comes up but I am ahead and did this cut crease colorful dramatic elongated eye it's just so beautiful I love it so much I just I feel like huda beauty for a second or maybe that's just my imagination wishful thinking anyways I like this side a little bit better than this one I like I still like the American side but this one is just so it's just mmm anyways you let me know which side you like better American or Arabic makeup let me know in the comments below before we start this video because I want to read your comments I mean actually when I upload this video I'm gonna go be going through your comments to see which one you like better if you're ready to get into this video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit got a notification bow so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with this video I'm gonna start off with my brows first I feel like in America we're starting to get into more of the feathered brow look I'm gonna do feathered on the American side and I'm gonna do both brows on the other side of my face I'm gonna start off with shade number five and goof-proof from benefit and I'm just going to outline my brow and on the Arabic side make it a little bit more dramatic so I'm gonna use a heavier hand on the side Arabic brows are really full thick and very angular I'm gonna just try to make mine look as full as possible and those lines are really defined so I'm just gonna come through them with the spoolie end of the brush I'm just softly upwards and then I'm gonna go in with shade number six and precisely my brow pencil and start to fill that in even deeper now I'm just gonna lock it in with some powder I have the foolproof brow powder it's my favorite for all powder right now from benefit and I'm in the shade number five so I'm going to take the darkest shade and set every everything in place so we have our Arabic brow right here we like bold looks too here in America but I'm gonna do more of a feathered brow rather than the solid kind of look so I'm gonna go in first with this guy again because just to outline the bottom it's a little bit quicker and with this brow I'm gonna comb through it as I go because I don't want it to be too bold this is the precise of my brow pencil in number three it's a little bit lighter and start to feather in my brow hairs kind of like an a gradient from a lightest to darkest so I'm going to start here gonna go in with the powder which is the same powder that we used for this eye but I'm gonna use the darkness shade for the tail end and then the lightest shade for the front of the brow just so you guys know this is the 317 winged liner brush from zoeva and it's very narrow so that's why I like using it on the front of my brows it's like micro bleeding with makeup and you always want to leave a little bit of space in between so that it actually looks like here I'm also gonna bring out the tail in so it's not so pointy actually for both brows I'm gonna take some concealer and clean up the edge I'm gonna use my heart-shaped Cape in light neutral and then take a little bit on my hand it's just gonna make it look extra sharp clean and defined so I'm gonna work that all the way onto the lid so I can use this as a primer now we get to the brow you want to be very careful and make sure that line is straight before the American side I'm gonna use the medium shape tape not as bright prime the eye oh my leg is falling asleep oh my gosh to set my eyes I'm gonna be using the new a two-faced chocolate gold palette and I'm also going to be using the huda beauty a desert dust palette at the same time because this has more colorful matte shades and this one has more of these shimmery shades that are colorful so I'm gonna be using both of them together and the first color that I'm picking up from the gold palette is this one right here this is rolling in dough so cute and work that all over the lid just to set it in place but our eyeshadow moves around really smoothly on our eye and it doesn't like skip or get touchy we want a smooth surface to kind of move our brush freely so I'm gonna start off with the transition shade I'm gonna go in with chocolate truffle and then take my dose of colors blending brush and just start to it will work this to the crease moment I keep it pretty far out because we want to elongate our eyes on this side I'm gonna go into the crease focus it on the outer portion of our eye and really elongate the eye shape so I'm gonna take it way past the outer V I'll take a little bit more on the brush and then start to working on the outer part of the eye just intensifying that crease shade work my brush very softly in this area barely putting any pressure down on my eye and then just start to bring it in like this very lightly like a feather and then for this crease right here I'm gonna take so bougie and this is going to be our key shape but we don't usually elongate that far out we do like a nice intense crease so I'm gonna go in these little back and forth motions I'm gonna see basically right cupping right around the lid just go back and forth and then I'm gonna take this all the way and then I'm gonna use heavy pressure going right in here because we're not being super artsy with this eye you like the drama and you can use back and forth motions or little circular motions whatever works best for you and you're blending out your shadow sometimes I even like to come in at an angle use very light pressure and I feel like it really just blends your shadow out so beautifully like that so that's our first little crease shade and I built it up a second time a little bit and then I'm gonna go in with cocoa truffle the one we used on this I write down a little further down on the ID you still want that so bougie shade to peek through so we're going right underneath that for this side I'm gonna go ahead and take this really pretty matte purple shade amethyst from the huda beauty desert dusk Paulo and this is the Alexi 229 tapered blending brush so I'm going to take some of that shade the purple and focus it right on the crease and kind of the same thing we just want it to disappear into nothing right in here so I'm going to use a super light feather touch hand and then as we go further out we want to use a little bit more pressure I don't want this color to touch the lid so I'm going to try to be careful with that and just remember to take it all the way out right to the end of the tail of the brow to make it a little bit more easier on yourself you can always put tape right here and line it up to the end of the brow Z 234 brush it's just a flat shader brush so I'm gonna pick up more of the amethyst color flip my brush upwards and just line it up with the brow with a bone right on the crease bone let's line the color up right in there and then I'm gonna flip the brush over and start to work this color upwards and just softly push out the edges so it looks soft and then with the clean brush to remember where it's at I think it's this one I'm going to clean up right in here again just go over it very lightly and then for this side of the eye I'm just gonna take a darker shade this is called booed I'm gonna take this shade right here for the American side and intensify the crease with this of the American side I'm gonna do this shade right here this is called famous it's such a pretty color and just work them I'm actually going to bring in the brown and bring it right into the edges right here it gives the gold like a different look and then I just want it to kind of fade into one another and then on this eye I'm going to take some concealer I want to deepen this up with a little bit of black and this is a exact blend a 32 brush from Sigma and I'm just gonna go right underneath that purple and then I'm gonna go ahead and take the concealer and clean this up concealer is like the magic eraser I'm gonna go in with the gold this is chocolate gold this one all right here and I'm gonna work that on in the inner corner of the eye I mean the inner third of the eye I really like the Arabic style of makeup because they're not afraid to use color and they're also not afraid to do different shapes with their eyes like they'll do triple we double winged it just really elaborate beautiful makeup this pink shade oh my gosh I hope this turns out good you guys live in lavish I just really want to use this pink shade this is actually how I used to do my makeup in high school I would always have pink on the outer part of my lid and then gold on the inner part or I do happen half and I wouldn't blend it that's just my life this matte black shade right here I'm gonna pop it on the outer part of the lid and I'm gonna do an intense cat eye so here we go my eye look looks almost like a pinata but we're gonna go with it I'm gonna go ahead and make an intense wing what I like about Arabic makeup is that it's a full eye of liner bottom top tight line waterline everything is black in dramatic and that's what I love about it so let's go I'm gonna do here I'm gonna bring it out and extend it a little bit further out here gonna use the other side which is this pencil it's super super super dark black so I'm gonna go right underneath I'm gonna go all the way in and touch the end of this and then with the other side I'm gonna connect these two guys he can have a little point like a little tiny one and I kind of went outside of the line right here but it's gonna kind of work for us because we're gonna smoke this bottom parsh partion I'm gonna smoke this bottom portion out to go on the other eye and I'm gonna do a wing it's gonna be a little bit different than this dramatic cat eye wing so for this I I'm just gonna go I'm gonna follow where it ends right about there and then start to bring it in you like to be dramatic too over on this side but we don't elongate our eyes as much we're still long gating the eye we're lifting it but we're just doing a shorter version of this eye right here and then for the liner I'm actually going to take the liner just to show you guys I'm gonna go in on the waterline still take it in make it dramatic but not all the way in just about half way so we still have that lip though now that we have that I'm gonna go ahead and do the lashes for the lashes we both like dramatic lashes but the eyes are so elongated in so extra dramatic the lashes are going to be ten times that these are actually my favorite lashes these are the fair lashes from hooded beauty but I feel like these are so wide and long that they're just gonna go perfect with their gonna match this I really perfect so I'm gonna get some glue on there and pop it on on this eye I'm going to use the Lillie lashes in tease this shape is style put the the rest of the face I'm just gonna put on a foundation this is the huda beauty I already have primer on I feel like a foundation is a foundation when it comes to both styles of makeup there's nothing particularly both like full coverage don't think this side really goes for the super tan I think it's more sculpted on what I've seen anyways so I'm not gonna focus too much on getting really bronzy over here I'm gonna focus more of the bronze on this side but I just want my skin to be nice and even right now actually applies pretty good and I don't really I'm not a fan of using brushes for foundation but this one is pretty good on this side I'm going to use the tart shape tape in light neutral something a little bit brighter I'm gonna go for that I'm gonna do the Instagram kind of application on this side I'm just gonna hit right in this dark spot right here and then on the American side I'm going to take these shape tape in medium something a little bit more close to my skin tone and I'm gonna bring it down the same way the hoola bronzer to contour I'm just gonna set my under eyes with some Laura Mercier translucent powder so I'm gonna let that bake on my face while that's doing that I'm gonna do my lower lashline and then I'm gonna take this shade right here this is called amber this one I mix a little bit and pop that on the outer portion of the lower lashline I'm actually gonna bring it all the way in like that and then now I'm just gonna smudge out the black liner so that it goes a little bit lower than what it is right now we're going to contour the face or the contour my knees my Natasha - no no contour sculpting powder and I'm gonna first snatch my nose a lot of you guys ask what brushes this I think this is the morphe m57 - brush and really contour them nose bring those little lines as close if you really want your nose to be pinched you want to bring these lines in really close for the american side if you like to look super tan so I'm gonna take this Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer on my cheeks bronzed up the forehead it's gonna give us all over sunkissed glow I'm gonna take it right down here to behind the earring want everything to kind of blend into one another on this side I'm going to skip the tan I'm gonna go straight to the contour i'm gonna use this brush right here from the makeup shakti at 31 and i'm just going to hold it upwards and intensify that contour so it's gonna give us a really sculpted face I'm gonna take this blush from Oprah this is Bellini I'm gonna put this on in the American side it's a little softer I'm gonna do that with a stippling brush I'm just gonna keep it right behind the apples of the cheeks and then for the other side and you go with something a little more dramatic I'm going to use this over sheet of blush and punch everybody loves the eye light so I'm gonna take it this cover effects palette right here it's a highlighting palette and it has a ton of shades in it actually gonna mix a little bit of gold just these four right here and then for the American side I'm going to take these two shades over here and just pop that right on top we can go dramatic on both feel like I can go with any lip it's gonna go in with a nude lip this is max boldly bare I'm gonna do more of a contoured lip on this side and then I'm gonna go over with this the colour-pop ultra matte lip and little pump really little pump Gucci game I'm gonna take it all right through there and then on this side on the American side I'm going to take Nicky's nude from Micmac and just go over like that the only difference I'm going to use the huda beauty lip stroke this is in ritzy this side I'm just gonna take a gloss and go straight over this is mac lipglass in nude thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did don't forget to thumbs it up I love doing these kinds of videos if you love them too give me a

[Music] oh my gosh like a little bit of that for a flush of color oh my god it's so really I haven't even had coffee yet hey guys welcome back to my channel i am bringing you this very natural no makeup makeup look it's glowy it's your skin better it's your brows but better it's your eyes but better fresh natural walking face so I think I nailed it because it doesn't really look like I have makeup on this makeup look is super easy to do you can do this look on under five minutes for sure I definitely amp up the glow when I'm doing a no makeup look just because it makes you look so much more fresh I'm actually on my way to New York for a New York Fashion Week and I am headed to the airport I don't want to look like I just rolled out of bed but when you see this next clip it's definitely gonna look like that and it doesn't look like I have a ton of makeup on and maybe just a little gloss in mascara but it looks very fresh very pretty and clean if you guys want to see how to look fresh glowy and pretty with no makeup on then go ahead and keep watching but before we get started don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification balls to give you a part of the quoi family and without further ado let's get on with the big thing that I'm gonna do is hydrate my face that's super super important so I'm just gonna use this moisturizer from gula sheer transforming perfecting moisturizer it's very very lightweight it's perfect for daytime before I get started especially for like a no makeup look I love using this is the banana bright eye cream from LA it has like a it's like a banana shade so it's going to help brighten up the darkness under the eye and I either put this on with makeup or without makeup it still is a nice brightener in that way so I'll use it no matter if I'm wearing makeup or not anything else that you put on top is just gonna make it look brighter Elite effortless to brighten it up down my nose and on my chin and then just to add some luminosity to my skin I'm going to use the True Match Lumi glow shine this is in the shade light light glow 902 and this is more for like an all-over kind of glow so I'm just gonna put put a little bit on and just put it all over all over the face to get it all over glowy look but morning Jaden you brush your teeth I do my brows while that sits into my skin I'm gonna use this to your brow pencil I like using these pencils whenever I'm like doing something very easy or on the go or something like that because it's just easier to do the entire brow and one stuff so I'm just gonna sketch my brows in [Music] [Music] I feel like this is gonna be the easiest makeup tutorial ever because it's really minimal minimal makeup but if you want that natural kind of I'm wearing no makeup but I still look really good kind of look it really requires very few products so I'm gonna take the radiant creamy concealer in medium one custard and just focus that on the inner part of the eye I'm not gonna bring it out all the way just because you are gonna be able to tell that you have some kind of concealer if it's brightened all the way to the end of your eye I'm just gonna bring it in right to this little area where it's really dark in places that you have like redness and stuff like that I'm gonna do that to save some spots [Music] is huge is it right here I don't even know how that happened it's pretty dark for everyone around this area so I'm just going to get right there in the nose also using a Beauty Blender really helps it look very soft and just effortless looking so I'm going to use my damp Beauty Blender just to work in the concealer and on the spots where you have a lot of redness or big zits you just use a very soft hand and since I already have like natural shadows and shading on my eyelids I kind of just keep it there because it does kind of look like ass since I have a shadow on so it kind of works for me and then I'm going to take the L'Oreal Lumi glow of more drops and this is for more of like a targeted highlight so I'm going to take these are that this is the shade daybreak and I'm going to use that on the high points of my cheeks and a little goes a long way so I'm just going to keep it right in here and instead of contouring I'm just gonna do a little bit of highlighting right here so just down the bridge of the nose and a tiny bit across so that your eyes just focus on the highlighted spots of your nose you really don't need to contour if you don't want to on those no makeup kind of days and then I'm going to take this mascara right here from LC and just do a very light coat [Music] I'm gonna let my lashes dry and then I'm gonna curl them up so I'm gonna go on to my blush I'm gonna use this Stila cream blush it's a very cream blush is super natural so I'm just gonna take a little bit of that for a flush of color oh my god that's a lot and just work that into my skin I'm actually on my way to the airport right now and this is perfect because I don't want to wear ton of makeup but then again I don't want to look crazy like I just rolled out of bed so it just makes you look fresh and awake and just naturally pretty and then for the lips I'm using L'Oreal color riche shine and this is in the shade glossy fun I love this on my lips it feels so so nice and comfortable it goes on like a bomb but it has such a high shine that it looks like a gloss perfect for those no makeup days and it's very hydrating so that is it it's very natural super easy you can do this in under five minutes and now I'm just gonna go do my hair cuz it's looking kind of crazy a tip for you guys if you want to get out the door quick and you don't want your hair to look like a mess and it's not long enough go back in my head it's not

I feel like posh spice right now anybody get those vibes hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I am doing a lazy super lazy makeup routine this is when you don't feel like doing anything like you literally just want to lay on the couch all day maybe go to lunch possibly you don't want to look like how you woke up basically that's me when I'm not filming so many tips for you guys on this look because I think it's so important to still look like you tried but I mean you don't have to use a ton of makeup you don't have to go through these crazy amounts of steps you don't have to bake you don't have to foundation it powder it prime it you don't have to do all those things if you're if you're feeling lazy really important to multi-purpose whatever you have bronzers and highlights you can multi-purpose all day all night you don't need a ton of products you really really don't this is literally a two-minute I can honestly do this makeup in two minutes but because I'm talking through it it's a little bit longer so if I wasn't talking through and explaining why I use this and how to use it and giving you tips and tricks this video would literally be honestly maybe even one minute I could do this look in one minute I have confidence woo that's a good challenge it makes you look fresh like you tried you just look put together and you didn't even really do much or put much on this is something that I do every time I don't feel like waking up but I have to wake up I have to do things I have to take Jayden to school I have to go to the grocery store I have to see people and I want people to see me like crazy if you want to learn some tips and tricks on how to do your makeup on a very lazy very I'm not trying to have anything to do with my life today kind of day but still look put together then keep watching and don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit got notification bells they give you part of the quad family come on let's say it together quad family and without further ado let's get on with this lazy tutorial on a lazy day I'm not gonna grab pomade or powder or anything like that I'm gonna grab a brow pencil so I have the Anastasia brow Wiz in soft brown I'm going to fill in my brows and then groom them up and I'll be done I sketch my brows back and forth like this and I try to focus on the areas where it's really sparse so I'm recreating hmmm and I'll just go back and forth these quick little motions bring it all the way to the front now if you use a light hand and you're just sketching their brows really quick the frame your brow won't get as harsh and then I'll just clean it up with a spoolie try to ignore this huge set going on right on my brow bone it's so annoying it won't go away and it's huge so we're just gonna try to ignore it even though I just said it for the rest of the face I would skip on foundation completely skip on doing all the extra stuff of foundation concealer primer contour setting it I wouldn't do any of that all I would do is put on something that's going to protect your skin even it out do all of those things basically on one the glam routine for my face is in this bottle right here it's the CC cream from our boria it'll also cover imperfections like breakouts blemishes and it evens out your skin texture so it makes your skin look flawless and it's not even a foundation it's a CC cream it comes out white so if you put it on your hand it kind of looks like with that supposed to adapt to your skin tone so it comes out white at first like this and then I'm just gonna dot it around where I want to put it basically all over my face so I'm gonna work that in with my finger you can use a Beauty Blender for this that I like to use my finger because I just like the way it feels it even helps with my under-eye circles around the mouth honestly this is the best BB CC cream I have ever tried in my entire life I don't even like BB or CC creams to be honest because I feel like they do nothing for my face and you know I have to have my coverage at some some kind of coverage if I'm not using a foundation and then I'm just gonna use a concealer but then I found this and I gave it a chance and I'm like I love it I'm a believer I can actually add some concealer so I'm going to add a little bit of tart medium concealer just a little bit in the corners just blend it in with a little beauty blender and I'm actually gonna cover this little guy up too because he is really really red I was using light/medium under my eyes but lately I've been liking the more toned down under-eye brightening technique because I just feel like it looks a little more natural and I like the way it just blends into the rest of my skin more seamless than as a lighter under-eye so that is it for the face and now I'm gonna move on I'm gonna let that dry because I'm not gonna set this I know that sounds really weird it works trust me the only thing I'll do is spritz a little bit of tachi dewy skin mist throughout the day and it'll keep it fresh and dewy looking and trust me your coverage will stay there for the eyes it's so freakin simple it's not even funny you can use any bronzer that you want any favorite bronzer that you have I'm using balm each from the balm and it's called warm it up I'm gonna take this on my cheeks on my eyes and this is basically going to define to give us a soft contour add some warmth to our face and it's gonna do so many things for our eyes this is a definite multi-purpose staple for a lazy day for a girl on the go it does everything I'm gonna grab an eyeshadow brush if you're feeling super extra lazy you can use your finger and just dab it on your eyelid but I'm gonna use a brush since they're right here I literally all I have to do is stretch my arm out and grab so it's okay I'm gonna put it all over my lid and I actually didn't put any concealer on my natural lid because I already have like a little bit of hyperpigmentation that I don't mind it kind of works for me it gives me some type of dimension so I naturally have that work it all the way into the crease fluffier brush to blend out the edges that's basically it for the eyes I'm literally not going to touch anything else on my eyelids except for the mascara which is the most important part to make your eyes look awake you need a good mascara my favorite mascara to use my go-to is the Maybelline colossal Big Shot makeup Shayla color this is baddest black and it is so dark I like the original formula but I like this particular black one from Shayla because a little bit drier of a formula at least the tube that I have is a little bit more dry holds the curl it doesn't weigh your lashes down have a really wet formula it's gonna make your lashes like fall pack on a ton of mascara try not to clump it up and that's all we're gonna do and that's gonna be it see when I put it on it's not super shiny it literally just grabs each lash pulls it out curls it up but you gotta wiggle right in between and I like to brush my lashes in the wrong direction so it picks up more volume right and then left and I wiggle up and it really stretches and pulls your lashes out you see that and because it's a dry formula it's gonna stay and that's all I'm gonna do to my eyes I'm actually gonna curl my lashes but I'm gonna have them dry so while they dry up I'm going to do the rest of my face which is gonna be super simple I feel like this is gonna go by so quick that I can't believe this is even a tutorial bronzers your best friend because it is dual purpose so what I'm gonna do right now is add some definition to my cheeks my nose my forehead it's basically like contour blush bronze all in one so I'm gonna take this morphe angled brush right here and I'm going to work that on my cheeks because I'm not putting powder all over the face it gives your skin a fresh look I like it can be lazy and still look good you don't have to have that many stocks I promise and then if you want to blend out the shadow if you want to you can go go ahead and hit it right on the lid nose under the chin so now that our face is bronze we have some color on our face we look like we tried I'm gonna go ahead and put on a highlight that's gonna really make it look like we tried the highlight I just got this new highlight in from Oprah this is one of the Nicki collab highlights I'm very excited to use it i swatched it it is literally just like the name says Global's this is the Global's highlighter it is beautiful first of all second of all right I feel like I'm the worst watcher but literally look how beautiful that is this on my cheeks I'm so excited so with this I'm just going to what though so bright it is so blinding I'm gonna take it right above my brows the nose its boat okay I think I went a little too far with the nose calm it down a little bit around there and that actually want to put it in my inner corners too when you get makeup that just makes you want to do your makeup this glow Nikki know you can literally blind somebody with this highlight you got to be careful I'll be very careful now for the lips I want something that is going to hydrate give me a little bit of color and make sure that my lips don't look crusty you know just know crustiness so I'm gonna take this h2o beauty Oh wases l-bomb and this is in the shade rose petal so it has a little bit of color I'm gonna put some on the back of my hand it looks like so and I'm just gonna take that right on my lips this gives your lips a little bit of a pink tint it moisturizes them and that's all you need honestly something that does two things in one like I don't want a matte lip I don't want a gloss I just want something that's gonna hydrate my lips and have a little bit of a color to them now that my eyelashes are dry I'm gonna go in and curl them and I'll be done another tip is if you're feeling lazy the easiest way to look put together is straightening your hair it's so easy you don't have to try he literally just straighten it that's all I did for this video thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it give it a big thumbs up also I have some videos hanging

hey guys welcome back to my channel it is 2018 we are living in 2018 now can you believe that years just go by so fast but I wanted to start this video off with just me barefaced do my makeup with you guys but this video isn't much about makeup it's more just about reflecting back on 2017 and talking to you guys and just my plans for what's coming up this year and just a little heart to heart so I decided to do things a little different this time and start with no makeup at all not even the brows I am bald right now I was like this is not gonna be about makeup and then I'm gonna start talking about makeup I already know myself so I'm gonna start off with primer I'm using the Smashbox one the one it's supposed to help with dark spots so I'm just gonna focus that under my eyes but looking back on 2017 I had some really memorable moments and I definitely grew as a person each year you learn something new about yourself and you grow and you do better sure last year I learned a few things I'm going to use the professional pearl primer it's a new primer from benefit I haven't really tried it until right now but it has like a soft pink look to it I'm gonna put that on my nose I'm also gonna put it like right in here and right in the middle of my forehead did some fun collaborations on my channel with some friends that I got a little bit closer to this year I'm not somebody that actually opens up to everybody so to open up to someone is really big for me I'm just a very private person in that way especially with my family and stuff like that so opening up to people was a huge thing for me last year and how to grab a coffee wait I said you were the good kind of fat this is my favorite coffee mug the perfect amount of coffee and at the same time it's just my favorite things in life are on this cup this is my first time that I did my brows with the just powder and not a pencil I love how they just came out anyways I am mixing latte and almond together be a tan this weekend and my body is a completely different color than my face so we are going to mix these two guys together and you really don't need much of this foundation because it covers your whole entire face with just one drop do you see the coverage basically creating a new layer of skin on my face and I kind of love it like I was saying I'm keep things to myself and my family so to open up just just somebody friend wise is it's pretty huge for me so I did that got let down and I just want to let you guys know that if you ever open up to somebody and you feel like you shouldn't have done that don't let that messed up your relationships after that incident because you can be missing out on some amazing people after that happened I didn't let that situation affect me in a negative way I opened up to some amazing people and I've met some super motivating selfless kind-hearted people and I'm very very happy and who have gotten close to this year or last year and I've even done some collaborations on my channel last year I did one with Sylvia Ghani Chloe Morello Karen I was so huge I love her so much Krispy and Jake he's such a cute little thing I didn't let with that situation you know change who I was I really just you know you're a little bit more cautious but don't let situations like that completely ruin future relationships that can be amazing when we went to Necker Island with benefit I was Richard Branson's private island and we had the whole island to ourselves ooh that was that was pretty epic we went on to Korea with Arab Orion which is a skincare brand I have my most favorite BB cream in the world and we went to Big Bear I saw snow for the first time with my family I went to the ariana grande concert with my dear friend heart that's someone that I have known since I moved here we clicked and we just stayed friends through the entire time and the most genuine down-to-earth kind soul I love her with all my heart we always say to each other every time we we leave each other it's like we never left obviously won't communicate their Instagram but actually see each other because we're always so busy it's like we never left so I love her her and aunt I love him so so much and they've been the same since I met them and they're amazing and then I went to France twice I went to can't Cannes Cannes oh my god I'm gonna get somebody's gonna say something about the way I'm saying that I got a tummy tuck this year completely changed my confidence in my body because as you guys know I'm a mom and you have a baby I'm telling you it does things no matter what you do working out cannot change it so I got rid of my stretch marks and my extra skin and I felt so good afterwards and went to Mexico and I christed a picture in a bikini like stand in front of you in a bikini in front of anyone like I wouldn't care and that's something that I couldn't do before so that was really huge for me last year super huge big thanks to dr. Barrett I went on a trip with my mom this year which was so cool Tarte invited influencers and their mothers to come along with them to kind of get the whole feel of what a trip is like like an influencer trip is life they got the makeup they got everything that we would get and it was so amazing my mom is like in heaven she has so many heart-shaped cake concealers she's good for life like she's by the way this foundation is so full coverage you don't even need concealer it is covering my entire life secrets right now I just if they're gone I don't even know where they went so I'm gonna go into my eyes I'm gonna use my friend my friend Patrick came out with his own collaboration with Matt oh so freaking amazing and I have the box here still isn't this crazy this is the most beautiful package I've ever seen from a brand it's so cool and the inside its I already took everything out because I've already used to stuff a bunch of times but this is the inside and there goes this pretty face so amazing things have happened for my friends as well this year so I'm gonna be using his eyeshadow palette this is actually like using both of them this is glam AF and then this one is gold gutter I'm going to start off by using the shade right here just to even out the lid you want to surround yourself with people that going after their dreams and pushing you and themselves and just people around that I take this shade right here from goal gutter and I also take this shade down here from glam ETF mix them together in my crease to give us some duck boba is laid out like slat like a rug and right in front of me it's so cute I got a really cool opportunity to collaborate with a brand I was very excited about finally a brand that I really wanted to collaborate with that I really loved but it just couldn't happen because my brand was coming out to this month which I'm gonna update you guys more on in just a bit and now I'm taking this brown color right here from the gold gutter palette I think this year I really got to connect with my uncle that I have never really had a chance to do that with because he's always lived out of the country on the country sometimes out of the country out of this state but once I moved to LA he lived in California now he's in Mexico but we still get to talking to Munich eight and that way and we're just so much closer now we went to visit him this year and his family and she's been down here a bunch of times and I just can't even explain to you how amazing it is to have I'm getting emotional right now so weird it's cool to finally connect with him it was just nice to have to get close to him and they'll be moving soon this year so that is something I'm very excited about all of my family is in Houston my mom and grandma my other uncles everybody's in Houston so it's nice to have someone out here that is family I mean of course my son my husband but it's cool to have other people too one person that I always went to this year that was my neighbor who's Patrick he was he's always like been there for every accomplishment and birthday to give me flowers or something just just to be a friend and I love him for that I probably don't post about a lot of this stuff I keep my personal life and I don't make it public I just want to enjoy it so you guys probably don't see everyone who I hang out with I mean I wish I was a little bit more open in that aspect but I think it's just a part of who I am it would be nice to kind of work on that this year but I decided not to make a new year's resolution to myself so I decided for myself it doesn't probably works for you guys but it does not work for me so if you're anything like me if I have a goal I'm just gonna try to work harder towards it I don't want to say it I'm just gonna do it I'm gonna show myself better than I can tell myself I took my first picture with my son last year in a very long time because I didn't put my son on any of my social medias I actually when I first started I put him on quite a bit I'm gonna be using these the darkest shades in both palettes now he is a huge motivation and I want to be a role model for him I am Ola model for him and his basically his life coach so I want to be the best that I can be so I can show him that he can do the same so actually Jaden's gonna be 10 this month which is exciting a lot of exciting things happening this month my brand is launching this month finally I have been teasing it to you guys sneak peeking it to you guys for a while cuz it's so exciting I just wanted to get it out there like but I decided not to do that until it is very close and it is very close so it's coming up towards the end of the month I will be launching domini cosmetics which is my only cosmetic line that I'm creating a passion project for me so I'm nerv sighted I think that's the best way to explain it it's all of that in one thing we've worked so hard on the formula and getting it right and the colors and the names and ready to make this brand a success and to get it out to you guys and for you guys to enjoy it bring it into your life and make it a part of your daily routine as well you guys know I love coffee it's right here I every day every night it's really bad actually it's a very important part of my day benefit held a brow search and I was a coach it was for Coach earth who was me Amanda and seeing Patrick's and James Charles and it was the funnest trip it was so beautiful there on Lake Tahoe it made me want to go back and have Christmas but you know we were moving through Christmas so that didn't happen we actually had Christmas for the first time here but we were moving and working and moving and trying to get all the equipment in here and I know you guys see just this background but there's just like so much around me above me and beside me below me I wonder if he could see in my eye my people like that that Cesar lighting my entire face he's so good I'm so thankful for him Mozza just mentioned me moved but we moved into a house like our first I never thought I was gonna be able to move into a house in LA I remember moving here and I moved into a one-bedroom and I stayed in this same apartment complex second year I was in a two-bedroom the Nok zeroes in third three-bedroom and then we moved to this other place every year I've done better with my channel and now we're in a house which is amazing the house I'm running but it's a house you know and hopefully praying to God I do that once we have launched his brand I am able to actually customize my own house and but for now we have this really beautiful cozy home and a large space to work in I have so much space to work out in it's not even funny I am now doing so many different workouts because of the space that I have it's so amazing I've been doing Blogilates every day every morning I fellow her workouts and I also just started doing hip hop dance workout so much fun to do the dance but Innis workouts you know if you guys want to start doing it or want to know it was somebody to follow I think it's a fire marshal and Blogilates to tone up you can actually do the moves you know they're not like too complicated you will sweat like my whole face is beet red by the time I'm done like I feel like I've just worked out at a gym and I'm just using my own body weight now I'm gonna add actually I saw this beautiful palette from Tarte it's this one right here I'm gonna take this shade right here and pop it on to my inner third I feel like I summed up everything that I went through this year so quick it all came out at one no I don't know what I wasn't talking about I'm gonna use the Patrick's powder and lastly for the lips this is the combo that I've been loving lately and I'm not just using it because this is literally my favorite combo just saying that because it's my friends products I like the mahogany from the Patrick Starr collection as the liner so I'll line my lips first and then I'm gonna take she better work lipstick and then I mixed in more mahogany on the outer corners and then I take my eye lips out IX color pop the lip gloss and I stole it and it is such a beautiful gloss it's a pink with the gold flecks in it put it in the Sun and just twist around it is so gorgeous and I put that right on the center of my lips so you get that golden shine but it has a little bit of the pink it's glossy I love it and that's it that is the completed look and that is the end of my chitchat talk with you guys oh my gosh I can't believe I almost forgot to say this one other thing that happened last year was we created the quad family which every flake all the new subscribers that I get I always have that question what is the quad family when did this come about what does that even mean this is not your quad I know that I know all of that quad a family got started and I'm gonna say this only once in this video we created the quad family last year I wanted to start a notification squad when I first announced that was like don't forget to click the Bell to be a part of a notification squad I accidentally said notification quad because I mean the best speaker ever and I meant to say squad and then I was like I made a joke about it being like four of us and you guys kind of went with it and liked it and kept bringing it up and saying quad so I was like you know what I'm just gonna call it the quad family so I was seeing quad family for a while but together we are stronger and that's what I was thinking in my head putting it all together its quad family but it means together we're strong and that's how I got started that was it I hope you guys that didn't know now you know the whole meaning behind the quad family and I love them the Clark family is actually very strong and they're very proud and I honestly think we need some t-shirts but pretty much at the end of the video thank you guys for watching I

further ado let's get on with a video and my voice is kind of going out before I put on any primary foundation or any creams in my face I'm gonna do my brows so that the pencil adheres to my skin better so I'm using the precisely my brow pencil from benefit in number 5 we are just going to fill in the brows make the brows look snatched this is one of the easiest pencils to do your brows with it's so quick it's so fast it's precise you can fill in brush through so friggin easy to do your brows I love this brow pencil brows are done now that we have our brows on I'm gonna do my eyes I still have lash glue that I cannot take out from my the last time I had makeup on which is like two days ago that's because I'm using the House of lashes lash glue and that thing does not get out of your eyes if I use that glue I will always have residue throughout my lashes and it's just so hard to take away so I'm gonna put on some concealer on my eyes as a base this is our primer and cover up those veins I'm using that naked skin from Urban Decay dirty oh my god this thing is so freakin dirty I will be right now okay now that I have my clean Beauty Blender with me I'm gonna go ahead and work that into my eyes this thing has been through so much traveling it is not funny to sip my I am pleased to a bone color on the lid so I'm gonna be using the TARDIS Pro palette today first I'm gonna take innocent and just wash that through the crease back in four I'm gonna take a little bit of whimsy and go straight through the crease and I even want to take a yellow and I want to run that through their yellow kylie vacation palette has a yellow in it so I'm gonna take this yellow right here and then I'm gonna run it through the crease I feel like this look is calling yellows name just to blend everything out then it takes away from it being so red or warm I was on Pinterest and I was looking up fall makeup looks just to get inspired and I saw Shay Mitchell with this beautiful look and I don't know if this is yellow or what it is but I want a yellow on my eye I'm definitely feeling like the mustard needs to happen so now that we have that crease I'm gonna add edgy on the lid all the way up into the crease so I'm going to start right at the bottom of the one right here and then just Pat it all the way through until I work it up into the crease okay so I'm gonna start off with a light layer of this brown and then I'm gonna deepen it up as we go I'm gonna layer on smoked in drama I'm just gonna dip my brush into both of these and layer it right on top I just did 100 layers of eyeshadow and this is what I got for some reason it's a little bit on the patchy son I'm not gonna lie but it's okay we can make it work I'm actually not gonna put on a brow bone color just because I see I like the way this looks for now who knows if I might change my mind a little whiter but I'm gonna go ahead and do my eyeliner so the eyeliner that I'm using is from Kat Von D this is the inked liner the waterproof liquid liner in trooper I'm gonna go ahead and do a cat eye y'all ready for this doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo okay my door it's official if you're having trouble with your wing being lopsided eyeliner wings will never be lopsided if you just drag them out to the ends of your eyebrows unless your eyebrows are lopsided then that's a different story all right it's time to get some mascara on our lashes so I'm going to take the roller lash from benefit and pop that onto my lashes just right through there really quick wiggle wiggle try it out like five different lashes and the lashes that work for me or the ones that I use they're just my trusty they go with everything go lashes that I'm using today is from Lily lashes the I know I just took this one off these are the Miami lashes and I just I just love them they're fluffy they're curled they have enough hair but not too much you can see the eye shadow look it's just beautiful there's no lash glue on these lashes just I'm gonna use this primer right here from Smashbox because they're new primer the photo finish primer Iser it's a primer and a moisturizer in one and it does miracles if you have dry skin so my skin is pretty dry work it into my hands and then work it into my action the foundation I'm using is from Too Faced this is the peach perfect comfort matte foundation I haven't used one of these brushes in a very long time but this is the artiste brush and I'm going to use that to put on my foundation today I like the peaches and cream collection but I like it separately I don't like it all together because I think it's too much peach scent but I love the fact that this smells like peach and it's 14 hour wear and full coverage so many good things about this for my concealer I'm going to

literally could not stand these little things I feel like they were just so annoying and did nothing and now I find them so useful I'm just like $18.00 for two of these little tiny things that don't

[Music] everybody get your pen and pencils out we are doing an eyebrow class today hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna show you guys how to get your brows in shape I actually have made so many freaking mistakes and I changed my brow shape literally every other week it depends on which way my brows feel like going that day brows take such a long time I have gotten so many requests to do this video I'm gonna show you all the do's and don'ts that I feel that I've learned throughout the years brows are hard brows are just a tricky thing for a lot of us so we are gonna go through it I'm gonna show you some do's and don'ts keep doing what you love doing but if you notice some of the don'ts that you are doing then maybe try the do side and I think that your brow is gonna look so good some of you guys may just do all the dues some of you guys made you all the donuts let me know below how many dudes versus the domes that you do because sometimes I still do the don'ts so if you want to learn how to get your brows on fleek then don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video let's do our brows don't number one brushing your eyebrow hair in the wrong direction if you brush this way which is something that I did all the time it lays your hairs straight down in the direction that they should go but then they always fall downwards especially the tail end for me so what you do want to use is a clear brow gel for the do side I'm gonna be using the benefit Bravo conditioning primer this is one of my favorite favorite clear brow gels to use it comes in this little tube like this it has these little ridges right here that just pull and pick up every strand of hair so I just take out a little bit I tap it on my hand and then I work it into all of the little ridges and then what I do is I brush upward it makes your brows look fuller does your brow more texture and helps you create those fine natural hair strokes they're so easy to fill in when they're going straight up number two do not use the wrong brush now you're thinking if it says brow brush then I can't be using the wrong brush because it says bravura but actually there's so many brow brow brushes out there that are way too thick for your brows I'm gonna give you an example of this brow brush right here this is the one of the don't brushes and I say that because it looks great this way but when I turn it on its side look how thick this brushes you are gonna get the thickest lines in your brows I'm brushing this way and I'm also gonna brush upwards you see that this is actually a brow brush too thick I don't recommend thick brushes like this they just don't really do much for you they actually make it easier for you to mess up and get way too much product on your brow so this thick brow brush is about on the deuce side I am using a thin narrow brush now this is actually not a brow brush this is a winged liner brush this is one that I recently found and absolutely love and you'll notice that a lot of winged liner brushes are amazing for your brows this is why if I turn it on its side it literally disappears it creates the most fine lines super super thin little brow hair strokes and it works amazing and I think dose of colors just gets it because even though they call it a winged liner brush it still has a nice spoolie at the bottom so you can comb through your brow hairs this is the supposed brow brush right here and compare it to this winged liner brush how crazy is a new middle this do not use something that is way too dark for your hair you don't want to go in with a super dark color and then BAM you have Sharpie eyebrows if your eyeliner is the same color as your brow color we need to start over again instead what you want to do is either use a pencil like this it depends on the mood I'm in that day I'll either use a pencil this one is from honest hacia the in soft brown or I'll use just a powder for those of you who don't want to use too many products and you just want to kind of a quick brow the brow pencils are the easiest because it's just like a one-step process and you're done the brow powder does allow you to have more of a natural looking brow so that's why I kind of like using that one first so what I'll do is I'll use a product that is two shades lighter than my natural hair color wet-and-wild ultimate brow kit you guys see me use this all the time I'm just gonna take this shade right here mix in a little bit of that dark shade just a little just literally a tap like that number four you don't want to start at the very front of your brow and create this box the box is not our friend I have a really long brow hairs in the front so it's very easy to create that box to be honest and it's very hard not to create the box but what you want to do is start in the arch and then lightly feather back the strokes to the tail end once we're finished then we can move up to this guy right here the number five don't is don't draw a fluid line starting from the very front of your brow all the way to the tail end you want to go in with a very light hand and use feather like strokes always want to feather in your brows because this is gonna give you the most natural look if you do one fluid line you are going to have Sharpie eyebrows a little bit harder to come back from and you end up just looking way too or the next don't is carving out your brows I'm a fan of it I think it looks clean and beautiful but there is a certain shade that you should be using so you don't want to use something like this this is super bright white so you don't want to do that what you want to do is use a shade that is similar to your under-eye concealer I like a pretty bright under-eye and that's fine if you go a few shades lighter than that or the bottom half of the brow if you're one of those people that like a little bit more drama to your brows and you want to carve out the top as well I would go with a darker shade of concealer this is medium something that's very similar to your foundation if you're one of those people that like to carve out the tops of your brows but if you want to do the bottom you can get away with using your normal under-eye concealer make sure that it isn't is bright make sure you go through your brows with a spoolie so that you don't have any patchy spots and you don't have any really harsh parts of your brow that you don't want there I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did give it a big thumbs up and let me know below what do's and don'ts you are currently doing I want to know I am Josi I'm obsessed with you guys and I read all your comments so let me know in the comments below and if you missed some other videos they're gonna be over to the side and check them out before you guys go I want to let you know there's only one of you and you are very

if there's lipstick on my teeth just ignore it I'm just gonna keep talking hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I decided to do this party glam look right here I feel like I needed glitter in my life I feel like I need a little bit of party a little bit of glitter without actually having to go to a party so I put the party on my face and created this look for you guys I really I was just like honestly I was dreaming about purple and bronze glitter like glitter in some way shape or form on my lids like I wanted this look so bad I dreamt about it I'm going to be trying out some new concealers today these are from NARS these are the new NARS soft matte complete concealers and they are very full coverage I highlighted I contoured I did a lot with these this is going to be on my favorites list just to let you know right now these are very very good these are the shades I used right here this one is custard this one is canal and then this last one is called dark 3 dark coffee this is what I used to contour my face today seven-thirty I really like them they're full coverage very lightweight it feels like your skin but better so I'm gonna go ahead and show you how I got this look on my face right now but first what do you got to do be sure to subscribe to my channel and hit the notification bell before you leave because you want to be a part of my notification quad we are very cool over here in the quad family anyways if you want to learn how to get this look then keep watching I already primed my face I'm going to go ahead and put on some foundation to my skin and today I'm going to be using the Estee Lauder Double Wear this is a new one so it's very fresh I'm very excited because it's clean blend it out with my Beauty Blender first they're gonna make some dots and then we'll blend it up I actually did a video that is coming up very soon with Karen and I love study she did this technique where she used concealer to draw a map out her brows first and then went in with a brow powder so I'm going to do that and try that out and see how it works for me today so I'm going to take one of the new NARS soft matte complete concealers and this was in the shade light 2.75 Pannell and this is one of those full full coverage concealers this is the kind of concealer I like to use to clean up my brows and just to make everything look flawless and clean so I'm just going to take this brush right here and I'm gonna map out my brows first see how this works for me Wow so that's how much brow I actually need on my face in this concealer blends out so easy okay so I'm just going to go in with this little brush right here shave and start to fill in my brows [Music] and this brushing is so tiny almost disappears because it's so narrow at the end it's really really good it's super precise I really like it you guys I'm doing this from now on this is so helpful I'm just going to cover up a very lightly underneath the inner corners I'm going to use the radiant creamy concealer from NARS and this is in macadamia medium 1.5 I'm going to use that and it's just going to do a very light coverage and I'm going to go back in and use contour and a heavier concealer once everything is done on the eyes this is just doing a very light conceal for us and it just brightens up this area so nicely so I'm just going to use that with my finger just work it in there I'm going to go ahead and use the shade light 2.75 the one I used on my brows and I'm going to use this as a primer all over my lids and just make sure that the lid is in even color and this is just going to create a really nice even base for the shadows I'm already so in love with this concealer oh my god I love it so loud I'm gonna go ahead and jump into the eyeshadow for the eyeshadow I'm going to take my morphe what is this 35n palette for somebody's this shade right here just to set the eyes all over it's going to do the same thing that you would do for your face it's going to set the creams in place it's also going to make a really smooth canvas for anything that goes on top of it so it's going to be able to blend so smooth especially with this really nice concealer underneath it just makes everything look even better I'm going to go in with this shade right here I'm going to take that on the inner and outer part of the eye I want this to be in a very specific precise area so I'm going to use a smaller brush for this and I'm just going to keep building up the color flicking it outwards I'm going to start to put it on the inner part of the outer the inner part you have the inner part of the eye sort of flick it outwards and work it up into that inner crease I feel like you just have a lot more control over the brush in the shadow and how how you really want it so just using a smaller densely-packed brush is just a lot easier okay so now I'm going to go ahead and take this purple shade right here though I'm going to go right on top of the eyeshadow and just work it in there so I want to take the eyeshadow up and out so I feel like the purples on there pretty light and airy and I'm going to take this Brown that's right in the center and I'm going to connect the two into the crease so I'm going to connect the crease right here just bring it through through there okay so I'm going to use a deeper purple so I'm going to take this make a peak shadow in curfew it's just a really nice matte purple shade and then I'm just going to work that on the inner and outer part and just build up the intensity of the purple so I'm going to do a little sure circular motions okay so I'm going to go ahead and take this shade right here it's like an orange burnt orange color I'm going to go ahead and take that on my M 506 brush so I'm going to put it right through the crease it's going to give the eyeshadow like a glowing effect now I'm going to go back with the brush that we had curfew on and all those Purple's I'm going to take it straight through the crease so just deepens up the crease a bit more so what I'm going to do now is pop on a bronzy glittery shade to the center of my lid I'm going to first use the dose of colors ideal duo loose and primer this is in the shade shale it's like a cream it's a little base for your shadow okay so I'm going to go ahead and pop that on with a morphe m43 two brush I'll pop that onto the center of the lid and this is just going to be our base until this is going to be a really nice base because it has like a tacky feel to it so now I'm going to go ahead and take the pigment which is on this side it's a really really pretty pigment looks like that I want a little bit more drama to the center of my lid so I'm going to add a glitter so now I'm going to take this adhesive this is a glitter adhesive from violet balls I'm just going to lightly Pat that on to the center then I'm going to take this NYX glitter face and body glitter it's really pretty bronzy shade so then I'm going to move on to my mascara I'm going to use this one from Maybelline so I'm gonna go ahead and take these lashes from house of lashes and smoky Muse eyelash glue lately this is from thrive cosmetics it's really good like it will not budge it might hurt a little when you try to take it off to be honest but honestly I don't mind because it's worth it so now I'm going to get to concealing and contouring for that I'm going to use these NARS soft matte complete concealers and there's 16 different shades so you can contour highlight whatever shade range your skin tone is naturally you can definitely find a concealer in your shade so I'm going to use a few different ones for something to conceal to do that I'm use medium one Kuster I'm going to go ahead and work that down and out okay yes this is definitely going to be full coverage but it does feel very soft and light on this skin which is nice and I'm just gonna work it into my skin with my finger just to warm it up blend into the skin so nice and easy and it doesn't look cakey at all it looks like your skin I like how this is full coverage but it still looks very natural and still looks like my skin but it covered up my dark circles so good I'm a really impressed with this concealer because it literally went melted into my skin and it's like my skin like you can't detect that I have concealer on right now I think I love it guys we're so excited I found a new good feeler so I'm gonna go ahead and use dark coffee for my contour shade I'm going to start right here by my cheekbones and my hairline and I'm just gonna sit down it blends into your skin so easy it's super creamy nose is snatched okay so now I'm just going to bake my under eyes I'm going to take this cover effects from system powder work my Beauty Blender in there and here start at the corner bring it over and this is just so it doesn't crease so I'm just going to let that sit for a little bit and while that's working there I'm going to do my lower lash line so I'm going to go ahead and take that shade that we used earlier in our crease load up my brush and start to work that on the lower lash line and just having that translucent powder there is going to make doing anything on top of it super easy and make it look really full lawless okay now that we have that lightly shaded underneath I'm going to take a more densely packed brush this is the disc colors flat definer and really just pack in that purple color I want the lashes to stand out so I'm going to go ahead and pack on the purple I'm actually just going to leave it right in there I'm not going to take it all the way in I'm going to go back in with that brush we used with the Lauren g brown shade I'm going to go ahead and go underneath just to buff out the edges here I think we're pretty good on the eyes I'm just going to wipe off the excess powder that I have going on right here and now I'm going to move on to the bronze room and add some warmth to my face I'm going to take this Milani bronzer XL all blow I'm going to go ahead and buff that into my skin just like on the outer perimeter to give our skin some warm so I'm going to use these blushes right here from their from a morphe blush palette and I'm going to take this shade in the corner and a little bit of this one I'm going to bring it up along the temple do the same thing on this side the highlight I'm going to use this press pigment it from morphe it's the mimosa Sunday I thought it would be really pretty along the cheeks and I'm just going to take some of that and pop it like it just be pretty to pop on right on the art I just blend it out with my finger just to soften it up a little bit and then on the lips I'm just going to take this nude lip liner from Maybelline it's called magnetic mauve I'm going to take this pure Velvet Matte lip color in the shade innocent little bit darker than I was expecting and I'm going to go over the top with the Geoffrey stars I'm nude I end up putting like

line her brushes are so freakin cute this marble right here is so so pretty it's the number 205 so I'm gonna take that and I'm gonna pop it all over the lid starting at the base of the eye and then working my way up all the way into that crease definitely don't to walk around looking like that so I'm gonna soften up the edges with a blending brush this is one of my favorite ones this is from dose of colors it's just called blending and I'm just gonna soften up that edge so for the next color I'm gonna go into the persona identity palette I'm gonna go ahead and take fearless this deep dark brown and I'm gonna line my lid right here okay so next I'm going to coat my lashes with some mascara and this mascara is from eiko it's the black magic mascara I'm gonna go ahead and just do a few coats on my lashes I'm gonna put on these beautiful lashes I am obsessed with these lashes like no joke this is what it looks like a close or long they're flirty PC everything I want in a lash this is the Natalie lash from Amy June lashes they are so pretty so now I'm gonna go ahead and work on my face I'm gonna use the Aurora Pro coverup concealer and balmy beige and I'm gonna cover my under-eye circles I'm still gonna work on the lower lash line but I want to kind of cover up this area before I go any further with that so I'm just gonna take it right on the inner corners and I'm also gonna use this as a highlight if you're not putting lashes on you can definitely do this under ten minutes it's so easy there's not very many step now I'm gonna go ahead and use some just around my mouth because it does look a little dark around here so I'm just gonna use it right there and then some right on that zit right there so we're just gonna put a little dot there and the way that you work with zits like this you don't want to focus on patting right on the zit you want to go right underneath it and then softly just kind of go over the area with a very light pressure okay so now that we have the under eyes covered I'm gonna go ahead and work on the lower lash line I'm gonna take the same shadow that we have on the top and layer it right on the bottom but I'm gonna start off with a base a little transition shade and then I'm gonna go ahead and layer this shade right here right on top of that matte transition shade we use the next shade I'm gonna use for defining the lower lash line is this dark brown right here and it focused that all around a little lower lash lines so we're going to go right under me and then I'm blend it out I'm going to use this dose of colors shader brush right here it's kind of flat but it has a little bit of a fluff to it so it's gonna help with softening those edges out so for the inner waterline I'm going to take this nude liner from Tarte it's called fake awake it's a a highlighter so I'm gonna take that and line up the waterline to make it nice and bright and then I'm going to take the mascara wheezed earlier on the bottom lashes and for the contour man use the k'kaw a medium powder kid I loved it so much in my last video that I was like okay definitely gotta use this again I'm gonna take a bronzer work that onto the apples of my cheeks and up in the temple to give me some color get some color back in my face and then I'm gonna put some on my nose just right on top putting it on your nose kind of gives you a natural sunkissed look I'm gonna for the contour i'm going to take my contour brush in the contour powder and work that on the hollow of the cheek i'm gonna put on a little bit of this Kat Von D contour powder right here I'm going to take this one right here a little bit of this one in the middle just go right underneath my eye honestly this no foundation look makes me feel like my skin is a little dry because naturally it is I think I'm not - spritz some kind of Hydra mist and actually I am going to add a little bit of liner right there gonna add this Steve Lawrence precision tip liner in black super super narrow and the packaging is so luxe it's so pretty I just want it to look a little bit more crisp for the highlight I'm using this Catrice cosmetics highlighting powder and this is in the shade champagne campaign pop this on ooh this is so pretty I love the quilting here looks very fast like I'm gonna go ahead and pop this on with a makeup shock t46 brush this is one of those soft natural highlights which I don't mind because I don't always have to have this intense beaming highlight which I love but I don't always have to have it like a nice soft highlight is pretty actually this it's really pretty right on my nose just on the tip and because I feel a little dry I'm also gonna put some right on my chin so that is it for the face now I'm gonna do the lips went a little bit more color because I feel like we're very neutral on the face I'm going to go ahead and take this Mac lipliner in mahogany I actually just got this in this week with a really cool package from M cosmetics and they had a beautiful bouquet of flowers like a vintage looking purple and beige it was really really pretty and actually have it by my front door like a decoration when you walk in you see it it's so pretty so I'm gonna go ahead and top this off the lip liner and that is the final look this is very pretty actually my skin I like the way my skin looks I really do that's so crazy I actually didn't think I was gonna like this but I do I'm very very happy with them just going to spritz some of this LC hydrate enhancer on my skin because I feel it's a little dry so spritz a little bit of

[Music] huh it's not gonna stop Oh about to do some brow surgery right now he got got a little lipstick on my teeth oh I got a lot of lipstick okay red is everywhere hey guys welcome back to my channel since today I am doing another super exciting video these are my favorites in Paris and videos so I'm doing American versus Mexican makeup I'm very excited cuz I actually am half Mexican and so I'm super excited for this video I think Mexican makeup is just so beautiful it's very flirty sexy seductive but fresh and pretty at the same time and I am obsessed I want to do a full every time I do a look and it's half and it looks so bomb I want to do the whole face and I'm so tempting but like nope we're gonna stick to our routine I just went to Cancun I have a little flower right here and a little hoop earring to represent my culture ever since I went to Korea I came back and was inspired to do their half and a half makeup versus our makeup and see what's beautiful for them versus I just done so well on my channel I think it's the most exciting video for me to do and you guys really love it so I'm gonna keep doing it so if you have any suggestions for me to visit or if you have any suggestions for just for me to look up and learn about a different culture or country put your suggestions below I hope you guys enjoy it and enjoy the comparison don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bells they give you a part of a quad family I went out further adieu let's get on into this video okay so I'm gonna get started with the eyes first I'm gonna take some of the Tarte shape tape in the light medium and just pop it on to the lid prime the lids it's gonna be both ways for American and Mexican because we both like to have really nice clean eye shadow looks so I'm just gonna do the top burn now and then I'll go ahead and you conceal the rest of my under-eye and then I'll do foundation later this will be the Mexican side so for that I'm gonna take the I left side collab with color pop this is the Shiki palette we wanted to use atiba in this video but I can't find it at all and it's like the perfect red perfect name for this look I was just so upset and go ahead and take this shade which is distressed and I'm gonna pop that all over the lid and then for the American side of my face I'm gonna be using the viola box top notch palette they're all very cool tone colors I usually go in with warm shades but I'm going to pick up some cool tone shades that I haven't used and I haven't even use this palette at all so we're breaking it in today so I'm gonna go into the crease with freckles it's a matte Brown and I'm gonna take I'm gonna pick up this shade right here as my first transition shade for the mexican side so I'm just gonna go in right here with a very light hand and more so towards the outer part of the crease bring it out I haven't even done my brows yet so I'm gonna go in with top notch top notch is more of a peachy warm shade so I'm gonna go all over the eye with this bring it to life like that and I think more so on this side actually the lighter shade of that pale bone color is a little bit more geared towards the Mexican makeup because I feel like the American side we go for a warmer tone so I am toning it down and kind of blending it into the rest of my skin I'm gonna go in with exclusive and I'm gonna use that right in the crease I'm gonna take it all the way in you mean that we're using coal tone shades today we still like the drama in America so I'm gonna take it all the way into the inner corner and really darken up that crease we don't focus too much on a specific area of the eye I feel like having this outer corner really defined for the mexican side it makes it more flirty and just a little bit more sultry so I think that is fitting for this side of the eye on the American side I'm just gonna bring that crease shade all the way in to the outer inner corner okay so that's basically it for the initial crease shades I'm gonna go back over to the Mexican side and we're actually almost done on this side it's pretty easy and very basic we are gonna go in with the darkest Brown that I in the palette which is no chance and Matt's brown which is right here I'm gonna pick it up first with this Musante brush I like how it's tapered so it kind of fits perfectly into that crease and I'm just gonna keep it right in here I'm gonna first use this brush this fluffier brush it still stays specific to the crease area without getting all over the lid and past the brow bone gives us a nice wash of this color really buff out those edges you don't want any harsh lines so now that we have the intensity of that color I'm gonna go in with a smaller pencil brush so I can get a deeper outer crease that's gonna add a really nice sultry flirty kind of look just amp up the outer V a tad bit more buff out the edges and the lid is basically using the same color we set with but really just amplifying that pale bone color it just makes the eye look really youthful and well rested so I'm gonna take a more densely packed brush and I'm gonna pack on that pale bone shade all over the lid right on the brow bone I'm gonna take a fluffy brush just a big huge fluffy brush and buff all of the edges out make sure everything just kind of flows together and just moves into one another really easy and then for the American side I'm gonna go ahead and take a darker Brown this is extra I'm gonna pop that on with the smaller crease brush is the 206 from time at Los Angeles so I'm gonna pop in extra right onto that outer corner and bring it all the way into the inner corner so drama from inner to outer corner so really deepen up the crease on the lid area I'm gonna add this really pretty gold from Too Faced this is the pure gold don't you find based on body glitter infuse with real gold ooh for the Mexican makeup I'm gonna go ahead and do a wing a wing is something that they've been doing for years and years I used to be really high up now it's a little bit more of a pretty flick so I'm gonna go ahead and try to move my t-rex arms into this position so I can do a wing so let's get really close here I'm actually gonna start right in the middle but I feel like the Mexican wing is more of a soft flick these days rather than a harsh triangle looking thing that I also love to do on my base is we also like wings but ours are a little bit more intense see how the American wing is just a little bit more bold and angular and this one's more flared out now I'm gonna do my brows before my brows driving me nuts for the Mexican side I'm gonna go in with precisely my brow pencil and number six and start to darken up my brows and fill them in the mexican brow is pretty much an even color there's no ombre to it it's just a nice even natural brow Mexican women really like to enhance their eyes deepening the crease darkening the brow the wing really defining the entire eye area making it look very flirty and seductive and just really feminine and pretty for the American brow I'm just gonna fill it in with shade five really quick towards the tail-end about to do some brow surgery right now [Music] at 4:00 the front of the brows I'm going to take shade 3 from benefit and just start to fill in those hair like strokes so going in straight down like this it's usually like a nice gradient going on and then I'm gonna clean up the bottom of the brow with some concealer and just define right underneath the brow bone so it's gonna really highlight the arch of the brow or the inner corner over here this oh my god this is such a pretty color I'm gonna use vivacious which is this metallic color right here so I'm gonna do something light and flirty these are from House of lashes they're the iconic lights and then for the American side I'm gonna do something along still shows you the makeup please use this lash right here from less saline it's called Adriana the skin is pretty basic for me both sides are pretty much the same so I'm gonna go with the NARS natural radiant foundation this is in the shade punjab and then for the concealer I'm just gonna pop on a de Tarte shaped tip concealer I don't think it's any different on either side I think it's just covering those dark circles so I'm just gonna do just a little bit here and the same thing right in here and when it comes to contouring I think both sides just pretty much like to have a nice structure going on with their face for the American side fake underneath so nothing creases and then for this side I'm just gonna add a yellow so I'm gonna take my Kat Von D shade and light palette whoo the yellow powder right underneath the under eye circle and then for the contouring I'm just gonna keep it the same I'm using this middle shade here from my Kat Von D shade and light palette and I'm gonna contour the cheeks eyes like this Sigma wide shader brush for my nose and that middle shade is to contour I'm slimming down on the American side I'm gonna add some bronzer so for the bronzer I'm gonna use the L C bronzer in medium then a bronze up the face take it all the way up to forehead around the cheekbones ron's up and glow the skin it's basically a very sunkissed kind of aloe so for the Mexican side I'm gonna take the Kat Von D Lolita blush and eyeshadow blush is a major part of the Mexican look just live-ins up the face gives it color it's just a very seductive flirty kind of a culture so anything to enhance that is what is gonna be happening on this side of the face basically [Music] I'm going to take the blush right back into the hairline so it looks like it's coming from underneath the skin I'm gonna keep it more matte on this side and then I'm gonna dust off that setting powder on this eye or the lower lash line here we always have to put a lower lash line something so I'm just gonna take the crease down to the lower lash line and then I'm gonna take the darkest Brown with the same brush and get a little bit closer to the inner corner and the waterline and I'm keeping it right out here just to keep it fresh and pretty I'm not gonna drag it all the way in like I did on this side and I'm going to take this is yuvan cheap magic Kohl pencil in black and line the lower waterline and I feel like baking and putting that powder right underneath kind of help stop your waterline from running if you have that issue and then here I'm just gonna take it a little bit into the outer corner and leave it like that the only thing we're missing on the American side is highlight so I'm gonna take the coffee and cream highlight from ELF this is the that's heart collab highlight that's my girl I love her I'm gonna take both of these shades or maximum intensity and pop them on over there on top of the cheekbone back to the Mexican side we are almost done the only thing we're missing is the lipstick or the lipstick I'm gonna take Max retrograde and then for the American side I'm gonna take a nude lip e this is from Y so [Music] thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did give it a big thumbs up and don't forget to comment down below what country you

it into the crease with this morphe brush does not have a number on it but I think it fits in my priest priest fits in my crease pretty good so we're gonna use this one just like so and I'm just going to use these back and forth motions right here and use circular motions towards the end of my lid just because my skin is very taut in that area so I can kind of move my brush around easier so I'm just going to go back and forth here very lightly because my skin's a little bit more loose in this inner corner area so just remember we all have different eye shapes we all have different lid spaces it's really important to use transition shades when you're doing like a bold eye shadow look you always want to start off with something that is very light and neutral in that same shade range that you're going in and then build on that because if you start off with one strong color it's going to be a lot harder to blend and it's going to be a lot more difficult to layer on you know so make sure using the right eye shadow brush and make sure you are transitioning your eyeshadows so the next color I'm going to pick up is this darker shade of brown okay these shades are kind of difficult for me to pronounce so I'm going to just spell it out right here it's an umber brown matte shade and pop it into the crease as well and I'm just going to use the same brush I'm just going to layer right on top always want to tap off the excess so you don't put too much product down at one time is you want to build it up so I'm going back and forth here and I always keep in mind that I want each shade that I use before to peak through so I kind of try to keep it below that shade or I'll go back and I'll I'll add that shade back into the crease so that it shows you know so you don't want to overlap it completely so you have that nice gradient and with this I'm gonna work it down into the outer V and I'm layering this on kind of like I'm doing a wing I'm just going from the outer lid and following up towards the tail end of the brow and what this also does is give you the illusion of a more lifted eye so you can tell but the difference in my eyes already if this looks a little bit more yeah like I got an eye lift or something so in case you guys have a problem where your eyes look tired or droopy try doing your eyeshadow like this at an angle okay the next shade I'm gonna use is right here the dark brown matte shade so I'm starting off with just a little bit of the dark brown on the outer corner so I'm like tapping it in there just using circular motions keeping in mind you want those other colors to peak through the top and just start to intensify the outer V and you gotta remember the shadow is embedded in the brush so you can still build on what you have here until you've really you're not doing much with it then you can add a little bit more really take your time on this because dark shadows are a little bit more difficult to blend and work with so a little bit at a time something that you me and I have something coming out on my skin great uhm so I'm going to go back in with a brush we used for the lighter shades in the crease and I'm going to soften up the outer edge of that before it gets too crazy I'll always remember if you have trouble blending make sure your hand is towards the back of the brush the next shade of minis in the palette is the darkest shade in the palette it's a Zee black satin shade I'll have it written below with the same brush it's pretty tiny with the same brush I'm going to go ahead and dip into that black shade and to work that on the outer crease as well on the outer V so I'm going to go in with this really beautiful bronze shade right here this is a bronze shimmer and I'm going to pop that on to the lid and then I'm just going to use that clean blending brush and just make sure there's no harsh edges and then for my wing I'm going to use this girl acted precise eyeliner marker looks like that pretty sharp and pointy just how I like it I'm going to go ahead and start to do a very dramatic wing let's see how dramatic it gets I like that this eyeliner lets you do a very thin precise line because that that point is so narrow when you do this type of eyeliner it really really gives you a facelift or like that facelift look so now I'm just going to prep my little lashes for false lashes so I'm going to put some mascara on actually I'm going to go back into the black or the darker Brown and kind of smoke out the wing a little bit towards the end so I'm going to take that dark brown and just smoke around the wing like right in here ok so now we're going to go into the eyelashes we are going to use let's see or whoo those look nice or the iconic lights okay I'm going to go with Lyla from house from Lily lashes we're going to go back to the lower part of the lash line in just a little bit but I want to do the rest of the face so I'm going to go in with some concealer I'm going to use this one from Le girl let's the pro conceal I'm going to go ahead and work this on my under eyes this concealer is amazing covered up everything I know I'm using a lot of la girl but I just got in a ton of new la girl makeup and I wanted to try it out so next mini is this Pro contour cream from Le girl I'm going to take that contour color start to contour my nose just shave off the sides a little bit okay so now that we have all of the face on there I'm going to go ahead and work on the lower lash line but I'm going to go into the shade right here and work that on the lower lash line it's kind of like when you're working with a crease you want to build up the intensity that's kind of what we're doing here take that with a orpheum 5:07 brush and I'm just going to work that on the lower lash line and then I'm going to go in with this little brush right here this is from the makeup shock the brush number is t2 I'm just going to work my brush into the darkest brown shade I'm going to start to pack that on the lower lash line using these little padding motions and then I'm going to go into the waterline actually haven't even opened this yet this is another Le girl pencil all the girls pretty good very creamy you can go all the way in I'm gonna stop just before it goes too far just because my eyes are a little more close together so I like to keep all the darkness from here back and then for the inner corners I want to brighten it up so I'm going to take this shade right here it's called Newberry street white gold shimmer we're going to use that to really brighten up the inner corner so my goal for this look is to be super glowy to the point where you guys need sunglasses to watch this video so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start off with this iconic London illuminator I'm just taking a little dot and working that on my cheek bone and to set everything in place I'm going to be using my the bomb highlight and contour palette so I'm going to be taking these two shades right here right on the under eyes and I'm just patting everything in place and then to set the contour in place what I'm going to do is use the contour shades in the balm highlighting contour palette and just accentuate the cheek contour and because this is the powder it's going to help just set whatever is underneath it in place so you don't necessarily need to go all over with one face powder so the next thing we're going to use is bronzer so I'm gonna use this Rimmel one it's called natural bronzer it's a waterproof bronzer really I'm just gonna work that into my cheek anywhere else I'm just taking this neutral color right here and just setting it in place like right below the cheekbone it also kind of helps with enhancing that contour so I am setting the highlight in place with a powder highlight this one is from Oprah it's called blissful it is so gorgeous this is gorgeous I thought I loved Rodeo Drive and then this happened and actually I'm going to add a little bit of blush I'm going to take this one from Kylie it's the new Kylie blush it's called x-rated I'm just gonna pop it onto the cheekbone stick out a little bit more glow and yes I am highlighting my ears your ears can be cute for the lip liner I'm going to be using this color pop lippie pencil in Boystown and I want my highlight mustache to show the lips I'm gonna use this Oprah liquid lip in nude potion and this is actually from the Nicki tutorials collab is Purdy and then I'm going to go over the center with this galactic lippy in the Shyne has like a gloss end like a clear gloss and then it has this gorgeous glittery and she's so pretty I want to use this as a highlight on the center of my lips so now your lips have that wet glowy look you thank you guys for watching I

learn my tips and tricks don't forget to subscribe to my channel to keep connected with me and stay up with me every week also hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video before you get started with putting any makeup on your face make sure to wash your face exfoliate moisturize the moisturiser that I'm using right now is from tatcha it's the water creme it doesn't feel greasy I use this all the time obviously I need some more but I put some on before I got started I just wanted to show you that this is one of my favorite moisturizers that I'm using right now so I'm going to go ahead and prime my face I'm actually using two primers a first primer that I'm using is from Smashbox this is the pore minimizing primer and I like to use this on my t-zone because this is where I have really large pores when I have pore minimizing primer like these these thick ones I really like to Pat it into the skin so that it settles into those large pores and it fills them in so it creates a nice even surface I only like to use this on my t-zone but for the rest of my skin I like to use this primer right here this is the photo finish foundation primer from Smashbox it's silicone base so silicone is going to sink into your phors fill them in and create a nice even layer nice even surface for your foundation to stick on to like to go right above my forehead and just tap it in there and around the perimeter of my face this is also going to help your foundation last longer next I'm going to jump into my favorite full coverage foundation it's been a favorite of mine for a while now as you guys know I've tried tons of full coverage foundations but I always come back to this one right here this is the Estee Lauder Double Wear and I am in 3 w1 tani the only thing about this foundation is that it's a little bit drawing so what I like to do is take a little bit of the custom cover drops from cover effects and I'm going to first pour this onto my hand the back of my hand just put like a little bit right there these are the hydration drops so I'll just take a little bit of that and put it into the foundation literally just one drop will go a long way you want any brush or tool that you're going to use on your face to be very clean especially your foundation so I'm using a clean Beauty Blender it's not a beet this is a new Beauty Blender if I were to use this I'd immediately wash it I don't like to let it sit and get clogged in here it's just it's kind of gross this is actually one of the new Beauty blenders this is the part of the Spring Fling collection I think it's the Spring Fling or summer fling or something like that so I'm going to take the Beauty Blender and I'm going to work it into the foundation you don't want your Beauty Blender to be super wet you just want it to be damp then it's just going to soak up all the foundation and you're just really wasting the foundation so just make sure that the Beauty Blender is just damn I'm going to go ahead and Pat that onto my face and when I do anything full coverage where I want the most maximum coverage out of the product I always make sure to use a very light hand so I'm using super light tapping motions all over my face and I always like to make sure that I bring it down to my neck so it matches the rest of my body even though I'm doing a full coverage foundation I'm going to first start off with a light layer you don't want to put on ton of foundation at one time because then you are going to definitely have the cake face but if you just start off with a light layer and then build up from there then you'll have more of a natural flawless looking face rather than like textured cakey makeup on your skin so just start off with a light layer because we're also keep in mind we're also going to put on concealer powder there's gonna be a lot of more things that are going on your face so just be patient makeup is fun take your time I'm not going to focus too much on the under eye area because we're going to put concealer there because I've already done my brows I'm going to stay away from using the bigger end of the Beautyblender so I'm going to take the pointy err side and get into the areas where I need to get into like right on the eyelid I love the beauty blenders point because it gets right on the inner corners it's kind of a hard area to get into if you're using a brush or anything else but the beauty blender just like pokes at the spot I don't know if that's a good description but it definitely gets in there really really well so this is one light layer of foundation I'll let it sit I'll do something else and then I'll go back to it and do another layer so I'm just gonna go ahead and carve out my brows a little bit more while that dries and I'll be right back okay so now that my brows are pretty defined I'm going to go ahead and add my second layer Foundation feel like my mole is basically almost gone the lighter I Pat on it the more it's going to disappear I'm going to let that set on my face but while it sets I'm going to go ahead and grab my fix plus this is the one of the new fix plusses and it smells so so good it's amazing okay so now that that's set on my skin I'm going to go ahead and work on my concealer so the best the most full coverage the best concealer of the year goes to Tarte shaped Apes this just completely cancels them out completely so I love this so much this is the Tarte shade tape enlightening and I'm just going to take it right underneath that just fits perfectly under the eyes take it right down here I start at the inner corners because that's where it is the darkest and then I start to bring it out I'm just going to go ahead and start on this side and this gets pretty wet so I like to let it sit and dry for a little bit it does kind of dry quickly so it's not too bad but I like to let it get a little tacky and then I start working my Beauty Blender in there and with a concealer I like to also go right on top of my eyelid I use this as my primer and this is actually my favorite to use as a primer because it does not crease this is a light medium color I also have light neutral for the highlight I'll use this one I'll go like a little ball right there and go down the nose and then I'll just do a few more right in here I keep the brightest parts right in the center and then I go around the mouth right on the Cupid's bow and right on the chin I'm also going to contour a little bit even though this is just supposed to be foundation I'm going to do a little bit of contouring so I'm taking my deep honey from Tarte this is their new cool coverage foundation stick but I'm using it to contour so I'm just going to do my cheekbones the nose and then I'll take a different sponge for the contour am I going to take you through like my full steps of contouring but just showing you a little bit because this is how I add dimension back into my face and okay so next I'm going to set everything in place so that it does not move this is a very full coverage high-impact industrial-strength foundation routine so just letting you guys know that trust me you're gonna be good now for my under eyes I like to set this is like this most important part for me I don't really like to bake if I do bake I'll use the Laura Mercier setting powder and translucent but otherwise right now this is my ride-or-die Holy Grail this right here this is the Von D shade + light contour palette I have been using this for about two years straight and I love it right so many other contour powders I've tried baking this is just my favorite way to set my under eyes and these two shades right here even though everything else broke it actually fell and it broke everything I don't use but this middle contour and these two shades are my ride-or-die Holy Grail forever until something better comes out kind of shades so I'm going to mix these two guys right here and I'm going to set my under eyes and really just set everything right in this area everything out here I use bronzers go over the contour a little bit more and to me that sets everything in place it adds dimension it doesn't create this flat look I'm going to go over my under eyes with these two shades right here I'm using the morphe e49 brush like if you're interested in this brush or anything from morphe you can use code kristin d and it'll give you a discount so i'm going to go ahead and pop into these two colors right here and then what i like to do i don't sweep it onto my face because this is a very full coverage look I like to Pat it onto my face so I'm going to look up into the heavens and I'm just going to start patting this like this lay it right on top and Pat it lightly underneath the eyes it's going to make everything look super smooth and brighten it just a tad bit more so I'm going to take it into the inner corners bring it down to the end of the nose and then just tough all the way through there above the cheekbone I'll go ahead and do around the nose and around the mouth as well just because those areas are darker on my face and this area right here tends to be more red and then I'll just set right in the center because I already have so much powder on here I won't dig back in there doing that can really make this go super cakey very fast so just stick with what you have on the brush and work it into the other parts of your face and I promise you it will work way better than dipping your brush in a few more times I'm going to go ahead and tap my brush right on my lids just just set the concealer and I'll just go in with the powder and start to pack that on right below the contour and if you have any type of texture on your face it's better to go in this way with your brush and pack it in to your skin rather than sweeping it I'm gonna go in with my Milani bronzer to set the outer perimeters of my face so I'm gonna go right around the temple cheekbone everything is set and ready to go this is my full coverage foundation now I'm just gonna put on lush highlight eyeliner things like that and I will be right back so I'm back with the rest of my makeup and the last step to make sure that everything looks flawless and amazing is to use this fix plus it doesn't matter what fix plus you use this one currently I'm using because it's one of the new ones and it's coconut I love the scent of coconut so this is the one I'm going to be using for a while I'm gonna go ahead and spritz this on my face this is going to make your powders look like skin so this is what's going to help you not look cakey thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video

[Music] all new makeup Wow that is really really attractive tears I think they're just so easy hey guys welcome back to my channel today is a super fun video we're gonna be testing a full face of first impressions new makeup that came in my PR and we have a bunch of really good stuff to test out we have the new have the new Kylie collection right here I'm so excited and we also have the Brett mint X morphe highlighter palettes some new full coverage concealers that may or may not be taking over some of the ones that are very popular right now we have new lippies from Ellery and color pop we have so many new things that I can't wait to talk to you about so we are gonna jump in and figure out if these are really great or not if we should buy them or if we shouldn't so if you want to see how that this look right here this like cotton candy storm looking I don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get in to this video start off with my foundation first I'm gonna be using this one from Marc Jacobs this is the new shameless youthful look 24-hour foundation this has a sunscreen SPF of 25 actually comes with this brush I've tried using it with a Beauty Blender but I feel like it works best with a brush this is a light to medium coverage and just playing around with it I know for sure that this is one of those daytime foundations that are just nice to throw on when you're just gonna be out and about throughout the day and you just need something to even out your skin tone so this is one of those everyday type of foundation there's about 29 different shades in the range you can choose from I'm a little bit more tan on my body which is not bad I'm not mad at it but I really have to work in this foundation because it's a little bit lighter and I definitely don't mind that this is more of a daytime kind of coverage because during the day I don't like to have super full coverage I want my skin to breathe I just wanted to look even and healthy noticing a little bit of separation but I think that's just my prime so I'm just gonna try and work that in so now my skin is even it looks good I'm gonna go ahead and do my eye shadow and I'm gonna be using the new storm collection from Kylie this is the eye of the storm palette which is the more dramatic eye shadow palette looks like so and then this one over here is called calm before the storm and it has those soft pastel colors that I absolutely love I feel like this one is super special in the palette because this is Aquarius this is stormy zodiac and my zodiac so we're kind of twinning and it's just a really pretty pastel purple color and I like how she matched the colors with a shimmer which I would go perfect right on the center of the lid so love that she did that I'm gonna take this shade right here and I'm gonna work it all over the lid I'm gonna come over to the calm before the storm palette and I'm gonna take this shade right here this really pretty pink and I'm gonna work that into the crease I love the way her shadows feel they're always so soft and smooth with a slightly smaller brush is the 231 luxe petit crease brush from zoeva I'm gonna take the darker shade like that gray mauve color in the palette this one it right here and I'm gonna work that right below the pink shade just give it a nice contrast and dimension I'm gonna elongate my eye just a little bit further so I'm going to take this gray shade and I'm gonna bring it out to the end of the brow bone and buff it out right there so this is gonna be more of the dramatic end of the eye so this is gonna be the storm and then this is gonna be like the calm of the storm a bunch of drama right in there I like this you put in more of a cool tone shade for a transition I feel like this gray really will change what we're used to because you know everybody loves all of those cool warm tone shades but I don't want to lose the pink so I'm going back into the pink and going right above it so I'm gonna go ahead and take the darkest shade in the palette which is this guy right here I'm gonna work that on the outer corners of my eye the darkest shade is actually not as intense as you think it would be just like a really nice gray color so what I'm gonna do is take this cream shadow right here this is super star and it is so gorgeous swatched it really quick for you guys it is so so pretty I'm gonna work that right into the inner part of the lid one thing about this is that it does kind of break up in between you see how there's like a space of nothing but then there's shadow all around it and I'm trying to stick it right in there okay I would usually never do this but the black in this palette has blue and silvery looking flex or like violet flecks in it so I'm gonna take this because it is a lot more deeper than this shade right here so I'm gonna take that color and work it on the outer corner just to add more intensity to it just to deepen up the look a little bit further I think keeping these darker shades really low on the eye and making sure you don't go up too high with them is super important just starting really low because if you go up too high you can have this crazy messy black eye and it's really hard to come back from so try to keep your blacks low as low as possible and gradually inch your way up to where you think you you want it or where you feel comfortable with it but they blend out really nice and I like that this dark color isn't super shimmery overwhelming it's just those light soft violet flecks are in there but it's definitely still matte looking which is really cool the only thing is this glitter shadow is getting really hard and kind of flaking everywhere today I'm gonna use a shimmer on my brow bone and something I never do but we're going to change it up today and a little bit of a pop right here I'm actually gonna take the same color and work it into the inner corners too it's just so so freakin pretty I love this color actually I'm gonna work more of the pink in I am kind of obsessed with this pink it's just such a pretty soft pink and they just nailed this pink to the floor it's so nice I don't know if I want a wing I think this I look looks already kind of winged out so all I need to add really is just some fluffy dramatic lash it will be good to go for the eyes except of course the lower lash line so we have a new concealer to play with it's this one right here from Laura Mercier it's called the flawless fusion ultra long wear concealer it's supposed to be hydrating and it's not supposed to crease at all so we are about to test that out right now and it comes in this tube that is not like a circle it has almost like an oval shape I love these types of applicators I think they're just so easy I just think they're so easy to use so I'm gonna use that right now on this darkness that I have going on underneath my eye they claim to have a blurring effect with these concealers and non-drying both of those things are huge pluses and I can't wait to see if that's actually true because if it is we could possibly have a new fave on our hands very exciting [Music] and I also like to put concealer right here personally looking in the mirror I feel like it helps a lot if I just put a line right under and sweep it back towards my ear I just feel like it just gives me a lifted effect because naturally it just kind of turns downwards so we want to lift that up give ourself a little bit of a facelift I doesn't feel it's like super lightweight but I I mean it's not a problem it does seem to dry down pretty fast I would say this this actually does feel a little tiny teensy bit stiff on the skin after a while I'm gonna add another layer right in here so I get really dark in this area I do like the coverage so far do feel like it's giving me that like soft focus blur effect to my skin okay I feel like I have to read this to you guys because it would help with how it feels on my skin right now because it does say that it's still super flexible it says 12 hours of high performance we're powered by skin fusion technology long wearing flexible polymers fused to skin for wear that's transfer sweat and humidity and water resistant even though I can feel the concealer on my skin I don't mind it because it's blurring out my face and it's brightening my under eyes and I just definitely feel covered so I love that I'm gonna go into a calm before the storm and I'm gonna pick up this pink and mix it in with this purple because I just have to use Aquarius we're just 20 right now like my tattoo actually it's on this side so I should be like this and then I'm gonna go into the dark grayish mauve color right here and work that on the outer part of the lower lashline to smoke everything out I'm just gonna line a little bit right into the outer corners right here with a liner that is not new I contoured my face snatched it up really quick and now I'm gonna go ahead and put on some blush this one is from bareMinerals it's the gen nude blush in that peach though oh my god that's such a cute name that peach though like they gave me this huge thing of all the blushes this caught my attention really quick and that's probably what I was thinking exactly at that moment with all the cool toned shades we have going on our eyes is a really nice contrast it's warm peach color so I'm just gonna grab my brush right here and work that into my cheeks I like the peach color because it gives you a flush and at the same time it's a warm shade so it gives you somewhat of a bronzing effects and I didn't put on any bronzer I'm just gonna go straight for the blush today I'm gonna bring it around the temple coming in like so this is the draping technique where you take blush and you bring it around like it's bronzer you don't get like a ton of payoff right away it's very buildable which is something that I like because when I have too much pigment at one time I feel like I cannot get back go back from it and I have to work really hard at taking it away so this is really nice you just picks up the perfect amount without going overboard so I like that the next thing we're gonna get into is highlight and for the highlight that I'm going to use today I have the morphe babe in paradise this is the highlighter palette with Brett Minh rock it's his collaboration and it is absolutely it's absolutely studying I love that it has that Hawaiian theme because you know Brett Minh is from Hawaii and you open it up and you have four really nice sized highlights lightest over here all the way to the darkest shade I'm gonna go into vacation I'm gonna go into vacation and I'm gonna pop that on first but I think I'm gonna end up popping on a little bit of get laid feeling the vibes Oh we just take a moment to appreciate the blinding effect of this highlight right now okay I'm gonna take my finger cuz it's a little bit more precise take it on the nose this is such a perfect color for highlight I love it it's so so pretty I take it on my Cupid's bow like so so pretty [Music] cest Wow for the lips I'm gonna go for a gloss today in just the gloss because I feel like the eyes are the main attraction we feel like I've been gravitating more towards glosses lately the one that I'm using is from the Ellery X color Pop Collaboration she came out with a bunch of lippies I think it's like formats two glosses and then a lippy stick and a liner and they're all really pretty colors very wearable for any type of day or night she has red Browns in there this nude gloss that is perfect it was calling my name I had to use it today this is the Neda gloss and I'm going to pop it on and I like that the gloss is super pigmented look at that oh and it matches so perfect with this look thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did go ahead and give it a big thumbs up for me

[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be showing you this super easy very natural holiday kind of makeup look this is the look that I'm gonna do when I'm hanging out with my family eating on the couch watching Christmas movies waiting to open presents this is kind of makeup look that you really do you're just like very natural if nothing at all even though I love looking at these glittery red and green kind of looks I just wanted to do something that I would actually really do so this is it very basic natural glowy skin just in case you have your family members trying to snap pictures of you and you're like not noticing at least your highlight is glowing and blinding the camera your face looks like nice and bright and healthy this is that makeup look it's a realistic holiday makeup look that's what it is that should be the title this is actually my first year that I'm not actually gonna be with my mom and my family I'm actually at home I just moved into a new place we've been trying to settle in for like a while and so this will be my first Christmas in LA so if you guys want to learn how to get this natural and glowy look for the holidays don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so to be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video house and it feels so much bigger if I could just stretch out everywhere I feel like there is such a huge difference but to you guys it looks the same because you're only seeing this face right here nothing else but I feel like I can stretch out to the world for a primer today I'm gonna take the laura geller spackle treatment makeup primer and i've actually never tried this it's still it's very new so I'm gonna open it up and try it with you guys some of my hand and it's like skin tone oh it says even tone so it's supposed to even your skin tone and then take that all around work it all around the face that definitely feels like it's going to hold the foundation on my face like it feels a little sticky like if is I wouldn't say sticky it feels a little tacky on the skin so it makes me feel like it's gonna hold the foundation better throughout the night I don't know what you guys but whenever I am hanging out with the fam on the holidays I really don't care what my face looks like I just I want my skin to look good I want my brows to be on point lashes but that's it I don't really care for anything else I do want to have that glowy kind of look so that's what I'm gonna be doing today so I'm gonna just pop that primer on and then I'm gonna go into this foundation from YSL this is the all ours foundation something that's gonna be full coverage long last scheme I just basically want my skin to look even no blemishes clear bright glowy and healthy and then while that dries I'm gonna go ahead into my brows and literally this is how my hair was for Thanksgiving my hair is just like this the whole time I really could care less cuz we're with the family we're with Grandma we're with mom sister nobody really cares I'm gonna go ahead and jump right into my eyeshadow so I'm gonna be using the new it's my ray ray x bh cosmetics eyeshadow palette there are so many really pretty just wearable colors right here you don't even has a mirror it's like everything in one palette that's so cool I'm gonna go ahead and take pancake and mix it in with mousse and start to work that right into the crease something that is just gonna give us a natural definition right here and I'm just gonna wash the color on just to give us some depth right in the crease area so it's gonna follow right underneath the brow bone this is just something that you can do really quick I'm gonna take control freak right underneath it who's more of a red tone Brown so washing that right onto the bottom of those two colors this eye shadow is really pigmented because I'm barely tapping my brush in there he's picking up a lot of product but it blends really nicely so I love that now I want a very natural just glowy eye so I'm gonna take nudists right here I'm gonna use this brush right here I like it cuz it's flat fluffy and it kind of takes up I can feel like it's gonna take up a lot of my lid space so that's a good thing I'm gonna take nudists and just pop it right onto the lid oh I like this color and it's okay if it kind of lays over the other shades because it's just going to make it look that much more natural and bright I just want to look like I have a nice awake healthy bright naturally contoured eye it's gonna look like we basically did nothing to our eyes but if you see the before and after in my face I don't know if I could do it right now but if I can show you the before and after it's a drastic difference it just looks like a healthier prettier looking eyelid so with that said I'm gonna go ahead and add a little bit of brown liner to my lash line I'm gonna take my pencil brush from makeup shock this is a tee at 13 and I'm gonna grab the midnight and just run it right along the base of your lashes because we're gonna put lashes on and you want it to look seamless and I don't want like a perfect wing so I'm just gonna diffuse that edge oh now I'm gonna go into the lower lash line I'm gonna bump my brush in to spice and just work that that's actually a little too red for me my bad just kidding I'm gonna take mousse in pancake and work that on the lower lash line as well and since we already have spice right there I'm just gonna grab a tad fit so it doesn't look uneven and then go back into mousse and pancake I love these names just gonna take some of what I have there and pop it back into the socket of my eye because it kind of changed up with the spice but I think I kind of like it so I'm gonna keep going with that glowy kind of look on the eyes I'm gonna take my all-time favorite from Victoria Beckham the Estee Lauder mascara the only thing is it gets kind of clumpy so that's not really problem I have with this mascara but I really like the way it just grabs on to every lash and it pulls it out and Bluffs it up at the same time so I'm gonna pop this on my lower lashes first and then I'm gonna pop on some eyelashes I feel like it's been so long since I've done a makeup tutorial um because of the move and everything so I feel like I'm I'm forgetting words oh my gosh the lashes I'm using are from Bellamy they're a collab with douve I'm not really heard of they are the hashtag douve ex-ored of X Bellamy and they are just the prettiest natural looking wispy fluffy lash I have been waiting to use these lashes actually I'm like I want to do really natural just skin lashes like natural lashes but flirty kind of looking these are perfect for this look then for the inner corners of my eyes I'm going to take the L'Oreal True Match Lumi shimmery stes this one's moonlight then this one is sunlight I'm gonna mix them together to highlight the inner corners of my eyes and then I'm gonna also swatch them for you guys on my hand so you can see this one is moonlight and this one is sunlight that is pretty and then I'm trying to mix them in the middle together because I used it earlier and it was just the most beautiful combination and in the inner corners to give us that glow so I'm taking sunlight and popping that right on the center of the lid just so that when the light hits it'll reflect this really pretty light it just makes your eyes look super glowy and just pretty and now I'm gonna move on to my under-eye circles which aren't that bad today so I'm gonna go ahead but I'm still gonna use my concealer I'm gonna try a new concealer though cuz this was a new one from Kylie and I've been really excited to try this on my face this is the shade ivory work it oh it's very thin super thin thin and lightweight feeling on the skin which is not bad I love how it just glides on the skin and it looks like it's gonna be full coverage even though it feels really light do myself a little facelift the cheekbone and I feel like this is a nice bronzy kind of a color and I'm gonna keep it right on the cheeks I actually like the coverage on this I just think that blending it out is a little tricky like you can't let it sit too long then it's gonna be a little bit tougher to blend but I like the coverage I like that it's super thin and you really don't need that much to get the cut like a lot of coverage and then I'm gonna go ahead and take the mocha from the palette to contour through this shade right here in the middle and kind of turn out of my nose sort of turns down a little bit so fake it and pretend like we have a turned-up nose I take this blush right here from the balm looks like so this is really cute packaging by the way I'm gonna pop that on my cheeks just to give myself like a nice natural flush of color and keep that right on the apples of the cheeks I want to have that look like I just pinched like somebody pinched your cheeks and then just let them go very like natural pinky and then I'm gonna put some of the pink right on this area I don't know why I just love the way pink looks right here just brightens it up in a really pretty way for this look is Maj it's one of the most important parts of this look because I want to look glowy AF on the holidays so I'm gonna take my highlighting brush the t-38 from makeup shock I'm gonna take the L'Oreal True Match Lumi shimmery stand sunlight and this gives you it looks like it's gonna be like a crazy shimmer on your cheeks but it gives you a really nice soft it's so beautiful I love this highlight it gives you a really nice soft glow so I'm gonna take moonlight and use that on the highest point of my cheek here so I'm kind of like layering these two guys together I'm also gonna put it right on the temples take some on my Cupid's bow for the lips I'm gonna stay pretty neutral so I'm gonna try first I'm gonna try this Laura Mercier the lower extreme matte lipstick and fresh Wow boba it actually has excitement in her blood tonight she's playing with the box she's running around like crazy she's usually like laid out on the floor somewhere in a corner and I just want to have like the most natural-looking lip but I do want to add some definition so I'm gonna bring this in a little bit more this is actually a really pretty natural color and I'm kind of pushing the color around just so that it gives you a kind of like a stained look now I'm gonna take the huda beauty lip strobe in the shade posh and this is totally optional but I just want to add a little bit of a shine in the center that's actually a lot of shine and it takes them off it's also it's gonna just give your lips a little bit more dimension it's not gonna look so flat but I think alone the fresh shade looks really pretty I just want that extra glow all over my face thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it don't forget to thumbs it up and before I let you go I'm gonna wish all of you guys love health and happiness during these holiday seasons I love you guys so much thank you for watching and I will see you in my next video bye dollies 
[Music] this is hohoho to me guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna show you all the new things on my face because this is a full face of first impressions I have a ton of new makeup actually something that just came in this morning was from at k'kaw literally this morning and she's on my face also her sister the Nani palette on my eyes which I will tell you how much I loved this later in the video and then some NARS some huda beauty maybelline Tarte all the new stuff right here and I created this look with it that I really really like so if you want to learn how to get this look then don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of a quad family and without further ado let's get on Vidya I'm using on my face is this Maybelline master Prime hydrate and smooth primer base like it just comes out white like this I'm gonna take it in my hands and press it into my face doesn't have any scent to it any weird scent which is good and because there isn't any new brow products that I'm crazy about using I just did my brows off-camera it's very lightweight it doesn't have like that's tacky feel to it almost like putting on a facial cream oh I'm so excited for this next product I've been using it I haven't used it in a video yet but I am very excited to show you this because it is amazing I've been using it everyday it's the NARS natural radiant long wear foundation this is full coverage it's not super matte on your face so it's not super drying like it's tugging looks like really nice even skin tone that's what it looks like I'm using the shade Barcelona and I'm mixing it actually because my tan is fading so I'm gonna mix a little bit of Patagonia I think that's how you say it I'm gonna mix these two colors together Barcelona it looked really great on me now it just it's starting to look a little cray-cray so I'm gonna take my Beauty sponge right here and just start to work it into my face very lightweight nice coverage doesn't tug on the skin doesn't have any smell I'm gonna take this all over my eye because I just want to even out my skin tone all over yeah you have this natural glow that I really love and it just looks like I have nice skin I was a little nervous because it does say natural and radiant those two things are usually like that's gonna be like no coverage but this is surprisingly easy coverage so I'm gonna do one layer of that just to even out the skin if I need a little bit more later than once it dries down I'll put a little bit more but for now I'm just going to move on to my eyes because this isn't a new product I really like to prime my eyes with the turqu shape tape this is not a new product everybody knows about it everybody loves it so I'm just gonna prime eyes really quick clean underneath my brows and be right back so I have the naughty palette right here so pretty simply have the nice palette as well I feel like I want to use this for like a winter makeup look or something so actually I think I might save this palette and see what I can do with just the naughty palette so I'm gonna go ahead and take it be naughty palette right here it has like a velvet texture on the font and it's just so pretty I love the green of the green I was hoping that it would be in the palette and it is in the palette it matches the actual palette so well so I'm gonna start off with merriment this shade right here I'm just gonna wash this color in the crease fun I just think it's a fun color and I've always wanted to use mint in one of my looks so like why not so I'm just gonna wash this through the crease and it's actually really very faint and almost just like a white I'm gonna go in with tipsy next one of the lighter Gray's in the palette and I'm taking a smaller brush to work tipsy in there on the outer edge to add some depth in there and I have the brush very lightly sweeping over my base because I don't want to put too much pressure than in the to get really intense and I want to gradually work the color up into the crease a lighter hand is always better and I always work in a circular motion out towards the end of my eye just because I feel like it's a little bit easier and I use a little bit more pressure out here too now I'm going to go in with his beautiful emeralds it's just it's just Christmas this is ho ho ho to me and I kind of flick it outward so that it creates this cat shape I can already feel this is super pigmented so I'm using the lightest hand ever short a little back and forth motions and I'm gonna bring this out here I'm gonna keep this area very open and clear because I'm gonna pop that beautiful gold in the middle I hope it's as beautiful as it looks in the palette this is the Vasanti brush there's no number two it just says Vasanti on it I have been loving this brush to blend out my shadows so I'm just going to take that and go around this shadow and really diffuse the edges [Music] for the outer corners I'm going to use coal the darkest gray in the palette and I'm going to work that on the outer corners I want the darkest point to be right on the inner corner and the outer corner and you really want to make sure you blend out these edges and that might take you a while just go back and forth in little short motions like this I'm gonna add jingle right in the center it's so pretty but actually because I kind of swatch the jingle this is jingle I feel like you can kind of see through it so it's not super pigmented but it does still have that pretty golden color in it so I want to use it but I want to use a base on the center's so this is called top yacht it's the chrome paint shadow pot from Tarte and it looks like that it's very similar it's a little bit more opaque than the shadow so I'm just gonna put this down and then lay jingle right on top of it I'm gonna take this Sigma duo fiber brush and just soften out the edges of this and I don't want this color to go everywhere so try to keep it right on the center be careful how far you're bringing out your brush because I feel like this could get everywhere then take coal again with my wing liner brush now I'm gonna add some mascara and lashes I'm gonna be using the new Marc Jacobs section it's not new it's it's new to me because they put my name on it and I feel super special about it I think this is one of my favorite mascaras to use to mesh my real and false lashes together the lashes that I'm using are not new so I'm just gonna put them on off-camera but these are the House of lashes ikonics for the lower lash line I'm going to take coal [Music] concealer wise I'm going to be using the new concealer shade from NARS this is the NARS radiant creamy concealer this is in the shade light 2.6 Cafe con Leche have darkness under here and it goes straight down so I'm going upwards with the concealer to make it look a little bit more lifted feel like this is actually my perfect match oh my gosh I haven't told you guys I am wearing my friend Yasmin Beauty burdock here on YouTube her and her husband came out with a line of clothing and she has these sweater crop tops I'm wearing right now it's so cute as stay dreamin stay hustlin I like to cover my arms so I always have like I like long sleeves but I don't want to be super hot so I like that it's crop top so I'm gonna link them below if you want to check out her sweatshirts I'm gonna set everything in place so I'm going to take my Laura Mercier powder and my slightly damp Beauty Blender so what baking does for me fills in those lines and makes everything look really smooth so I'm gonna let that sit and bake on my face so while that's doing that I'm gonna go ahead and contour with my shade and light palette you guys know my contour routine I do it all the time so I'm just gonna be back with a contour face this is a new blush palette from NARS it's from the mannery collection and it has Laguna in it lovesick and surreal highlight I'm just gonna be using this blush right here this is lovesick and I'm gonna pop that on to my cheeks I know it looks kind of crazy in the pan on the pan but on the face it's actually not so intense the highlight that I'm gonna use is from huda beauty it's her winter highlight palette and look at this I love her palettes they're so cool the first day is frosted kissed which is like a cream and I'm gonna use I'm just gonna softly Pat that on my cheekbone and then I'm gonna take Northern Lights this really pretty gold woah woah that cream really makes it pop so you want to be careful with this the bridge this is a very intense highlight color that I want to use is called savage the white on this collection very like Frosty the Snowman kind of vibes so I'm going to take that on my lips see hopefully it's not too dark now I'm going to add a gloss to the center of my lips for that I'm gonna take Kylie sister Kim's a new launch actually just got this in my door I mean I just got this out my door this morning I have this gold right here from k'kaw it's a gloss called the yellow gold it's very very pretty let me just do a close-up on it this is what it looks like so I'm just gonna take the yellow gold and I'm just gonna pop it on the center and I'm gonna take my finger just to soften up thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did you know what to do

Eve tonight and no I am NOT naked I'm wearing this shirt right here that you cannot see through the entire video almost the end of the year and it's really crazy how fast time went by just it just flew by my face I am creating this smokey glittery very like sultry wing I ended up making this a black glitter wing I'll show you how I did it in the video but it just reminds me of one of those sequins pillows that you can kind of like change the color on you know what I mean and like make it's a thing I was kind of experimental with it but after everything was done I was like you know what this is beautiful I'm so excited for you guys to try this look also to let you guys know this is going to be the last video of 2017 for me so I want to let you guys know that I really appreciate each and every one of you and those of you who are new to my channel this year I am so happy to have you in my little family here on YouTube it makes me so happy just to have you guys you guys are the best supporters ever I just get so much love from you guys I love you so much with all my heart and you make me so happy and you encouraged me to go further with myself with my career and with my videos so thank you guys so much I love you and if you want to learn how to get this glittery glam smoked out look don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with this video so I've already prepped my skin I've done my brows I'm gonna get straight into the eyeshadow today so I'm gonna go in I'm gonna prime my eyes with the NARS radiant creamy concealer this is the shade medium one custard and I'm gonna use that as a base for my eye shadow just so that it lasts longer and this concealer does increase so is this one's gonna be really good to use and eyeshadow base I'm also very happy that I got to partner up with NARS in this video for their radiant creamy concealer because I love them so much so I am so happy to partner with them so this is the violet boss hash tag palette I'm gonna use fresh right here to just set the concealer on my eyelids and make sure the eyeshadow goes on evenly all over the lid without skipping I'm gonna take this palette right here from a dose of colors this is the blushing berries palette I'm gonna take this shade right here this is berry sheet and I'm just gonna use a fluffy brush just to work that in the crease area of my eye just working in back and forth like that in circular motions a lot of you have been asking what brushes I use you want me to let you know what brushes I'm using as I'm doing my makeup so and I don't really do that as often so I want to make an effort to try and mention that for you guys so the brush I'm using here is Lamora it's a crease brush it's called the 1 1/2 and I actually don't know where I got this and it looks like I used it so I don't know but I'm gonna go ahead and take that crease brush and just sit my hand on the back of the brush so that the brush moves along my eye a little bit easier and I have less control over it so the eye shadow is going to blend a lot smoother that way and I'm using these little circular motions to do that and I'm extending it all the way out to the end of the brow and because there's no Browns in this palette I want a hint of brown in the crease so I'm gonna go back into my hashtag palette from violet boss and I'm gonna take a sauce which is this one right here and work it all the way through the crease just like that and it's going just below the blushing sheet color and this is basically setting up that transition shade this is what's gonna make the eyeshadow look like it's seamless so I like to take my time on the crease shade and sometimes I use like 2 to 3 shades for the crease and for Roseberry I'm gonna pick up a new brush so I mix up the color on another brush so I'm gonna take the makeup Shack t-64 brush looks like so and this one I'm just gonna keep on the outer portion of my eye I'm not gonna bring it all the way and like I did the other ones because this has more of a red in it so if I bring it in too far it's gonna look my eyes are a little irritated for the lid I'm gonna take this shade these two shades together and see if it's purple enough for me let's just see okay this is perfect I could already see it so I'm gonna put that all over my lid but I'm gonna try to keep it away from this inner corner because I want to brighten that up and I like to do that you can actually take it all the way in but I like to keep it away from the inner corners just because my eyes are kind of closed set and if I put a darker shade here to make them look even more close together I try to keep the dark eye shadows towards the outside of my eyelid so I'm just gonna go back with the t-64 brush from makeup shop and just soften out the edges of the purples I have a tip if you guys see a part of your eyeshadow that is not wanting to blend and it's just really harsh looking you want to make sure that your hand is right on the tip of the brush just so that you have less control and it's easier to move back and forth and with the lightest hand just keep going back and forth until you diffuse that edge out I'm also gonna take it right on the lower lash line too so I'm gonna come around here and start to work that right on the lower portion of my eye but not taking it all the way in again you can take it all the way in I'm just gonna avoid that so I'm just gonna take some of the canal shade from the NARS radiant creamy concealer pop it on my brow just to clean up that shape and give it some definition for this inner corner right here I'm gonna take fresh from the viola Voss palette just that color we set our eyes with I'm gonna pop that on to the inner corners to brighten it up or the crease I'm gonna take berry black this matte black shade right here and this is a time at 2:06 breast time Los Angeles to a six brush and I'm just gonna work that into the crease is to darken it up a little bit more just to pinch more I'm also going to take that black and work it on the lower lash line as well to intensify the lashes this is such a pretty power this is the t67 from the makeup shop hit my brush into rose berry which is this shade right here I'm gonna pinch it with my finger and just go right below the black so I'm gonna do a black winged liner with my hourglass waterproof liquid liner I'm gonna see how I feel at the end of the black liner I'm a pop on a some pink glitter but we're just gonna try out the black wing first so I'm gonna go in with some glare over the top of the wing so I'm gonna take my violet Voss the secret weapon it's a glitter adhesive so I'm just gonna take a little bit on this brush and just go right over the wing so once that's on there I'm gonna take this violet Voss slitter in Kiki you're right Kiki really pretty purpley pink glitter I thought it would be a really pretty contrast to the dark smokey eye and I'm gonna go right over the wing okay because it is so intense sleeping I'm gonna change it up a little bit and add the black right back over it I'm gonna put on some mascara and then pop some lashes on it's from the war they have different styles of eyelashes in here but they all have a glittery black band and if you guys can see it it's not coming off on camera very well which is really weird I just thought it would be a perfect pair to this look that I'm doing right here so I'm gonna do the imagine lashes I'm gonna use this to highlight my face later but I want to use it on my eyes as well this is the artist couture ex Jackie ina diamond glow powder and the peach it is such a beautiful freakin color I can use it every single day I'm gonna take what I have on the top and I'm gonna pop it on to the brow bone and it's just gonna make us look a little bit more extra a little bit more glam you see I can't begin to tell you guys how much I love this diamond glow powder it is one of my favorite it is so beautiful some and take a little bit of the pink we used earlier okay so the eyes are done I'm gonna go ahead and move on to my foundation the foundation I'm using today is from G way it's the essential high coverage cream in latte [Music] okay to conceal my under eyes I'm going to take the NARS custard medium one Kuster that I used to prime my lids earlier so I'm gonna use it right in the hollow area like the ha lowest area of my eye right in there I like this concealer because it's super lightweight it's medium to full coverage you can build it up and it's just easy to work with it looks really nice on your skin it doesn't look super cakey or anything it doesn't crease it's just such a beautiful concealer also gonna use it to brighten right where the mouth is right here so giving myself a little bit of a facelift before I highlight their color range is so broad they just came out with six new shades which is so cool and then to highlight I'm gonna use Cannell this shade right here and just so you guys see what it looks like so this one is custard and this one is Cannell and that's gonna make the highlighted points of my face look that much brighter I'm gonna use one of the newer shades to contour my face just so you can see what it looks like up close it's gonna be a very natural contour and then just to set the contour in place I'm gonna go ahead and use the pur cosmetics contour diary okay so I'm gonna take the shade passion right here and work that right on the contour just to set it and also deepen it just a bit more [Music] that soft contour they did with this NARS concealer their new one it gave me such a really pretty bronzy natural glow that I'm just gonna stick with it I'm not gonna add any bronzer I'm not gonna add any blush I'm just gonna leave it how it is so the highlighter that I'm using today is one that I have been loving so much its new it's from artist couture X Jackie I know it's the diamond glow powder and lip peach so beautiful oh my gosh I'm about to show you guys why should you guys earlier on my brow bone put on the face it's insane [Music] I'm gonna take a little bit on my hand just put some on my the tip of my nose and then down the center of the nose and to set my under eyes I'm going to take charm and dream mix them together and then just set right on top of the under eye area okay it is time to make these lips look extra clumpy so I'm going to take this over lip liner and wine right here to kind of over line and just accentuate this shape [Music] I'm gonna use the new Kylie Jenner lipstick this is in the shade angel cake I'm gonna go right in the center with this because it's I know it's super pale like a pale pink I'm just gonna work it in with my finger you know her lipsticks are really creamy because this lipstick is so light I'm going right back over the corner so we don't lose the definition of the lip shade thank you guys for watching I

[Music] welcome back to my channel so today I'm giving you all the Christmas vibes this is gonna be a very festive holiday makeup look and the good thing about this makeup look no matter what shade or skin tone you are you're we're gonna look beautiful in this look because it is universally pretty on everyone also as you can see I have a really long hair today really really long I put a pull-up on Twitter and I asked you guys if you want to see a long or short hair tutorial a lot of you guys said long hair so I put in these extensions and I'm showing you how I get this holiday hair right here it's a big thank you to new me for partnering up with me in this hair tutorial because I'm going to be using their classic one such a big barrel it creates the most beautiful waves and curls in your hair maybe showing you how to get this holiday hair and makeup so if you want to see how to get it then don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video put some primers because I have dry spots red spots so I have this green one for red spots and I've never used her I'm actually opening it right now and it's green it looks like this I'm gonna just put this on my cheeks because you can see you have a lot of redness going on right there so it's gonna help counteract that red right and they're just trying to be in the holiday spirit with this red and green I have a hydrating primer just blue and I'm gonna pick that on the perimeters of my face now that I'm done with the 50 primers 50 shades of primers I'm gonna do my brows I don't think I'd do them on camera very often so I'm gonna be using the precise of my brow pencil in number 5 I'm just gonna fill in right underneath the bottom I also like to add more to my brow cuz they're really thin I'll go a little bit lower than what they are and I'll connect it to the end right here that looks kind of crazy right now and I always end up not doing my brows on camera because of this long process but I'm gonna do them on camera are you guys today and I actually curved this purposely then it's easier to use that way for me so it didn't come in like this and then I just brushed through as I go the powder makes your brows look just naturally Bowl it's a very soft kind of powder then with the foolproof brow powder using the shade number five I'll take these two shades and mix them together and I'll work it on the back part of the brow front of the brow so wipe off my brush and I'll use the front of this cute little brow and I'll work that into the front so what I'll do is I'll hold it straight like this and do these little slits so the thinnest part of the brush is the very tail end that's why I keep that one up and I have a new foundation that I want to try I'm really excited to try it I've heard really good things about it it's the Maybelline 24 hour foundation supposed to be a full coverage foundation this is in the shade I hope it's my shade sunbathe and I'm also using this sponge if you follow me on snapping to stories you know that I post a picture of this little guy right here and it's so cool-looking it's just it's like a bell honestly feels like a piece of furniture it's just like microfiber or something it's really cool feels like velvet and so I wanted to see how it would perform with foundation on my face and here we go putting on foundation with microfiber basically so whoa whoa whoa that's a lot that is a lot and I think it's because the little hairs are so close together it grabs a lot more product so once oh this is actually a lot darker than my face but it kind of matches my skin tone because my face is lighter than the rest of my body because I exfoliate it and I think I'm gonna be good with just one layer of this foundation I'm gonna add some concealer now I'm gonna do the shape tape I always do my concealer a little bit differently every time so today we're making it a tornado I really missed the point from the Beauty Blender or the LC sponge I'd rather have it pointy but you know it's okay this foundation dries really really fast for the eyes today I'm going to be using the new nars narcissist wanted palette it looks like this inside it's a very very pretty palette and I'm very excited to use this guy right here it is the most beautiful color I'm gonna use this shade right here I don't know the names that are like always backwards so I hate when they have them on the back of the palette it just confuses me so I just rather not even say it but I'm gonna use this light taupe shade right here for the crease I'm just gonna start right right in here right on the outer part of the lid and going in softly in windshield wiper motions just back and forth and then circular motion swigs the end instead of just having it on the crease I'm gonna bring it down to the bottom of the lid this whole entire outer section right here and just slightly with a very light hand like pressure circular motions just working the shade in there okay I'm just doing a wash of that color and then I'm gonna take the next darkest matte shade which is this one right here I'm gonna do the same thing just work it in the outer portion of the eye right below the lighter shade that we just use so right below you want it to peek through there and just go back and forth the next circuits color and pick up is this one right here it's like a dark brown almost black I'm gonna take that on a smaller brush some more heat in 507 and I'm just gonna work that on the outer levy I'm gonna angle it upwards towards the end of the brow just so it gives your eye more of a lifted look and then I'm going back in with a light transition shade that I used earlier in the same brush and I'm just going on the edges along the edges at the darkest shade so we can soften them out when I blend this out it almost looks like a grayish black it doesn't look so much brown to me so I'm gonna take this pencil brush right here and a maybe it'll look a little bit more true to color with this I'm gonna take it right around on the tested out right here first Stokes kind of black it's like a ashy dark brown there's one in here it's called hot cider it's in the nice palette from Kylie this one right here take a Bobbi Brown oh yeah this is more of what I'm looking for so I'll use that where the edges bring it into the crease I'm going to take the lightest shade right here I'm going to pop that on the lid now for the star of the show I'm going to be using this shade right here again this is what it looks like very pretty I'm gonna pop that on the inner corners all the way down to the lower lash line and so it shows up to its maximum potential I spread some fix+ on my brush [Music] and then I'm gonna hit a little bit more of this darker shade right on the outer part for the lashes I'm gonna go with these iris Beauty lashes right here in Cleopatra's is what they look like and I take them out of the box for the highlight I'm gonna use this zoeva strobe gel this is in the shade rewind rewind gel nova the sort of says rewind gel nova it's a really pretty kind of champagne rose gold and it feels like putty I'm just like digging my finger in there I'm gonna skip the bronzing today I'm just gonna go straight into contouring I'm gonna be using the hardest pro glow contour powders and highlights [Music] and then with a Kat Von D yellow shade to look more buttony shape literally just creating a totally different nose on my face and then with some Laura Mercier setting powder I'm gonna go in way through this guy and big right underneath my eye and I do it right on the corner of the mouth because we're tricking the eye to make it look like it's more lifted that's it for a little bit and while that's baking I'm gonna do blush instead of bronzer with this look for the blushes I'm going to use these two tart ones I'm going to mix them together this one is Dollface and this reddish one here is natural beauty I'm gonna mix the two together and it's going to give me a really nice pretty flush of color I'm gonna pick up fire and it'll it for the rest of the powder we're just gonna knock it off for the lips I'm gonna take max brick to line them up and then I'm gonna go oh my crazy and then I want to go over with the colour-pop ultra matte lip in ribbon so I'm done with my makeup now I'm gonna move on to my hair I have a ton of extensions in my head I'm gonna take this guy out I'm gonna show you how I curl my hair for the holiday so my hair is pretty crazy looking right now I actually washed all my extensions and put them in so that's why they look kind of crazy like that and a little frizzy my hair naturally is frizzy too so I'm gonna go ahead and show you how I curl my hair for the holidays when I'm wearing extensions I'm gonna be using the 32 a millimeter classic wand from nume I'm gonna brush my crazy hair out and I'm just gonna do section at a time and I'm gonna curl the bottom pieces even though my hair is super frizzy the one is gonna help smooth out all the frizziness you just click it right there to turn it on it's super easy to use and you don't even have to hold your hair in the one got long for it to curl and the good thing about this is that your curls last for like days if you don't wash your hair you're gonna have a really nice curls the next day and the next day all you need is dry shampoo and I like to have spacing in between the curls and leave a little bit out so that you don't have a tight curl all the way to the end of the hair now I'm gonna make another section I'm just gonna go around and curl the rest of my hair but anything around my face is gonna go back [Music] this is the last section gonna let it down put the rest of the hair that I already did back I think it's really cool that new he's gonna be a Knowlton now that's so crazy you can get their straighteners their their curling wands their sets all the things at Ulta I'm gonna take a little portion of it over and then just ease back combing this area so we have a little bit of height see how it doesn't just go flat in that is my holiday hair thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did go ahead and give it a big thumbs up and before I let you go I want to let you know that if

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] welcome back to my channel so today we're gonna be talking about underrated makeup makeup that is so good so bomb but nobody's talking about it these are diamonds in the rough I feel like these products aren't getting as much love as they should be getting so I'm going to show you a full face using nothing but underrated products so if you want to see how I got this look right here using the most underrated products in the universe then subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the club family and without further adue letters I'm going to talk about primer there are two primers that I really like someone to tell you about both of them I really don't hear anybody talking about the japonesque primer it is such a good primer it doesn't leave your skin feeling oily fills in pores it just makes your skin so super smooth and velvety it's called the japonesque a Velvet Touch primer and you guys have to try it and then this new primer I have to tell you guys about I actually used it in my last video from Orient's the pink perfect cream it just makes your skin look super plum it just brightens it up it gives it life and it also blurs out any imperfection so both of these guys right here you guys have to try I'm actually going to be using this one today because it's my new favorite that I just found out about but this is an old favorite that I don't ever hear anything about as you can tell I've used a lot of it I'm going to go ahead and pop this one on right here because it just makes your skin look so flawless also if you have any texture it's going to help the texture on your skin look less noticeable and it smells so good so the next underrated product I am going to talk about is this CC cream which is also from herb Oriya and it's the CC cream in illuminator if you watched my last video you could literally visibly see the difference in my skin and I have been using this ever since I came back from Korea I love it so much and I use it everyday even if I'm not wearing makeup I still use it over time it's supposed to help with the texture on your skin is so just these two together it's just such a great combination for my skin type but I don't hear anybody talking about this brand at all if anything people are like what is that brand where do I buy it from it's actually at Sephora they've just got into the u.s. I think that's why not very many people know about them but they are so great the CC cream comes out like this it's white and it has encapsulated pigments in it so when you work it into your skin it warms up to your skin's natural pH it gives you the best color for your skin tone you guys know I love my full coverage foundation I use it all the time any time I'm going to any event so this tells you a lot about this CC cream there is a nice coverage there and it looks natural and I just I'm in love with the fact that it doesn't look like I have a lot of makeup on it doesn't look like I have a cake face and it just looks like I have a nice healthy skin and the thing about this is that it is buildable so you can start off with light coverage and then you can build up the coverage and it doesn't feel like I'm just taking on makeup it feels like you're putting on more moisturizer it also has a SPF of 25 when you go out in the Sun your skin is protected its hydrated its luminous and soft it just looks like pretty skin all right so let's hide those under-eye circles I don't ever hear anybody talking about this this is from Mally Beauty it is a perfect prep under eye brightener more recently this comes in a white squeeze tube instead of this pot which i think is genius because this can get a little messy but I do really like what this does to your under eye circles helps with cancelling out that blue undertone masks the dark circles completely this is like an oldie but goodie and people if you have dark under-eye circles you need to have this in your life I am just going to work that right there just three little dots this is another product that's very hydrating and almost like skincare moreso than makeup so anything that's going to help your skin improve over time and at the same time help it look good right now instantly is awesome as you can see it automatically brightens up ever in that area it may look scary because it's bright yellow and it's in a jar you can still get it in a jar some places on Amazon Walmart if you go on Ulta or Malibu decom it will be in a white squeeze tube so just to let you guys know what to look out for and it looks so natural okay so let's get those brows in shape they're all over the place so I'm going to go ahead and use two products that I don't see anybody talking about on YouTube or very rarely do they mention these products the first thing is this brow and liner brush I feel like I talked about this a lot but I don't see anyone else this is from blink it's their brow liner duo brush the brush is super narrow and the spoolie is so tightly packed with these bristles that it just pulls all the brow hairs up and you actually feel like it's working as a spoolie should rather than just kind of sometimes when I see spoolie is I'm just like eh they don't really work how a spoolie should work this one actually does its job so that's why I really like this brow brush that nobody talks about have it in your life it's awesome I'm also going to use this right here this is from Wet n Wild you can tell that I use it a lot I've actually already lost the top it just broke off thing that I really like about this palette isn't the top it's the product inside this is from wet and wild it's the ultimate brow kit I love it so so much there's so many other really amazing brow products than if it has awesome stuff honest Asya for an affordable price this guy is so good there's a reason why I keep coming back to it it's super affordable stays in place all day I love the shades in the little compact they always match my brows perfectly so I'm just going to go ahead and fill in my brows with this really quick I'm gonna move on to the eyeshadow now I feel like nobody talks about cargo as much as they should talk about cargo at all I don't see it on YouTube very much if you see it please let me know in the comments I don't get to see every single youtuber on YouTube but they have really good high-quality eyeshadows which trips me out I've had the essential palette from cargo for a while and I love it they're all more of a cooler tone side but they're so pretty they're very pigmented they're me they're really really nice shadows they just recently launched this palette right here it's such a pretty like festive summery looking palette it looks like this inside it's so beautiful look at the shades so many crease shades lid shades they're shimmery shades all the shades that I want there's pops of color it's a gorgeous palette I'm going to be using this palette to create an eye shadow look today on my eye so the first colors I'm going to pick up in this palette are wakiki right here and hibiscus I'm going to take that in with a crease brush from the makeup shock which is another brand that I feel like not many people talked about but it's they have really great brushes so I'm going to take this brush right here this is from the makeup shock it's the t44 and I'm going to use that to blend these shades into my crease I'm going to go in with another crease shade this one is Tiki it's the darker Brown and on a makeup Shakti 63 brush is more of a detailed crease brush work that color into the outer crease I'm going to kind of extend it out a little bit past the crease so we can make the lot of the eyes look a little bit more elongated now what I'm going to do is take hibiscus right here this is the t44 brush and then I'm going to work it on the entire rest of the lid and all the way around the darker Brown I'm also going to bring it down on the lower lash line as well and then on the bottom lash line I'm going to take this color right here this is Chi take that and pop it on to the outer part of the lid I mean the outer part of the lower lash line and then on the inner corners I'm going to take hoola and for that top for the brow bone I'm going to take Hapuna I'm going to go right under the brow bone I just want to jump my eye in this high and Apple yellow shade it's so pretty it's like a burnt yellow pineapple I'm gonna go ahead and line my lashes I found the most darkest creamiest eyeliner it's this one right here from M cosmetics I don't see much hype on this eyeliner but super dark very creamy and take it right along the upper lash line and also on the lower lash line this eyeliner is super creamy so I'm gonna go ahead and smoke it out with just a little liner brush just to smudge it out it almost reminds me of a gel liner because it's just so creamy now we need to put some drama on our lashes so I'm going to use these ones right here these are the makeup Shaq lashes in style Miami and they are so clashes I don't hear people talking about their lashes at all I just I mean the brushes I've seen few people will talk about them not really too crazy but their lashes I definitely have haven't heard anything from and they have really nice lashes so I'm just going to pop these on really quick and show you what they look like they're nice full and wispy they're really easy to apply they just pop on your lashes they're not too curved and there's not too much you have to cut off okay the next thing we're going to talk about is the Frankie rose contour palette which I don't hear anything about at all it's a pigmented palette it easily blends in with the other shades looks like this there are six shades in here a banana shade a cream shade this is a highlight and then these three down here or contour colors to me I feel like this can be actually just like a powder for the entire face to probably clean it honestly before I show you guys a little bit better has like a magnetic closure on it so it closes right away I'm gonna use the yellow shade to really lock in and brighten the under eye and then I'm going to bring it down around the corners of the mouth where it's kind of dark in this area just to brighten that up to contour the cheeks I'm going to take tempting and heated and do a light shade right under the cheekbone bring it around the temple I love how it gives me an extra layer of coverage contour colors are very natural looking and just blend into the skin so easy always love to put on a nice bronzer I've have heard some people talk about this but it's not like crazy all over the place but the Physicians Formula butter bronzer is so nice also the Rimmel natural bronzer is a bronzer that I really like and I go to so if you're looking for a a nice affordable bronzer these two are my favorites this gives you more of a I just got out of the Sun finished tanning kind of glow so I let really like this for that but this one I feel like you can even contour with if you wanted to this one is more natural-looking and this one is a little bit more of it I just finished tanning in the tanning bed so either one of these are going to be a really nice pick for you guys if you want a nice affordable bronzer oh this one smells so good though I'm going to take this one because it smells so amazing and smells just get me going so I'm going to go ahead and pop that onto my cheeks just to bronze up my skin give it some color and bring it around the temples I think city color has a wide range of really good products but they have really nice matte blushes they have shimmery blushes this is more of a rustic bronzy blush palette but then they also have this kind of rosy one right here which is going to give you like a nice pretty flush of color and I take the lightest shade and pop that onto my cheese this is from the brand Golani I was so Lord whenever I just watched this highlight right here this is the celestial skin luminizing powder in teeth and I'm just going to swatch it for you guys right on my hand actually swatched it in my last video oh it is beautiful they also have in love most intense Instagram highlights that I have seen in a really long time they're not as big for one because when you look at the packaging it just gives you a data to feel but the product inside it is so good they'll like the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer of highlights right now Bobby Brown liquid lips they're so cute it literally looks like a crayon how adorable is that it's like a little squeezy tube so i'm Sampath on you can throw this in your bag they're super easy to travel with it's just such a cool innovative way to use the liquid lipstick just really like it it's called the art stick liquid lipstick thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did thumbs it up and don't forget to check out the other videos to the side if you haven't

my heart afire hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm doing a full face of only using Bobbi Brown cosmetics and this is the first impressions for me because I don't really have much of Bobby Brown and this is the first time because I'm really using a lot of it and it's so funny that it's the first time because Bobby Brown was the first makeup artist book that I bought as a teenager and I learned so much from it how to cover temple concealing Foundation braces like all kinds of stuff so it's really cool that they actually reached out to me to do a video with them and so I'm really excited to test things out and what I'm really really excited about is this concealer because they're saying it's supposed to be like magic maximum coverage concealer and you guys know I love full coverage concealers so especially anything that's gonna cover these under-eye circles I want to test this out and see how it works for us and if you want to learn how to get this look right here don't forget to subscribe to my channel hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on I'm gonna start off by getting this skin together real quick so I'm just gonna put a light layer of foundation so I'm gonna use the skin and net foundation SPF 15 from Bobbi Brown and this is in the shade 4.25 tan I have so many breakouts right now please don't judge my skin this is a very light formula just bounce that on really quick wow this is a very lightweight foundation I'm gonna need a little bit more coverage so I'm gonna have to go in with another layer see how than it is like water almost this one is gonna be one of those buildable foundations everything looks nice and even so I'm gonna just do my brows so this is the long wear brow gel right here and this is in the shade rich Brown looks like that and I'm gonna go in with my little brush and just fill in my brows supernatural oh my god this is the cutest little mirror you see yourself I feel like that's gonna be a little too read kind of like keeping the brows in place at the same time filling them in this is nice I just wish I had a little bit more coverage for the brows and I'm gonna go over with powder moving on to the under eyes I'm about to do some work some magic on my under eyes right now we're gonna make them disappear hopefully so what I'm gonna do is take the micro-mini be blender and I just wet it without wetting it once you wet it gets twice the size gets pretty big and I like this for concealing and for contouring or highlighting if you want to use creams this one fits right in that area so perfectly so I'm gonna go ahead and take this little guy to apply the concealer after I squeeze it squeeze all the water out of it I then Pat it dry with either a little towel or a paper towel then I use it on my face just to make sure there isn't any excess moisture or wetness in there so I'm gonna go ahead and use the instant full cover concealer from Bobbi Brown know how I am with my concealers so let's try this guy out and see how it works on our face okay so I have a few shades with me they actually have like 15 different shade ranges I'm gonna go ahead and try this one in the middle right here this is beige this is supposed to be maximum coverage so I'm going to start by applying it right in the inner corners this is my darkest area so I'm going to focus it right here dot it right down here and right up here I'm also gonna do is to I'm highlighting with it so I'm gonna go down the nose like that right in between the brows get that Cupid's bow right on the chin okay so now I'm just gonna work it in with the micro-mini I'm gonna use the smaller side for write on the inner corners I'm just gonna dab it in this concealer feels super lightweight on the skin having a more full coverage concealer it makes the face less cakey and it really just focuses on where you need it adding that in there fits right in those inner corners so perfectly and then I'm gonna go right in here okay yes this concealer literally is so good and it's super lightweight but you can tell the coverage is it's an intense coverage whoa this concealers really nice under eyes are concealed life is good I'm gonna go in with this eye shadow right here in shell Pat everything in place okay the first transition color I'm going to use is this one in toast so I'm gonna take this color right here and I'm gonna work that all over the lid all the way up into a little bit past the crease this is a really pretty color especially for like a transition shade okay and then from toast I'm gonna go in with camel and I'm gonna work that from the lid up into the crease so I'm just using patting motions because I want to focus the color on the lid but we do want to take it up into the crease a little bit and now I'm gonna go in with the darkest round that I have which is black plum which to me looks like Brown is this shade right here so I'm gonna go right on the lid and just pack it on and if you want some guidance to see where your socket is if you just tilt your head back a little bit you can kind of see where that bone sticks out if you still feel like you can't see it you can always just make your own little socket all right so I'm gonna move down to the lower part of my lash line just because it's very I got really heavy really quick up here so I just want to make sure that it's balanced on the bottom of my lash line so I'm just gonna take some of the Brown and work it right underneath there so I'm gonna take this black shade right here I'm gonna go and line the waterline and on the tight line as well the next thing I'm going to go in with is eyeliner it's this sparkling golden bronze color it's so pretty but I'm just worried that it won't show up on my actual eyelid but we're gonna try it out anyways I put on some mascara and lashes off-camera and then I will be back and we're gonna do the rest of our face so now I'm gonna go ahead and set the outer perimeters of my face I set my under eyes already so I'm going to take this bronzing powder in natural one so I'm gonna grab this with my fan brush and just go right on the cheekbones and right on the temples I feel like I haven't been highlighting as much on my channel I'm just going through like a different kind of phase with my skin but I found this highlighting powder it's called bronzed glow look how beautiful it is what the Sun start right here on the Cupid's bow right on the nose and then right here last but not least are the lips so I'm gonna take this nude lip pencil line up my lips and this is their lip pencil and nude I'm gonna take this lip color right here in neutral rows and go over with a little bit of gloss this is in nude 8 I've been loving glossy lips lately so I'm just gonna layer a whole bunch of that stuff on fried chicken with [Music] thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did thumbs it up

[Music] which one do you like better really you like the bold side yeah rather than this side Korean no it's not it's totally different well it kind of seems like a very soft well everybody else doesn't like his dramatic makeup we're just so extra hey guys welcome back to my channel so today as you can see as you can tell by the title of this video and my face this is the American versus French makeup tutorial I just recently went to Paris for a Paris Fashion Week and I was able to see the style of makeup I also just did a ton of research looking up how they do their makeup and everybody pretty much has the same idea natural glowing skin either a bold lip and natural eye or a wing and a natural lip basically the French like to embrace what they already have but on the american side as you can see we are so extra we do a bold dramatic eyes bold lips contoured sculpted face highlight to the gods and this side is just very natural glowing from within I was born like this and I just woke up flawless to give you guys a quick update as you know I released a sneak peak on my Instagram about my cosmetic line dominique cosmetics it is coming very soon making any type of makeup is a very long process I've been working on it for a year now and I'm still down to the bone analyzing everything making sure everything is perfect before you guys get it you want more updates or sneak peeks I will be releasing a sneak peek very very soon on dominica Beauty which is the Instagram for dominique cosmetics so make sure to follow that instagram i'll have it below in case you guys are wondering what the updates are when the latte palette is coming out even saying that just makes my heart so happy so that's a little update on my cosmetic line back to these half-and-half makeup if I go to another country which I travel pretty often I will be doing this right here so if you want to see how I got this look don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification Belle's need to be a part of the quad family and without further ado we're gonna get on intermarry you like longevity of makeup on her face I'm gonna take this primer right here from Smashbox and I'm gonna work that into my skin like this because it is a little bit of the thicker formula that gets into those large pores so it's gonna fill them in and make them look like one even surface it's also gonna help my makeup last longer for the French side they usually like to use BB creams or CC creams on their face nothing too heavy what I've read and what I've seen when I was in France a lot of them just really embraced some natural skin and if they have flaws it's very minimal they're really into skin care so the micellar water is really big they're a really good moisturizer and then just something that's going to give your skin and even look and a nice healthy looking glow is what they go for so for coverage on the French side of my face I'm gonna use something with moisturizer something that's going to give my skin a little bit more of an even look and hide a little bit of blemishes but not a full layer of coverage so I'm going to use the origins tinted moisturizer and this is a sheer tint release so it comes out white but as you work it into your skin it works into the natural shade of your skintone little dots around the face like this or if you need a little bit more coverage like I feel like I do I'll just put on a little bit more of the BB cream it's all about looking as natural as possible still want your skin to peek through we want it just to look hydrated healthy and glowing not like American glow not like the I went on blind the haters kind of glow oh this is more like a natural soft glowing from within kind of glow this tinted moisturizer is perfect for that you can still see blemishes but they're not as intense and the skin overall just looks even and just a little bit more healthy so for the American side we're gonna take it on normally do this is my life I love the cake so for that I'm going to take this YSL foundation right here this is a full-coverage foundation please ignore my nail I know I'm gonna use our imagination and pretend for a second and you're gonna start to see that my skin flaws are disappearing with this side you can still see the skin peeking through and we're kind of just embracing our skin what it's going through and on this side we're covering it up so basically we're just extra American girls are just I feel like I need to frame my face before I go any further so I'm gonna go into the brows for the brows and using the brow is it from anastacio and dark brown and I'm just gonna comb through this foundation that I got on my eyebrow and then on this side I'm just literally brushing upwards cuz that's very natural in these parts so on the French side they usually like to just fill in the sparse areas define the natural brow shape a little bit further but they don't touch the top at all comb upwards so they look nice and groomed follow that natural shape of the brow the other thing is not to change how your face naturally flows so if your brow is going up and around you just follow that natural flow of your brow so I'm just going to do the bottom a little bit it's more about enhancing the natural shape and showing that you know your brow is alive and naturally okay I don't know this thing just broke so I don't know how that happened or this side of my face I would be adding and filling in and shaping and carving out so I'm gonna fill in the sparse areas you create little brow hairs here I'm actually gonna use this brush just because this one this fully broken is just a little bit easier to use this one to fill in so I'm just gonna use the benefit to goof proof brow pencil then we're going to carve out the brow so I have my tart sheet tape and I'm gonna put a little bit on the back of my hand first starting off with I light the brow and carpet out and then we're going to do the bottom so now we're here we're just going to put some on the lid so that everything is nice and even we're gonna have a clear even canvas for our eyeshadow then I'm just gonna work my Beauty Blender right on top of that and that is the brow for the American side very dramatic very intense and structured so for this side of the eye right here I'm gonna start on applying a little bit a little bit of eyeshadow I did not see anybody with eyeshadow at all if any eyeshadow is used it's definitely a very soft crease shade so I'm gonna take the morphe 3 502 palette I'm gonna take this shade right here which is the lightest shade in the palette and I'm just gonna work that right through the crease for definition I want to use the Charlotte Tilbury palette I'm changing it up a bit I honestly think those are too warm for the French side so I'm taking smoke I'm gonna add a little bit more into the crease just add a little bit more depth and right in here I'm actually gonna bring the smoke and I'm gonna bring it right on top the lash line just to add a little bit more definition and then on this side right here is very appropriate to lose the morphe palette for this so I'm gonna take these two shades work them in my crease lovely warm shades here in the US so I'm gonna take those and just wash that right into my crease grab a few more crease shades because you like really defined creases so I'm going to take this Brown right here now I'm gonna grab a darker Brown something really dark let's go with this shade right here focus that on the outer part of the crease down into the lid and then right on the inner part of the lid I'm going to take this brush wheeze or to carve out our crit burn brow and we're gonna just carve out right where our crease would start so right in here and these bring in a concealer down I don't want to bring it all the way and just right on the inner third and then right on top I'm going to add this rose gold it's gonna be a vibrant intense shimmery lid now I'm gonna just deepen up the crease with this black I'm gonna add eyeliner to this side of the eye because we like our wings so I'm gonna do a dramatic wing to add to the drama on this side of the eye it kind of feels nice knowing that I don't have to line up this wing to match this one so I feel like I can just do whatever and go crazy with it one thing I notice is that they like to use an eyelash curler every single time they do their lashes because this is basically all that they do on their eye unless it's a wing so I'm gonna curl my lashes before I put on mascara on this side and to really get the maximum curl out of your lash I like to pump the mascara and then start to move it but I usually put on some mascara right away just to prep for lashes the lashes I'm putting on are from Lily lashes and actually this is my travel wash so I have a few in here and I think these are Miami I'm not mistaking Miami's are a popular lash to wear in the u.s. but they're just such a beautiful lash I would wear them no matter where I'm from so while that dries I'm gonna go to the French side of my face and I'm gonna start to put on a mascara this mascara is a really good one saman 'yes this one from Maybelline it's the colossal Big Shot the makeup Shayla one and baddest black is my all-time favorite one I use it all the time so I'm just gonna use that and we wiggle up my brush from the base up into the top okay I'm gonna let that dry and then curl them again so that's pretty much it for the eyelids now I'm gonna work on the concealer because I want to get down to the lower lash line heart-shaped tape is a must it's very full coverage it is thick and it covers everything to the Instagram kind of makeup here while we're here we're just gonna highlight this little area right on there and the chin the Cupid's bow I'm gonna let that sit for a second and then on the French side I'm going to use the NARS radiant creamy concealer and I'm just gonna do a little bit right in here to brighten it up so this is the difference between the two so I'm gonna come over here on this side and start to work that in you like our faces to look highlighted in every aspect contoured and just very dramatic I learned from the French that they don't like to use brushes really this doesn't go for everybody but from what I've seen the majority don't like to use brushes and they'll use their hands or their fingertips somebody's mine use this fingers since it's nail free and this is only for people who have dark under-eye circles if you don't have dark under-eye circles concealing is not even necessary we're gonna mix this shade right here with this one and we're gonna put that right on the lower lash line and then I'm gonna add a black eyeliner right on the waterline some mascara on and my lower lashes and then for the inner corner we like bright highlights and this looks like a bright shade right here I can add that to the inner corner of my eye so I'm gonna go into with smoke for the French side I'm just gonna add a little bit of color right on the lower lash line right on the outer part of the lower lash line I'm just blending the edges out add mascara to the lower lashes my lashes are pretty dry so I'm gonna go back over them with a lash curler and then just clamp them down this tie looks a lot more wide awake and fresh this one is just ready to party or the American side we are gonna contour because contouring is contouring is everything for that I've been using the offensive Beauty contour stick in mocha the cheekbone with like high cheekbones temple this side of the nose everything has to be sculpted defined we slimmed down the nose right there and bam we're done with our contouring on this side of the face they don't really contour but they do bronze I'm gonna use this bronzer from NARS and I'm gonna use this on my cheeks just to add some color into the cheeks I just look like two different people to me right now what about you they go for more of that golden bronze I've seen almost every French makeup artist use a cream blush I'm gonna use this cream blush from Stila this is the shade petunia I'm going to add a very tiny amount of that to the cheeks nothing heavy at all literally the smallest amount because you don't like pink cheeks as they don't want to look super young and they want to look like mature women so a really young baby doll kind of look is not something that they go for so I just took a little bit of that just to add like a natural glow and flush to the cheeks for this side of the face we are not done yet setting everything in place with the powder version of what I just did to contour and highlight some needs the kat von d palette for that and I'm just going to go really fast through that and then personally I like to use more of warm-toned bronze so I'm using the bronze goddess from estée lauder on this side to bronze up the face it has a little bit more of a warm tone to it and then for blush I'm gonna use this powder blush from Kylie who loved us and Kylie because they like more of a natural dewy looking highlight I'm gonna use peach frost from Too Faced it's a it's called a melting powder highlight so it's a very natural-looking highlight so I'm going to take this shade right here and just work that on my cheeks it's gonna be very soft and then on this side we love our highlight we want to blind people with our highlight these two actually I'm gonna use the one from Mac this is the oh darling extra dimension skin finish on my cheek we want to blind our haters and the tip of the nose right above the brow Cupid's bow chin and then I'm gonna take because we are so extra here I'm gonna take the artist Couture diamond glow powder and cocoa gang it's something you want to wear when you're just feeling yourself when you wear this so the difference between the highlights is very extreme and then for this side of the face I'm going to use the Kylie liquid lip because you love Kylie's lips but first I'm going to line up the lips this is the makeup forever number 14 lip liners in case you guys are wondering and then I'm gonna put on it is Kylie velvet liquid lipstick in boysenberry and that is the completed look for the American side and for the last but definitely not least French side of the face so French usually go for the natural lip and the very small flick of the wing or they go for the bold lip and the very natural looking eye so since we went the natural looking eye I'm gonna go for a bold lip and for that I'm going to use the L'Oreal infallible and this is in the shade Matador I'm going to take this and they love reds I noticed that a lot of them like red that is a really pretty and this red will not go anywhere because trust me it is hard to take off [Music] thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did go ahead and give me a big thumbs up thumbs up is a hug too nice let's see how many

finish the shadows I was like okay I liked it when I saw this color it was love at first sight I was like oh I have to put this on my lips right now and it was that dramatic so I put it on my lips it's kind of drying out right now which is making me really sad but I put it on my ill what's going on here I put it on my teeth because it was so good I put it on my lips and I was like okay this is the best holiday look I have ever seen I really like it I feel like anybody can wear it if you're scared of color and you want to incorporate it into your look this is perfect smoking out a wing it's really flattering and very pretty so I know you guys are going to love this look and if you want to learn how to get it then keep watching hey there hey guys welcome back to my channel hello can you hear me alright let's get into this tutorial today so I'm gonna go ahead I already put on the moisturizer I'm gonna put on a little bit of this japonesque primer on my face just so that our foundation lays down nice and even it fills in all the little bumps and holes in our face I'm gonna go in with my Mac foundation this is Studio Fix fluid shave tape where are you I'm going to cover my under-eye circles with some shape tape and I'm using a light medium she is ready for war I'm going to jump into the eye shadow I'm so excited because we're going to be using her new palette and here is the palette at the Chi shadow palette this is the holiday collection 2016 palak where's the tears crying are the colors that are inside of the palette which look like this there's a format and 5 shimmers I'm gonna be using this one to start off with I'm going to use that all over my lid and take a shader brush this is my morphe m-52 4 I like to use this whenever I'm using one shade all over my lid because it gets that light look at this it's huge and I always like to use a base like this because it just makes it easier to blend out the shadows everything glides on a lot more smoothly and it also helps with setting any creams that you have on your lids this shadow is one of the mount ones and it's called chestnut of our lids are sets you can move on to the color I'm going to start off with this Bobby shade right here this is sugar cookie and I'm going to use that on the crease use my morphe and 5:05 brush to apply that to the crease working my brush in there tap off the excess and I'm going to start to work that right in the crease area just gonna warm up the crease with this really pretty blush tone shade I never have too much fallout with Kylie's palettes and then after sugar cookie I'm going to pick up this dark brown shade I'm going to focus that on the outer part of the crease to right in the air I'm actually going to bring it in a little heavier to create a cat eye effect it's a very slanted cat eye it looks a little chunky right now but we're going to blend it out I'm going to start to blend that darker Brown out a little bit softer and then with this right here this is a Smith 220 it's gonna clean that line up make it as soft as possible I haven't decided if I'm going to work in the blue or the green yet because I want a pop of color I just don't know which way I want to go yet okay I'm going into the greens called evergreen I'm going to take this green shadow and I'm going to work that over the brown I'm gonna work that over the brown and then fade it up and honestly I'm just making this up as I go so we'll see what we come up with at the end of this tutorial we're just marrying these two guys together whether they like it or not okay so have a little fan brush I'm going to take sugar cookie with it the sugar cookie is our transition shade and that one's going to help us create those nice gradient effects and it's going to help your makeup basically look more like a celebrity makeup I'm going to use this more feet r44 brush and I'm going to take that darker shade of brown this one is called Gingerbread connecting the lower lash line to that wing like so so I'm going to take the green I'm going to work that on to the outer part of the lower lash line and then I'm going to go back into the brown it's a lot of back and forth until you get a really nice blend I'm actually going to go right underneath this line with sugar cookies going to give it a little bit more I'm going to sweat my brush with some fix+ I'm going to use winter which is that blue shade right there and I'm going to work that on my waterline I don't know if you're supposed to do this or not I'm just doing it we're going to see what it comes out like we actually could probably mix it into the lash line a little bit it's giving it an iridescent look which I like so we're going to keep working it very close to the lash waterline area it's actually giving us is a really pretty dark turquoise look I feel like this is a very simple easy look that I'm coming out with but it's a really nice way to work in colors if you are not comfortable with wearing a lot of color on your eye using it as eyeliners is like the best way to do it and for a pop of shimmer I'm going to go ahead and take the middle shade which is frosty that's silver color and I will pop it on to the inner corners of my eyes so I'm going to take this BH Cosmetics 118 brush and start to work that on the inner corners about this mascara in from Maybelline's is called the colossal Big Shot colossal mascara I used to use in the yellow and purple tube for a very long time it was so much my staple that Cesar already knew what to get me if I was running out of mascara I'm really curious to try out with the Big Shot colossal supposed to be like and they just keep making it better and better they had this spider effect one which was okay to me this one is what was the one that I really like so I've been on some lashes from House of lashes and they're actually in the wrong boxes this is the iconic box which is the wrong box because the lashes look like this I think these are the heartbreaker lashes they're very light and wispy so I'm going to go ahead and put this on my eyes and I will be right back it bugs me if my skin is showing on my lash line so what I'm doing is taking the this is one of Kylie's clay pot liners filling in all the skin when you do this to a new tight line it makes your lashes look lush and full so I'm going to do that to have to look down so I'm going to be looking this way from you guys can you see though I'm just pulling up my lash my eye and filling it in so I'm going to go ahead and set my face I'm going to be using this really beautiful packaged powder from Pierre look at that that is gorgeous when I'm setting my foundation I like to just hat the powder on so I'm just patting everything down and then to set my under eyes I use the shade and light contour palette okay so I'm going to take this powder right here in this banana shade mix them together and then look up and pass this under my eye this is going to brighten up your under eyes set all the cream underneath your eye and after this your makeup should not budge at all and then we're going to brighten up around the mouth you can't go wrong with a Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer so I'm going to go ahead and take some of this with my morphe and 500 brush and warm up my face I always love putting this stuff on because it smells like chocolate and then a 4 above the lush I'm gonna keep this really pretty cute Too Faced love flush but love flush a blush and funfetti and this is a cute little baby pink packaging my favorite color is baby pink and inside is a cute blush it actually comes with a two-faced blush brush too so I'm going to use it for fun because it's so cute and I'm going to work it on to my cheekbones just going to line my lips so I'm going to line my lips with vixen start out the Cupid's bow make a sharp V what the heck we're going to make a bow we're going to make it a Christmas present today so I'm gonna put on Blitzen whoo it smells good I am in lust with this book right now and I think I'm going to skip out on the highlight today just because I'm liking this matte look with matte lip you guys are watching I hope you

[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today is super exciting ok I have never ever had this much expensive makeup in my hands ever in my life and I am gonna be testing expensive extreme expensive high-end makeup on one side of my face and the other side I'm gonna be doing nothing but drugstore I don't know about you but I think they look pretty similar except for a few little things just a few little things okay so you guys we are using Tom for Dior Givenchy like super expensive expand its it's expensive so I'm really excited to show you guys I have never ever spent as much money on makeup in my life to be honest I want you guys to let me know which side do you think is high-end and which side do you think is drugstore I'm gonna give you one side here okay and then here's the other side there's both sides okay now pause the video comment below which side do you think is drugstore which side do you think is high-end go ahead I'll be waiting as soon as I upload this video I'm gonna check everybody's comments to see which ones you think it is I think it's super exciting to see what your thoughts are on the makeup my personal thoughts you will see later in this video there are some pros and cons and I will let you know what I think about everything in the video but if you want to see how I got this look right here see which side is really drugstore don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bow so you can be a part of the quad family and without fruits I know this isn't your quad you guys I know it's a long story I know this is not the quad but we are the quad family only the quads get it the few the strong the quads and without further ado let's get in to this extreme high-end verse drugstore so I'm actually really excited to get into this because this is the most high-end I've ever used in my life for the high-end side I'm gonna use the mr. smooth smoothing primer from Givenchy it's so fast I'm gonna put this on right here this primer is pretty thick make sure to get exactly half of my face instantly it definitely absorbs quickly it plums the skin it definitely feels like a baby's butt it's just like bouncing back for this side of my face I'm gonna use this primer from Rimmel it's the lasting finish primer this primer actually feels this same on the skin it has that thick consistency and this is supposed to have that smoothing effect on your skin as well so this is really crazy it feels the exact same balance is back this one doesn't absorb into the skin as quickly as this one this one's already like gone so there goes the primers okay so I'm gonna go onto the brows the next expensive eyebrow pencil I have is from YSL I feel so bougie right now this is a while-- eyebrow pencil oh my god I think number five has a little spoolie on the end like that so I'm going to start to fill in my brows on the bougie side the color is really nice and natural I really like the color of this usually brow pencils are a little bit too warm and not ashy enough or they're too ashy to wear they're basically gray but this one seems to match perfectly with my hair glides on the skin pretty nice I really love this color it's not just a dry pencil it has enough wax enos to it that it will actually grab the hairs and press them in place which is something that I really like and I love the color of this brow pencil it just matches my hair so perfect this is it this is good sad because I don't think I'm gonna buy you all the time but you're a good one for the more affordable side of my face I'm gonna use the Rimmel eyebrow pencil in the shade dark brown so I'm gonna just go in there and start to fill in my brows this one is a little worn it looks a little red this one isn't waxy but it's very smooth it's not gonna hold your brows in place but it'll definitely fill them in totally different brow colors completely different I definitely see the difference this is definitely not a do because of the wax enos and I feel like this is gonna this feels like it's gonna stay in place this one is just hanging out for the high-end version of my face I'm going to use the Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation we all know this is a good one this is in the shade of 5.75 I'm going to take some on the back of my hand and use my beauty blender start to work that on my face I like the formula it's really lightweight it's creamy and it just sits really nice on the skin I feel like this foundation is good for like a day or night time kind of look just wear a light layer and you'll be good for the day and it just looks natural and pretty or you can build it up with a Beauty Blender and really pack it in to the skin and get more of a medium coverage I think this is such a beautiful creamy lightweight foundation I can't say any more about it you guys know it is so good I'm going to use the infallible Pro glow from L'Oreal this is supposed to give you that luminosity as well so I'm gonna try this on the back of this hand and instead of using a Beauty Blender on the side I'm gonna use an elf sponge see how that looks for us I could see why they're calling it a glow because obviously it gives you that loo luminous dewy look but I don't think this will work for everybody especially if you have textured skin like mine right here it kind of accentuates everything so I'm gonna go ahead and jump into the eye shadow palette the eye shadow palette that I picked up that is high-end this is the most expensive shadow file that I've ever bought in my life all of these products are the most expensive products and they ever bought in my entire life I bought the Natasha de Nonna palette and this is the purple and blue eyeshadow palette it is so expensive it's two hundred and thirtysomething dollars it has the names of the shades on this little paper and these are the eyeshadows i've swatched a lot of them and they are so freakin beautiful oh my gosh they are silky creamy pigmented when you swatch them they go on so even and beautiful i absolutely love these whoo with saying that i feel like this is a lot of colors and it's almost overwhelming to look at what do i do first purple blue the only thing about this palette doesn't have a transition shade in it for being so extreme expensive there is no transition shade I mean you can use there's some matte shades here and then there's this brown but it's not really matte but I feel like I could still get away with it being like a transition shade it's more of a silky kind of shadow so I'm gonna start off with this color right here which is cool plum I'm gonna work that all over the lid up into the crease this is just gliding on I so soft and smooth like butter oh my gosh I don't think this pallet is gonna do it for me for the crease but I do have this one from ELF it's the Aqua Beauty palette looks like this these are also super pigmented and I definitely recommend you guys go and get this elf aqua palette because it is extremely pigmented you will not be unsatisfied with this palette so I'm gonna go ahead and use this shade right here I feel like that's sort of similar to poor plum I'm gonna put them side by side so you guys can see what I'm talking about these are the closest that I can get and they both have that like satiny kind of finish to them so I'm gonna go ahead and use a different eye shadow brush for this eye you're gonna go ahead and work that the same way that we did the other eye shadow it's not as pigmented but it glides on the skin beautifully just like the other one and it's a nice transition I just think this eyes gonna look slightly different so there is this deep plum color right here if you haven't tried the maybelline city mini palettes you definitely have to try them out I'm gonna take this shade right here this matte shade and just start to work that on the crease on the outer V of the eye and I'm gonna make it go to a little point right here to give it more of a sultry look now go ahead and blend this guy out I could see this palette is so creamy and pigmented that it may get patchy in certain spots like I can see it already getting a little patchy but it is pigmented and they are creamy there's just something about it sticking to the oil of my skin maybe in certain areas but it is a really nice pallet my blending brush and just start to soften out those edges I'm gonna go on to the other eye I'm gonna use that purple right here I'm gonna use this little guy and work it on the outer part of the eye bringing it in this is gonna look a little different because it doesn't have that plum undertone this is more of a warm Brown I definitely like the color of this one more than this one right here definitely looks different on the eye compared to the pan it just looks great like a totally different color almost blue which is really interesting hmm so I'm gonna add more on this side now see if that makes a difference totally different I look completely different it looks like I have a blue eye and a purple eye let's see how this ends up for us okay so now for the lid I think I'm gonna do this beautiful beautiful color right here for the lid so so pretty I'm gonna use that on the inner part of the lid let me do a close-up of it so this one right here and then in the Natasha Danone a palette where is this shade right here that is kind of similar to this shade that's the color that I'm gonna put on the inner corners so far they look totally different but you know let's see how we end up so I'm gonna start off with the high-end side I'm gonna take this I shower brush from the makeup shock the t48 and I'm gonna work that in there it's like a really pretty gunmetal color I'm telling you these eye shadows are in sane oh my god if you are to go to Sephora and swatch this palette you would fall in love you would really fall in love and you'd be like why's it that looks good I was I was like very hesitant to buy this because it's $200 there's a $200 palette you guys it's very curious to see how it would compare to a drugstore brands on the other eye I'm gonna take and work it into that shade and I'm still working on my eye let's see what this looks like okay so far it looks kinda similar not as pigmented but maybe it's buildable and then I'm just going to blend out those edges so they're not so far I'm liking this I compared to this one just because of that plum shade kind of is not really the shade that it looks like in the palette okay so next I'm going to take this gorgeous blue shade right here and I'm gonna pop that on my lower lash line I actually already started doing that but my camera turned off out of nowhere so I'm gonna go ahead and work that on my lower lash line I'm gonna bring that all the way in I'm gonna take that crease or the first shade we started off with as the base and work that right underneath and then I'm gonna go on the other eye on the side with the Maybelline Maybelline city mini palette I'm gonna take this blue right here and pop it on on this side for the fancy side I'm gonna use the hourglass liquid eye pen right here and then for this side I'm gonna use the L'Oreal voluminous liner nor liquid eyeliner let's see if they act the same they look like this they're the same basically let's see which one works better let me start with the bougie side I have no complaints on this one it works good it glides on it's very black and it's really easy to work with so [Music] since I'm not comparing lashes or mascara I'm just gonna pop those on really quick and then but if you want to know which style I already know you guys are gonna want to know I will always have it in the description do not worry but I will be back with some lashes and we are going to go on to the rest of our face so now I'm going to take a black liner to the waterline for this side I'm going to use the Givenchy black magic pool liner and just place it right in that waterline I'd have to say that this is just like a regular black pencil it's creamy its pigmented it's just like any other black pencil I feel like you can have the same quality at the drugstore so I'm gonna go ahead and use the Rimmel waterproof black eye liner it takes a few more swipes but it pretty much ends up the same move onto the concealer the concealer I have the Guerlain I think this I say it Guerlain concealer it is the hydrant multi perfecting concealer in blurring effect I'm all about the blurs go ahead and work that with my finger which is full of eye shadow so and I have this big long nail so I'm just gonna use the smaller side of my beauty blender to work that into this area right here this little tiny area this is kind of amazing it fills in all the creases also my under eyes feel more plump and it's like instant on the drugstore side I'm using the Maybelline master conceal I'm gonna put that on with this side which I think it's a little bit too big but it's a little bit lighter than the other one so this looks a little more natural but it does really conceal the under eyes and it's a very light weight on this side I'm going to use the Dior extreme control powder I'm gonna just start to work this into my skin so we can set all the creams in place it doesn't look cakey at all it doesn't even look powdery then on this side I'm gonna use the fit me powder from Maybelline store foundations and powders are always a little off for my skin tone so this one is a little pinky for the high-end side for contouring today on this side of my face i'm using the Natasha de Nona contouring sculpting powder looks like so and I'm going to use my brush right here to work that onto the face we start like right in at the hollow really close to the ear and then work my way upwards this is a very natural looking contour shade for me and then for this side of my face the elf bronzer [Music] so now we're moving on to the blush I'm going to use this Marc Jacobs one in so dirty I'm gonna use this Marc Jacobs one in lush and libido shimmery blush and work it right in to the temple and this is a nice blush it goes on really smooth it's easy to blend into the skin and with the contour I really like this blush and for the other side we're gonna use the NYX away.we glow and this is in the shade crushed rose for this side of the face and it kind of has that sheer color to it as well has little tiny shimmers now we are going to test the highlight my favorite part is testing highlights so I have the Tom Ford highlight over here the sheer highlighting duo and reflex guilt so this is the packaging so beautiful and these are the highlight looks like that this is like the more pinky or shade they are so beautiful the golden shade right on the tops of the cheekbone mmm right here in the tip of the nose it's gonna be really weird to compare on the nose and this side of the cupid bow they keep its bow tie let me take a little bit down here - because I'm dry it's beautiful being high on makeup is kind of dangerous for me because I don't know if I'll be able to get this again okay for the highlight on this side I have the Wet n Wild mega glow highlighting powder in golden flower crown this is a really pretty highlight as well okay we got a very extreme high the only the only bad part of this is that my skin is so textured on this side it's not gonna look the same as this side like the sides pretty this side is pretty glowy too but doesn't look good on my skin for the lips is a Dior lip liner in the shade jungle brown it's a lip liner on one side in a brush on the other so let me just line up my lips and then on this side I'm going to use the Rimmel lip liner okay this is a very natural lip liner this liner is a lot lighter they're both pretty nice on the lips they go on smooth and even and it's just a color difference I'm gonna move on to the lipstick so for the lipstick I have this YSL lipstick and number 70 so I'm gonna take that this is the naked coral from Maybelline and let's see what this looks like compare it's a little bit brighter than the other pretty much looks the same the only difference really is the color of the brow the crease color in the eye and then the lip color is slightly off everything else looks pretty much the same except I like the foundation and the skin overall on this side so this is the final look

sharing what's going on in my life and I've never done something like that before so that's something that will be also talking about in this video but before we get into the video don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and hit that notification bell so you could be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video here we go I'm gonna go to oldest because I've had I've made so many so many so many videos so I'm gonna go to oldest date added oh my god seven years ago I created this video how to create fuller lips and the thumbnail is very weird it's like me up close like this it's back before you could even pick a thumbnail on YouTube and you just hope that YouTube would give you the best thumbnail like screenshot I'm so nervous [Music] first of all can we talk about this song really quick I know it's like just started but this song is not the song that I chose I actually chose Akon sexy back so I think about that song playing in your head this was back before YouTube really cared about copyright so I had that song and then it got flagged so I changed it to this random song this video was shot with my iPhone I think it was iPhone 3 and yes there are cereal boxes in the background okay so the first thing that I'm showing you cuz you're probably like what the heck is that that is the end of an eyeliner pencil it's the smudger of an eyeliner pencil yeah I did not have a lip liner back then like I I couldn't afford a lot of makeup so I was very resourceful with what I had and yes disclaimer I do have lip injections my lips are a lot bigger than what they were seven years ago and back back when I made videos like this video I didn't make another video until like the next year or like six months later I was very inconsistent I would make a video three times a year so I don't consider that like me starting YouTube I think when I was consistent about it would have to be back in 2013 like if I wanted to do a beach look we'd go out to the beach and that would be like part of the intro and I cut to music I took off my lips and it says to get a dark color blend it out into the corners of your mouth as well as the bottom lip so what I would do now is I would take strip down this is stripped down format which is true if you want to create a fuller lip you want to add that dark shadow on the edges or the corners of your mouth and I actually learned that from the candy Johnson that's who I used to watch back in these times I'm gonna just keep layering this on until he gets as dark as it was in the video all right so we got some lip definition going on there that is a very close I remember I sat my iPhone on top of books and like random things that I would I could find and that's how I made my video in the lamp in the back I don't know if somebody must have given that lamp to us because I definitely didn't pick that lamp but that was like my lighting now take the medium shade and brush it on top of the darker shade slightly overlapping the color take the medium shade okay I'm just gonna take oak and I'm gonna brush it slightly on top of the darker shade overlapping the color okay I had no eyebrows and I had just mascara now I'm here with the smokey eye full lashes I was wearing a Hollister shirt and I think I don't know if it came like that where I cut it in it's good I thought I was soaked you take the lightest color in the palette and brush it on the top lip in the cupid bow tie area the cupid bow tie oh my god slightly overlapping the other colors next to it so I'm just gonna go back in with spice and create that little Cupid's bow nowadays I like a pointy Cupid's bow so I'm just gonna enhance the pointyness I remember when I started this video when I when I made this video act like I loved watching makeup tutorials I wanted to learn everything I could and you really could I learned so much from YouTube because I wanted to be a makeup artist and I wanted to make other people feel beautiful I would do other I would do my co-workers makeup and they would feel amazing so I was like I want to learn more I want to be like a pro I want to see how how good I can get in how far I can go so I I started I've made this video I didn't tell anybody about it I actually hid it from everyone nobody knew I had a channel or that I made this video I was just so shy about everything I didn't want anybody to know especially C's early no I was like no look so dumb so I didn't tell anybody about it and so crazy because I didn't hardly have anything but I know I had this passion and this drive I wanting to be a makeup artist I wanted to anything that I had I know I wasn't there all the way on the skill set I wasn't there with the products if you see my makeup now this was this would be like a fantasy I had no makeup I would like to struggle just to buy foundation this foundation was like the most expensive thing for me that angle though still blending at least I blend blend blend oh my god how embarrassing is this get a bubblegum pink dolly color I'm using a mineral shadow and put it on the middle part of the top and bottom lips you guys get a bubblegum pink dolly color well I'm gonna say I'm gonna get Dubai from Oprah it's not a bubblegum pink dolly color but it is a very nude shade and that's what I'm gonna use today just something neutral this is gonna help blend out harsh lines this almost reminds me of like a concealer color but it's really pretty and soft oh my gosh that is the worst angle you can see straight up my nose one nostril is bigger than the other I have a deviated septum so you could definitely see that taking a highlighter I'm using Kleenex Platinum glow number seven brush it on the Cupid's bow tie Cupid's bow tie area of your lips and then very middle of the bottom lip so we're still highlighting here into the Cupid's bow tie area of my lips I'm gonna use a Mac Smith highlight right in the center and blend it out with my finger and I'm using that smudger brush from the eyeliner my lashes are so clumpy by the way take another light pink jumbo color pencil and highlight the middle dang I used so many things to highlight the center of my lips now use a lot of pink back then nowadays I would just use a lip gloss okö by Kylie and this is one of their glosses in sugar plum I'm just gonna use this and this is gonna be like my final highlight like I've already created the lip because this is a lot of stuff so I'm gonna just go in the center of the lips again and create that pouty highlight that I was going for and I'm just gonna dab it with my finger this will cause light to reflect the lightest area of the lip creating an instant pout that's good oh my gosh good job oh I remember like I thought that was so cool and like they would you this is the color I am using right here like I thought that was so cool I was a legit youtuber if I did that Jayden's baby wipes are in the background - oh we were messy remember to blend blend blend I've relieved harsh edges or dark ring of line around the mouth avoid the clown face look avoid the clown face look avoid foundation in your hair I love the length of my hair almost done okay I showed something I don't know what it was but I'm sure it was to clean up around the mouth let's just see how where this takes us take a slightly lighter than your skin color powder and brush it over the outermost part of your mouth so that the lips will stand out even more Fein I hope I could help remember rate comment and and subscribe your official makeup artist it is so crazy that I started from that literally from from zero I would have never thought that this would be my life you don't have to have much to start towards your goal you just have to start literally whatever you have no matter what's going on in your life no matter how crazy it is or how much you don't have if you just start that day you start is gonna be a part of a journey that is going to change your life and once I started to believe in myself and I worked every single day to get closer and closer to my goal if finally happen I had a huge moment a huge turning point in my life in my career it was a big day I got an email in late 2013 from Ipsy they had seen the videos I was making and they really liked them and they wanted me to move out to LA to become a full-time youtuber and do videos for them as well so at first hearing this I'm like this is too good to be true like that's something's up with that and if it is like I just bought a house at that time me and Ceaser had just bought a house really there's there's no way I was a medical insurance rep like the one who answers all the questions member services basically that's what I was and I was like I'm really comfortable in this space but in my heart I knew that I was missing something I wasn't living to my fullest potential so we decided to come out here to LA and pursue this once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing that you don't ever get those types of like offers so we moved out here in a little u-haul Jaden was six years old of course we drove was a full day I'm originally from Houston Texas so I'm not used to like this kind of lifestyle and I remember just walking looking at people walk down the street and they all had a sense of style or singing and it was just so so different faint so this was a whole new world for me I was really excited and very nervous but I knew that that it could be the start of something really huge I was working so hard every single day I was working really really hard and it was it was really difficult all that hard work went into it but I understand growing as fast as my peers I was like wow I'm working so hard but I'm not getting anywhere as fast as these other girls the first year moving here crying every single day and I had just moved my whole family out here to pursue a dream that I'm not actually doing well at so it was a really hard moment for me and it's scary for people that were that loved me and were very close to me and I had a lot of those people told me that you know it's probably time to move back home go back to your other lifestyle this is not a for sure thing you don't know where it's gonna go I let myself feel that moment of failure stop it after I felt that moment it's like I had already there's something in my heart that is saying to keep going and I'm not gonna stop fast-forward to 2017 we're here I live in LA I'm doing great I have 2.7 million of you guys who actually clicked the subscribe button and wanted to follow me and watch my videos and learn from them this is my career and now I have so many opportunities that I would only dream of like these are fantasies and looking at this first video it just makes me appreciate my journey I've had a few offers this year to collab with different brands and I'm so grateful for those offers but I've my heart is in another place right now that I want to focus on something that I've been working on for a long time something that is very very very very close to me that I'm so so excited about and so grateful that I can actually do this for myself because I am working on something very special to my heart it's huge and I've dreamed of this since I was a little girl and just looking back at this first video I came from nothing like literally if somebody were to look at that video they would be like she has no hope now I'm able to create something for myself because of you guys and because I took this first step I took my iphone smudger brush and now I get to create something that I wish I could tell you more about I'll be telling you more information about in the upcoming weeks that's the end of the video thank you guys for watching I

makeup logically this guy right here is going to be your makeup artist for the day it is the easiest look it's so pretty and I cannot wait for you guys to try it out and also in my next video coming

don't forget to check that out so if you want to get into this video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bousley to be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video I'm gonna start off with a Smashbox photo-finish hydrating primer and work it in really good because my skin is extremely dry my lips are really dry I have just been trying to look as normal as possible these days I have been sick for like it feels like such a long time my eyes are darker than usual my voice is still a little scratchy but it's definitely way better than what it was if you guys are out there right now and you're sick flu season is really bad right now and I just want to give you some pointers I have the it cause and that confidence in a cream on my face I have the same under-eye cream and then this hydrating primer so anything that can make your face look a little bit more plump is what you want to grab also for my lips today I'm using the drunk elephant lippy just because we don't want crack lips they're still trying to look glam through the sickness we're still trying to look glam through the winter after I'm hydrated super moisturized then I go I can move on to my skin I'm actually gonna do my skin first and then my brows I've never tried this foundation and I just got this in and from Dior and I'm really excited to use it because I looked it up on Sephora and it has almost a five-star rating and a ton of really really good reviews the one thing I noticed about it when i swatched it on my hand is that it is very very thin diluted now let me try this myself because I haven't tried it out so let me see if this is actually buildable to full coverage I know it is definitely a medium coverage I just love that maximum coverage with that barely there feeling which is really hard to find so if this is that foundation I may have one of my favorite foundations already like just the corner of my eye the darkness is already going away which is awesome and also just a tip for you guys always like to give you guys tips as I go through my process this foundation smells really good if you use a lighter hand you're going to get more coverage I'm just like very lightly balancing that on my skin this is actually the perfect color for my skin tone I'm just gonna do half just to see and we can compare together how well it is covering up my skin without making it look cakey because it feels like I have nothing on my skin right now that is actually amazing because it really feels like I have nothing on my face right now and I just put like two layers on my face from sick Toula who I've never even heard of the sickness - ill what is that this side of my face looks so healthy oh my gosh that is crazy this foundation is really good and it says to shake well before using it which I didn't do we'll just shake it midway through no big deal I I didn't even tell you the shape gosh I haven't filmed and feel like it haven't flown in so long I don't even know how to do this right now this is shade 23 so let's see if it works its magic on this side of my face this should have been half and half way caps it and a half not sick or I don't know how it would title that but it should have been something like half in huh I'm gonna put on my brows really quick there's a new brow pencil from Maybelline that I wanted to try out it's called a total temptation brow definer in deep brown it looks like this I just when I see pink it's super girly I love it and I just want to use it it's like a tiny little midget spoolie and I think it's the cutest thing and I actually feel like it would be more useful than the longer one so I just want to try it out everything around your brow area is dry then I would go in with your brow pencil or powder or whatever it's like a diamond shape so I feel like I can get some really precise lines with the tip and then if I want to fill in the rest of the brow I can do that easily with just one brush just by looking at it so I'm really excited to try this and then I'm gonna take this little guys so cute reminds me of Bobo's face and just brush the hairs upwards and comb through and I'm just I'm happy with the way my eyebrow looks like this I think it's supernatural and I think that this color works perfectly for my brow color I'm gonna go ahead and get into the Urban Decay excursion Li and daydream palette I think this is the most delicious-looking packaging I just want to eat it or lick it or something or put my finger in it it looks way too good I'm just saying like it makes me want to eat cake right now there's such a beautiful peachy kind of palette it's like something you can wear every day and you open it up and it's just really pretty whimsical flowers it just looks so so cute it has a little brush in it little turquoise brush one side is flat and then the other side is a little bit more tapered so you can get like on the lower lash line or you can do the outer corner I'm gonna start out with Lucy Lucy is just a matte cream bone shade that I'm gonna put all over my lid this is gonna instantly make your eye look awake and alive I'm gonna go ahead and work the 1212 onto the lid with a flat brush so I'm going to take a day dream me lightest crease color and subscribe I'm gonna mix them together right around that peachy shade okay so I just made a decision right now to put tape on the edge of my eye because I wanted to have more of a cat eye look so I'm gonna grab that actually line it up right here to the edge of my brow so just like that okay I haven't done that in a very very long time so I probably just taped some of my lashes but that's okay so anything that goes outside of this is not gonna touch your skin so when you peel it off it's gonna have a nice sharp edge to it it's gonna make it a little bit more glam without having to try you're just feeling a little lazy you know there's something like you might let the tape work for you so I'm just going to bring out that those brown shades those natural warm tones I'm gonna take a fluffier brush and just go around the edges and softly buff out all of the edges deepen up this outer crease with eight gemenese the little brush that comes in here so I'm gonna take that right on the edge just kind of the perfect brush to do this with a really nice chocolate brown I take this brush right here it's the m5 oh seven and a little bit of eight and we'll work that into this area right here like right on that crease just to deepen it up a little bit add some depth so this is more of a glam look so I'm gonna take this black this is a new brand that I haven't used it's called wander beauty and this is a gel pencil in blacks and it looks like a really high-quality pencil and a lot of their makeup looks very high-quality so I'm really interested to try it and I live my I have a little bit just dragged it right across and work it right on the edge you don't have to really worry about messing it up because the tape is your guide I'm gonna start to drag out the black with this liner brush I'm gonna drag it out but I'm also going to clean it up soften the edges and make it look a lot more smooth once I smoothed it out I'm gonna take more of the eight shade and work it right on top is gonna give it more of like a smoked out effect it's also gonna make the block look less intense gives me more of like that chocolate hot cocoa winter day by winter night actually or if you want to wear it during the day up to you but for sure it's gonna give you that smoky look I'm gonna peel this off and hope that it doesn't look crazy crazy let's just see what it looks like oh all right it's pretty good just clean that up a little bit there is this really pretty shade that I definitely want to work into the inner corners this shade right here I actually want to put it all over my eyelid but since we already are here I'm gonna take corona from the Kaleidoscope palette we use this side of the brush to just work that into the inner corners this is such a beautiful bronzy golden color I think this has got to be one of my favorite colors for sure so I'm gonna clean off my face put on some mascara and lashes so LC just launched a mascara it's called lash full that's a cute name lash ball it's more I feel like this is more of a lengthening mascara and it also pulls out those hidden lashes I usually wait to put on mascara on the lower lashes until I'm done but who's watching okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and pop on these lashes from a hooter Beauty these are the Noelle's got the lashes on and they're really interesting because I hadn't opened them before these are not double-stacked they came apart like they're two different lashes she's interesting I didn't know that they were made like that but it's a really really pretty and just super fluffy so I really like them I'm gonna take daydream and subscribe again on the lower lash line because my eyes are a little bit more red and I'm still kind of sick and I want to look awake and healthy I'm gonna take this wander Beauty new gel pencil and I'm just gonna hit it right on the waterline I just want to show you the difference before I go back now we are higher alive and we are going to conquer the world from now on so I just got these new highlights in from hourglass is called the vanish champagne flash is the color I have and it's a highlight that looks like this I'm gonna go ahead and use this on my cheekbones to give me that glow and I'm putting a light layer on before I put on my concealer and if you're looking for another thin formula that's a really full coverage the Urban Decay Naked skin 1 is another amazing feeling on your face without having the cake and then it gives you that flawless look I'm not gonna push down too hard because I want to get the most out of the concealer I want it to be more full coverage because my under eyes are extra dark and if you put this type of highlight underneath your concealer or have it slightly coming through your concealer it's gonna give you more of a natural glowing within kind of look contours I'm using is from Natasha de Nonna this guy right here it's a really good sculpting powder I'm gonna do my nose first let's get that straightened out literally this is a bm5 72 brush from morphe and I'm just gonna work that right along the edge of my nose and I'm blending around the nostril just so you guys know all the info and then you can go across as well but I'm not actually gonna go across today I'm just gonna go right below your new time you contour make sure that you are blending upwards not downwards and because my face is a little bit more rounded instead of cupping it right in this way I like to go straight down towards the end of my mouth right on the corner and it just gives the illusion of a more slender face if you're more rounded I'm going to take the highlight from Kristen Lea and this is the beauty beam highlight palette I'm gonna take these two colors right here you can't see them right in there oh my god how does that even happen gonna take those colors and just work a little bit right onto the cheeks I don't want a crazy highlight today I just want something that's more subtle and then I have this zoeva opulence palette and it's such a pretty package I'm gonna take the two middle shades mix them together and tie a little bit to my cheeks like a tiny bit and I'm not touching the Apple I'm letting the highlight kind of sit there and shine or the lip we are gonna go she actually Kristin Leanna has three lips and they're in these hot pink lipstick cases there really cute there is a purple one and it's called cloud 9 it's matte and there is bun-bun it's a comfort mat and yeah it's bug button and it's cute because it has Kristin Lee and there's a heart with her name right in the middle of it it's actually really pretty color I think this is actually a really pretty color and I think I might try this one with this look there is also spellbound which is a mega match a dark purple oh I forgot to set my makeup I'm gonna set my makeup with the wander Beauty in there powder foundation it's actually a medium but it's pretty light looks like that [Music] thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you like this video learn things from this video don't forget to

on it the LA girl is really really good this is from Tarte this sponge you don't actually wet this sponge you just use it as is and it works really good my favorite part I don't know if it's just me I have a lot of discoloration around my eyes so whenever I get to my eyes and they turn from red to like skin tone color I'm like I get so happy it's the little things and then this side for the inner corner fat in your foundation because you don't want it to be smeared around everywhere you won't get very much coverage that way so make sure you pat in I didn't go too heavy around the under eye area because I'm gonna put concealer there and I don't want it to look super cakey I've been using this ever since I got it and I just can't stop this little guy I use pretty often cream contour kit from a Velvet 59 as you can see I use it I'm going to take my morphe r32 brush and I'm going to take that light contour shade and just go underneath my cheekbone right here and she create that shadow same thing on this side go right alongside my nose I like this brush because it's not too big it's not too small it's perfect this is a really good one I'll just blend upwards and take these two shades and I'll go down my nose like that right not up I'm going to go ahead and move on to the eye shadow this is the new palette from Tarr I'm going to take this color right here this is classic I'm going to use that all over my eyelid I'm just so that we can neutralize the aisle and have everything sit really nice and pretty on top of the lid so I'm just going to take my brush and sweep it over and get the inner corners really good I'm going to do some war red tones so I'm going to take mod which is this red shade right here and I like that this palette is all matte and then they separated in circles the glam shimmery shade so I'm going to take my paper blending brush from luxe ISA 229 I'm going to put that into my crease just buff it in there okay so after I put that all around my eyes and then I'm going to go in with drama which is this plummy purple shade right here and just go right into the crease the same areas that I put the red but just bringing it down a little bit lower so all around the eye I'm going to take it into the inner corner right here just like dot it like that and windshield wiper motions and then I'm going to go ahead and take it around and I'm building up the color around the inner and outer corners of the eyelid I'm taking a clean brush and I'm just blending on the edges pulling the color out and fading it up into the brow bone I'm going to put on the lid color I'm going to take ethereal just this shade right here this I'm going to take my zoeva 234 brush and I am going to pick up cereal you're going to work that on to the lid and then on the outer parts of my eye I'm going to take Punk which is this matte black color and I'm going to use my SL miss glam Beauty w20 angled eye brush and this is good for getting into the crease so I'm going to take that the outer and inner parts of the crease I'm also going to touch just a little bit with the with the pointy side of the brush I'm going to touch the inner corner of the eye I'm actually adding a little bit of blam on top of a cereal because it's a little bit lighter so I'm going into the top and just packing that on so I get the most of the product so I'm just going to Pat it I'm also going to take the black and go on the lower lash line here bring it around like so and for my waterline I'm going to take the zoeva black to earth graphic eyeliner pencil and I'm gonna line my waterline pretty heavy so now I'm going to go in with some eyeliner I'm going to take the ICO skinny liquid eyeliner deluxe and in black I always like to line it up with the end of my brow like that that comes straight down and then I'll bring it in on its side and then I'll work it into the inner corner but I want it to be the line to be very thin in here so when it's almost like fade into nothing when it gets to the inner corners of the eye and this eyeliner is supposed to be long lasting fade and smudge proof now I'm going to go ahead and put on some mascara the mascara I have is this tiny little suit better than sex from Too Faced like that so I'm going to put that on my lashes I'm reading something that about the better than sex right now as I'm putting it on and it says I didn't know this it's a collagen fueled formula and that's what thickens and lengthens and curls your lashes that's what gives it that extreme volume I didn't know that now I'm going to put on some lashes these are pretty I'm going to put on some of these lashes I don't know where they're from but and I will link on below until you later this stay with you guys and put them on with y'all because I have been doing it off-camera a lot and I'm going to go ahead and put them on with you guys so I'm taking my eyelash glue my favorite one is the duo rush on adhesive I need a new one obviously look at it it's like stuck together oh it sounds like it's raining outside I love when it rings outside I always use this TARDIS eyelash thingy I hold it like this and then I put my lash like that in the middle can you tell can you see can you see this is a awkward angle I put it in the middle tilt my head back and find the center pop it on to the center let it sit for like three seconds and then grab the inside and push it on to the lash line pushing it down and in and that is the completed I look I'm going to go ahead and go down to the face I'm just going to pop my Lexy brush into the pure powder and set my makeup in place for the blush I'm going to take this city color intense blush palette and this is the collection - it's like a lot of warm shades I'm going to take this one right here and I'm going to pop it onto the cheek bone I'm just going to bring it around the temple a little bit higher up I'm going to take this darker shade and pop it on to the back of the apple of the cheek really close to the hairline I'm kind of layering my blushes today I'm going to take this peachy red blush right here and just pop that on right to the apple of the cheek I this is the first time that I've done this technique kind of working different blushes into my skin so I really like it I think it looks really pretty like the dimensional glowy gives you and I'm going to go ahead and highlight with the hardest pro glow palette such a nice palette it has highlights in it a contour and a cream contour I'm going to use lit in stunner those are my favorite ones this is the morphe eat em five to nine brush I'm going to take stunner pop that on to the tops of the cheekbones like that and then I'm going to take lit and focus up at the top just take whatever we have left and pop it on to the nose get that highlight mustache a little bit right here just because I have I dry skin and it looks very dull at times so I'm just going to put it there for myself right in here and now my whole face is lit just need to pop on a lily for the lipliner I'm gonna take the LA girl endless semi-permanent Auto lip liner and this is in the color nectar to bright orange you shade and I'm going to line my lips with that this came in the highly holiday collection this is the liquid lipstick and Kristin and this is the completed look I'm gonna go about my day now thank you guys for spending time with me watching this video and getting ready with me I love you guys so much thumbs it up if you liked it and if you haven't subscribed the SUBSCRIBE ones right there so you can click that button and that's

[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be showing you how to get ready like super fast this is one of those where you woke up late and it's your friend's birthday dinner or it's a party and you need to look just a little bit extra but I'm gonna show you how to get there super quick tell you the pointers to make it seem like it took you about thirty hours and you were comfortable you were had your music on you were just taking your time when really you had 20 minutes and bam you are done I promise you you can do this in 20 minutes and if you can definitely adjust it to where you're comfortable at all so I'm gonna give you a huge hair tip when you're running out of time and you need your hair to look right I'm gonna give you some pointers on hair makeup thank you - IG k for partnering up with me in this video for their dry hair shampoos because I love them they are the cutest things and they're one of my favorites so I'm gonna show you how I use them which one I love so if you want to see how I got this look right here and this volume in my hair and no time at all then don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bow so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with this video you do is just wake my face up a little bit by putting on a little bit of this oil from tatcha this is the gold Camilla beauty oil and I just feel like rubbing that in instantly gives you a boost and sometimes I'll even skip primer if I just do this it just makes a really nice smooth surface for your foundation to glide on top of no this is not one of those kind of like I'm running late and have to go to work or school this is like I'm running late and I have my friend's birthday dinner to go to something more fun and just an obligation that you definitely don't want to miss I'm just gonna start applying my foundation right away so the foundation that I'm using is the Dior forever in the shade 23 and I'm just gonna pop that on really quick if my Beauty Blender and I literally just got spray-tanned right now so this is probably way too light for me but it's okay okay so if I was in a hurry I would just go ahead and pop on the concealer right away I'm still gonna give my eye area some time to dry down before I do my brows because if I start doing my brows now the pencil won't hold on to the skin very easy it's just gonna slide over the skin so I'm gonna wait to do my brows I'm gonna go straight in with caramel this shade right here work that right on the crease area depending on your skill level you could probably get away with this within like 10 to 15 minutes but if it'll take you a little bit longer you can always customize what I'm doing to fit where you're comfortable this is actually really easy because it's just one crease shade that you're doing and then I'm gonna pop on hazelnut I'm gonna take hazelnut all over my lids so that one shade is gonna make a world of a difference and automatically amp up our looks so much faster so I'm gonna take a flat brush and I'm taking hazelnut and I'm gonna pop it all over the lid like this and just take it all the way from the inner corner to the outer smudge it in the lash line you want to bring it up until you hit the crease that bone right here and then you just start to work it and this is pretty pigmented shadow so you don't need to go back too many times and just work it like so this color looks so beautiful on brown eyes or blue so I'm just gonna take a little bit more on the outer part of the eye and then blend it out this is the brush that I used for the crease so it's gonna help really ease that hazelnut shade into the caramel and voila you're done you don't need to go any further I know you're not gonna believe me but you're gonna look like you actually took an hour or two on your makeup one medium tone shade is all you really need and then just using a little bit more towards the outer corners of the same shade is makes it look like you use more than one color this color is so rich and beautiful it just really makes your pop so if you just layer like one or two layers you know a full-blown smoky eye make sure there's no harsh lines on the edges so use a very light hand and just do circular motions really quickly so now I'm just gonna move on to the lashes I know this is going so fast but trust me you don't really need that many steps if you want to look glam so I'm just gonna go ahead and grab my lash glue blushes that I'm choosing are these guys right here from house of lashes these are the ikonics the reason I'm choosing these lashes for tonight is because it's kind of a flared out winged lash so you don't really need a wing with these it kind of does the drama and the lifting of the eye for you this is all you really need for your lashes and this is what's gonna make you look super glam right away so they are definitely gonna add some drama super quick to your look now while that's drying I'm just gonna fill in like my brows really quick I'm definitely gonna go back and fix them up definitely using a pencil is so much quicker than using anything else like a pomade well that's kind of drying on my eyes I'm gonna go on my lower lashes take the brush that has hazelnut on it and just sweep it right underneath my lashes my lower lashes so now I'm gonna go in with a pop of color you either want to do this on your lips or your lower lash line so either a bold lip or a bold lower lash line so what I'm gonna do is take cold-brew from the Lahti palette after the liner I'm just gonna pop on some mascara to the lower lashes mesh my tree lash with the false lash and I'm sweeping the mascara on the very tip of my real lashes and sweeping it up going through the false lash so that it connects together now I'm going to add a pop of highlight to the inner corners so for that I'm gonna take macchiato even if you do like your bass first and take your palette with you in your bag and do the rest in the car in your uber on your way you can definitely get it everything done all in one palette so that's a good thing about this palette and it's definitely good for those type of nights after that I'm gonna go ahead and set my under eyes and brighten them up just a tad bit more so I'm gonna take vanilla cream right here in the palette and just go right in that inner corner and then for contouring if you have time I'm just gonna contour my nose really quick with mocha very lightly and you can definitely skip this part but for me I will fit contouring my nose in if I'm going out for a pictures sake know I'm gonna have to snatch the nose but I can get away with just doing bronzer on my face so I'm gonna take hazelnut and use that on my cheeks as well I'm gonna take it around the temple and then just to make sure that we're extra bright under our eyes and everything is nice and soft around the bronzer I'm just going to take a little bit more a vanilla cream to soften of the edges [Music] and go right down the nose right here and we've shaped them it was so quick with the one palette that's crazy now I'm just gonna do my highlight so I'm just gonna take macchiato what I use in my inner corners and use it right so for the lip I'm just gonna take this Kat Von D love Ludwig lipstick like so [Music] so you can stop right there you can just do that lip but I'm gonna go ahead and add on at this gloss it's really beautiful it's from pixie and Chloe Morello she made this gloss it's the lip icing in the shade cake it's so pretty and shimmery I'm just gonna lay it over the top of the center of my lip look at that gold and this was just glam up any look at any time of the day even if you wear it on its own I feel like this would be really pretty so that's pretty much it for the makeup very fast quick easy you can do a setting spray now the hair so if you woke up and your hair is a mess or if you haven't washed it in like a day or two and it's just flat and oily like mine right now my trick is to use dry shampoo and lately I have been loving these dry shampoos from igk and not to mention the packaging is extremely freaking cute I am obsessed with packaging that's what catches my eye and it's just the cutest thing together these dry shampoos right here are called the flight Club it's so freaking cute there's jet lag direct flight in first class and they have really pretty packaging so this one is called jet lag and this is the invisible dry shampoo it's super lightweight this is when you have maybe one or two days of hair and it's not really that bad so this one right here just gets rid of mild dirt and oil in your hair then this guy right here is called direct flight to multitasking dry shampoo this one's gonna give you that lift in your hair if you're if you like volume which is something that I love and I love to use which I'm about to show you right now it's gonna give you that boost and lift in your hair it's also gonna absorb the oils and this is a medium cleanse so if you've if you've been out and about and you haven't washed your hair maybe like two days or three days then you might want to use this guy right here and this guy is good for normal to oily scalp so keep that in mind and then the last guy is the first class this is the charcoal detox a deep cleansing dry shampoo this is when you haven't washed your hair and so many days you're embarrassed to tell us about this one is good for oily scalps fine hair medium to thick coarse textured hair any type of hair basically you can even use this after a workout you're gonna smell good your hair is gonna feel good and it's gonna it's not gonna look dirty so nobody will know it's it'll be a secret the one that I'm gonna use today is going to be the green one because I want some lift in my hair and it's been honestly maybe two days so I feel like I'm just gonna go with this guy right here so I just want a little bit of a lip so when I'm ready to get out and do my hair what I do I'll have it straight first of all because straight is the easiest less time-consuming thing to do so I'll just focus this on the scalp [Music] doesn't leave any residue but I'll just let it sit there I'm not gonna even work it in yet and then separate it smells so good and focus that one and do another layer or my hair hits my crown and once I've let it sit for awhile now I'll just start to massage my head like this it just gives you this blow-dried Airy kind of look I've already have so much volume in my hair and if you guys could tell from when I started that's pretty much all that I would do quick outfit and head out of the house thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it go ahead and give it a big thumbs up and before I let you go I want to remind you to have an open heart and an open mind you never know who can let in your life I love you guys so much and I will see you in my next video bye Dolly's 
[Applause] [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today we're going to be doing five-minute makeup when you're on the go trying to get out the door really quick and you want to look like a normal human in the world super easy no lashes just just you just you being you this is what I do and I need to like one out but I don't want to look like a crazy mess it's literally the easiest video I've ever done at my channel anybody can do it this is a universal look for anybody to grab your my channel if you're not subscribed already go ahead and hit that education Bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video so I'm going to use this toothpaste hangover three-on-one replenishing primer it's just an setting spray I'm going to go ahead and pry my face right now even though I'm on a time crunch I want my skin to look flawless so the first thing I grab is my hourglass advantage Foundation stick it is amazing and super full coverage and you can just slather it all over your face blend it in and you're ready to go I'm in the shade nude looks like this and I like how it's shaped it's like that triangular shape so it gets into those contours of your face they enter little inner corners around the nose so I'm going to go ahead and put it on my face just little tiger stripes and then I blend it in with a brush I feel like the stick foundations blend better with a brush into your skin B I actually fake tan so my body is a little bit darker than this foundation but this is usually my color I'm going to blend it down I'm going to pretend like this is my skin color some people can literally just go outside the house with concealer and they don't need foundation but for me I feel like I do need foundation and I can do this in less than five minutes but if they take you a little bit longer then you know you can skip it take concealers spot conceal where your red and dark so I just evened out my skin tone now I'm going to go into my panda eyes and cover them up I'm going to use my Holy Grail my heart-shaped tape and light medium I'm almost is basically almost done but I'm scraping it literally I'm scraping the bottle because it's amazing and go ahead and work that and right here where the inner corners are because that is the darkest part of my eyes right here and then take my little Beauty Blender and you want to use the lightest touch the lighter you bounce the Beauty Blender on your skin the more coverage you're going to get so now I'm going to do my brows for my brows I'm going to use the honest Agia brow Wiz in soft brown and I'm going to take the spoolie side just to comb through them and then I'm going to fill in the sparse areas of pencils the easiest way to get a nice well-groomed natural looking brow and you want to use a short little strokes for the front like if you have a ball front like I do but you don't want to look like a sharpie eyebrows you just want to use little tiny flicks with your hand like that and then you want to clean it through so it looks fuller but it doesn't look overdone so now I have my brows filled in I want them to stay in place so I'm going to take my Bravo conditioning primer I love this stuff as soon as you put it in your brow it will not budge your brows stay in the exact same shape you brush it into until the end of the night just makes them look really nice and well-groomed and it just looks like he tried oh you tried and you succeeded your browser gunpoint and it didn't really take that long I want to do something that's realistic for anyone out there who's just trying to get out the door and look like a human being and not like a zombie okay so now that we have our skin looking good everything's even our brows on fleek we are ready to almost ready to head out the door I'm just going to set everything in place because you're going to have a big creamy slightly mess on your face if you don't set it so I'm going to take my Frankie Rose Pro contour powder palette this yellow shade right here and mix it into this shade it comes together I love yellows for my under eyes because I feel like it just makes your panda eyes just disappear so I'm just going to tap it lightly on my skin and it's going to give us the most coverage because we're using a light hand whenever you sweep any powders under your eyes or anywhere on your face it's literally going to move the cream around it's not only giving you the most you can get out of your product so if you use your light hand tap it on your skin and we're going to look so flawless you're going to have so much coverage if you want that and if you're not looking for a lot of coverage or brightness under your eye you can just use a translucent powder and just set your entire face with that and then you'll be good then even go like right under here I would suppose contour it naturally enhances the cheek contour if you do this see and so that's like a little hoc i'ma go right in the center so now I'm going to add some life into my face aka bronzer I'm going to take the hoola benefit bronzer and this little dome brush right here that I love to use for bronzer just fits right on the cheeks so perfectly so I'm going to tap off the excess and then just start to work that in circular motions right on the cheek and I like this bronzer right here for a contour you can contour with this because it's not too it doesn't have that foreign G undertone to it it's pretty neutral it's actually a really nice light tan looking color so I'm going to take that around the temples and then right on the cheekbone do the same thing to the other side just quickly and go down my nose I'm also going to get right under the chin right under the jawline because I had Starbucks today and also when I'm in a hurry I want to do I want to have something on my eyes I don't want them to be completely bare so once I set my my eyelids with powder then I like to go in a fluffy brush like this one and then I'll just take the same bronzer and just go in to my crease like this the key to everything that we're doing today is keeping your hand towards the back of your brush remember the closer your hand is the harsher the line so just go back and forth windshield wiper motion you only have five minutes so probably do this week in seconds and done you have dimension in your eyes you don't look dead and then I'm going to go ahead and take my all-time favorite mascara right now all-time favorite right now it's going to be can you guess the Maybelline colossal big shot so I'm gonna go ahead and take this and start at the very base in my eyelash and then wiggle it back and forth all the way up and not touch your skin because I'm just going to get everywhere if you do touch your skin and you get mascara on your lid do not clean it it's going to get so messy it's going to be hard to get back from that so just let it dry and take it off of the q-tip and what I like to do is brush my eyelashes in the wrong direction just imagine you flipping your hair to one side you always have it like that so your hair is accustomed to going that way but once you flip it over it has a little more volume because it's like I'm not used to be in this direction same thing with your lashes so I brush them to the right and make it like sweep tout like what's going on and then I brush them to the left and they're like whoa and then I brush them straight and they are so lucky luckier than a squirrel's tail and then you move zigzag motions back and forth motions I already look so much more alive just with my lashing like that in the longer I should write question to the left don't move it anywhere don't try to clean it and spin get messy I'm gonna let it be the usual real life situation right now I'm just going to let it be let it sit and get dry so I have my q-tip it is dry and we are going to script it we just have to do is just tap in that little bald spot if you are extra I need some highlight in your life I'm going to go ahead and do this part for you I'm going to use the huda beauty 3d highlighter palette and I'm going to take this clean highlight and just grab it right on my my cheeks and it is intense intense highlight dab it dab it I'm going to take my all-time favorite and natural lip color this is the Mac dervish lip liner I'm obsessed with this color it makes your lit it's like the most natural looking lip color but it is just something to your lips I'll show you give me a second so I'm going to go ahead and actually put this all over my lips so just fill them in sitting on that overdraw your lips a little bit color them in and they will look so natural and plumpie with this and then I feel like it needs a little bit more of a pop just put this right on the center take your eyelash curler in your bag and just Chrome later and they'll look a lot more perkier thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did thumbs it

[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I am doing this wet and glam look right here that is very much inspired by Selena Gomez I found this picture of her the other day and actually did a snapchat tutorial on it or was it in some stories I think was snapchat and it's this look right here she is so beautiful we have the same haircut can you tell can you tell I was so excited about that and I just love this classic red-carpet look so I wanted to do my own interpretation of this look and this is what I created I've been seeing this white hair look go around Kim Kardashian's been wearing it a lot Selena Gomez oh this is my last video it's actually really super easy I wish I would have showed you in this video I'm not like a pro at doing this look yet so I didn't want to like do a tutorial if I really don't know exactly what I'm doing but if you want to see a tutorial on this I can definitely show you after I've practiced a little bit more on it I don't know I just love this look on everybody I think it's gonna look great on you your brother your sister your mom your grandma give everybody a makeover in the house today because we are doing this look and before we get into the video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video first thing that I'm grabbing is the boying industrial-strength concealer from benefit I'm gonna use that to just kind of prime my eyes and even out the skin on this area right here now that it is nice and even I'm gonna be using this eyeshadow color right here this is the collaboration with candy Johnson from Too Faced the I want candy palette I am very excited actually let me use my fancy hand right now because this is my ratchet hand the Too Faced I want candy palette it is so cute it's in this little tin has a little sticker with Kent looks like Candy's face on it it is adorable and the pellet smells really nice I don't know if it smells like anything it smells kind of sweet but I don't know if it's just me you know too matte shades in one highlight a shade ooh whoa that was literally one swipe whoa very good color payoff so the first color that I'm gonna try is banana cream pie as you guys know you guys know this already after the concealer I set it with a powder and I usually use something similar to like this shade right here if I don't show you on a camera in the video trust me I did it off camera I don't do this every time I do my makeup if I'm not doing much to my eyes if I'm just doing it very natural like eyeliner lashes and maybe just like a crease color I won't I won't go through this every time to be honest with you guys but if I want to do it right if I'm doing a YouTube video and I'm doing something with the eyes I do really want to have a really nice and vibrant eyeshadow look the next colors I'm picking up is cream puff and pastry and I'm gonna work that on to the crease I'm gonna work this into the crease so we can have a nice natural-looking depth remember for wanting to buff out any edges we just use a softer hand so I'm going to go in circular motions with a very light hand just to buff out this area right here now I'm gonna take butterscotch kind of looks similar to the color that Selena Gomez has in the picture so with this color I'm gonna take it on butterscotch shade all over the lid and bring it into that crease then I'm gonna take raspberry cocoa use the same crease brush and just work it on to this outer portion of the eye and then I'm gonna blend this all the way up into the brow bone I'm taking it up a little bit higher because I want to change the shape of my eye a little I'm gonna go from here all the way to here and I'm just gonna use circular motions to get there then I'm gonna bring it into the crease the next chord I'm gonna take is hot chocolate right here just a matte Brown I'm gonna use a smaller brush for this this is the luck C 231 a small tapered brush and I'm just going to take some of the brown and enhance this outer V portion right here I'm only gonna keep this on the very outer part of the lid and then whatever I have on the brush I'm just going to blend blend through this here I have a tip for you guys if you want a really intense outer V I would suggest gradually getting there and try not to just grab as much product as possible it's going to get so patchy and so hard to Belen when you put so much product on at one time so my tip for you guys today is just to use a little bit at a time until you build up to the intensity that you want to blend out the edges I'm gonna take raspberry cocoa and a fluffy brush and I'm just gonna work it around the edges of the darker shadow and I'm bringing it all the way up into the brow bone just to give it a little bit more of a dramatic effect on the inner corner I'm going to take this shade right here this is sparkling cider so I'm gonna start on the wing for that I'm going to use the taupe berry and licorice rope and start to create the wing I'm going to inch my way in because I don't want it to be too thick here and then for the liquid liner I'm going to go in with this one right here from Too Faced I want candy collection this is the candy liner in black licorice and so I'm going to take that and really define the eye oh this is cool make sure you close up of this this is the wand it's really cool and different you have trouble creating a wing I feel like this would make it easier because it already has that slanted edge for you I'm gonna layer another pair of lashes on top these are the house of lashes so for our collection and the style everlasting they look like this they're tapered curled and kind of fluffy looking so I'm gonna go ahead and pop these on right on top I'm gonna take the Smashbox photo finish primer and work that into my hands and then Pat it into my face I'm actually going to color correct my face today so I'm going to take this Stila correct imperfect and take this peach shade right here and work that on my under eyes and with the peach one does is it neutralizes the bluish purple under a circle for medium to light skin tones if you have a darker skin tone you want to use this orange shade right here and then I'm going to take this yellow shade right here and this is for dark spots so I'm gonna take that around the mouth cuz you can see it's a little dark in this area and then it's red right around my nose right on my cheek so I'm gonna take some of that on my cheeks as well and then I'm gonna take this smashbox face shaping a studio skin and a foundation stick this is the contour that i've been using i used in my last video and i've been using it ever since i got this product this is actually the first time i'm using the foundation side so i'm going to take the foundation in 2.2 and work that on for the face [Music] this soft contour side and I'm just going to contour my cheeks [Music] okay and then for concealer I'm going to take this benefit boying industrial-strength concealer and a number two and I'm gonna work that on my under eyes I'm just gonna use my finger to Pat it in and then I'm gonna take my tiny little baby Beauty Blender work it into the rest of my face I like to be the mini Beauty Blender because if you want a contour or highlight in a precise area it will do that for you without getting it all over the place like with this big big Beauty Blender so having these little mini PD plungers at first I was like what am I gonna do with this does nothing but then I found a really good use for them it's the beauty blenders little mini Wow's the first time that I'm not using the Tarte shaped Cape to come from my under-eye circles I did a really good job I'm gonna set my face with the Kat Von D at translucent setting powder I'm gonna take some of this on the back of a Beauty Blender and set my under eyes always like stretch my eyeballs in the back of my head so that the skin is super taut and I don't get any lines so look way up I'm gonna pack the transition light the transition powder on so that nothing creases underneath your eye area and now that I'm set my face is pretty much set I'm gonna go back into the lower lash line and I'm not really gonna do much to the lower lash line just adding a black liner so I'm taking that aqua XL liner we used earlier and I'm just gonna line the bottom just smoke it out I'm gonna take this Sigma short shader brush and brush it along the line right underneath so it kind of drags down that black liner and now I'm just gonna add a lot of mascara to my lower lash line that's lower lash goals I am gonna try to attempt to make my lashes that long one thing that I noticed about the pictures that Selena is super bronzed I don't know she has a tan it's natural this is NARS Laguna and I feel like this is a little bit more on the warm tone side this gives you more of a no it's not too ashy you can actually some people may use this as a contour but I actually think this will work great as a bronzer it has a little bit of that warm undertone and I'm just going to start to work that on my cheekbone so I'm going to take it around my temples right here and then and then on the nose especially right across like that gives you like a natural looking glow just looks like you went tanning I'm gonna mix this bronzer as well I feel like this is a lot more of a has it more of an orange look to it this is bronze goddess imma layer that right on top as if it's a blush and then I'm gonna take this big powder brush and blend out this blush and then for the highlight I'm gonna take this Oprah highlighter in Bali put that on my cheekbones tip of the nose right on the Cupid's bow and a right on top of the brow and then for the star of the show I'm gonna be using this red lipstick right here it's that ultra matte lip from colour-pop in it's a collaboration with Karen I love

is cold let's get on with the video my primer and brow so I'm gonna just jump right in to the foundation I'm gonna be using the LC micro silk foundation I haven't used this in a long time I remember using it a few times really liking it and then I couldn't find my shade but I have a ton of different shades to choose from the only thing about these foundations is you may think it's your color on the outside but then when you put it on your face it's like 30 shades darker so just be careful with that but I do like this foundation it is very full coverage I'm gonna start off with camp vanilla I'm gonna put it on the back of my eyelash box you're gonna notice when you put this on your face it is extremely thin if you're not patient enough you're almost gonna feel like there's no coverage but if you just let it set into your skin you'll see that it's a it's a very pigmented foundation it's just extremely lightweight there's been a cricket that has been haunting me this entire time I don't know if you guys can hear it I'm pretty sure you can but it's even louder it's back with a vengeance cuz we thought it was gone but it is back and it's super super loud I'll shoot it out later I really like that this foundation is super light like thin and lightweight but it has a lot of pigment in it so it's very full coverage the first this is the first layer I could leave it here but I mean add just another little bit of a layer because I like the cake but it doesn't make it look cakey at all and it feels very comfortable on the skin but it does dry down Matt when I use this I kind of like because it's so flat this is a very matte foundation because it's so flat I do like to use some sort of finishing spray with this and then I'm gonna move over to the eyes and this time I'm actually not gonna use concealer I'm just gonna use this foundation as my base okay I'm gonna go ahead and start on the eyes for the eyes I'm going to use this palette right here it's the ciate London pretty fun fearless palette by Chloe Morello it's really fun pretty packaging and then when you open it up it has it has a cute mirror right here with the flamingos on the sides I'm gonna first pick up skinny-dip it's a very light topi shade it reminds me of like just nude skin or like a nude bikini this is oh it's super super creamy it almost feels like a cream but I'm gonna go ahead and pick that up first work it into the eye the time Los Angeles 206 brush and picking up skinny dip okay I'm gonna work this shade right into the crease so I'm gonna go right so I'm just gonna work that into the crease and then I'm gonna take this fluffier brush right here from the makeup Shack is the t68 wash the color even more into the skin and then I'm gonna take on fire which is this shade right here the same brush and start to work that and I'm gonna have it sit right below the first shade that we use I'm gonna take it right around the crease also kind of through the inner corner right here it's gonna be a nice transition for the purple that we're going to use in just a little bit here this is the Mac two two 1s brush and I'm just gonna pop in to flirt which is that really pretty plum and work that on the outer edge by the outer V I'm gonna leave the inner third of the lid length so that we can pop into one of those pretty shimmers focus all of the plumbing shades right on the outer portion of the eye and then I'm going to take it out kind of extending it towards the end of the brow like right where the brow ends and then taking this big fluffier brush and just going over the edges just diffusing them into the skin the next color minute take is day dream I'm gonna take it on a pencil brush this brush doesn't have a number so I'm just going to take that on the outer corner and really deepen up the outer V while these shades way okay then I'm gonna take this Mac to a 17s brush and go into my tribe which is this cream vanilla shade and then I'm gonna take that right underneath the brow bone to pop the shape out and also just make the eyeshadow look a little bit more clean I'm in for the inner corners I'm gonna take some concealer and just put it on the back of my hand and grab a flat brush like this one right here from the makeup shucks the t51 conceal right in the front of the lid just so that I shadow that we put on top can really pop and then right on top of the concealer I'm gonna take happy this shade right here this is just a really pretty cool tone gray shimmer shade let me go back in to flirt and just marry these colors together so that they don't look like this is a like a harsh line right now I'm gonna do the wing for the lean I have this Maybelline curva tude liner right here [Music] I'm just gonna pop this mascara on right here it's called big T's from buxom to prep our lashes for falsies oh this one really grabs onto the lashes I'm gonna pick out some lashes from my little books that I have here this is a bunch of different lashes so this is just old ones that I'd use like once or twice I'm gonna pick up flirt and pop it onto the lower lash line take it all the way in all the way into the inner corners blend it out and then right with that waterline is I'm going to take the Maybelline Gigi Hadid gel liner pop that in right there then I'm going to take my concealer from NARS and work that right into the inner corners [Music] and then for the highlight I'm going to use the buxom divine goddess Luminizer in Venus what a name so it's this liquid illuminator like this and I've tried it before it's very subtle I'm just going to take that on the cheeks I'm gonna use this as a base highlight and take it right down the nose and I'm right on top of they keep it's about to bake underneath my eyes I'm gonna use the Laura Mercier brightening under-eye powders oh wait it's called the secret brightening powder for under eyes that's a really long name but I'm gonna use this in shade one and just work it right on top of my concealer I'm gonna let that settle and then I'm gonna take the new bronzer from the balm it's called take home the bronze it's an anti orange bronzer this is in the shade tawny so I'm going to take this and work that right on the cheeks give to face some color [Music] and I'm gonna use the Mac to 75s it's like a curvy brush and I'm gonna take the bronze Grammy shade this one right here and snatch my nose real quick I'm gonna take the vanilla shade from the latte palette and just go right over the top of the nose and down the center to highlight right along the sides of the nose I like that this isn't too ashy as a contour color it's not like super orange that shade that I used as a bronzer we brought a nice tan into my face I am loving these bronzers so far now I'm gonna use the frat-boy blush right here from the balm just a light pink flush of color I'm just gonna use that right on the apples of my cheeks so I'm gonna go ahead and pop on a lip color to my lips the one I'm gonna be using is from buxom it's the Evolve ah plump shiny liquid lipstick and the shade that I'm gonna use is a beg for mob or come to dolly I'm in between both of them there's actually 20 shades to choose from that I have they're all really pretty and go from fall to spring day to night with them but I'm gonna choose something with like a pinky purple undertone something kind of Mavi it has like a curved lip applicator it's supposed to really hug your lip and just be easy to apply it really gets into the curve of your lip which is a good thing okay I'm gonna test this one out on the bottom of my lip because I'm not really sure about this color and then I'm gonna text beg for I mean text and then I'm gonna show you what beg for mob looks like just you see it oh no that's too bright there's also getting warmer let's see what this looks like I'm actually gonna change it up I'm gonna use getting warmer I'm gonna take all these shades off of my lip ooh and there's like a plumping effect in this lip so I can feel like the tingly sensation happening the shade I'm gonna use is getting warmer I decided on this one right here I think it would go perfect with this lip and with one swipe you get a really saturated color so it's a really nice and shiny and it's supposed to last pretty long this is the final look I love the way this came out you can see my little my ratchet ponytail thank

Brandt the Luminizer primer and this is gonna fill in your pores but it's not going to make your where she stays what happens is sometimes silicone when you put that onto your skin and you mix it in with a good different like a water-based moisturizer or something else you don't mix together so they end up rolling up and that's sometimes what happens I was just Tony I'll put something on and then I'll go like this and literally I'm like what the heck and it's like rolls all off of me so that's what happens when you're mixing the wrong parts together get a little bit of the h2o aqua defense

from Tarte always would you want a cup so backwards it's so funny it's so cool to see how people do their makeup we may personally we're just saying that we're not gonna switch from a shape tape until somebody comes out with something better than shape it has to be better even found anything better than that before this mine was Urban Decay Naked skin NARS me like me me wait you mix them no no

natural we learn to love it embrace the inner cruise boat boys so I'm going to start off with moisturizing my skin the first thing I'm going to use is this little cutie right here it's from this month's if sea glam bag I'm actually partnering with Ipsy to use some of the stuff in the glam bag in my video today so if you see other little cuties like this it's probably from the glam bag I'm gonna try this guy right here this is air repair complexion boosting moisturizer so we are going to pop that on to our face to give us a nice boost of moisture so I'm gonna put some of this on squeezing the little life out of it it's supposed to help with dry skin dehydrated skin ensued out your skin feels really good smells kind of smells like a really pretty plant that I don't really know the name of I like to put a light base of foundation on just before I do anything else I like to work with my eyes first but when I'm filming I like to put a light base of foundation so it's just a little bit easier to look at you know just say and then take my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation and why three through five in case you guys are wondering this little brush right here is from it cosmetics and I use this from time to time but it I feel like it doesn't like it's a good brush but I feel like it needs little streaky marks on my face so I end up using my Beauty Blender to smooth it out and that is a very far for me right now so oh my god I had my sponge right here I had both sponges this is the 3d Sigma Beauty sponge I've been using lately and I like it I like it very much so I just kind of like smooth everything out with this little guy okay so now we have foundation on I'm going to quickly put my brows on I've been using this L'Oreal one I used it today actually it's in dark brunette it's their stylist definer brow thing I'm actually going over it with the benefit brows was it a brow give it that a little bit of a warmer look it was a little bit too cool tone for me I'm gonna actually use lid primer today I know I never use lip primer I always use a concealer I'm gonna go ahead and use this one this is from Smashbox that's their photo photo finish lid primer in light and I'm gonna pop that onto my lid then I'm just going to blend everything out with a beauty sponge alright so now we have a clean smooth nice even canvas to work on I'm going to go ahead and pick up a new palette that I haven't used that just came out and it's so so pretty and natural-looking it's the Too Faced and natural love palette I think it's so gorge I'm going to pick up nudie I'm going to pop that into my crease first which crease brush are we using today mini is this Luxy 229 brush grab nudie and then I'm going to just work that back and forth into my crease make sure you don't have too much product on your brush so it's not like oh you know work this in circular motions in to the crease I'm actually gonna extend it a little further out like right about here we are going to be putting a different color on top of this so you do want to kind of use this Kri shade a little bit higher up so the reason why we're using this is so that we can have a nice gradient effect so I'm going to take it a little bit higher up than what you know the usual crease like right about here I'm going to take it up a little further up like right in here and I'm going to go back and forth in circular motions and then of course right into the crease I'm just going to use these back and forth motions so now that we have that very neutral crease shade on there I'm going to go ahead and pop in makeup and chill makeup and chill is this really nice Brown it's actually the darkest Brown in the palette I'm going to go ahead and take that it's a matte shade I'm going to take the same brush and I'm just going to start to work that layering it right underneath the first crease shade and I say underneath because I still want that shot that topi shadow to peek through and help with that gradient and dimension and so we're going to keep this right below this is the Sigma tapered blending the e-40 I'm going to go ahead and blend the edges of this keeping my hand towards the back of the brush so I have more control over the blend so the next color I'm going to use is this one right here this is the deuce a free Matic eyeshadow in the shade I wanted to use that on the crease it's a little shimmery but it's like super highly pigmented and very blendable so I really enjoyed playing with this before I did this look when I put her right into the crease and really bring it in make sure to blend it out like out further towards the tail end of the brow I am trying my best to leave the lid open because I want to put a really pretty pink color in there from the Too Faced palette so I'm just going to leave that as open as possible so for the lid color I'm going to take bunny nose which is this really pretty pink right here and just work that into the lid I'm going to use this eye shadow brush right here from Vasanti it's called the professional contour eye shadow brush I'm going to work this on the outer lid just to blend out the harsh edge it has those dome shaped bristles so it's perfect for blending in the crease little inner and outer corners so I'm just going to take that and blend that harsh edge out like so the bristles are really soft this is a really good crease brush actually I am going to keep that I also want to create a line right here with this shadow so I'm going to wet this winged liner brush this is the Sigma eo6 wet it up and then I'm going to dip my brush into this shadow right here so as you can wet it too so let's see how it works as a liner it's pretty it gives you like a rose gold kind of look which is really pretty for spring create a little wing like that that's actually really really pretty I like it a lot so I'm gonna put some mascara on now I use my Maybelline colossal Big Shot put my lashes before I put on some false lashes I'm going to be using these velour lashes in the style see-through they look like this for the lower lash line I'm going to take this over Cosmetics peach blush and I'm going to use it as an eye shadow I feel like you can use it as a highlight and eyeshadow it's just really pretty peachy pink golden undertones it's gorgeous so I'm going to go ahead and pop that on the lower lash line with a wet angled liner brush and I just wet it by spritzing some fix+ on it I know it looks a little crazy right now because I don't have concealer on but I will do that in just a minute for my under eyes I'm going to take this city color photo chic dark spot corrector it's going to just brighten up any dark spots on your face and so I'm going to take it it has like a peachy undertone so I feel like it's good as a color corrector for me too so I'm going to use my concealer brush and just work it in there and this is just going to really help to neutralize the dark spots on your face or for me underneath my eyes and I'm just going to work it right underneath there wow that really actually really like how that covered up my under eyes so now I'm just going to put on some mascara on my bottom lashes so we're done with the eyes I'm going to go ahead and move on to the rest of the face I'm going to contour first I feel like we need to contour so I'm going to take my where is it I'm going to use my I use the same thing all the time I love this thing so so much but I'm changing up my brush I'm using the Smith 220 brush to contour and of course the Y 505 from Make Up For Ever I'm just going to hollow out my cheekbones a little bit more [Music] I've been liking liquid blush lately more so than the powdery blush because I just I'm kind of steering away from too many powders on my face I'm gonna take orgasm this is the liquid blush from Mars worth that on my cheeks it's a really pretty pink shade and a little bit goes a long way with this it blends into the skin so nicely and it just melts into your skin for this springtime I really like my face to look moisturize and just really glowing and healthy so I opted for more creams than powders but I do want to set my face in place so nothing moves around but before I do that I'm going to spritz some of this Mac prep and prime it's this fix plus writes that all over my face let that sit to set my creams in place I'm going to take this cover FX translucent powder okay I'm gonna just dust this all over my skin just so that everything is in place it's not going to give us any more coverage but it's going to make sure that our creams don't go anywhere slip and slide off of our face I use a little bit of bronzer behind the apples of the cheeks and around the temple and the bronze are amazing is this one right here it's the Victoria Beckham Estee Lauder bronzer and I'm just taking it across the temples and right behind the cheekbone so for the highlight I'm going to take the Too Faced Lovelight prismatic highlighter and this is in the shade blinded by the light and I'm gonna pop that on my cheeks so now we're moving on to the lips I'm going to take this matte dervish lip liner and I'm going to line my lips with it sometimes I'll use this lip liner and not even wear anything else with it and I'll just put it all over my lips and it gives it just a really natural pretty flush of color on the lips I'm going to take the Tarte cosmetics TARDIS quick dry matte lip paint and this is in the shade Rose Day I'm going to use that all over the lips this lip paint is very full coverage and it dries really quick when I do a matte lip I usually like to go in the center with a gloss so today I'm going to be using this little guy right here it's another little cutie and this is from be a bombshell cosmetics and it's a lip gloss and the shade possess'd it's a really pretty nude 18 color and I like to use something that has a higher Shyne and this one is supposed to have that high shine so it works perfect for the center of the lips just to give us that pouty boost in our lips this is a really pretty combo I like the combo with the eyes it just all ties in together beautifully I really like it I feel like it's very fresh and perfect for springtime and that's pretty much the look this is the final look you guys [Music] thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you

[Music] I don't even know what to do with myself with all this highlight this just it speaks to man's hey guys welcome back to my channel so today we are doing a full face of first impressions using all new makeup from Too Faced peaches and cream the smells of the Too Faced collection we're gonna talk about this in a little bit from funky beauty and from YSL and everybody else that came out with something new it's gonna be on my face today and I didn't realize I didn't know that was going in this direction but everything on my face is geared towards somebody with a really oily skin this is a super matte look I really like how it looks on my face but I do have dry skin so it's a little like I have Botox just like my whole face is really really tight but it looks really good and it's gonna look great in pictures but I have lipstick on ki if you guys have oily skin this is gonna be the perfect makeup tutorial this makeup tutorial is just for you if you have dry skin well you're just gonna look you're gonna look really good but you're gonna feel like a tight appraisin this is like an everyday glam look for me I could definitely wear this every day I hope you guys enjoy it before we get into this video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification both need to be a part of the quad family and let's get on with I'm actually filming in the morning for the first time in a long time and it makes me super happy cuz when I film in the morning so I feel like I have the most energy and lately I've been filming at night when I'm just kind of like ready to go to bed might have a huge thing of coffee and I am ready to show you guys some new makeup and give you my honest opinion on them as I put them on I already did my brows and they go ahead and start with the eyes so I'm gonna use this Too Faced just peachy matte palette this is from the peaches and cream collection I have the whole collection but I'm using and reviewing some products not all of them ooh that is very that's a very strong peach smell I just like moosh peach in my face this shows different little things that I would actually use so I have the palette here and it looks like this there's a lot of warm tone shade I like the orange a peach right here and there are some Browns you can take from day two not a glam night but definitely a little bit more dramatic look before I put any color on my eyes I'm going to prime my eyes first and set them with concealer so I'm gonna do that really quick it's so important to me to have a setting color in the palette and they have a perfect one right here so I'm gonna take each butter and I'm setting my concealer with it just so that everything is nice and smooth by is evenly and it's set in place so I'm picking up is peach tea and I'm gonna work that into the crease this is a warm crease shade and using very light pressure I'm going to use circular motions to work it into the crease and extending it out to the end of the tail into the brow and if you get a little bit on the lid it's fine because we're gonna cover the entire lid anyways if anything it'll help with a gradient effect so the eye shadow blends very easy and it's not patchy at all go-to color payoff the next color I'm picking up is peach cobbler and I'm gonna work that all over the lid up into the crease with this one we're gonna be layering a lot of these colors on top of one another just so that we can create that seamless gradient on our I've easily lays color down on the eye and then once you're ready to blend it out you can take it with soft pressure and just move your brush back and forth and it blends it out so nice because it's not a round brush you have a little bit more precision so I'm gonna go in an angle right here this is gonna make any color on top just look like a warm buttery pie so I'm gonna take peachy punch next this is a super vibrant pink coral color work that into the crease live in this look up a lot and I'm not gonna put that on the lid I'm just going to have this kind of be the halo of the eyeshadow I definitely grabbed this palette as one of my everyday kind of palettes for the rest of the lip color I'm going to take just right which is this reddish plum color right here and I'm gonna work that on the lid or the brow bone I'm gonna take the lightest shade in the palette which is peach meringue it's like a yellow tone shade I always like to have most of the highlight right on the arch and then I blend the shadow out into the other area and then I'll blend it down as far as I need to if I like when a little too high with the Cree shadow so I'm gonna do a wing on my eye I'm gonna use this new estee lauder Victoria Beckham it's the eye ink matte eyeliner I actually really like the Victoria Beckham estee lauder line because I have the bronzer and I have the eye shadows from her and they are so beautiful pigmented and just sit flawless on the skin so I'm excited to try this liner the liner is a very pointy so I also like that you can make a really crisp clean line this is an intense black eyeliner and I like when eileen is drying that it dries super matte so much that it dries out super fast so you have to keep putting it in the little tube but I really like it they also came out with a mascara with Victoria Beckham's line so it looks like this it's just like a skinny little tube I mean it's a skinny little tube and it's a skinny little wand as well and these kind of mascaras work really well for the lower lash line let's see what it does for our upper lashes it is a very wet mascara meaning it will weigh your lashes down a little bit but it definitely grabs every lash but it is a little wet so I think this will work really well for the lower lashes okay just just as I thought this works beautifully for the lower lashes because the lower lashes are so thin and fine it grabs every single lash and brings it out it's it's look at my lashes you can see almost every single individual lash that is amazing for the lower lash I'm gonna take these lashes right here in the pink box the pink boxes are usually more natural-looking I'm gonna take opulence they're so pretty the next new thing that I'm gonna try out is the YSL all ours primer oh my bad you're supposed to twist it so it looks like this oh very thin very very can formula I feel like it's brightening my face like my skin just got brighter with this and I'm gonna use the concealer and the foundation so this dries instantly on your skin and I almost feel like it's going to be one of those mattifying primer so if you have oily skin this would work well for you I have dry skin so it doesn't have the best feeling on my skin because it feels a little tight and then for the foundation I'm gonna use all hours Foundation and I've already tried this guy out I already know he's good he's really good and it's a very full coverage they sent in one of those foundation brushes but I didn't like the way it applied to my face with a face brush so I'm going to use the Beauty Blender which they also sent in and start to work this on my face if you are looking for a full coverage foundation that is going to cover up acne redness hyperpigmentation or scars this would be really great for you and if you have oily skin it's gonna work like a dream but first it kind of looks like it's going to be a little dewy but it definitely dries matte trust me very much to the point where I actually needed to spritz on some kind of hide hydrating mist then again I do have a dry skin type I'm gonna let this dry on my face it does take a minute to set it is a matte foundation but it looks very dewy right now so I'm gonna go ahead and do my under my lower lash line actually before I finished doing this part I want to try the Douai estelle concealer thought they sent as well since the shade 40 PA for I think I'm gonna try this on my under eye I see the good thing about this is that it is buildable same thing with the foundation everything is really buildable it also doesn't feel a heavy on the face so that is the definite plus okay so now that we have our under eyes concealed I can move on to the lower lash line so I'm gonna take just peachy and work that underneath the lower lash line on the outer part of the lower lash line I'm going to take peach tart and just work that really close to the outer part of the lower lash line I'm not gonna bring it in at all I just want to add to that cat cat eye look and then with that just peachy shade I'm gonna blend out the edge of this Brown so it's not harsh so now I'm going to contour my face I just bought the centipede II contour sticks they are magnetic which is super cool it has a really cool shape to it I've never seen anything like this I think it's really unique and cool and I like the packaging it's nude I like my nudes so I have mocha for my contour and it looks like so I shut up let me see how much product is how I work that back down I like the shade of it it's an ashy tone shade so it's gonna look really natural I'm gonna go ahead and work that on my cheek bone I want a higher cheekbone so I'm gonna bring it up a little bit higher until it's going to blend into a really nice natural-looking shadow I just like blending with these little tiny ones because I feel like there's so much more precise I don't want to get this color in the wrong places so that's why I'm using a smaller beauty blender for this it looks like a natural nice shadow it works really well for my skin tone so far she also has this shape called bamboo this is the matte skin stick and then I'll just blend that out with the same little Beauty Blender and then they have a shimmer stick that looks like this this is a shade trip int so I'll put it in the same spots like as we highlighted earlier I'm gonna work it in with my ratchet Rachel finger I'm gonna do the other side love how it does that like I'm in midair and then I'm about to okay for mine to set my face I'm actually gonna set my entire face with the peach blur from Too Faced I tried this before it came out and when I first tried it I was like why is this all shimmery how is this gonna blur my face is gonna make my face look crazy I was very skeptical about this but I actually tried it and I absolutely loved the way it made my skin look it makes your skin literally look like you have a filter on your skin set my entire face with this and it does have a very strong sweet peach scent to it I feel like this the sense in in this peach collection are way stronger than the first one for sure literally makes your skin like you have a filter on it I love this peach blur so much okay I went and brightened my under eyes a little bit with some powder but it's stuff that I've already used it's not new so I didn't want to use it this first impressions of new makeup kind of video so I did that off-camera if you want to know what I used I'll always put it in the description to add some color to the cheeks and to bring some life back into my face I'm gonna take the Too Faced sweetiepie compact and it looks like so it's a it's supposed to be a matte bronzer but it's called a radiant matte bronzer so it sits on your face matte but it also has these illuminating particles to it but it doesn't make it look like shimmer it's not shimmer on your face honestly I could see somebody being a little put off by all of the peach scent all at one time but I'm the type of person that loves sweet smelling things that I'm okay with it but I can definitely see how it would be a little too much for some people this just it speaks to me on so many levels so now for the highlight I have two highlights from fenty beauty one of them is called trophy wife and the other one is is like a duo highlight and her line is called kilowatt the the highlighting I guess category of her line so there's this a really bright gold color right here let me just swatch it on my arm it's very sheer it's more of like a glittery type of highlight and then there's this one right here this is hustle a baby it has like a peach undertone this is the one that I think I'm gonna use today and then there's like a softer shade which is called new money and I think what I'm gonna do is use a mixture of both because they're both really really pretty really gonna try to incorporate all of them on my face today so let's just see what we come up with here first I'm gonna take this one right here her highlights are no joke this highlight is definitely poppin I'm also gonna try the trophy wife because it's just how can you not try this whoa that is intense this is the most intense highlight I have ever used in my life I think honestly no joke not even trying to overhype this thing I don't know what to do with myself without this highlight for the lip I'm gonna use something that's not new it's the stripped down Mac lip liner so I'm just gonna pop that on really quick for the lipstick I'm gonna use the Too Faced lipstick in the shade send a fun day and the tube looks this this is such a pretty nude it has little peaches all around it I'm gonna put that on my lips right on top of the lip liner this is the lighter shade is called Dollface I'm going to take that on and pop it on to the center of the lips and this lipstick is nice and creamy and hydrating there is a peach miss that I want to try out this is also mattifying if you don't shake this up you will have white splotches on your face so you make sure to shake it up test it on your arm before you spritz it on your face I'm gonna spritz it on just to say that I did it thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it you know what you know what to do give it a thumbs up and I have some

makes sense the shimmers and the mattes makes sense I just I'm really excited to put this on my eyeballs all my eyelids don't put on your eyeballs it's not safe and it also comes with a brush which so first Kylie brush that I use like an actual eyeshadow brush feels pretty good and I'm actually looking over at my new more few brushes that I just got in and you're like almost the same oh except this is more of them this is more of a rose gold versus a gold well you see that they're so similar the brush is pretty similar Wow so I'm going to start off with sorbet which is this shade right here and I'm going to work that all over my lid and just pack it onto the lid all the way up to the brow bone and this is a really pretty matte peachy shade I'm also just gonna wrap it around the bottom of the lash line as well I'm going to take it around I always like to squeeze my brush like this so it's like a little fluffy fan brush and work that around the lash line the lower lash line I swear I need to make my own fluffy little fan brush for the lower lash line I'm loving this peachy shade it's so pretty I'm going to go ahead and take this color right here which is peachy so it's this darker matte shade of peach and I'm going to work that right above the lighter peach color that we just put on and I'm going to take my new little more few brushes that I just opened today I'm going to actually take this brush right here so see morphe doesn't have a number on that's weird this one right here and I'm going to work that a right above this one so I'm going to make sure to pack that on all over the lid and blend it back and forth using windshield wiper motions and you can kind of buff out the edges like that you want that pretty peach light peach shade to peek through this one so try not to go completely over it just kind of layering on top like so and then if you happen to lose some of the lighter peach just take the brush that you use to put it on first and just work it back in there and kind of you can also buff out the edges with this brush it works really good to make them look smooth this is the stepsister of the eyes because this one just has so many weird folds in it she always ate hot cheetos and bean dip she is me actually this kind of looks like a hot cheetos inspired look I also take that color around the lower lash line I'm going to take this brush right here and I'm going to take this light taupe shade and work that into the crease to give it some dimension so just going to these windshield wiper motions to just intensifying that crease shadow I'm going to take this color on the outer V of my eye so we're going to create a V and then we're going to bring it halfway in to the crease so it looks like that starting to look more and more like a flamin hot cheeto that's pretty oh my god I'm falling in love with this look so I'm going to go in with Dutchess this shade right here I'm going to put it on top of my lid and I go ahead and Pat that right on top of the lid color so I'm gonna start in the middle I'm gonna work that around everywhere almost reminds me of a dirty penny and actually I'm going to go into the middle of my lid with this shade right here which is clean B and pop it on to the center of the lid just to add a little bit more light here and I'm going to keep it right on this Center for the bottom lashes for the bottom lash line I'm going to go in with that really beautiful royal blue and I'm going to work that very close to the lash line I am back with my blue eyeliner because I think I'm just going to line the inner rim to see what that looks like and I'm using my Lancome blue eyeliner and then I'm going to take some of that Brown wheezed earlier brown shade is called sandy BTW if you were wondering that

the waterline next I'm just going to make my lashes super super big and fluffy so I'm going to take a really good mascara if you're having trouble with lashes or mascara try to find one that's dry or you can just leave it out for like a day leave it out for a couple hours or even a day and it'll dry up a little bit it actually works better than a very wet feeling mascara so now I'm going to put on some lashes I'm going to use these flutter lashes and Kelsey they're very pretty wispy fluffy looking lashes so I'm going to put those on and I will be right back okay I want to darken up a little bit

again and I'm going to start to work that into my face it has some coverage in it which I was not expecting to be that heavy but I'm not mad at it so keep the coverage coming season thank you you take

love you guys so much don't forget to comment below all the peach emojis just flood me spam me I want to see all the butts on my comments and that's pretty much it until the next video bye Dolly's 
[Music] like the movie monsters I'll let you guys know I'm not naked I know I look naked but I promise I am wearing an upside down tube dress because I don't have a black tube top hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be doing this plummy smokey halo eye with a pop of lime on the lid I haven't done a dramatic look in such a long time and I'm using a bunch of new makeup that I've been excited to try out so I can't wait to show you guys how to get this look in the new makeup also just to remind you guys I am doing a huge back-to-school giveaway on my last video the back-to-school video I'm doing away i pads a MacBook Air I don't want you guys to miss out so don't forget to enter if you haven't already and if you have then good luck and if you want to learn how to get this sleek smokey look that I have been obsessed with don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bells to give you a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on I'm gonna have a lot of smokey mess all over my face so I don't want to start with any foundation at all so what I'm gonna do is just jump into the eyes so to prime my eyes I'm gonna use this NARS soft matte complete concealer this also cleans up the brow and I keep moving that over and I like a winged liner because you want it to be nice and fluid and then bring it down and you want the base to be nice and even we'll work that in with my finger using your finger is best when you're applying or blending out creamy products like this because the warmth of your skin heats up the product and it just melts into your skin it's so nice and flawless okay so we've primed our lids we have a nice even base but I also want to make sure that I set this cream because if I just start applying different shades and it's not set it might move around and get really weird so you want to make sure you set it I'm going to be using the nude beach palette from the balm today for the smokey eye and I'm gonna take brilliant I'm gonna take this shade right here it's a very neutral similar to my skin tone shade it's just gonna set our eyes in place so nothing budges our moves and just pop that on so that nothing is moving around on our eyelids so now we're done prepping our eyes I'm gonna go straight into the crease the crease shade that I'm using is actually not in this palette because I didn't see a light enough shade to really transition into so I'm just taking Peach Smoothie from makeup geek tap off the excess and start right in the crease right in your crease and if you don't have a crease you can always make one and you just want to make a Halfmoon right above any part of your lid and that will be your crease I'm gonna work that back and forth in some windshield wiper motions like so and you can see it's very subtle but it's going to be very helpful in the gradual process of this dark intense shadow that we are doing today so I'm gonna also do the same thing to the other eye and I feel like this eye is just the stepsister get ready because we are about to use a ton of different crease shades so are you ready it's called bold it's in this bold area right here I'm gonna take this same brush and just work that shade right into the same area so we're just going overlapping that Peach Smoothie shade and working it right into the crease and when you want to buff out the shadows make them look softer towards the edge you always want to lift your hand up take your hand move it towards the back of the brush and then lift the pressure up and use these circular motions to blend them out I'm going to take bold on this brush and just work it on the inner and outer corners bring it up into the crease where we were blending and then you see how it's kind of harsh go ahead and take whatever crease brush you were using and with a very light soft feather hand with your hand could be a feather use the circular motions and it buffs everything out and then I'm gonna go on the inner corner and start to work that in there and then I'm going to connect this to the crease and bring the crease shade down into the inner part of the lid this is a very light layer but I like to just go back and forth just to make sure that I don't have any harsh edges and since I've already talked you through one eye I'm just going to fast forward this part and turn on my ratchet music and finish this eye look the next crease shade this is what crease number three the next crease shade is bodacious this orange brown shade right here I'm gonna work that right on the outer corners and into the crease same thing we're just layering it over we want the other shadows to peek through these so you make some space so that you can still see them okay for the fourth shade that we're using it's this one right here it's called brazen so we're going to take that on the same brush I was cleaning it off as I go so don't worry it is the actual true color that one the same area so I'm going to take it right on the outer edge work it here you want us to use this darker shade very low and you don't want to overdo this you want to gradually build this up a little bit at a time because once you put on way too much it is very difficult to blend out take your time and blend out as you go I really like this brush for blending this is the urban decay itro 9 tapered blending because you're wondering this is a really really nice brush to blend and again I'm using a very light hand in hand it's lifted off of the skin very light pressure and then I'm just going back and forth do not press down too hard once I started doing this my makeup started looking a whole lot better so just a little tip for you guys oh my god this is so bad I'm gonna put makeup on and I'm already at you I'm just using short quick patting motions to get that darker shade down there and you want to do this kind of look when you have a lot of time on your hands you don't want to be rushing a smoky eye or a halo with glitter it could look very messy especially be using dark colors like this these I'm just gonna connect the two together I don't want it to be too dark we just want these two shades to kind of glide into one another and now I'm gonna take this plummy purple this shade right here it's called brave into the outer and inner part of the lid same thing that we did with the other shade we're just making this even more intense I'm looking down because I'm cleaning the brush off using the same brush I love the way I just love the shape of this brush and I don't want to dig in two of my other brushes so I'm just gonna keep this one brush and use it for the inner and outer part of the eye so I'm going to do the same thing just build up that intensity I love this like plummy color feather out the edges as you build it up it's like you want to create a little C shape around your eye blend your way up so it could be gradual in gradient rather than putting a harsh line right up on top and then trying to blend it out gradually work it as high up as you'd like I'm gonna go back and forth into this shade intensify it bring it up we'll end it out you will see what I'm talking about for that Center lid I'm gonna take the new the dose of colors collaboration with desi and Katy this is their palette it's such a beautiful palette I'm gonna take turbo Sun right here and this is one of the shadows that you can use dry and i've swatched them they are so pigmented and then these two guys you use wet and they look like metallic beauty on your skin but I'm gonna take this one right here this is like a plum color it is so so gorgeous I thought this shadow would work really really good as a plum II pop in the center of the lid as these really beautiful reflective in it so I'm gonna take that on my ring finger just work my finger in there and we are going to pop it on to the lid like so I feel like this I shadow was meant for this look that I created with this palette because it is such a beautiful complement to that plummy Brown while we're here I just want to show you how beautiful these shadows are so that right here I'm not flipping you guys off I'm just trying to do oh my god this is such a beautiful color with the other two shades you're supposed to wet them I wet my finger just a little bit this is what it looks like I kind of want to use this just as a bright highlight harpoon I'm so beautiful and then what I'm gonna do is go back into bodacious spring that warmth back into this area okay so now I'm just gonna line my waterline so what I'm gonna do is take this Mac liquid last liner and line the upper lash line I'm not gonna make a wing I'm just going to literally add some definition to my lash area so that when we put on false lashes it just seamlessly blends together nicely so I'm just gonna make a line right here so we are gonna go with these Lily lashes right here these are in this style Ella they're long and flirty and a little dramatic but still PC enough so you can see what you did on your eyelid go ahead and do my lower lash line after I do my foundation but this is pretty much the eye look right here I love this glittery eye shadow it's so pretty it really brings a look together I love it I love it so much we use this primer right here from Kat Von D on my face something I haven't used in a while I just don't I keep using the same thing over and over again so I'm going to try this out and then I'm gonna use the Kat Von D foundation which is super full coverage and the Lockett foundation in a medium 52 and then for concealer I'm just gonna use some of this Turk she taped right on the inner corners I'm just gonna Pat that into the skin I'm using very light hand emotions I feel like I said a lot but it's super necessary I don't want you guys to be going in super hard and then it's gonna look it's not gonna turn out the way you want it to so I think it's important to tell you guys how to hold the products how much pressure it up it down so I'm gonna brighten in contour so I'm gonna take the Kat Von D shade + light contour palette this is like my favorite go-to OG contour palette and ass in DB so I'm gonna take these two shades per usual pop them underneath my eye to brighten and I'm just going to look up so we don't get any creasing work it down and over all right so you're gonna add a little bit more brightness to the under-eye and it's just gonna stay in place so it doesn't slide off of our face so dipping into both of these guys and I'm going to put my god my hair looks I'm gonna go ahead and contour the cheeks here by the ear and then go down I don't want to go down too far look at that that is dark and then I'm going to take the clean side of the brush and then work this contour shade upwards and then for the nose contour I'm going to use this brush right here I'm going to take that middle shade and a little bit of the lighter shade together and we are going to match that nose and then bring it around the nose and I'm going to soften it up with this brush right here just patting it for bronzing up the face I'm going to use this NARS bronzer in casino I always start behind your cheekbone and then bring it in to see you can kind of gauge how much you want I almost forgot to go back into the eyes because we want to finish out that lower lash line go back into the nude beach palette and I'm gonna take bodacious I'm gonna work that on the lower lash line we have a hair and that is not a mustache hair approach part of that Russia was using made sure to shave my mustache before I got on here connecting it to that outer edge and work it all the way in and then right on the waterline I'm gonna take the Urban Decay glide on pencil and 0 so I'm gonna take this brush and smudge out the black liner a little bit lower smoke it out with that purpley shaggy's earlier brave and work that right underneath it alright so getting back to the rest of the face we are going to highlight for the highlight I'm gonna take Lego right here flag on the cheekbone so now all I have left is the lips so for the lips I'm gonna go ahead and deke Mac's world lip pencil to line up my lips and then I'm gonna use one of the nude lips let's see either more creamer or no shade I think when did you know shade on my lips my lips are a little dry but this lipstick is actually really hydrating so I feel way better about my lips now this is the gloss in over the top it is so beautiful let me just see what it looks like really quick okay so we went with the gloss on the center of the lips the last thing that we're gonna do is spread some fix+ all over the face so we can make these powders look like skin again and let's do this [Music] thank you guys for watching I

take a minute I know it's a drastic change I am now the buna emoji or she liked this I dyed my hair I feel like it's such a good change for the winner and my heart's need a break but I'm very happy with it at first I was a little scared but I adjusted Jaden has told me he doesn't like it it's okay I think he needs to get adjusted to I actually really like it now cuz I was used to like the dimension and it just it was so different but now I really like it I'm just going back to my roots let me know in the comments what you guys think about my original hair color that I was born with taking it back with my nails they're super glittery love it my nails were so ratchet for so long very happy about these nails right here so today I'm going to show you how to do this quick and easy holiday look literally super quick because I actually have to go to the airport in a few minutes so I haven't even packed so I have 5 or 10 minutes to pack so I'm gonna try to do this as fast as I can you like this look I promise you it probably looks a little complicated but it's super easy and I hope you guys enjoy this holiday look and it's got further ado let's get started before we get started and jump into the makeup I just want to let you guys know I'll be using some products from the estate C glam bag in the first product that I'm using is this Ren clear skin glycol lactic radiance renewal mask this guy right here I'm gonna put it on right now just a little mask before we get started this smells really good like a mango or something or tangerine tangerine mango this mask is supposed to renew the skins texture and tone so I'm gonna put it on let it sit there and it also minimizes pores and hyperpigmentation so I need all that stuff to work on my face today I'm gonna go wash that off now I'm going to use this tarte maracuja oil on my face today it's gonna help with moisturizing my skin it also helps with firming the skin and I actually really like using this for my split ends a flyaways when I have flyaways the next thing I'm going to use is for my large pores I got some big one my nose I'm going to use this Porefessional from benefit Lucas ochio as a little baby and I'm going to take some of that and the way I like using the professional is by tapping it into my skin like this I like to use it around my t-zone because my pores are out - say hello to everybody and I'm trying to push them back into their house feel like it works best this way it really gets into the pores and fills them in so it looks really nice and even when I'm going through a quick look and I want to just get out the door quick and easy I'll use a foundation stick today I'm going to be using my hourglass it hourglass vanish stick in nude and i'ma just use that on my face really quick and just glide Ounces smooths with that Monica gel wheel like butter like vada ooh that's a lot of foundation I love it though so now we're going to blend it in with my beauty sponge from Tarte and just press it into my skin get in those inner corners it is very hollow in there very hollow sleepy hollow actually Pat it dab it press it work it into your skin you just want to make sure everything matches and then don't forget your neck actually I'm really in a hurry I have to catch a flight to Houston so this is a really quick makeup look now that everything is even I'm going to start to working on my eyes I'm going to be using the Urban Decay Naked ultimate basics palette and I'm going to take rush right here this is the morphe Y 18 brush I'm loving the gold brushes by the way you guys I have a discount code if you just type in my code right here you'll get a discount on these brushes and everything on the morphe site so I'm going to take the pre-game shade right here to matte yellow color very pretty like a banana color and I'm going to take it and go all over the the lid all the way up to the problem this is going to be a nice base well I want this matte color to be laid down first because this is going even out your entire lid and also set that cream that we just put on our lid so that anything that we put on top is just going to blend a lot easier and look a lot smoother the next thing I'm going to do is put on the lid color and take below this shade right here it's like a white shimmery shade and I'm going to press that into the lid when you're on the go and you need something quick the easiest thing to do is enhance your eyes with contour colors in this case it has a little bit of a shimmer to it which makes it a little festive in pretty and then with a clean brushing brush or with the brush we just used to lay down that all-over shadow we're just going to soften up the edges before the crease color I'm going to use this morphe m4 12 brush and then take commando right here and I'm going to work that into the crease and what we're doing is just and if you're in a hurry you can't find this palette or a color like it just use just use your contour palette if you have a contour palette or even a bronzer would work anything that's going to enhance that crease it's going to create a natural shadow if you want to get a little bit more depth take a denser tinier brush so what I'm going to do is take my morphe y22 brush and I'm going to use this shade right here it's called lethal we fill us a little bit of a darker Brown I'm going to take lethal and instinct actually mix them together I'm going to work that my on the crease just blend out that second crease color so it's nice and soft looking and smooth so it looks like that gives it a little bit more depth is your eye a little bit more dimension you really don't need to go any further from there and then for the brow bone I'm just going to take I'm going to take nude this shade right here and we're just going to pop it on the brow bone I'm going to take this Pat McGrath silver pigment and I'm going to work it on to the lids my city color brush right here and this is like a baked eyeshadow it's really pretty I'm just going to pop it on lid you can wet it if you want no get up really good pay off that way but I think I just want a subtle shimmer now I'm gonna use an a-level move I'm gonna use an eyeliner I'm going to take my hardest liner and just make a wing with the other side the pencil I'm going to go ahead and fill in the upper part of the water line right on the tight line that number I can never get used to that I'm going to go ahead and put on some mascara and lashes and I will be right back for the lashes and I take these new House of lashes lashes lashes lashes so I'm going to take these House of lashes in the style Mon chéri it's a new lash style and I'm going to go ahead and pop them onto my eye and then for the bottom lash line I'm going to take a tempted and place that underneath my lash line I mean underneath my waterline we're a pop of color I'm going to take this NYX professional makeup prismatic shadow and this is in the shade fireball it's a really pretty metallic shade i swatched it it's a really smooth shadow and it's super pigmented look at that crazy color I'm going to pop that in to the lower part of the lash line I'm going to take this royal and langnickel Moda angle eye shader brush and I'm going to work that NYX shadow in with that angle brush eyeshadow brush is 100% vegan friendly so that's cool stuff now I'm going to take some silver glitter is that Urban Decay had metal glam rock I think it is got glam rock silver glitter I'm going to pop that onto the inner corners of my eyes then I'm going to go in with this mica beauty angled eyeshadow brush and this is really good for contouring for using contouring colors around the eyes so I'm going to go ahead and go back into commando and tempted and I'm just going to work that right underneath the next shadow now I'm going to put some concealer on just to brighten my under-eye circles yeah and also use it to highlight my face and then blend it in with my Tarte Beauty sponge feels like jelly on my face it's so soft it's softer than the actual Beauty Blender and it works a little bit better in my opinion which is a big thing to say because the Beauty Blender is like the best thing and then to lock it all in place I'm going to use this hello flawless benefit powder and never settle petal and they take my NARS is my nurse I think he's japonesque the japonesque work it into my face just set everything in place I just rhymed and way to cool I mean who rhymes out of nowhere me I do and then for the blush I'm going to take this City color cosmetics be matte blush I'm going to take this shade right here which is fresh melon I'm going to pop that onto my cheeks with this japonesque brush and it's a really nice matte natural flush of color I'm gonna bring it up around the temples kind of do a little bit of the draping technique to add a glow to my face without using bronzer and then for the lips I'm going to take this matte

that video oh my gosh if you haven't seen it has like millions and millions of views she looks so beautiful and just effortless and it was such a change from what she normally does she usually does live wing and the high pony or half pony this time it was like no wing just lashes straight sleek beautiful hair she looked glowing and gorgeous and just looked a little bit more mature than what she normally does but in a good way it looks so beautiful on her so I wanted to recreate it for you guys I also thought that this look would be great for prom if you guys are wanting an easy effortless elegant look for prom also don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you're notified as soon as the vo comes out and without further ado let's get into the tutorial and without further ado let's get into digital tutorial I'm using the makeup forever step one base hydrate mmm okay that's a lot of primer can pry my arms moving so I'm just gonna pry my face with this so that my foundation has something nice and smooth so on top of and my foundation is gonna is going to last longer I also think of primers as the barrier between my skin care and my makeup I like to use a really good primer I'm gonna go in with the hourglass vanish stick and nude that's my shade and I'm just going to cover my face up cover those blemishes up this is a very matte formula if you have dry skin I do you're going to want to put something on there that's kind of make it a little less drying what I'm going to do is use this cover FX custom infusion infusion drops this is the hydration drops and I'm going to put that on my TV this kind of stick foundation honestly would be a little bit easier to blend with a Sun type of brush like one of these brushes would be really great but this one's not clean so I don't want to use it you see there's hair on it so I'm not going to use it there's even glitter in there I don't know how that happened but I'm going to use my Beauty Blender and I'm putting some of the custom cover infusion drops on there just to make it less drying on the skin bouncing the Beauty Blender you guys I'm going to see ariana grande at the end of the month I'm so excited I've never seen her in concert or in person so I'm really excited about that or the eyeshadow I feel like it's more of a ma be look it the lighting is super dark so you can't really tell but I feel like it's a little mothy on her eyes I just got this palette in from dose of colors it's so pretty and it's called marvelous mobs and I thought that this would be so perfect for not only for prom but for the Ariana look and I'm going to go ahead and start off with this really pretty color right here this is the shade Rosie start to work that all over the crease and the outer portion of the eye like the outer crew outer lid I'm using circular motions I I forgot to do my eyebrows I go on and not do my eyebrows it's going to look weird to me give me just a second okay we are back with brows I feel like you guys are going to comment on my brows I always get a comment somebody commenting about my brows being and even you guys can I just tell you something I try my best but one side of my face is a little bit off it's like a little bit lower because I had Bell's palsy when I was younger and it paralyzed one side of my face so I was paralyzed for about a month and all of the muscles and everything were a little bit weaker on one side so one side is kind of lower than the other side so um just in case you guys are gonna comment on that I know my brows are a little different but not everybody is perfect okay and try to make your brows just in the same family okay they can be second cousins it's fine let's get back into the eyes and now I'm go a little bit deeper so I'm going to take these two shades this shade is called wishy-washy and this one is called spaced out mix them together and then just intensify the outer crease so I'm using a very light hand in circular motions right around the outer crease the harder you press the harsher it's going to look on your eye and it's going to be a little bit more difficult to blend it out so just try so you barely touch the skin and just buff the shadow in there now I'm going to deepen it up with the darkest shade in the palette which is a wine stain and start to work that on the outer part of the crease up here I'm keeping this the darkest shadow away from the upper part of the crease because I want it to look like a nice gradient so make sure that it sits right below the colors and then you you don't want a harsh line of course so you can go back with the same brush and just use a very light hand to blend it out but if you feel like you have too much shadow on your brush look at that use these little baby circular motions very soft circular motions and what I'm going to do is use a clean brush as the Smith 2:47 and I'm going to buff that buff that out with this clean brush so that there's no more product on there and it just makes a nice soft wash there is something in there there's something there that wasn't there before I think that's how it goes and then for the inner part of the crease I'm going to take fluffy which is this nice light baby pink color so I'm going to take that on a flat shader brush which looks something like this right here this is the zoeva 234 and then start to press that onto my lid then I go ahead and take this middle shade right here wishy-washy and I'm going to pop that onto the lower outer part of the lash line I am really loving this palette that eyeshadows are super easy to blend they're pigmented they're just beautiful I love it there's not crazy fallout so now I'm just going to add some mascara to my bottom lashes I'm going to use the triple threat mascara from pure I like it because it's very tiny I'm going to take cocoa bling from artist pitar and add it to the inner corners I'm going to take my Y 505 take any contour color you want and I'm going to take my Smith 220 brush and just snatch that nose and I'm going to bring it all the way up into this area right here take this cover FX custom and enhancer drops this is in candlelight top that on my cheeks and just anywhere that I want to highlight so it comes in this little dropper a little dot of it go ahead and take that on the ball on my nose right down the center Cupid's bow just keep piling it on take this highlight and contour palette from the balm it has literally everything if I'm traveling I will take this with me just because it has everything in the palette that I need I'm going to take these two shades right over here so I'm just going to take this and set my under eyes and also give it a little bit more coverage and brighten it up a little bit more I'm going to bronze up my face I'm gonna use this Smashbox Sun Tan and matte bronzer right here swirl it around in there tap off the excess and just work it on the outer perimeters of the face so now that our skin is nice and bronzy I'm gonna go ahead and add some blush and the blush that I'm using is actually a new one from the balm it's called Palm Springs so cute this is the in full-swing blush did you notice that Starbucks has those cute pastel blue and green cups I wanted one so bad but I was not feeling hot coffee I wanted iced coffee so I didn't get one what about these I feel like they need to be more festive with these cups okay so now I'm just going to work that on my cheeks I'm going to take the dose of colors gold is a new black highlight with my morphe M 510 and just layer that right on top of my cheeks like so and then the Cupid's bow the nose and right on the chin I'm also going to work down on the collarbone I don't know if you guys can see cuz I definitely cannot see but I'm going to work that on the collarbone as well okay for the lips I'm going to go with the Ofra lipliner and wine so I'm going to take oh wow that looks really pretty for the lipstick I'm going to take this liquid lipstick from Kylie it's the velvet liquid in charm actually took off a different lip color that didn't work so that's why my lips kind of look like this just gonna run that right over and that is it for the makeup this is actually how I had my hair for prom but also how ariana grande has a sleek straight hair it looks so pretty and glossy and just elegant and beautiful so I'm gonna do that for this video I'm actually going to use this really cool straightening tool it's this guy right here so this is the foxy Bay rose gold straightening brush and this heats up to 450 degrees it gets very hot but it doesn't burn these little guys right here because they're not like plasticy so I'm going to go ahead and take my hair down I have it heated up to 450 and I'm just going to take this piece right here and go down my hair just double click the power button to adjust the temperature okay that definitely works and it has that glossy shine to it so I'm going to go ahead and do the next section pull my hair out like this hold it against the the brush and just brush through the reason why it's so glossy like that is because it's made with tourmaline tourmaline tourmaline technology you don't have to put extra product in your hair so I'm going to weigh your hair down and it's brushing your hair at the same time which is awesome wow I am like really surprised I make very impressed honestly okay I'm going to finish doing the rest of my hair even if you're like getting ready for school in the morning or work and you just need to quickly get your hair into shape honestly just grab

pretty sure it's like up there like something but it's such a beautiful bottle it's beautiful it's okay okay believe us it just you believe us when we tell you it's theirs I mean it better be cute for that much money yeah yeah and those gold flecks better be doing something crazy with their skin to try this has you rave about it all the time hmm looks like you have a lot in here too how much do I need not a lot not a lot or goes a long way let me just use up all your product this feels expensive my skin is like briar baby skin right now yeah it does it feels so good smells absolutely delicious I feel like it does do the blurring my my head feels really smooth and I have really bad like texture my foreheads so so far we're like I'm gonna use the makeup forever this time this is the ultra HD classic classic classic I'm gonna use to face the Born This Way over here Z we're coming together but I think I'm gonna go with my Urban Decay brow beater great name oh this is freakin good that sauces is so good it's so affordable I just love it it lasts all day I'm actually surprised I need to try it cuz I've never tried it um no but my brow hairs are actually really really coarse so I can't really do much with them like you can create a whole new shape if you want it to because your brow hairs are so like yeah like fine and like soft mine are like pubic hair or something my brow oh yeah I'm gonna use that on the outer part of the brow you do that ombre effect I try the straight vowel thing clearly and I don't think it works on my face shape so now I'm trying to go back can't do it now because I like a win story and once you go straight you can't go back it's scary we'll use what I hold on I'm trying to finish this just focus week month I've ever done yeah now we're moving on to concealer I always use my concealer as primer too so I'm going to set my primer and you will need I recently did a video I literally just drop it today testing out Marc Jacobs a bunch of Mike Jacobs makeup so I recently tried their concealer and I actually really like it it's like creamy but full coverage it kinda reminds me of the Norton Arzo AHA mapper or a complete soft matte I'm gonna know I can't find the right shades for me in the NARS one this is not too pink not clean up my brows and stuff with that one denars yeah I could see that alright so I'm just gonna blend in this face how'd you get ahead of me okay this concealers everything here we go I don't know I did that just tapping off my concealer so I guess I'm using the remarkable concealer from Marc Jacobs full coverage very creamy here's something that's full coverage and it's creamy do that like skin like finish yes I'm like give me it right now I feel like I'm only using expensive products which is so weird for me traveling so basically everything I'm using in this video is like the items that I've been my go-to recently so I just threw my bag and I'm like okay I'll just go with that for my trip and then everything else is kind of like my OG products yeah so probably boring if you're watching me a lot because you know I use these like pretty consistently but it is what it is I'm using the Jaclyn hill palette that's a good one yes I'm kind of late to the party on this one for sure but it's an amazing palette so I'm gonna try and create a look with it Kylie Jacqueline so I'm gonna go into all the transition shades so that's this one right here we're just gonna go in there I'm gonna highlight my brow bone with one of these bad boys probably a little mixture both of them you know oh you're starting with the brow bone highlight different do you do that laughs what do you I do that laughs I like to do that first and then I kind of bring it down you're like I can't really blend it very well if I do a loss that's what's me oh that's it it's cool to see how somebody else does their makeup in the order that they do yeah yeah everyone does it so differently but we all have our things like I get so tripped out if I try and do it a different order like messes me are like this isn't right yeah I'm just gonna put that on the outer and inner corner of my eye and I'm gonna leave a space in the middle for one of these gorgeous freakin gorgeous shades right here from the G wait skinny-dip palette that palette is just so beautiful to look at to like it just blinds you by looking at it I'm gonna do a little halo like today I think I might go in and I think I might do a cut crease ooh am i over achieving right now let's see this let's see I'm gonna go in with this February I love it this one mm-hmm probably mix it with that I'm just like so it's not as bright yellow she did such a good job with this palette there's a really cute package it is really keep acting super cute and the colors just make you happy to look at like that baby blue just was like so pretty do I have a Canadian accent tell me a little bit know when you say certain words those are people tell me but they never tell me what those certain words are like I haven't said you out about yeah right there that's what it was about yes that's so neat what do you say about what you can actually I need some of the Jackson Hale Paula he's really dark brown down here it's got whatever you could bring in the drama it's got whatever you could possibly need okay I'm making some progress but it's very slow progress like very very slow take your time doing right I'm going in with like all the different brushes I'm using a little bit here yeah it's very exactly what I'm doing um yours is coming along nice so everything really pretty thank you I feel like if I do a hollow eye my the sunken in this of like my eyes like how deep said it is it just gets accentuated yeah so it looks literally like my eyes are two little circles like protruding out of my head so after my transition shade I went in with that orange II know I was the orange yeah I went on with that Warren G Brown shade then I was brown ended up mixing it with darker Brown but now I'm going in with like this Brown here to deepen it up and that's a color that's what we're here - all right I'm gonna go into these you a skinny dip palette where we're going in to skinny dip right there I just want to show you what it looks like on my finger oh I'm trying to think what color I should do unlike the lid lid the mobile lid the moving lid

because this stuff is absolutely amazing I love this stuff so much it's a fine mist that just goes over your skin it feels so refreshing next thing we're going to get into is foundation I'm going to be using the Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage foundation I'm going to take it back for a minute because I haven't used this in a long time I just forgot how good it is so I'm going to take that on with a Beauty Blender and this is probably definitely not that this is definitely not my shade anymore it's a little better I was actually blending in with the background at one point that was kind of scary by the way you guys I'm doing this video in partnership with itse so there we go this little sample size and all these other little sample sizes that you'll see are from the Ipsy glam bag and can I just mention that the glam bag this month is so so cute are those dreamsicles I love Dreamsicle so this is from City color cosmetics it's the bold brow eyebrow powder in medium it has a light shade in a dark shade so you can mix it together and get your perfect Wow match so I'm going to do this today I'm not going to do like pomade or anything I'm just going to go in with some brow powder I'm using the Turk shape tape what a surprise I'm actually mixing light sand together ooh that is bright mixing medium because I don't have the light medium right now since we're here what the heck might as well go down the nose little ball line just going to go ahead and bounce that sometimes I notice when I bounce really hard on my scanner it kind of separates or it doesn't like me the coverage that I want I have to use a very light gentle hand after a my myself be gentle so that it blends into the skin nice and it gives more coverage I'm going to go ahead and use this lemonade from benefit this is a color correcting eyelid primer I love yellows to call it correct or to hide like under-eye circles or anything like that because I just feel like oh but no baby no no no no no boba see hi boba ji she wants to eat the paper oh you need to cut your nails yeah I'm gonna go in with this ji way essential matter shimmer palette right here for the crease I'm going to take this shade right in the middle this is a matte taupe shade it's called desert so I'm gonna take that pop it on to the crease for some dimension and work it straight through the crease my eyelid is very bright and there is no dimension so kind of excited to put this on my eye right now bring my eye back to life I'm just going right around the lid kind of outlining where the lid is and then blending this little bag if you sure there's no harsh line very nice now I'm going to go in with this red shade it's called sepia the reddish orange and work it on the outer part of the crease so I'm just kind of like marking it out and I I want to create like a outer V so like that that'll be my little reference when we start there and just start to blend it out little circular motions you're using a soft touch and you're doing quick little short circles to blend the arounds make it really soft I'm gonna go ahead and work on this inner part of my lid for that I'm going to use the Pacifica island life I shadow palette and have these really pretty shimmery shades in it okay so this one is called skinny dip it's like the shimmery pink one I'm also going to use coral sand it's like an orange e pink and then golden which is the golden shade first I'm going to take this gold shade right here and I'm going to work it right on the lid I think it goes really pretty with that orange e rustic shade on the crease then I take this other brush from Smith it's the Smith 247 and just going between these two guys so they can blend together the eye shadow has like a creamy finish I like it a lot and it's really pigmented and then I'm going to go in with that this shimmery orange pink shade and I'm going to take the other side of the brush and work that super close to the inner corners a little bit closer down I want it to fade and from the orange e to the golden and that light pink shimmer in the inner corners and then I'm going to go in with the shimmering pink shade and pick that up for the lower lash line I'm gonna go in with this deep brown this matte deep brown shade this is dark chocolate whoo I like the Navy and I'm going to work that right on the outer part of the lid I mean lower lashline and then for the inner part of the lower lash line I'm going to take the orange shade but I'm gonna go right on the bottom right there that actually I'm going to take the gold no on the outer part of the the crease I'm going to take dark chocolate so I'm going to take this makeup shaft ii8 brush and I'm going to go in there like it needs a little bit more definition I'm layering Sapir right over dark chocolate and it's giving me a really nice dimension I like the color it's giving me so I'm just gonna keep doing that I'm also going to take some of that reddish shade I'm just going to pinch this brush right here it kind of has them on it I'm going to go right underneath the dark chocolate shade I just feel like it'll tie everything together a little bit better now I'm going to go in with a winged liner I'm going to be using this la girl line art matte eyeliner right here okay this eyeliner actually dries to like a grey I don't know why but I'm going over it with the pixi by petra endless silky eye pin in the shade black noir and gosh it's just going on like butter on my skin and it's so nice it's so black and it's fixing all little mistakes I never thought I'd do an eyeliner a wing liner with an eye pencil but is turning out pretty good that is the longest wing I've had in a really long time we're moving on now I'm actually going to add this other pixi by petra pencil it's in the shade opal overcoat and I'm going to put it right on the waterline I'm gonna take the Kim Thai lashes from cake face Beauty and such a cute box looks like a little present and these are the lashes they're very long and glam so I think they will fit perfectly with this look I'm just going to grab them cut the edges pop them on and I will be right back okay so now I'm going to move on to the rest of my face I'm going to go in with the urban decay and naked skin shapeshifter and I'm going to take these creams on this side first makes this contour shade right here and I'm going to chisel out my cheeks and use this Sigma angled cream contour brush right here grab that contour color and just start to work that on my cheeks I'm just going to cut them then I'm just going to blend it out with my little beauty blender I almost feel like this contour color is a little too ashy I mean I like a shadow effect but this one is almost a little muddy I'm gonna grab my Tarte clay stick and deep honey it's gonna give me more of like a bronzy look which I'm fine with and contour at the same time so now we're all contour I'm going to put some blush on just cream blush right here from geek Beauty it is called metalli matte naturally quick drying blush and a boo and it's like a peachy pink shade and it's a smooth matte cream with like a metallic sheen on it I'm gonna put that on my cheeks I like that it has like a matte finish to it and it dries like a powder so you can actually use this as a shadow too I'm going to set my under eyes menus this Kat Von D translucent powder and and then we're just gonna let it sit there for a little bit I'm gonna let that sit and bake and I'm actually gonna do my lips while I do that speaking of baking I'm going to use this caked makeup lip fondant in the shade low key and it has a heart as the oh I thought that was really cute it's just the small details in life this is like a dusty muted terracotta color this is also a vegan and cruelty free product which is cool okay so now that I'm done with my lips I'm just gonna dust off the powder ooh this is a soft brush this is from royal in lag and langnickel this is a precision angled brush and it's very soft the first thing that caught my eye it will definitely be good as like a little highlight on the nose so I'm going to use this highlight from Dixie glam bag it's for the urban decay afterglow 8 hour powder highlighter so this is in the shade sin I'm going to take this so use that to highlight my nose I like that it goes on sheer and it's pretty blendable so this is kind of good that it's this size not too small it's not too big so it just fits perfect thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it give it a thumbs up also I have some

link right here I just filmed a whole video on it just for the brows so go ahead and check that out if you're interested and let's get on with the rest of the face so I'm gonna start off with primer I'm gonna use this one here from Stila it's the one-step corrector gentle caressing and a brightening primer since we're doing more of a fresh face kind of look you want to make sure that your skin looks so good bomb perfect so I'm going to mix I'm gonna take this primer to help with all of those issues on my face i exfoliated my skin moisturised so our foundation is going to sit on our face really nice and smooth we just gotta be careful around the brow area and because this primer has the purple the green and that orange undertone it's gonna help cancel out any red spots any dull areas on your face and it's also going to help with those dark areas under your eyes actually gonna go in a little bit further with this right underneath the eye area I haven't used a steal a primer in a long time it's nice to go back to something that I really used to love so that helped to brighten up my eyes so much we are back to life now I'm going to fill in any large pores so we can look like the pretty filter this one is from cover effects it's called the blurring primer it's out like this and it's pretty thick so I like to just Pat it in to those areas where I feel like my pores are just wide open I'm just gonna put it in right here I just also want to let you guys know that this is mattifying so if you have any oily spots on your face or if you're oily in the t-zone this is gonna help you out with that and for some reason I have been getting oily today I'm gonna be using a new foundation so excited to try it this is the Laura Mercier flawless fusion foundation and it's supposed to be medium to full coverage which is great for me I want my skin to look good since I don't have a lot of makeup on my eyes to distract from zits pimples redness so I'm gonna take this one I this is in golden I also have dune so I'm gonna go in between the both of them I feel like I'm right in the middle and start to work that on my face and if it's a little too golden actually I think I can work this into the rest of my body to have a fake tan going on and I think it's gonna work out for us I'm just gonna Pat this in so I can get nice full coverage while this foundation feels very light on the skin and it covers a lot of redness ooh I like a light I'm gonna let that sit for a few seconds and then go in with a second layer because I want a flawless flawless no blemishes at all kind of skin today it doesn't feel like a heavy foundation but it does have a lot of pigment in it so it really covers a lot without feeling like it's super thick and heavy this is a really good foundation it's a new one for me so I'm excited about it it's you know what it's almost as good as the Estee Lauder Double Wear without it feeling drying this is not drying something is in this foundation I'm gonna go in with concealer right now just because I want to I want to look at these panda eyes anymore you're gonna go in with the Tarte shape tape and medium buy a little inner corner triangle you know what I'm not gonna even do the highlight thing I think it's gonna look a little too much but I am gonna go in with my new micro B blender I really love these for the under eyes I'm gonna go ahead and top that in out to the tops of the cheekbones I'm gonna get this whole triangle right here it's gonna lift your eye make it look brighter and then after it's set into the skin then I take this side just go along the edges to make sure we don't have any harsh edges anywhere so what I have left on the beauty blender i go ahead and i Pat onto the eyelid just so that we can use this as a base for our eyes shadow we aren't doing much with eye shadow but we are going to accentuate our natural eye shape and really enhance the shape of our eyes so I do want some type of tackiness there and I do want it to look nice and even I want to even base before I go in with any with any color cuz if I just go in its gonna look patchy and uneven I'm gonna go in with this Tarte setting powder it's called filtered light and a Beauty Blender which is kind of damp but he's okay and then I'm going to look up and work that underneath my eyes so I don't have any creasing even though this smells good it smells like a vanilla cake this feels really tight all of the sudden try it right below for my eyes I'm gonna be using the one the only Sokol Concilio violet Voss palette I've been using it everyday first of all can we talk about the amount of different shades of orange and burnt Browns there are in here this is a definite everyday kind of palette I love it Nicole this is amazing I'm gonna go in with and the names are so freakin cute I'm going to set my entire lid with and easy and for that I'm gonna take my time 2:05 brush these brushes are so gorgeous they match with my background I kind of want to put them back there I'm very tempted I'm gonna work that all over my eyelid so we can set all those creams in place very nice pigmentation its glides all over the lid just smooth like butter loving that I'm gonna go in with hangry which is me all the time and I'm gonna work that all in my crease this is very warm I want to tone it down a little bit use a fluffier brush for this area so I'm going to take this brush biloxi 2:29 and I go into hangry and boop bop and I just want to wash that all over the crease I want it to be really nice and soft so you don't want to get too much product on there and these are pretty pigmented oh I'm going back and forth like this and once your wiper motions on the areas where you feel like it's a little harsh all you have to do is lift your brush up as light as you can barely put any pressure onto your skin and just go back and forth in these circular motions and it will erase that harsh line everything will transition super super nice into one another so you just got to use a very light hand when you do this moving literally a wash of color I'm getting this huge fluffy brush from dose of colors this is called a blending it's just called blending I'm gonna go over the entire thing with this with a very light hand and just go back and forth deepen up the crease a little bit further chocolate chopped I can't I can't do a New York accent Nicole with chocolate I'm gonna use this tiny little brushes from morphe it's the M 507 work a tiny amount right in here you can already see like the natural shadow right there so add a little bit of extra definition to that area on the outer portion like I tried just because you have a fresh face doesn't mean that you can't put eyeshadow on and you still can enhance the natural contour of your eye and make that look really really beautiful like you are and then at the same time I'm going back in with my bigger blending brush just so we can soften everything out but we still want to make sure we can see that definition out there we just don't need it to be like a harsh line that is Boba's cat here I have it in my nose actually and then for the lid I'm gonna go in with bra for the brow bone I'm Zozo right here look at that butter so pretty I'm gonna use that on the brow bone kinda spread it out with my finger so that it isn't overwhelming when I turn my head you'll see that nice pop of highlight I'm gonna take chocolate work that on the outer part of the lash line just to give it a little bit of a lift and then I'm gonna lift up the brush and just softly work that I shadow out towards the brow go in with Henry and boop-boop again and work that on the outer part of the lower lash line this is the dose of color shader brush and it just works so perfect underneath the lash line with that same brush take a tiny bit on the lower lash line just add a tiny definition right at the outer edge the new mascara from the balm is called scuba it's water-resistant works really good for this summer time when you go work out and you want a little bit of something on your lashes take her swimming on the first date obviously you guys you don't have to do this step if you don't feel comfortable on a fresh face kind of day this is my take on a fresh face makeup look I like to put lashes on I think it makes a world of a difference on your face brings your whole look together and makes me feel really girly and pretty so I love wearing lashes with anything that I do so you definitely can skip this but definitely get yourself some early lashes the lux ones are really nice alright so we're done with the lashes and now I'm going to move on to the rest of the face for the contour I'm going to use the new pur cosmetics contour Diaries such cute packaging the marble loving it the rose gold it's so pretty go into passion and I'm gonna work that into the hollow areas of my face so we can load snatch like an alien the more morphe m57 to and I'm just gonna work that into the hollow of my cheek bone and stop right about here just so can look very natural and then I'm gonna work the product I'm going to use this to bronze my face but I don't have anything on it so I'm just gonna work it on the cheekbone well I can blend the contour into the skin so it looks nice and soft and then I'm gonna just go right on the end of the nose just to make it look more rounded and that's the only places I'm really gonna contour now I'm just gonna bronze my face for that I'm using the LC light all over just taking that on my temples so now I'm just gonna brighten so for that I'm gonna take a charm and dream this yellow color oh I love yellow powders I think they work so well with medium skin tones and they just brighten up make you look gorgeous so I'm gonna go right under the eyes up that in doing this kind of helps narrow the nose out as well so kind of pushes it together now that my face is nice and bright I'm gonna put some fix+ on just so I can melt all the powders together into the skin and make it like skin again just so that we don't have any cakey areas on our face to bring more of that fresh blush of color to your face I'm going to take blisful from Tarte we're gonna load it up and we're gonna Pat it on to the skin instead of sweeping it back and forth because then you're gonna get way too much on your skin and it's hard to go back so a little bit at a time is the secret to get a really nice makeup so now it's time to highlight the face I'm gonna take the cover of fact celestial dropped so you can actually work it on to a powder and it won't get weird so I'm just gonna put that right up here and right on my highlight mustache and maybe some of my real mustache and you can actually stop there but if you really love that intense glow then I would keep going take the Kylie a face duo and skinny dip wrap this shade right here glow up [Music] so now that we're glowing to the gods I'm going to go ahead and pop on a lippy which is very very simple take this Marc Jacobs lipgloss in pretty thing and I love the applicator on this thing because it picks up color from both sides so you can easily apply it to your lip and

try because it's so girly it's so pink and glittery it's like if I was going back to school I would want to use that palette everything else is gonna be drugstores whoo affordable so I am going to show you how to get this look if you want to learn how to get it subscribe to my channel hit that notification bow so you can be a part of the club family and without further ado we're gonna get onto the video saying that I'm gonna do to my face if throw on some primer because I don't want my face slipping off by the end of the day so I'm gonna put this NYX angel veil primer this is great if you have oily skin because this is oil free and it's just gonna modify your entire face this stuff kind of makes you feel like you're putting on like if baby powder was in cream form this is what it would feel like I'm gonna put on my foundation first and then I'm gonna do my brows so the foundation that I'm using today I'm trying to use as much drugstore and affordable products as possible I'm gonna be using the covergirl vitalist healthy elixir I'm using the shade medium beige today this is the first time that I'm using a covergirl foundation in either ever or in years I I can't cuz I don't use a lot of covergirl so I don't really know but I definitely use covergirl before in the past but not a foundation so let's see what this is gonna look like it's supposed to be like a medium full coverage and let's just see how this works out for us my face is lighter than my body because I do tan and I exfoliate my face pretty often so that's why it's a totally different color but we're gonna work it down into our neck and see how this goes you definitely want to test out anything new the day before school or a week before school just in case just so you know you like it so the first day of school you walk in you're not like you don't have any surprises this is my first time using it and you guys can see if you want to use it depending on how I like it or how it looks on my face so this seems to blend into my skin pretty good I was a little skeptical at first it's like a pinkish undertone but I really don't mind it it's blending into my skin pretty well and if you happen to get the wrong shade and you're like I don't have any other foundation just blend it all the way down into the into the inside of your shirt and you'll be good don't ever you know ever put it on your hand and try to act like it's your skintone because then that might be look really messy and just really weird just but let it definitely blend it down into your shirts so that you can't see any line of demarcation on your face I'm actually not gonna use a drugstore for the brows this is the Anastasia brow Wiz in soft brown I feel like a pencil is easier in the morning when you're about to go to school you don't wanna sit there and do like the pomade and everything so I'm gonna go ahead and fill that in I have some sparse areas where it here [Music] and now we are going to conceal the eye area so we can look like we woke up this morning I just got these in from colour-pop these are the new no filter concealers and they have so many freaking shapes to choose from but this one was the yellowest looking one you like my description this is the light 20 and just work it down on my under-eye [Music] I'm gonna work this onto my lid and kind of Pat it in there so this could be the base for the eyeshadow I'm super ecstatic about this eyeshadow palette that I'm about to use this is the Kylie birthday Collection the I wanted all palettes so so what I'm gonna do first of course is use buttercream frosting because this one is the most neutral skin tone kind of shade so I'm going to use that as you guys know pop it all over the lid just to make sure everything is set in place this I love how this eye shadow barely has any fallout at all if you don't have this palette that's fine you can just choose colors that are similar I'm sure you can find them I mean there's just pink mobs and bronzy colors okay so the next color I'm going to use is Forever Young and I'm gonna whip that all over the lid up into the crease it's just a really pretty pink color blend the ends of this shadow out the next color I'm going to take is party time right here the Mabi shade so now we have like a really nice pink pretty bass so after that I'm just gonna layer on 1942 or this pink shade is gonna peek through all of these shades we're going on the lid patting it onto the lid and then we're working it up into the crease this is gonna look like your eyes you just have this glowing effect it's so pretty the inner corners I'm gonna take birthday girl so I'm gonna go on with this to my lashline we see it's like it's not super intense but it is adding some definition to that lash line so we can put on some lashes my new favorite mascara from the drugstore is from laurie alice is the voluminous lash and it just works miracles for your lashes I'm gonna start at the base wiggle and wiggle to the top if you have really tiny lashes and your parents won't let you wear lashes yet like false lashes or just don't have time for false lashes brush your lashes in the opposite direction and down and then up and then BAM your lashes are gonna look fuller than they have ever looked in your life especially with this mascara open your mouth like Miranda sings so you can get into those bottom lashes without touching the skin that is that is the goal don't touch the skin and you can stop there but I'm going to put on some false lashes that are very natural-looking from Lily lashes these are opulence these are the opulence okay there we go these are the lashes they're super natural you can see very wispy long and flirty these are the opulence lashes from a Lulu lashes they're just so pretty I'm going to put these on my lash line and I will be right okay we are done with the eyes I'm gonna move on to set everything in place I'm gonna use the pure cosmetics contour diaries that I break it so what I'm going to use is this yellow powder right here to set everything underneath the eyes what is that gray thing [Music] take that shade and just contour the cheeks you can actually use this to bronze I feel like depending on your skin tone so I'm gonna take my morphe m57 to brush and I'm gonna contour my nose [Music] if you feel like your nose a little too pointy you can always go down here to round it out with a contour color that's like a natural shadow underneath your nose so it'll give you the illusion of a rounded nose or that your nose just stops and your nose is a little bit shorter than what it was before I love contouring I could do this all day use the hoola bronzer just so it looks like we stepped outside this summer and we weren't inside online all day to have fun in the Sun so I'm gonna take that with the Kylie brush right here pop that on my cheeks the last step on the face we're gonna do is the highlight it's like if the one in the palate a little bit too glittery and especially for school I found a gem in the drugstore this is from Maybelline this is the new chrome master chrome metallic highlighter it is literally butter highlight on your face I'm just gonna put it on with my finger so I'm put a little bit on my nose keep its bow tie and right on the high points of my cheekbones somebody is the 20 lip liner and matte liquid lipstick so first time I put on the liner blot my lips once just so it's not super intense looking at this look I want to add a liner I know I said I wasn't and you don't have to but I'm gonna add a liner I feel like it needs it so I'm gonna take this brown liner in Mad Max Brown from Kat Von D I feel like the liner just really brought this look together so I'm actually really happy that I put the liner on if you don't want you you don't have to thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did thumbs it up and good luck to all of you guys who are out for your entering in

[Music] they started Jim Belson give you a book oh my goodness hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be doing this 5 minute makeup right here on my face right now it's so easy so quick and it's very fall all the warm tones all my face are just giving me fall vibe I want to learn how to get this look on my face in under five minutes oh this video is probably gonna be way longer than five minutes that's because I talk through it I explain different things I were to cut out all the talking and just did my makeup like I do an Instagram it would be five minutes trust me it's not hard it's very easy and you can always take steps out customize the way you want so it can work for you my five minute is always gonna be your 5 minute so you can always work whatever you want in and out of your routine I'm just here to give you in spoke I know you guys are gonna love this look it's super easy and quick and before we get into the tutorial don't forget to subscribe to my channel and he founded Education Bell so you can be a part of the quad family and ignore my freakishly tan it without further ado let's get into you guys make my brows but I'm like no cuz then I have to work around the foundation I just want to slap it around wherever out one I'm gonna take this Milani prime shield face primer it's a mattifying pore minimizing primer and I'm gonna mix it looks like so and I'm gonna mix it with the new Maybelline x2 Gigi Hadid tinted primer in light/medium so thin it's just it's super dark by the way whenever you work it into your face it still looks dark alone and so mixing this primer in because as you can tell I don't know if you can see but I can't yesterday as you can tell there's a great job of that my whole body is a lot darker than my face I'm just trying to make it one even thing can we talk about Gigi Hadid 's packaging for her Maybelline collab it is so beautiful it's a really pretty pink and then she has the holographic letters it was just really beautifully packaged now we are ready for the datian if I'm taking five minutes out of my day I think I can definitely work in foundation usually I'll do a stick because it's a little bit quicker but I've done that before and there isn't any new sticks that are out so I chose this instead I'm taking the cookie cosmetics this is the first time I'm using their foundation it's the HD foundation in the shade for tw they also sent me 45 see which is cool tone this is more of the warm tone I'm gonna mix them together I don't think this is gonna be dark enough for my neck also the brushes that I'm using today are gonna be very affordable brushes so I wanted to choose something that you guys can pick up at the drugstore or that you can get online for like four or five dollars I'm gonna be using all of the LA girl brushes right here very affordable brushes again they're like four to five dollars some of them eight dollars depending on what you get and then these are the maybelline ones that came with the gigi hadid collab and then for my foundation today I'm going to be using the Real Techniques foundation brush work that into my face I hope that it covers up some things cuz that's some some unwanted friends on my face this is a nice brush no this is think I'm gonna need a little bit more of that dark color if I'm doing five minutes obviously this is this videos gonna be longer than five minutes cuz I always like kind of talk through my videos and explain the things as I go so that's why this video is longer than five minutes but this makeup can definitely take you five minutes I'm gonna add more of the darker shade I think this will work better okay just to let you guys know something very honest and real right now both of these foundation colors I think are a little off for me they're not covering up very much so I'm not a big fan of the foundation and definitely a tip if you're going for only 5 minutes stick with a foundation that you're used to don't try anything new because then if you only have 5 minutes you're gonna be a mess I just got a lot going on my face and it's not covering it up so I'm gonna move on to a different foundation I think I'm gonna take the Milani foundation so I'm gonna take this off and then we'll be right back so now I'm gonna take a concealer and just go right underneath my this is from Patrice and it's in the shade light beige I'm gonna just work that in with my finger I'm gonna take this yellow Gore on the nose this is from essence it's a color correcting stick I want to use this to lighten the dark spots on my face like around my mouth when you're in a hurry your finger is your best friend I'm gonna go ahead and get started on my brows just so I can look like human again I'm gonna be using the cokie high brow angled eyebrow pencil in the shade deep net these kind of pencils usually can do so many different things at once they can fill in and they can create little tiny sharp lines because of the cool unique shape this is one of those brushes that are perfect to grab when you're on the go so I'm just gonna fill in really quick this color is so perfect for almost any brown haired girl brows are done so what I'm gonna do is take these two shades right here this peachy one and mix it with this one right here and I'm just gonna pop them on my eyelid if I only have five minutes I don't want to like do a whole bunch of steps with my eyes if anything at all so this is one super simple way to do that then I want to work this color up into the crease so that gives us that contour gives our lid some color and then just take a blending brush and just blend out the edges really quick like so I'm gonna do the other side you see how it kind of just live-ins it up a little bit I like this shade right here for like an everyday kind of eye these shadows are so soft and feel so smooth and beautiful on the skin and blend out like a dream so I'm very very happy with this palette right here Maybelline usually has a really nice little palette I just don't like when it's all shimmer then I feel like I can't really do much pinks give you this flushed kind of youthful lively kind of look so I like using those if I'm doing something on the go I'm also going to take it right underneath the lash line this brush right here from the and I'm just gonna work that down right below my lash line now what I'm gonna do is take this gel eyeliner in nude this is part of the collection and I'm gonna work that on the waterline just so my eyes can look awake gangster eyes look a little bit more healthy especially if you have redness or irritated eyes or sleepy looking eyes it's gonna make you look a little bit more awake so I'm gonna take this really pretty champagne color in the palette right here take that on line the inner corners of my eye with this la girl brush in 206 mmm it looks champagne E and the palate but when you put it on it looks like a really cool toned gold very very pretty and then I'm gonna take the darkest brown in the palette and I'm gonna use that as a liner on my upper lash line because la girl brush of course and 208 I feel like it's easy to do wings with powders grab your brush look it out you can be kind of messy with it because it is a powder and you can move it around then you can blend it out so it's not something that's gonna be really harsh on your eye she's gonna give you that light little lift and you don't have to bring it all the way in you just make the thickest line on the outer edge and then just leave it and again if you feel like this is not a 5-minute step for you you can definitely skip it because this isn't for everyone I have other tutorials where they're super super basic the most minimum 5 minute makeup this isn't one of those that I do have those types of videos if you guys want to check them out coming in a little bit and connecting the two and then for the mascara I'm gonna use the Maybelline lash sensational doody Hadid we're pretty much done wishing to contour a little bit and add some color to our face I'm gonna take the pixie X Maryam a kiosk contour palettes this is such a good palette it's amazing for highlighting and bronzing and actually I like this for contouring on myself personally I'm going to take this la girl 106 brush and I'm gonna take both of these shades right here in the palette just come toward these cheeks okay that was a lot that was a lot but even if you do this you can blend it out this is real life right here this happens we we do this you know you're just gonna have really contour cheeks so the thing what you want to do is blend upwards blend everything up and just keep blending up oh this one is so easy into the skin I'm also gonna take it around my temples like here such a beautiful color to bronze love how it is blends into the skin take the cookie cosmetics contour palette and I'm just gonna do a yellow powder and it go right on top of my under eyes just set that in place just this bigger brush and this blend is a whole face in okay once I've contoured in bronze I'm gonna take a little bit more bronzer because I like bronzer so I'm gonna take the essence Sun Club bronzer in lighter skin the NYX blush brush and just work that on my cheeks looks like we've got some oh this smells really good and I take this lip right here this is aaron from the maybelline x gigi hadid collection this is a really pretty color I love how this makeup look it looks I think I'm gonna add a little bit of blush this is the essence blush in satin coral and then I'm just gonna put it right above right here to tie everything together once you're done with that I would curl my lashes in the car if you have time in chrome now but I'm gonna take this and make it last setting spray it's a 16 hour setting spray from Milani let's make this makeup lasts all day thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did you know what to do give it a thumbs up and if you're not ready

okay I'm ready hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be doing this super glam smokey I haven't done it looked like this in a while something very dramatic and dark I have not felt this glam in a very long time I haven't had this glam rock eye in a while and I'm loving it if I'm having a girls night out or for going clubbing which I never do let me just not lie to you guys right now but if I were to go clubbing I definitely wear this and look it just makes the eyes really stand out no matter what I color you have have you put these smoky dark shades around your eye your eyes gonna stand out you know what makes it look even better I had that spotlight right on the lid and I'm using this cream shadow from Revlon it's the Revlon Colorstay cream shadow it is very intense it's a super pigmented it's like BAM I love it I am obsessed with this look if you guys want to learn how to get it then keep watching so I've already prepped and primed my skin I'm going to go ahead and go into some foundation and start to even out my skin tone and I'm going to be using my fingers today to apply the foundation just to it I feel like it warms the product up really good and it melts into your skin really nice so I like using my fingers from time to time so now I'm going to cover up my panda eyes I'm gonna take some concealer and just make a little V underneath my eyes to give your eyes that lifted effect then I like to take it all the way to the tops of the cheekbone so it acts as a highlight as well while we're at it I'm just going to go ahead and highlight since we're already pretty much doing the job so in the middle of forehead the bridge of the nose the Cupid's bow and right on the chin and we're just going to dab dab dab so now I'm going to fill in my brows I'm going to take the Revlon Colorstay brow pencil in dark brown and I like this pencil because it has a little slanted edge so you get that precise definition and I'm going to go ahead and start to work this on to the lower part of my brow just to get the shape that I want it's easy to get those hair like strokes if you just flip the pencil on its side right here on the edge and it gives you sharp little hairs and then it's flat at the tip so you can just fill in your brows super easy so you get a little bit more space so I'm just filling in the sparse areas and this pencil is long wearing and waterproof so it lasts up to 24 hours and I'm just brushing up the hairs in place it also softens up the harsh lines in case you have any but this brow pencil is so good so now we're going to get into the eye shadow I'm going to take this color stay cream eyeshadow in blackcurrant and this is really cool it's a cream shadow it has a built in brush right here so you can use the brush to get precise application and it's also it's not gonna you know you're not going to get it everywhere so it's mess-free I'm going to use it in the cream shadow and then rush it onto my eyelid this is waterproof and it lasts up to 24 hours so it's going to give you a long wear - and I'm just going to put that all over my lid kind of bring it into the inner corners so I'm going to pick up this shade right here and start to work that in to my crease I'm just going to add up to the crease I'm using windshield wiper motions darkest part of the eye shadow is going to be the outer corner of the lid and then if you want to use less pressure just take your hand and pull it up to the top and it releases some of the pressures so that it looks a little bit more blended and soft I'm going to add a little bit more to the inner part of the eye and I'm going to bring it around so it creates a halo effect and I'm going to go back into the the color stayed cream shadow and I'm going to pop it in I'm just going to pop a little bit more on to the center and when you put anything on the center of your lid it's going to really make your eyes stand out because it's like it's like a highlight to your eyes and I'm only using this one eye shadow you don't really need a bunch of eyeshadows if you use the right amount of pressure on your brush you can really get the effect of two eyeshadows we're just using a little bit more pressure around the inner and outer part of the lid and then when we get up to the crease area we're barely just lightly blending the shadow I'm also going to take the same color and work it onto the lower part of the lash line and whenever I have a heavy eye shadow look on my lid I also like to just apply it on the lower lash line so it balances the eye look out and just ties everything together now I'm going to take the revlon colorstay two-in-one angled Kajal and this is in the shade onyx I'm gonna go ahead and start to apply this to my lash line on the upper lash line it also has an angled tip to it so you can easily get those precise lines and I'm just going to smudge it into my lashline and I like the way it's shaped because it has this one and that's kind of squared off and it fits in there super easy and then if you want to make longer lines and it has this longer side right here it glides on so easy and super dark it's very black so now that we're all smoked out I'm going to apply some mascara but first I'm going to curl my lashes so I'm going to go ahead and give them a few pumps and sometimes when I curl my lashes I can see the skin underneath which I don't like so I'm going to go back into the two-in-one angled Kajal and just line the upper waterline so it's dark and it doesn't look like there's skin peeking through now I'm just going to do a few coats of mascara okay so now I'm going to add highlight to my cheekbones the tip of my nose if it's bow and right here just blend in with my finger use a cream highlight it gives you more of a natural looking glowing from within kind of look so I like to bring out my creams from time to time I'm gonna use this translucent powder right here it's not going to give me any more color it's not going to give me coverage is just going to set everything in place so you don't have to worry about it taking away from the work that you've already done and now for the lips I'm going to use something that's nude because the eyes are pretty dramatic so I'm going to take this lip liner right here this nudie lip liner and I'm going to go over my lips start at the Cupid's bow and then just move down the end of my lip it goes really thin so I like to bring it a little bit over the lip line this is great for whenever you're over lining your lips it makes it look a lot more natural and then over top I'm going to use a matte lip color another so now I'm going to go into this nudie peach blush I think it's going to work well with the lip color and his title will look together and I'm keeping it behind the cheekbone so it gives the face more of a natural flush of color and you want to keep your eyes the main focus so you don't want to go too heavy on the blush or the lip you want to use something that's very neutral right around the temples and this is kind of a little bit of the draping technique we're not using it all over our face but if you just pull it up around your temples it gives your face a little bit more structure and you actually don't need a bronzer to do this if you have just like a peach blush it'll give you the same effect it's a little bit more of a subtle effect very natural thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed the video if you liked it thumbs it up if you didn't like it thumbs it up anyways comment below what you guys want to see next and if you missed my last two videos they're gonna be below my box you guys to check out also at the end of the subscribe hit that subscribe button up there so you can stay updated with my videos and you don't lose me in this huge YouTube makeup tornado I'll get lost also if you haven't hit your notification belt hit your notification bellow so you can be a part of mine of notification squad yeah stay updated with my videos I love you guys thank you for watching until the next video bye dollies 
guys welcome back to my channel my channel there's Eve makeup today a little hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'm going to be showing you how to get this glittery glam Year's Eve makeup look my last video of the year I am so excited to be bringing you this look I wanted to deduce I wanted to do something that I would actually wear on New Year's Eve just like a subtle pop of glitter metallic something that is very wearable for anyone and I would actually wear this so I wanted to create something like that that's very easy to do for you guys you don't have to sit there and pop on a bunch of different colors keep it neutral keep it glam and glittery I hope you guys enjoy this video if you want to learn how to get it then keep watching is it rolling okay so I'm so excited to do this video it is like the last video of the year and so the products that I'm going to be using in this video are going to be the ones that are my ride-or-die go to products because I trust them when you go out for New Year's or you have a big occasion you want to use makeup that you trust and you know is going to work on your skin and how it's going to feel and how it's going to laugh so I primed my skin with the base hydrate from Make Up For Ever and that is just because my skin is a little bit dry for the foundation my go-to foundation for this year was the Estee Lauder Double Wear this is a full coverage foundation and I know that it's going to last all night the only difference with this foundation I'm going to put some on my hand I just wish it had a pump because it just look what it does you know that's the only thing but it wears well it I mean it covers really good but the only thing I'm going to do different with this is put in some custom and future infusion drops from cover effect this is the radiance drops this foundation like it gives you a little bit of a dry thick consistency sometimes so what I'm doing is putting in a few drops so that it makes it a little bit more moisturizing and it just goes on a little bit better and smoother so I'm going to go ahead and work that in with my tart beauty sponge like how it just makes my skin look really even and it also covers really well under the eyes I start off with a nice thin layer because I'm gonna put on all of my eye makeup brows everything and then I'm gonna go back to my face I usually let that kind of sit in and dry before I start on the rest of my face for my brows today my hair is such a different color so I'm gonna go in with ebony I used to use evany back in 2013 and so this is crazy to come back to this guy right here just going to create a line right underneath them to kind of get the shape that I want and then I'll start to fill them in in the sparse areas I'm going to start here at the front and with a soft hand feather out that brow and I'm trying something a little different with my brows instead of making them go to a sharp point at the end and kind of building them up this just making them a little bit wider at the end just building up where I need to right in there it'll just look like natural full brows and if you want to really figure out where your point is it should go right diagonal across your eye and that's where your point should be and then it should start right there at the beginning of your eye diagonal and then it should stop here to clean up the brow hair as I go I'm using the benefit Boeing industrial-strength concealer this is what you'll be using to clean them up and I'm using this morphe m-43 to brush like how clean the concealer makes your your makeup look it really enhances the shape of the brow it also makes it look really clean gives you that celebrity makeup artist kind of makeup look so I'm going to go ahead and Pat in the rest of the concealer use the lemonade primer from benefit on my eyelids and it's just this yellow primer I feel like it color corrects really nice six year I shot it last a whole lot longer so now I'm going to get into the eye shadow I'm going to take this color pop eyeshadow and get lucky so this one right here as you can see I've really dug my finger into it pretty hard so I'm going to go ahead and take my finger because I feel like using your finger with the color pop shadows it's the best way to apply them when you use a brush just let them go on as nicely or at all but I'm going to go ahead and Pat my feet on there because my claws are super long I'm not going to be able to get in there so what I'm going to do is take this brush right here this is the Sigma duo fiber blend and I'm just going to make sure to get this guy in the inner corner just to work it over and there we go and then I'm going to go ahead and go over top with this other color pop shadow in cheap date it has some glittery specks in it I'm going to take a little bit of that and just pop it onto the center basically the same color but with some glitter chunks in it and then for the crease I'm going to be using a transition right here and just go right around the lid I'm going to darken it up a little bit more so I'm going to take a different brush taking this pencil brush right here from Tarte pop into teddy bear and I'm just going to work that into the outer socket and then I'm going to take my luck ZBrush again with that other transition shade on it literally that's the name of the eyeshadow and I'm going to go ahead and work that just blend that in so that they merge together so now I'm going to go on to the eyeliner I'm going to take my hat Von D liner about this baby one because it came like a sample sized one it came with the Too Faced Kat Von D collab collections I always go back to this one because it's so good it glides on so nice and just smooth I'm going to take this gold glitter from Urban Decay this is the heavy metal glitter in Midnight Cowboy I'm going to take that I'm going to run it right across the top of my eyeliner then I'm going to put a little bit in this inner corner like a little dot a heavier right in there not gonna lie it kind of burns my eyelids a little bit so you wear that kind of birds and now I'm going to go ahead and put some mascara on my favorite mascaras and I've said before mascara is just a mascara but actually no it's not realized that there are really good Oscars that make a difference on your lashes on the length and the width and everything this one from math girl it is so good I mean this is this calll it's called upward lash upward black is the color this is going to make your lashes look so freakin long if you have trouble with your eyelashes standing up this one is really good the brush grabs your lash and the formula keeps it so I'm taking this transition shade right here that we used on our crease I'm using it on the lash line as well this is a morphe y22 brush and I'm just working it right on the lower lash line like so I'm going to go back in with teddy bear and start to darken up the bottom lash line and then for that brow the brow bone highlight I'm going to take thanks a lot a this shade right here and to use my Joseph's colors flat definer brush to use that on my brow bone and just words that on there like that press it down into the other shades so that the transition is really nice and everything looks smooth and then for the waterline I'm going to take the UH Nastasia luster liner I'm gonna pop that onto the waterline right now I just want subtle metallic and pops of glitter here and there I'm going to take this silver glitter it's the urban decay heavy metal glitter and glam rock and I'm going to take that on the lower inner corner just in case you're indecisive and can't decide which one to use just use both of them I mean why not okay so time for the lashes I'm going to be using the House of lashes in iconic so they're so glam and so pretty these are my go to the lam lashes let them dry for a little bit I'm using the Tarte TARDIS Pro glue I hate when it sticks in your eye and then your blinking and every time I blames it like scratches your eye a little bit it's the worst so I always cut off the ends my ultimate favorite lash glue though for this year was the lash duo adhesive that comes in this little tube it comes in a tube like this it's white the best and it doesn't stick to your eyes afterwards doesn't leave that nasty residue it's a good one so I'm going to let that dry and while that's drying I'm just gonna put on a little bit more foundation put on some concealer I'm going to go ahead and take this foundation just whatever is on the end of the bottle and then I'm gonna put it on the face the foundation dries the color slightly changes you can tell it's a little bit darker now when I put it on it first looks a little lighter so just let it dry for a little bit while you do your while you do your um shadow I'm gonna put some and concealer on for contour I'm going to be using the Anastasia evany stick foundation actually this is not a contour color to stick foundation but I like the color for contouring the closer you make your lines on the con on your nose the smaller your nose is going to look so I want it to look a little bit more pinched right on the tip so I kind of curve it inwards instead of making that straight line down my nose it just flows a little bit nicer so now I'm going to seal everything in place I'm going to use my hello flawless benefit powder soap this is a powder foundation rest that into my skin make sure nothing moves around trust me this makeup is not going to move around if you are doing every step that I'm doing in this video your makeups gonna last until the next morning until the next afternoon so I'm going to go ahead and bronze up my skin I've been loving this it cosmetics sunshine in a compact it's a matte bronzer and I like how huge it is it gives you a lot of products and I'm going to be using my Kat Von D brushes like a dual ended brush I'm gonna use this dye and just start to work that into my cheekbone and circular motions really focusing on the hairline area and then for the blush I'm going to take this really pretty peachy blush from ex1 it's called a pretty in peach it's this one right here and when it comes to color on the cheeks I would like to keep it behind the cheekbone makes it look a little bit more natural and just gives you a really nice glow for my highlight I'm going to take artist Couture's Coco bling I'm just going to take what's in this top I'm not it almost one of these brushes also going to get the tip of my nose and my Cupid's bow and now I'm going to go ahead and do my lips I'm going to take this makeup forever lipliner in number 12 and overlined my lips of course and for the lip I'm going to use this city color matte lipstick and Chloe it's a really pretty nude color these two colors blend really well together by the way I love this color this is like the perfect nude thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video

[Music] brought up what are you doing hold on I have the shortest hands of life honestly they're so small that's where I need to be right now hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be doing a drugstore prom makeup tutorial I know a lot of you guys in high school don't have a huge budget I know I didn't I were to Abercrombie I made like $6 an hour can only afford maybe a few lunches that was pretty much it so anything that I got was from the drugstore so I went to the drugstore and I have a whole face of slayage with drugstore makeup and honestly looking at the makeup I cannot believe that I created this look using all drugstore least laid our eyeshadow brows lives contour everything from the drugstore I cannot wait to show you guys what I use because it's super affordable which shows you that you don't need super expensive makeup to look super expensive subscribe to my channel and hit the notification bow so you can be a part of the quad family so if you're ready to slay prom let's begin I've never done that we're gonna start off with priming our face so I'm going to take this Milani prime shield it's a mattifying and pore minimizing oil-free primer so when I have primers like this what I like to do is top them into my skin because they are going to get into your pores and fill them in and make your skin look super flawless so the best thing to do with these type of pore minimizing primer x' is to top them into your skin or you can focus them more on the areas where you have really large scary pores and you can just like with your nose usually around my nose I have that but I'm going to do all over my face because I want my face to look flawless for prom so I'm just going to even out my skin tone just do a light Flair foundation and I'm going to use this Ecotools Beauty sponge and the foundation I'm using is from Maybelline it's for normal to oily and it's the matte and poreless foundation and I am in the shade 128 which is warm nude I'm just going to bounce it onto my skin when you're using those modifying primers you want to make sure that anything you put on top of it you want to bounce it onto your skin if you rub it into your skin back and forth or if you use a brush then you can sometimes bring up dry flakiness I picked up this little brow kit from wet and wild so I'm going to use the darkest shade and start to fill out the tail end of my brow I'm actually going to take the middle shade I think I'm going a little too crazy with this dark shade the lighter shade I'll bring towards the front because I don't want the front to be super dark I actually think doing your brows with powder gives you the most natural looking brow so now that our brows are done I'm going to go ahead and prime my eyes I'm going to use the Maybelline master conceal in the shade light/medium start to top that into my lid and you don't need a lot just a little tiny bit goes a long way if you put too much then you'll get a lot of creasing in your eyes what's gonna help your eyeshadow really stay in place is setting it with a powder I'm gonna go in with my ELF shadow brow and liner palette I'm going to go in with that bone color and place it right on top of the concealer just to lock the cream in place and it also is going to have make our eye really smooth so that anything that goes on top of it is going to glide on so I'm just going to work my brush into these shades right here a little bit into this one for the crease and i'm using this Ecotools brush and it's the blend side there's a smudge in a blend and work these shades right into the crease she's gonna be our first crease shade just to give us a nice little dimension just go back and forth back and forth it's very subtle but you can definitely see the difference in these subtle little shadows that you're putting on your eyes are gonna make a world of a difference at the end if it may not seem like it's doing much now but it's all part of the process they all work together for a good cause for your eyes to Salette one prom day so I'm going to go into that shade right there it's like a rustic pink looking color and I'm just going to work that right back and forth into the crease I'm using a brush that has more of a point to it now I'm doing that because I wanted to focus right on the crease I'm going to bring it in towards the inner corner of the lid so now I'm going to take this purple color right here and I'm going to work that into the crease next and I'm using the same brush just work it right in there try to keep it below the pink so it makes that nice gradient I take this L'Oreal infallible paint and I take this side right here it's called cool ivory actually the whole thing is called cool I breathe I'm taking this golden shade over here it's like champagne looking color and I'm going to pack it on to the lid and then I'm going to top my concealer brush on the edges of this so that it cleans it up and then for the liner I'm going to use this L'Oreal infallible paint liquid eyeliner right here and I'm just going to create a wing right across on the top actually I almost forgot about my brow bone I'm going to go into my brow bone with a nice bone color just to work into the rest of the shadows and this part is really just going to clean up the crease and enhance the the shape of your brows I'm going to take this shade right here and I'm going to pop that right on to the brow bone and I honestly feel like this makes your eye shadow look super crisp and clean and then for mascara I'm going to go in with the Maybelline colossal Big Shot and I put some on before I put on falsies just to prepare our lashes and then for the lashes I think I'm gonna go in with these Ardell mega volume lashes right here okay so now we're done with the eyes I'm going to go ahead and do the rest of the face I'm just going to add a little bit more foundation and concealer like patience is a key with doing your makeup because if you don't then you get really frustrated you do things too fast too hard and you just want to get it over with so just have patience if you're doing your own makeup this prom for concealer I'm going to take the master conceal from Maybelline I'm gonna put it right underneath my under eye right on my under eyes actually just tap it in with my finger just a warmth of your fingers gonna make the makeup melt into your skin really easy and smooth so sometimes I just rather use my fingers if you want more coverage underneath your eyes then you just tap with a lighter hand so the corners in my mouth are kind of dark so I'll put some concealer here just to brighten it up a little bit next I'm going to contour somebody is just dream brightening creamy concealer it's actually concealer but we're going to use it as a contour stick and then I'm going to get right on my nose and then right on the top I like to create a little ball right here sometimes I think it looks cute so I'm going to go ahead and clean it up with this side right here just Pat it down and bring it down onto the sides when you do your contour I feel like it's easier and it looks a little bit more natural if you do just the cream contour try not to go too low because I'm just going to look like you have a little bit of a shadow down here which gives you more of a manly look and then I'm going to go ahead and highlight with this Maybelline strobing liquid right here and this is in light iridescent so I'm going to take some on my hand looks like this it's so pretty right on the high points of my face I like to do it right on the center of my nose too and a little bit down here Cupid's bow and then I'll just tap it in with my finger so when the light hits your cheekbones girl so we're nice and highlighted contoured skin is looking good you want to wait just a second before you set everything in place make sure everything is blended look at it really quick make sure that your foundation is blended down to your neck once you're good with your skin you feel like it looks good everything's blended then you can sit everything in place with this powder and this is porcelain from Maybelline so I'm going to take this little brush right here from Ecotools and then just work that into the powder and kind of tap it over the areas that I want to set so underneath my eyes and I'm using a lighter powder under my eyes because I want to brighten them up a little bit more so I'm using that tapping motion so nothing is moved around it's literally just sitting right on top of each other and then bring it around here because it's a little bit dark in the space so I'm going to tap it around and brighten up the spot I'm going to take a darker shade of this powder and I'm just going to go ahead and set the contour in place so I'm just going to Pat it in that area and then I'm going to move it upwards and then to add some warmth to my face and give us some nice color I'm going to take this Rimmel matte bronzer right here start to work that right on my cheeks I'm going to go around the temple so with your bronzer try not to bring it down to low and then for the blush I'm going to take this one right here from Wet n Wild it's the color icon in mellow wine top my brush in there and add a little bit to the cheekbone and then for the highlight I'm going to take this powder it's from Milani it's called the prep set glow it's a transparent powder has those little sparkles in it that without overpowering your entire face and work it right on the cheekbone and it gives us a really nice natural glow without it being too crazy I'm going to go ahead and go in with this elf lip liner take this natural shade on this side it's a matte natural color and I'm just going to outline my lips and then for the lip color I'm going to take this L'Oreal and follow the lip paint I like that this sponge has a little curve to it so it contours to your lip it's super comfortable oh it's not sticky at all I'm actually going to get this bronzer right here and just add a little bit of a shadow to the lower lash line and I'm taking some mascara and just coating the bottom lashes I'm actually gonna go in with some eyeliner on the lower lash line so I'm gonna take this L'Oreal liner I barely tapped down the liner but you know L'Oreal always has the darkest drugstore black liner another really important part after you're all done with your makeup you want to set your makeup so it last all throughout the night so I'm going to take this master fix we're boosting setting spray right here and try to keep it far away and if you have lashes cover your eyes so your lashes don't come off and your makeup will stay in place all day the powder is going to help it stay in place but that setting spray is really going to lock it in and you can have fun the rest of the night and not worry about your makeup thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video go ahead and thumbs it up if you liked it also I have some other videos hanging out over there for you to watch and that's it I love you guys so much until the next video bye dollies 
[Music] how does it always see firstworldproblems my grandma just commented on my Instagram photo we are about to save some money honey stop right there don't go further than this comment below which side you think is drugstore which side do you think is high-end hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be doing a high-end verse drugstore makeup tutorial I don't remember which side actually I do know that we are gonna compare and see if there are dupes if they are the exact same so you can spend a lot less I will let you know my thoughts at the end of this video so keep watching if you want to know which one I like better when I upload this video as soon as I post it I'm gonna be reading your guys's comments to see which one you guys think cuz it was so interesting you don't forget to subscribe to my channel before you leave and hit that notification bell if you want to learn how to save some money if you want to get some exact dupes for high-end makeup then keep watching this house high-end over here I have drugstore over here let's do this so I already primed my face I was going back and forth on the foundations because during the spring I want my skin to glow more I was trying to figure out what is going to be a dupe to something that is glowing in the drugstore so the first thing I thought was proclo and fallible pro glow I know it works I know it's good I like it a lot the closest thing that I found to being glowy or radiant that I have is the Estee Lauder Double Wear it comes in this little compact right here and you just press this and it comes out this is a lot lighter than the Double Wear like this one the one that comes in the bottle this one's a lot thicker and heavier this will give you more coverage this one is very light luminous radiant so I'm going to go ahead and use this guy for my high-end side of my face I'm going to use my new Sigma sponge like the 3ds bun and I am going to work that in with my Sigma booty blow under I always like to start off with just a light base of foundation I usually end up putting on a little bit more once I'm done with my eyes I just don't put that part in because this video would be very very long now we're going to go on the high end side of my face so I'm going to use this estee lauder one it comes with a little sponge I can't use this punch so I'm going to go in with this right here and I'm just going to okay this is a different color the other side's a little bit darker this is tawny that's so weird Tawny's usually my shade so there goes both sides they both feel really light but for some reason this one feels lighter the estee lauder feels lighter on my skin this side feels lighter it looks lighter it feels lighter and I feel like the coverage is very light too I feels a lot heavier on this side you're already very content with your skin and you just want a really nice even luminous skin tone then this side will be like perfect this one will probably feel a little too heavy for you I would go with this side the l'oreal side just because it gives me more coverage but at the same time I'm still getting that glow shining through still pretty good coverage without being full coverage in your face cake you know to me when it comes to these two guys I will have to say I am going with this one because it gives me more coverage but I still have that luminous glow to my skin which I really love which one would you go with this one or this one this one okay so the next thing that I'm going to do is fill in these brows use the Loreal brow stylist definer on the high-end side I'm going to go with the Anastasia brow Wiz in medium brown so pretty much the same shape same size let's start right here by the arch bring it in I actually really like how my brow just turned out right now this side of my face we're going to be using the Anastasia brow Wiz and medium brown start to fill this little guy in just brushing on this one you really don't have to continuously brush back and forth because it's already really nice and dark this is more of a warm tone this is more of the ashy tone I like both wouldn't mind using one or the other to be honest I think they're both really really good they do the same thing they look the same it's really hard to find a good brow pencil in a drugstore brand I would definitely buy this so the next item I'm going to use is concealer and I'm using the Loreal infallible total cover versus the Make Up For Ever concealer palette let's test them out let's see which one is going to work for us for the L'Oreal you start to work that underneath my under eyes the coverage is good it is a little bit more of a drier formula but I would have to say this is definitely a full coverage if you have really heavy dark under-eye circles it works really really good I'm going to blend everything else in with the Beauty Blender so this concealer is very full coverage a little bit dry now we're gonna try the Make Up For Ever side and I'm going to work that alongside my nose right in that inner corner I'm gonna work it outwards this one isn't as dry as the other one but it also doesn't have as much coverage as the other one you don't really need to cover like a deep set dark under-eye circle this one's going to work for you just fine I like the way it brightens that brightens up a little bit more than this one does but this one just looks a lot more natural if I have to choose I like both of them what do you guys think now we're going to get into the eye shadow for the eye shadow I have the Stila palette this is the matte metal eye shadow palette it looks like this it's really pretty and Mavi for the mob and nudes in this palette I found this palette right here which is from covergirl this is the true Naked Roses palette it has those Bobbi nude shades in there and those are the colors that I'm going to be comparing so we're going to test out the shadow quality and see what we get so the first color I'm going to pick up is this really pretty light pink right here this is called velvet and I'm going to pick it up with a morphe m-52 4 brush work that all over the lid I'm not going to go up to the brow bone with this but I'm just going to keep it right on the lid I really like the pigmentation on all these colors I like that isn't really any fallout when you put them on and it's it's quality is just amazing I'm going to go into the covergirl roses palette and I'm going to use this pink right here so very light pretty pastel pink and the shade right here is called baby pop it on to the lid there's a lot of fallout of this one it's a little bit darker than the other shadow I would definitely use some sort of eyeshadow primer before doing anything with this palette this shadow is very chalky like I wanted to like you the next color I'm going to take from the Stila palette is suede this really pretty mom and imma start to work that into my crease take this deeper shade of mom which I'm very scared to take right now so I'm gonna take some of this shade and the crease look at it like it's all like settled right here the shadows don't really blend well together the next color I'm going to pick up in this palette right here is this one this is retro put that right on the inner corners there's a really pretty rose gold looking shadow for this eye I'm going to take this shadow right here which is pretty much the same work it in there there's so much fallout on this eyeshadow for the brow bone I'm going to take this shade right here this is feather so I'm going to take this color right here this is almond and I'm just going to start to Pat that on my brow bone this side actually doesn't look bad the colors are really pretty they pretty much match except for the crease shade I think it's got really dark and ashy on the side I'm going to say this one is definitely a no for me I can't handle the amount of fallout it has it's not blendable at all I mean if you blend it it's all gonna fall off of your face this one I like the colors they are pigmented there's no fallout so I'm just going to definitely go with the Stila for the lower lash line hey these Purple's right here this is from L'Oreal this is their eyeliner pencil I can't pronounce that so there it goes for you you know how to pronounce it let me know this is pure purple it's a matte purple this one is from Marc Jacobs so this is the matte gel crayon in the color line pop this to the lower lashline I mean the waterline literally inside your eyeball that is a very pigmented purple it went down really nice on the drugstore I'm going to go ahead and use the L'Oreal one it's a few strokes to get the color down on there for sure I'm gonna have to say this one goes on a lot better both colors are nice this one's a little bit darker than this one I actually really like how the shades on this eye are working for spring so I'm not going to say these are dupes because they're definitely a little bit off on color they both have something different about them that I like so yeah this one or this one for lashes I have the elf lashes in star struck and for the high end lashes I'm choosing these Lily lashes in opulence they're both layered out wispy natural-looking but we are going to try these out and see they're the same or which one is better let's see okay wait I'm gonna stop that before we go any further I'm gonna bake under my eyes so I have the elf translucent powder on this side on this side I have the cover effects translucent powder take the cover effects on the black sponge and then on the drugstore side I'm going to take the elf it seems like the elf translucent powder is a lot more fine than this one so we're gonna let that sit there for a little bit while while we put on our eye lashes battle of the lashes the Lily lashes are a little bit thinner feeling these are a little bit thicker let's just put them on our eyes and see what the difference is okay so I definitely was off on the length because the elf lashes are a lot shorter and the Lily lashes are a whole lot longer and they're round and fluffy they have a little bit more lashes in between the little spikes and the little spikes on this side that's it that's all you get I would spend a little bit more money and buy this one because I can wear it more often and I'll get a really pretty look out of it just by putting on the lash it already did it's so much more for look okay so now I'm just going to take off this powder that was the elf side that came off really fast and now I'm going to take off the cover effects side which doesn't come off very easy and I think I put too much because my under eyes are getting wrinkly decide it just looks a lot softer this one is a good one I use it all the time I think maybe I used too much and it created these little wrinkles under my eyes but this one looks very smooth I would buy this this is worth the money I would buy this too but if you're looking for a cheap translucent powder that is good I would get this one I'm actually really liking the drugstore side it's just sad because I know that this eyeshadow is not going to stay on next we're going to go into the blush for the drugstore side I have the wet and wild color icon in the shade mellow wine versus the tart captivating blush which is one of my favorites first I'm going to use a wet and wild shade and I'm going to pop that onto my cheeks I like the way it blends it's pretty nice I like it I'm nothing bad to say about it the other side I'm going to be using Tarte you get a lot of color payoff with just one little swipe on this one Tarte captivating is definitely my favorite blush for any look this one is usually my go-to if you want something that's a little bit more affordable for you you're going to get the same color with the wet and wild mellow wine I'm so excited for this one so we are going to highlight her face now the packaging is so beautiful this is the Lancome LaRose blush illuminator taking me back to before I was born and we open it I'm obsessed with it look how pretty this is so I would definitely have to say that the Milani strobe light and number one is somewhat of a dupe for it so we are going to place that on our cheekbone the luminosity is there it's very light it's a little chalky it's nice for more of a natural looking glow I'm going to go ahead and try the dupe to this which is the Milani and pop it on to the Chi you get more color payoff on this one if I had to choose between the two I'm gonna have to say I'm and she's Milan we are down to the lips the first one is the drugstore which is the Loreal collection exclusive this is liya Spink and then on the high-end side I have Mac's lip tensity and arrows they're pretty much the same color they are very much the same we're gonna try the drugstore side first when it comes to springtime I really like these bright pretty colors this is the Mac lip tensity oh shoot right away like right away one swipe and I'm done it's a little bit darker than this side but pretty much the same you don't have to keep going over it to get that really

by step on this side how to get the most coverage out of everything that you're using without it looking textured rough thick and cakey on this side I showed you all the things that you're not supposed to do I think you can tell it's making me really sad right now just looking at it it's it's so bad unless you're far away I would say yes you look good but close-up it's it's scary it's a scary sight so I wanted to show you the don'ts remember that everything that I do on this side of my face is something that I've done and learn from so if you're doing something that you love then keep doing it let me know if you do any of the don'ts I want to know put them in the comments so if you want to learn how to stop the cake face from happening on your face then go ahead and subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be part of the Quogue family and without further ado let's get on with the video before any of us start with our makeup we want to make sure that we have nice clean skin what I would advise you guys to do is go and wash your face sure you exfoliate exfoliate your skin is going to remove the dead skin cells from the very top layer of your skin it's gonna give you more of a smooth feeling to your skin after you've exfoliated your skin it's clean you've removed the oil the dirt you're ready to moisturize your face whether you have oily skin or dry skin personally my skin is a little dry slash combo no matter what season I'm in it's a little bit dry always so that's kind of the skin type I have - what I like to do is use a thicker heavier moisturizer during the day and night so I've actually found this one this is the use a sorbet cheer in strong protection I use this for my daytime moisturizer so I'm gonna put that on the good side of my face the part that is going to look flawless and smooth within poreless so I'm gonna put that all in my hair just put it all in my hair just really get in there after you've applied your moisturizer don't go straight in with a primer and foundation you want to wait a little bit till that sets in your skin kind of dries and then you can go in because if you go straight in there it's gonna look uneven because it's so wet you want to wait till things dry on your face you don't want to go in when they're still fresh and wet so give it a second I'd say about 30 minutes before you actually start doing your foundation and your makeup if you can wait that long if not get a fan get a little baby fan you are dry we're ready for our primer or if you're feeling lazy and you don't want to use a moisturizer and then a primer you just don't have time for that you can always get one of these guys this is from Smashbox it's the photo finish hydrating primer so it's gonna give you the best of both the worlds in one - this is a good one for us dry girls who have trouble with the desert happening on our face but if you have oily skin i would suggest you use a mattifying primer coverfx has a great one so does makeup forever they have the base one mattifying primer the formula is very thin and lightweight so you don't feel like you have a thick layer but the good thing is if you have oily skin you were gonna look younger longer so I'm jealous so now that that is set into my skin I'm gonna go ahead and use this primer right here this is from Herb Orion this is the pink perfect cream this is one of my current favorite primers because it does help reduce the appearance of texture a little goes a long way and also if you have kind of dull skin this is gonna help brighten your skin on when I have thicker primers which is always I always like to Pat them into my skin because they are going to get into those pores and fill them out so it looks like you have a smoother surface I don't normally do this all the time but just for the sake of my other viewers out there that do like to color correct their face I want to show you how to do this properly so you don't have a cake face to be honest the more layers that you put on your face the higher chance you're going to have a cakey looking face I'm going to color correct around my nose I like to use my fingers because the natural warmth of your and we'll heat up the product and it's just gonna apply smoother and softer I'm literally dabbing on the smallest amount it's gonna help cancel that out I personally don't like color correcting under the eyes because my eyes are very deep set I feel like if I add foundation concealer powder over the color corrector that's just another layer of cake we are gonna choose a foundation that is right for our face so I am usually dry normal dry combo so what I'm gonna use for my skin type is from L'Oreal this is the infallible Pro glow and this is for normal to dry skin Julie a medium coverage I can kind of build it up to a full I feel like does have a more luminous finish so if you are used to having that dry dull looking skin this is going to be a really good one for you if your skin is more on the normal to oily kind of side I would choose the matte and poreless foundation this is from Maybelline I feel like you can get a really nice full coverage out of this without it looking crazy I'm gonna apply my foundation today with a L'Oreal beauty sponge any Beauty sponge that you find that you love for me it's Beauty Blender and this one they are pretty much the same to me just shape is different and this one's a lot cheaper and I'm just gonna dot it on you always want to start off with a thinnest layer of foundation let it dry and then see if you need more I like using a sponge rather than a brush because it soaks up the excess product also it pounces lightly onto your skin so it gives you the most softest airbrushed look the brush creates this micro exfoliation on your skin that really shows all the dead skin and it brings up the flakiness so I just applied a light layer I'm gonna let that sit and apply another layer because I do like the cake but I don't like to look like the cake and I like to keep the foundation away from the under eyes is the more layers the more cakey look that you're gonna get on this side of my face I'm gonna use a foundation that is not for my skin type and I didn't prime so you do the math and then I'm going to use a brush let's make it worse um not only are we going in with a brush we are also going in circular motions which is going to bring up that flakiness so I'm going to go under the eyes put a lot of foundation under there this side still needs some more this is two layers of foundation on the side this is one big block of foundation to be honest and a lot of concealing under the eyes with the foundation so the next step we're gonna do is concealing concealing to me is I don't know what I'd do without concealer I'm gonna go in with the heart-shaped tape in light/medium this concealer is awesome because it doesn't crease on your face it doesn't enhance those fine lines it has a lot of amazing skincare properties that can only help your skin this concealer is thick so you don't need a lot of it so what I'm gonna do is just put a dot right here for me this is the darkest area of my eye I'm gonna go down here I never like to follow the actual shape of my under-eye circles because that will give you a reverse raccoon eye and what this is going to do is also make your eye look a little bit more lifted brighter younger awake everything that you want in life is going to happen with this concealer let's erase those under-eye circles so while that dries I'm gonna go over to the cake face side with this concealer like I said it is pretty thick so you don't need to put too much this is what too much looks like and at this point you literally look like you can scrape it off of your face which I used to love this look and in person honestly if you're not looking from far it does not look pretty it looks very textured you look older it does not look good so I'm going to take another little layer here and it's okay to layer your foundation it's okay to layer your concealer just make sure you wait let it dry and then decide if you need another layer so this eye is brighter but you can already see the fine lines here on this eye and what's going on right here alright so now it's time to set everything in place so that it doesn't move or budge throughout the day so we're gonna set with a powder anything that you set with the powder is going to last and the good side we are going to take a translucent powder this is a Beauty Blender I'm just gonna dip it into the powder and then I'm going to set underneath the eye so it doesn't crease and it lasts long you want to make sure you're not putting too much of this on your face because that can actually bring up those fine lines so look up into the heavens as far as you can make sure there is no fine lines and then go in with your Beauty Blender I'll let that sit for awhile all it does it's a job we're gonna go to this side of my face and on the wrong side what I'm going to do is something that I would always do because I loved just coverage coverage coverage out of any and everything that I used all right so we're gonna use a compress powder that it has a lot of full coverage I'm gonna load up my brush to do this so I'm gonna go ahead and do that all over my face as you can see all my fine lines here are very prominent it's even creating fine lines in places that I actually don't have fine lines in but that's baked into my skin it's soaked in it's not going anywhere it's not creasing I'm gonna kick off that excess powder I'm gonna take a brush any clean brush that you have and just wipe it away so you're probably thinking what about the rest of your face so I have a solution for that I actually don't like setting the rest of my face with the same powder you can and can set it with a translucent powder I used the bronzing powder as a form of setting the temple forehead cheek bone all of that I do with bronzer so I'm gonna take this bronzer right here from Elsie's is a matte bronzer I just loaded up my brush I wanna tap off the excess because I don't want any extra powder that I don't need on my face what I like to do is go in right to the forehead and the cheekbone like that you can also contour I'm gonna actually do that off-camera so this side is nice sculpted set in place okay this side just is making me want to cry you can see the difference okay so we are done with our makeup the only thing we have left is to spritz on a long-lasting setting spray but I always use is the mac prep and prime fix plus this is the coconut one which I love is my favorite one for the summer thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and

and anything that goes on top of it it's gonna sit down even it's gonna look smooth and it's going to last all night I'm just gonna do my face how would I would normally do my face because it's human so I'm gonna take the estee lauder double wear for that and 3w 120 take it all the way down the neck basically make an imaginary line going down in the middle of your face I'm gonna jump straight into the eyes so for that I'm gonna use the tartlet toasted palate which smells so good it honestly smells like I just want to curl up next to a fireplace and drink hot cocoa make s'mores and Matt bone color and I'll place that right on top of the lid work it all the way through this is gonna be our base I'm not gonna go into too much detail about how to do this side of my face because you guys have seen it a hundred times and I really want the focus to be the death part of my face and I'm gonna go in with a warm shade the lightest one they have so this is cashmere and just start to warm up the crease now I'm gonna take warm this shade right here and I'm gonna work that into the outer part of the crease as well okay that was way too much then I'm gonna go in with cozy right here and just work that on the part of the crease I'm gonna take candle with this small little precise brush I'm gonna pop that right into the inner corners for some highlight now I'm just gonna take my TARDIS double take eyeliner and I'm gonna wing out my liner I'm just gonna add some mascara and some lashes I think these I think this is an iconic lash and it's funny because I only have one iconic lash I always take these little Lily lashes with me to travel and I literally don't even have anything to match that well at least I could put it to use today on my human eye so I popped on my iconic lash right there and I'm gonna actually started filling out the crease with this dark shade right here fire side so I'm just gonna fill it in just a little bit more to give that in there I'm gonna take the Urban Decay Naked skin and just work that underneath my dark circle I got this from my friend Melissa when I was in Paris with L'Oreal really beautiful person and beautiful girl she is an instagramer on YouTube or so so sweet she gave me this terracotta spray from Guerlain I think that's how you see the name and it's a spray it works so beautifully it literally looks like airbrushed bronze I'm gonna put a little bit on a napkin work my Beauty Blender in there just to add some warmth to my face I'm gonna take these coverfx drops the custom enhancer drops in celestial but I'm gonna go ahead and spritz this maxixe plus for the highlight almost forgot I wanted to use a powder highlight on top let me use proud proud friend very proud friend right now this is the elf X heart defense er collab highlight this is the coffee and cream hub this is the coffee and cream highlight duo it is so perfect I can't even begin to tell you this is rose bold right here it's so beautiful on the skin and I like to use this one right here for the top so I'm gonna take this one first and I'm gonna pop it on right on the top and then I'm gonna take this rose gold shade and I'm gonna work it down into the rest of the cheek and it's just so beautiful blinding so proud of you I love this highlight this is perfect just like you I love it so much you love her I love it I love coffee I love cream this is this is everything the packaging is beautiful it's rose gold it's cute it has a heart it's okay so now for the fun part I'm gonna do this side of my face which is death I don't want it to be like pasty white I want it to be as realistic as possible so I like to take just the whitest foundation I have I have the number seven stay perfect foundation in the shade I have no clue it doesn't not even say sticker must have fell off but it's a pretty pale shade I'm just going to take that put it on my face with a Beauty Blender I'm just gonna start to work the deaths skin color onto my face I'm so excited for this part this is my first Halloween tutorial so I'm so excited about it I'm like super giddy so I'm gonna let that dry for a second and then I go in with a second layer of foundation to really lock in this pale look we're gonna go ahead and lock it in place I'm going to use the dermablend loose setting powder and I'm just gonna put that all over of the face so I'm gonna start to hollow out my cheekbones and just start to contour on the face so for that I'm going to use this a makeup forever I shadow here there's no name it's like a number which I don't know if you guys would care about that it's M 536 when use a few different shades but this is the one I'm going to start off with so to contour I'm gonna take this Sigma tapered highlighter brush and it's in number f-35 I'm gonna go a little bit higher than my natural Hollow okay I'm gonna go into the neck start to shade that I have this is actually from anastacio it's one of the contour kit colors and is fawn start to shade out a little bit further the next color I'm going to go into is from makeup geek if this is a bad Rock it's a matte gray shade and I'm gonna go right underneath it and anywhere you just feel a hollow or a bone that's kind of prominent you go right underneath it and now I'm gonna use a little bit of black I'm gonna intensify the contour a little bit more later but I'm gonna start to work on the eyes and I'm gonna first start off with this red shade it's like a dark red this one right here and I'm gonna work it right in the hollow of my eye and I'm gonna take it all the way up to the brow bone and then I'm going to work it downwards really close to the eyelid bring in concrete jungle into the eye alright extend this all the way out here on the lid I'm gonna take the LA girl Pro primer it's black so I think that's gonna work perfect for this look so I'm just gonna take the block and work all into I'm gonna take some of this orange shade from makeup forever and this one from makeup geek it's called peppy I'm gonna mix them together and start to work that into the crease then with this black shadow I'm gonna go over the lid completely I'm gonna take some of this red on this fan brush just took my lash fan brush I'm gonna work that right underneath my my lash line add today red I'm gonna actually use a lip liner since I'm going a little crazy with brows I'm gonna kind of make my brow hairs into the veins so I'm gonna take some of this red and mix a little bit of brown together and I'm gonna go in between of the brow veins I'm gonna add a little bit of the blue to little parts of the veins [Music] so I'm taking these two eyelashes this one is from Amelia castano ex glamour by Josue cake B Miami lash glue them together I'm gonna wide out my lips so I'm gonna take this white shade here from the tsuba Beauty palette and really white out this area and kind of also add some paleness back in here and I feel like I lost them in some areas just because I was blending the purples and the blues and then right on at the inner part of the lip I'm gonna make this black I start to do these little veins going down thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today we're getting ready for a date we're gonna get ready for a date together here we go I feel like this pink is screaming at me right now but it's okay it's very flirty and different and fun and the eyes I'm went for a little bit of a cut crease a little it's glam but it's not like crazy it's not gonna scare them away so if you want to learn how to get this look don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with I'm gonna be using some stuff from the Ipsy glam bag this month so this is the bag if you see anything that's travel sized it's because it's from the way I'm bag and I've partnered with Ipsy for this video let's get started with a face so the first thing in my bag is this neo Gen der Balaji white truffle serum in an oil drop so this is supposed to give you intense hydration and leave your skin moist and supple so I'm all about that let's try it out right now on our face okay here we go looks like so I'm just gonna work that into my skin for an oil it doesn't feel very oily which is good the only bad thing about putting your eyebrows on before is that if you're putting any kind of foundation with cream primer on your face you have to be super careful because you will have eyebrow all over your face which is kind of hard not to do but you know out oh my gosh what is that that is my skin I have a skin tag right there shoot I'm gonna use all the face products before I start on the eyes because I want it to soak into my skin and really set so I'm gonna take the Smashbox photo-finish radiance primer and apply that to my face you can actually also use this as a targeted highlight you know I was like a base but I'm gonna use it let's see let's see I don't know I've never used this before let's see how intense the highlight is or the radiance is on this and put it on my hand to kind of figure that out because I can't have crazy okay yeah okay this is gonna give me a ton of luminosity so I'm just gonna target this in certain areas of my face that I want to highlight it so the bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow right on the cheekbone and you can use this alone just to give your skin a natural looking glow and this is a moisturizing primer cream it's supposed to give you that Magic Hour glow I'm also gonna put it right on the like right above the brow where the light wouldn't actually hit your forehead that's where I'm gonna intensify the highlight it is very it does feel very moisturizing on those areas so that's a plus you can put a little bit on my chin if you're oily you can totally skip this stuff I always say that because I have dry skin in a lot of you and if you're new to my channel you don't know that I'm gonna be like where's your doing putting highlight on a chin but I have dry skin so I need all the radiance luminosity but not everywhere because I also have texture and acne scarring so I have to be really careful where I want to illuminate my face because it can look really crazy really fast that's pretty I would even wear this like if I were a BB cream I would wear this alone with a BB cream I think that would look really pretty it just makes your skin look really healthy and glowy like naturally glowing so I'm gonna let that sit into my skin now I'm gonna move on to my eyes okay wait let me set my eyes first [Music] okay so the pallet that I'm gonna be using is this one right here from the makeup Shack it's called Muse and it is huge like the pan sizes are humongous I'll give that and there's some mattes and shimmers I'm gonna go ahead and first try iconic gonna take this shade right here and I'm just gonna work that on the crease just like this with a big fluffy brush just to give us a natural depth going through our crease I'm gonna do that on both sides just go back and forth in these little windshield wiper motion and I'm using a light hand to sweep that on my eyes I'll press down to hard because you're you don't want any muddy spots that you can't blend out later so this is very light here and go back and forth the next Klarman going to is reezy so I'm gonna take a flat shader brush which is already kind of used up just try to wipe it off on my pants I'm so lazy like if I'm filming I'll just wipe everything on my pants and I'll just look like a dirty mess when I get up and that's just my life so I'm gonna do is take a flat shader brush like this this is from zoeva it's the 234 okay so I'm gonna do like a cut crease right in here I'm gonna follow this shadow that my eye naturally has and I like to keep this side as clean as possible because we're gonna blend up with that side so we're laying the color down first on the crease and I'm using a very light hand and just dragging the brush across like this following the shadow and once you have the intensity of the color that you want now I'm gonna flip my brush over to the clean side and we're gonna just brush upwards [Music] I'm gonna take this clean brush right here mmm this is the time Los Angeles 204 and I'm just gonna go back and forth right here very lightly I'm gonna take another brush that's pretty similar to this one because I'm gonna take a darker shade I'm gonna take this shape this brush right here it's super tiny I like to use this on my lower lash line because how dense close together that the bristles are so it lays down more color so I'm gonna take Luna the shade right above it and go right underneath take another brush and do the same thing and brush upwards very lightly buff out the edges of that now I'm gonna get some concealer put it on the back of my hand and amazing this could be a brush right here from the makeup shock let's see T 86 and I'm just gonna take some concealer and start to carve this out and really sharpen up that crease [Music] I'm actually going to take of more narrow brush this one right here and I'm gonna flick this out now I'm just going to carve out my underneath my brow with the same concealer and also fix my brows a little bit and really make this look nice and clean and crisp using the little Beauty Blender helps buff everything out so nicely so I like to keep this guy around for like for this area right here so for the entire lid I'm gonna go over with this shade right here from Elizabeth Mott this is the pop goes the shadow in the shade toasted it's a really pretty taupe eesh immer it is so pretty I actually swatch it already on my hand and I'm gonna Pat it into the lid this shadow is nice and creamy I'm just gonna follow this little outline is definitely a buildable shadow so you can start off sheer and then you can build up the intensity actually gonna take a darker color and really intensify that cut crease so I'm going to take chocolate-dipped from the Too Faced Just Peachy palette just a darker shade run it through the crease and then I'm just gonna create a wing on the top so I can fly away so I'm gonna apply a black mascara this is from Tarte this is the lights camera lashes four in one mascara and this is good for volumizing curling lengthening it does everything and I love the one because it's so skinny it's but it's not too skinny to wear you can only use it on your lower lashes this is just a perfect amount of volume in a brush for the lower and upper lashes so I'm just gonna work that into my lashes just using these roll wiggle emotions I'm gonna use the little lashes in the style NYC I'm gonna pop them on real quick and I'll be back with some fluffy lashes I feel like I'm a surgeon I'm like scalpel so there's tweezers glue I'm back at my lashes on now I'm gonna put on some foundation I'm gonna use this foundation right here I just got it in it's from Dior it's the air flash the spray so I'm gonna spray it on my hand first because if I spray it on my face that'll be a terrible mistake so I'm just gonna take my Beauty Blender and work okay this is too dark my skin my body's actually pretty dark so I'm just gonna put on a light layer this actually I think I can use this I think it will blend into the rest of my body I'm going to take my heart-shaped tape concealer and just conceal my under eyes I'm also just going to highlight with this I'm gonna take iconic and run it down the lower lash line not thinking it too dark right here I just want to just want a little bit of death right in here do a little bit of contour snatch the cheekbones give ourselves a nose job I honestly feel like a makeup surgeon because of what I create on my face is literally surgery with makeup just gonna add a little bit of bronzer on my face so I'm taking this bronzer from Estee Lauder it's the bronze goddess and we're just gonna work that all around my cheek bone around the temple right along the forehead and then I'm gonna take a blush I'm gonna actually run that down my nose then I'm gonna take a blush from Tarte it's the big blush book they came out with and this is number three and they have a really pretty matte blush that I want to use this is called mindful love the name and the color so I'm gonna take this color right here pop it on my cheeks right behind the Apple into the hairline if you had texture skin if you have textured skin these matte blushes look really great on you if you have a really nice smooth skin and then you can go in with these shimmery shade your skin will look so beautiful and glowing so I'm gonna skip that part because I'm a little help in that area so I'm gonna set my the rest of my face using the peach blur I just feel like it minimizes the texture on my face it just looks like you have a filter on it so I'm just gonna put a little bit of that all over and then lately I've been obsessed with this banana powder that candy came out with with the Too Faced I really hope that they just make this a staple because it's so beautiful for the under eyes so I'm gonna take it right on the under eyes and what I like about it is that it's not super bright white has a yellow undertone so it kind of neutralizes the under eye circle and it kind of meshes with the rest of your skin and it just looks like a natural healthy under eye or the highlight today I'm going to take this pixi by petra Beauty blush duo in honey and there's just two really nice silky highlights I'm gonna go ahead and take these blushes with my little blushes highlight I'm gonna take this brush right here and grab some of this really pretty highlight and start to fit it on the high points of my face this is a really nice natural-looking highlight it's not too it's not like super intense blinding I love that look as well but this is a really nice fresh look like a silky highlight I like it I like it a lot so now we're moving on to the lips for the lip I'm using this color pop lippie stix in the shade glam bag it's a matte lip II stick so this shade was selected by the FC community and was exclusively made for this September glam bag it is a very pretty color and I'm going to pop that on my lips it's a very full coverage matte formula and it's super lightweight in velvety and I just really love how this lip complements the eye I think it's such a beautiful combo and right on the center I'm gonna pop on this lip gloss right here from dirty little secret cosmetics such a cute package and this is in the shade nude beach it's supposed to be a really nice lightweight formula and it's actually smells really good and it's not supposed to be sticky at all which I already feel that it isn't thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it you know what to do give me a big thumbs up if you want to check out some more

that I've been using is this Smashbox primer that's kind of dirty my contour palette broke this is the contour palette that I absolutely adore I love it so much I use it every single day and it's like thank the heavens it only broke the parts that I don't use we still have the rest of the important parts of the palette my skin is still very dry I don't know why but it is so I have been using this Smashbox photo-finish hydrating primer and I mix a lot this in it's from Make Up For Ever it came look like a big box of stuff but because my skin is so dry right now it's a hydrating serum so I put I mix this sermon with this primer and it's beautiful so I'm gonna go ahead and pop that on my hand squirt that in there mix it up oh it feels so good on the skin it just feels like my skin drink a big glass of water that's the best description that I have for this right now I always like to take it down to my neck because I'm gonna put makeup on in this area because we're gonna blend it we want it to match our the rest of our body I was very into makeup always and I'm gonna say I was like seventeen sixteen seventeen I would blend the makeup all the way to town like a crazy person like literally why I would do that the I would always run out of foundation because I wanted to drench it all over my body I don't know why for the foundation I'm going to be using the make it forever Ultra HD liquid foundation the most perfect shade I have ever had in my life has been this one then make it forever Ultra HD in Y 335 so if you are my similar skin tone get yourself some why 335 and you are good to go they have this in the stick form as well so we are going to go ahead and use this it makes it look a lot more hydrated it just makes it look healthier and this has really been doing the job for me so I'm just working that into my skin bouncing it bounce bounce bone I've been using the brow is from Anastasia in medium brown and then the precisely my brow pencil and number six to go on the bottom of the brow I don't know why I think it's a great combo it's just me I want to show you guys a little snippet of what I do to my brows so let's go go in there and sketch through them I just follow the natural flow of the brow fill in the sparse areas and enhance the the tail because basically I have no tail end of my brow I feel like it's not even there like I have a little tadpole I'll brush up and then I will hold it like this and brush through the brow and then I take this one right here this is the precisely my brow pencil from benefit and I go right underneath the bottom of it lightly just brushing through the bottom this is just to enhance the shape of the brow ever since I got this NARS soft matte complete concealer this has been part of my routine ever since the moment that I grabbed it and put it on my face so I'm just gonna clean up my brow so I'm gonna go ahead and take the meet matrimony palette and I am using Matt Lin we're gonna use him first I'm actually kind of happy that these are guy names because I always call my shadows and makeup products him or her it makes sense now so I'm going to take Matt lid I'm going to pop them all over my eyelid to set and neutralize the eye and we're going to take that all the way up to the brow bone so start in the inner corners all the way down to the end of the lid crease up to the brow I'm gonna go into the crease my crease brush that I've been using every single day is the Luxy 231 this has something orange on it so I'm going to clean it right now give me a second thank God for this brush cleaner I cleaned all my brushes yesterday with it and it just cleans them up so fast this is the it's your brush love from a cosmetics so this works really really good to get off if you want to change the color it gets it off like so quick it just slips right off the brush okay we are back to Norman I'm going to take Matt Lopez and I'm going to run him through the crease so I'm going to start out here so I'm just doing circular motions out here I like to just use back and forth windshield wiper motions when I get closer to the inner corner so we're going back and forth like this but you may have to use different motions on your eye because we all have different skin folds on our eyelids so use what feels best to you you can either do windshield wiper and that's just this mo right here circular motions for the outer part of the crease because there isn't very much folding there so it's easy for me to blend like this so just kind of find your own little groove of things and that's when your blending will get better and something that's going to help you on blending is using a light hand and sometimes it's hard not to kind of get in there and get like this close but when you're doing that that's gonna put a lot of pressure on your brush which makes blending a lot more difficult keep your hand on the back of the brush so you have a lot of room to kind of move it around so many is a little bit of Matt Kumar and a little bit of Matt Reed kind of mix them together and pop them into the crease so I'm coming in a little bit heavier handed towards the end of the crease because I want that part to be the darkest and then I just soften up towards the inner part of the crease so I go back and forth like this so I'm gonna go in with the smaller brush this is the morphe M 507 this is the perfect for me it's my perfect crease brush like right when you want to get that dark color in the crease this is the brush that I like using and I'm mixing Matt Wazowski with Matt Reed and we're going to focus that on the outer part of the crease only [Music] I'm going to go back in to Matt Lana to really enhance that lid color so I'm going to take a 234 brush from zoeva going to pack that on top of the lid while you're there you can kind of soften up the edge of the crease color I'm just going to touch the brow bone a little bit with this color and bring it down when I have a winged liner picture up on my Instagram everyone asked what eyeliner is it and it's this one it's because it's super super dark this is the hardest double-take eyeliner I've already use this side done the pencil that was dark too but I'm using this side right here this is a liquid liner part so I'm just going to go ahead and do a quick little winged liner now I'm going to go ahead and pop on some mascara and some lashes using my Marc Jacobs mascara I go back and forth between two lashes goddess from Lily lashes and now the House of lashes iconic light I'm gonna go ahead and pop those on and I will be right okay so I just put on my lashes now I'm gonna go into the rest of my face concealer because I just want to cover up my under-eye circles I'm going to use the Tarte shape tape this is it's the coffee trust me I don't know what's going on with me pop that underneath my eyes and everywhere else on my face [Music] I'm also going to use the radiant creamy concealer in 10 L because I am out of light medium and I use light neutral it is a little bit too light so I wasn't seeing these two together actually this is customer we're going to go ahead and pop that right on top and blend it in and now we are going to contour our face I'm going to use the Make Up For Ever contour stick I mean this is not I made this my contour stick this from Smith it's the Smith 220 I'm going to take that on this little brush and we are going to contour our cheeks [Music] now I'm going to set my under eyes with the shade and light contour palette now I'm going to bronze up my face I'm going to use the NARS Laguna bronzer just to warm up my cheeks and give my face some color I'm going to take that around the temple then I'm going to lightly blend it right in the center but not not going to go too hard because I don't want helmet bronzer for highlight I've been using the double glean from Mac dicey gling gling I'm just going to pop that onto my cheekbones Cupid's bow for the lips I've been using oak to line my lips [Music] and after oak I'll go in with cream denude this shade right here from Mac as you can see I have overall over the rim and I have been using that lately it's kind of like my combo and that is my every single day makeup routine thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did thumbs it up I will see you guys in my next video I love you guys don't forget that if nobody has told you today I love you and I think you're very special and amazing and that's it I love you guys absolute the next video by Dolly's 
[Music] I feel like a Victoria's Secret model in this robe right now like the dorky version you got groomed yesterday so she's nice and pretty and I think she knows it mm-hmm Starbucks for breakfast don't mind if I do one Saturday morning hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be filming this makeup look right here it's Saturday morning so I feel like I'm not gonna really do much today I'm not doing any crazy big event or anything probably go to the movies go out to eat or something I just want my skin to look really nice and healthy if you want to learn how to get this glowy dewy skin look very natural just really enhancing your natural features then keep watching I literally just woke up and it's like early in the morning so I still have things weird things going on in my eyeballs so just putting it out there for you guys I just want my skin to look really good and I want to like look very natural and just like a better version of myself so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use this priming water from Smashbox it's a photo finished priming water just to hydrate my skin I'm gonna hold it a little further away every time I spray something in my face always go and I hold it it's so weird my focus today is for my skin to look very healthy dewy and glowing so I'm going to take cover this cover FX custom cover drops and I'm going to mix it with this Becca backlight priming filter so I'm just going to take both of them on my hand like that and I'm going to mix in some of this priming filter just to give our skin a little glow here we have both of these guys on my hand I'm just gonna mix them up with my beauty blender mix them together and then work it onto my skin wow that's pretty good coverage make sure you get your neck so everything is your neck isn't detached from your body that's like what are the most important things for me I'm like let me get my neck really quick so that it looks like one piece and just bounce my beauty blender into my skin I like the the back was it clogged the Becca backlight priming filter I like this because it gives your skin like a very subtle glow it's not an intense shimmer all over your face which is what I thought it would be when I first got it but it's really nice actually next I'm going to do my brows I have been using this brow brush lately it's called it's from blink and these guys are in Sephora I believe on the end of the brush is so narrow it works really good at getting precise lines on your eyebrows making those hair like strokes it's like one of the best brow brushes I've used so far so I'm kind of stuck on it and I really like the spoolie it has like tiny little bristles it's really hard to find a really good spoolie because I feel like most brands don't really care too much about this spoolie there's big gaps in between and they're just fluffy that is nothing to brush through your brows this one is like really short bristles and they're close together so it literally grabs each hair and it like combs right through them so it gives you a really nice brushed up look so I'm going to go ahead and fill my brows I've been using the brow Zing's lately from benefit I'm using number six and number four mixed together I like to start right in this area so go straight across getting in to the eyes I'm going to use the violet Voss pro-rider dye palette this is like really really huge palette it's something you can use every single day realize so I grabbed it and I was like okay I'm gonna use like two colors I always like to set my eyelids with the neutral color shadow and then I'll go back in with a crease color to add some dimension back into the eye so I'm just gonna take April because April looks like she's pretty skin tone looking a pop it all over my eyelids in the mirror oh my god huge huge mirror you see yourself do you you see your so oh my God look how many of me is there is whoa that's trippy that's trippy my god you see that this is the m5 21 and I'm gonna pop that all over my lid take it all the way up to the brow bone and if you don't have like an eye shadow that's your color or close to your skin color just use your powder that works too we're just trying to neutralize and set everything on the lid and then I'm going to take a crease a crease brush this is the M 507 the first color that pops out for my crease is Abigail I feel like this is a really nice matte topee shade work it through through the crease and we just want to add a soft nice soft dimension to the the crease this brush is from the makeup Shack it's in number t12 it's a fuller fluffier brush softening up the edges and just kind of washing the color through the crease I want to add a little bit more of appreciate so I'm going to take Josie just focusing on the outer part of the crease and then I'm going to work it through with that makeup shock brush just just soften up the shadow so that's basically all I wanted to do to my eyes just make them look like a healthy natural looking eye okay and then for my concealer today I'm going is the NARS radiant creamy concealer this is in Canal and work that underneath my eyes just to cover up those dark circles I feel like the radiant creamy concealer is a little bit more lightweight and it gives you that luminous radiant look so I'm highlighting my face right now this is giving us like a base highlight at the same time we're concealing our under eyes blend that in with my Beauty Blender I'm actually going to go around my mouth because it tends to be really dark right here lightly putting the beauty blender to blend it out because when you use lighter like a lighter hand to bounce it it just blends a little bit easier and it still leaves the coverage that you want I feel like if you bounce too hard it picks up a lot of the product which is good if you have too much but if you really want that coverage you want to use very light patting motion I'm going to go in with this uh Nastasia cream contour palette bringing back the dimension in my face these we use a lot of foundation and concealer that can kind of just make us look washed out so for that I'm going to use two shades right here going in with my Sigma angled cream contour brush I'm going to take it right down my nose closer your contour is the smaller your nose is going to look so I like to make it a little bit more narrow towards the end look a little bit more pinched in and then I'll do these little this little triangle shape right on it I'm going to go in with the Stila kitten hue highlighter illuminator I like it because it's a cream and it's going to make your skin look like skin so I'm going to go ahead and highlight on the center of my my lids nose Cupid's bow chin and then I'm going to go in with the ciate dewey stick right here and this is going to give your skin beautiful dewy healthy look so i'm gonna go in with this it makes your skin kind of give you that wet look it's really really pretty I actually did a photo shoot with them me and a few other girls we did a photo shoot with the CIT dewy sticks it was so fun there was a photographer there named Sasha and she did Kylie's pictures so she did our pictures it was really cool and we got to create this cool video I'm gonna be posting it on Instagram soon so you'll get to see the pictures that Sasha actually took and the video from the shoot that we did it's so cool everything's like very like natural glowing and just really beautiful and I'm going to take it on my finger you can apply it right onto your skin but I'm going to take it on my finger and I'm going to go over those highlighted areas and you'll see that everything is going to be amplified this is in the shade glow oh my goodness look at it it's beautiful took your skin is glowing and it's doing it's healthy and I love it so I'm gonna put it right on the parts that I want and highlighted that's going to give us that glowing dewy wet healthy look can't even put this on your eyelids to give your eyelids that wet look it's also good for like a beach day like beachy hair and your skin is just like supple looking and glowing and healthy and dewy oh so so so good I'm going to take this mascara right here I'm in excessive lash from makeup forever and just coat my lashes really good before I pop on the fake lash the false lashes and just start at the base and just wiggle your way up I like this mascara because it's not super wet it's kind of dry so it really grabs on to your lashes so now my lashes are there they're saying hi to everybody I'm going to go in with these Lily lashes these are super natural looking but they're really really pretty they're in the style goddess look like this they're so so pretty and very wispy and natural-looking I'm gonna put these on really quickly thank you starbuck yes did you get it SOI did you get this so am sematic egg for the cheeks I'm going to take this steal AB glow watercolor blush and it's in the shade rosewater looks like this on the inside looks like that so I'm just going to pop that onto my cheeks just a few little dots I feel like my lips are really dry so I'm going to put on this is you a conditioning lip treatment it makes your lips super soft and then over the top I'm going to put on this makeup forever lab shine diamond collection gloss in the shade D 16 thank you guys for watching

you guys so much don't forget that you are amazing you're beautiful and I love you okay I'm done bye dollies 
hey guys welcome back to my channel just let it a new intro you know I get bored guys welcome back to my channel since today I'm going to be showing you my skincare routine something that you guys have been asking for I honestly don't use much I don't have like an extensive routine or I don't use a lot of masks so it's super simple just to let you guys know I have dry textured acne prone skin hyperpigmentation I got it all so I'm going to show you how I've cleared up my skin and I'm very happy with it and if you want to know how I cleared up my skin don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the cause family and without further ado we're gonna get in to the video so the first thing I do is wipe off my makeup and I've been using these wipes for years you guys want a cheaper alternative I would go to Target get their brand that says compared to Neutrogena makeup cleansing towelettes it's the exact same thing I just take it work it around my face even though I use the wipes I feel like I still have it removed all of my makeup so I'll go in afterwards with the touch-up pure one-step Camela cleansing oil and this I feel like really gets in there and just removes everything like there is not going to be one trace of makeup even if it's waterproof this will take it out even though I use the towelettes I still go in and use an oil cleanser because this thing removes everything I used to use them micellar water and that would work really well but I feel like this works even better it's very gentle on the skin and I feel like it doesn't dry your skin out which is a problem for me so this works really well for my skin type and the way you want to use this is dry hands dry face work it in after I've taken all my makeup off then I will use this guy right here and let me tell you I know this is not a sponsored video at all whatsoever nobody's paying me to do or say anything this is just what I use and I happen to love touches products because they work well with sensitive skin especially dry skin like mine it just is a perfect match for me and I know this because I was using it for a while but I get so much skin care products in that I get really curious to see if other products work so I went through this phase where I was trying a bunch of different stuff and it was to the point where my face was so broken out and it scared me so it was really bad and he's a lot of help with my skin so I went and got a facial with yoli glow and she used the Tatra products on my face again and she's like what are you using and I'm like I'm using a bunch of different things because I get so many things I just I'm using everything and now I don't know what to do because my skin looks crazy it was really bad I don't know if you go back a couple of videos it was just like zits popping out of my makeup everywhere I told you Lee I'm using all these different products I don't know what to do now because my skin's like this and I feel like Tasha's doesn't really do much for my skin and so she's like well why don't you do this she said go back to your trusty friend and try this guy go back to using this to wash your face for a whole month and let me know what happens so that's what I did I'm like you know what I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do it she gave me like a travel sized version and I took it with me when I traveled and I was like okay this is why I used to Tasha because my skin completely cleared up at first I was thinking this is not I need medical grade something for my skin but honestly this is all I needed so I went back and I've been using this and my skin is still really great if I don't keep up with it if I don't use this consistently I will break out when I use this very consistently with Yoli doing my facials she does extractions on my face and it takes out anything that might pop up later and so everything is very clean and when I clean my skin it's actually getting in there and really helping my skin improve after I take off my makeup I will use this on my face this is the polished gentle rice enzyme powder so what I'll do is wet my hands really quick pour some of the powder into my hand as soon as you rub your hands together it's instantly activated by water it becomes like a very soft creamy feeling cleanser and then I just work it into my skin for about 30 seconds I feel like over time it evens out my skin tone helps my hyper pigmentation all the breakouts that I've been going through and it just really soothes and balances my skin and that's why I keep going back like these are my holy grails right here these two guys together is magic feel like it really has smooth out the texture on my skin because it's a very soft kind of exfoliator and you don't feel any grainy pieces scraping your skin I have to be super careful with the products that I use on it and I can definitely trust these two products was so happy when I saw my face clearing up and then once my face started clearing up as I started getting a lot of comments from you guys saying what are you doing to your face it looks so good you have to show us your skincare routine let us know how you cleared up your skin so I was like okay I have to do this video I had really bad acne when I was a teenager so like I have scarring right here that just won't go away unless I actually resurface my skin so I probably will still do that I haven't been breaking out so I might plan to do that very soon and then your future and I will let you guys know everything about the process once I do if you follow me on snapchat follow me on insta stories if I don't post it on here on my experience for sure I let you guys know on snapchat and it's a story so make sure you follow me there and so after my skin is clean and dry I'll go ahead and moisturize it and this is something that I use as a nighttime moisturizer because it is a lot thicker and consistency it's called the herb or Ian use a sorbet night cream and this is very thick so I wouldn't suggest to use just during the day smells amazing it smells like you want to eat it and it's made with use' and which is a fruit it really sinks into your skin hydrates you recharges your skin for the next day I wake up like feeling my skin like it's a baby's butt if you have oily skin I wouldn't suggest this because it's gonna feel really heavy and slick but if you do have dry skin like I do this is going to work perfectly for your skin this helps fight fine lines and aging as well or if you have really dry skin and you just need all the moisture that you can get I definitely suggest this to you after I'm done with that my face is hydrated I go right into the under eyes and for the under eyes I use the it confidence in an eye cream this thing is also really thick you can see the difference in your under eyes when you underneath it literally brightens your under-eyes it brightens them anything that brightens my undereyes I will use I don't care I will try it I will use it and I will let you know if it really works or not and the one I'm about to tell you after this works just as great the reason why I use this at night is because it's so thick the consistency is so freakin thick I use this underneath my eye like if I'm doing the Kim Kardashian highlight I'll actually put it underneath my eyes in a V right in the center of my face and right on my chin I don't know you know I just feels like if you're gonna highlight those places those places need to be the most hydrated baby like flawless places on your face this cream is for all skin types if Brighton says you can use it during the morning but personally I would not suggest to use it in the morning unless you like that heavy feeling on your face or if you feel like you really need the intense moisturization during the daytime this is something that I really like and I feel like it makes my under eyes look really nice and smooth so after the under eyes are done I'm not done yet we still have the neck I know it's so weird you're like what are you gonna do with your neck your neck age is so fast you guys your neck in your hands so it is so important for me to prevent that from happening so I have been using this tarte maracuja neck treatment for so long if you look back in my old videos anything with skincare this is gonna meet in it I'm it is such a freaking thick cream all these creams that I use at night are super thick like Grandma thick hi grandma love you I don't care how old I am I don't care how young I am I am gonna prevent aging at all costs too because you know keeping up after all that's done I'm going back in with my tatcha dewy skin mist so I put this on no matter what time of day it is I'll just spritz it on my face after I wash my face hydrate I use the mist and it just feels so refreshing it really brings in that extra light layer of hydration and then I just close my eyes and go to sleep okay so now I'm going to go to the daytime because the daytime I did the nighttime because there's a lot of steps so the daytime is basically the same thing I use these two guys what changes after that is what I moisturize with so this is my daytime cream.the use a sorbet but this is going to fight free radicals it's gonna help protect your skin it smells amazing I'm almost done with it it is the lightest feather feeling on your face it feels like nothing and that's like my goal during the day I don't want anything to feel like anything on my skin you know I just want it to disappear it's super hydrating it protects your skins me this dewy natural glowing look so after that's done I'll go in with an under-eye cream and I use the origins ginseng refreshing eye cream and this helps brighten your under eyes it helps a puff everything on your face it just makes your under eyes look amazing this also if you put it on it's like a champagne and it has like a little bit of shimmer in it and it makes your under eyes without putting makeup on just this it helps visibly brighten your under eyes over time I don't know if my under eyes are getting lighter I don't honestly don't know that but instantly it does brighten your under eyes and it does feel very light and hydrated so I love that and I put this in my highlight areas too that is my skincare routine I feel like I don't really do too much I've seen a lot of other skincare routines where it's like they do mask and they do like all these other things I that I don't do but this is what works for me it's pretty minimal I would think I put on a lot of moisturizer because I am really dry I feel like my process is pretty simple and there's not anything fancy about it really you're interested in any of the products that I'm using I will always have them listed below with the price and the link where to get them so you don't have to worry or search or ask in the comments I will have it in the description so don't worry

[Music] you didn't make this you did no thank you is studying behind my back you know when you don't know if you shaved your armpits yet he's just like okay that would be embarrassing if I actually didn't shave my arm hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be doing this natural glowy look I put a pull-up on Twitter to see if you guys wanted to see something glam or more fresh-faced I was very excited when you guys wanted to see something fresh-faced because I was already kind of thinking I wanted that I just wanted to gauge what you guys wanted to see so I created this look right here it's very easy it's super glowy and it's all creams so it looks like your skin but better so I really like this look I think I'm gonna be doing it a lot this year for my no makeup makeup days I'm everything on my face is contour colors creams just vary your skin and your face but better if you want to learn how to get this look then keep watching so I'm going to start off with a bunch of skincare because skincare is so important for your makeup to look really nice and clean and smooth so what I'm going to do is put on this number 7 early defense day cream and it has a sunscreen in it I have lipstick on my hand that could have went really bad really best and I just wiped it on my pants Joe that's my life anything any day cream honestly I don't use this one all the time I just opened this one up in I like the ingredients and I like the way it felt when I put it on my hand it was very light very light weight feeling and those are my favorite kind of moisturizers to use during the day you don't want anything that's thick on your skin I saved my thicker creams for nighttime the next thing that I'm going to be using is this primer this is from Urban Decay it's the optical illusion complexion primer this one is a smoothing primer so it's going to make your skin feel really smooth and velvety and that means that the foundation that goes on top of it is going to lay down very smooth so I'm gonna pop this on it to my face mmm that's smooth whoa I like to use smoothing primers like this because it fills in all of the large pores and any divots that you have in your skin it'll help them look a little bit more smoother and it kind of plumps them up let's make our skin look flawless I'm going to use this Smashbox Studios skin 15 hour we're hydrating primer the key to everything that I'm using today is hydrating because it is winter time and my skin gets very dry during the winter my head gets really flaky it's really bad so I like to go for every and anything that says hydrating on it because I need a lot of help in that department so this is a hydrating foundation and it's also it has a really nice coverage and it doesn't feel thick on your skin it's a very lightweight very wearable for daytime or every day so I'm going to apply this with a brush this one is very buildable too so if you want a light coverage it's not immediate full coverage it's buildable so if you want something that's a little bit more on the light side or if you don't need as much coverage this is also a good foundation to use for that put a little bit here and I'm not going for a full coverage of foundation when I'm doing something that's everyday I do really like full coverage foundation love full coverage foundation it is my everything but for something like everyday and I just want to look like my natural self but better I don't I don't need full coverage for that so now my skin's even I'm gonna go in with some concealer and fill in those under-eye circles so I'm going to go ahead and put on a very lightweight concealer this is the NARS radiant creamy concealer drag it out like this I'm going to go ahead and start my eyebrows because I need some eyebrows today he's the COO brow this is a number five and this is actually waterproof and 24 hour long wearing everybody needs that in their life so I'm going to fill in my brows and start at the bottom of my brow and just follow the natural curve we got how much brow I need so I want it to look very natural and full I want my brow to look like a natural full brow now I'm using the brow precise to my brow pencil in number six from benefit and I'm going to use that to fill in the sparse areas all right so now I'm ready for the eye shadow I'm going to be using the Tarte man-eater palette on the go palette which is perfect for something that is everyday or very natural looking so the first thing I'm going to do is pop into this color right here this is passion it's like a matte nudie peachy looking shade it's going to be taking this guy right here and I'm going to be placing him all over the lid all the way up into the brow bone so what I'm doing right here is just mattifying everything and sealing my creams in place so I'm going to take this color right here which is her to Matt Mabi shade I'm going to take that with my Sigma blending b25 brush I'm going to work that onto the crease and I'm just going to follow the natural hollow of my crease I'm just going to diffuse the edges so they're not so harsh so it's very natural and fresh looking I'm going to take saucy which is the color next to it and this is also a matte shade with the same brush I'm just going to enhance the crease and I'm going right below that shade to add extra definition to the crease I'm going to take passion and with a more densely packed brush and start to work that on my I really enhancing the lid and then for the brow bone I'm going to take me out which is the lightest color in the palette right here and I'm going to need a closed mirror for this because I can't see I just pop it on to the brow bone literally Pat it down so you can get the most out of the color I always like my right under my brow to look the lightest makes the eyebrows down doubt makes the eyeshadow stand out a little more as you can see the difference and then I'm going to take this shade right here it's called lace and I'm going to pop it into the inner corners to add some light there bring it down a little bit right below the tear duct okay so the next thing I'm going to do is put on some mascara super basic and I'm going to be using this mascara from Maybelline it's their new mascara the colossal Big Shot and I really really like this mascara I used to use it back in the days like high school days and now they came out with this one I think I'm using it again because it is so good it just separates and lists every single lash so nicely so I'm going to put some of that I'm gonna put a lot of that on actually wow I'm so impressed with this mascara it is so bomb look at that and then I'm going to pop on some lashes so I'm going to put these on and I will be right back okay now I'm going to do some cream contouring I'm going to use this Kiko palette and take my Sigma angled cream contour brush I have a discount code in case you guys wondering I have it bound below so you guys can check it out I'm just going to dip into this brush and start to contour my cheekbones and my nose bring it up it's just a natural shadow that you're enhancing right underneath the cheekbone my face is a little bit more rounded so I liked a definition to it I want to look natural but I want to look defined to my features to look really nice and define so contouring is a must for me and I'm also going to go down my nose with it I like the ends to curve out and then these two little lines on side like that and that's what is basically what I do to contour and then I'm just going to blend out the edges so it looks nice and defined you go into strobing side I'm going to take my morphe y 15 brush just work that in there and then start to apply that onto my cheekbones [Music] all right on the Cupid's bow and I'm also gonna do it right on the chin you don't have to do this especially if you have oily skin I have skin that's more on the drier side so you can skip this part if you want to add some color to my face I'm going to add some blush this is the color pop a pop flushed blush I like it because it's creamy it's like on the cleany side so it'll work really well where the look that we're going for today so I'm just going to pop it onto my cheekbones with my finger and just press it into my skin and then with my clean finger I'm dabbing around it so there's no harsh edges my Chaka what did you mean you didn't make this you did no thank you so I'm going to set my face with this powder right here this is the cover FX translucent setting powder perfect setting powder but is this just to set everything in place I'm not I'm gonna avoid the parts where I highlighted just so that they can still shine through so I'm going to take this brush right here since from BH Cosmetics C 136 brush so I'm just gonna go right underneath here and it's not giving us any coverage it's just literally setting everything in place so doesn't move around right around there and then I'm going to put it right underneath the under eyes but I'm not going to drag it out too far because I still want the highlight to really be pop in I'm I use this bronzer right here this is from the bomb it's called bomb beach the long wearing blush but it's like a bronzer it's called warm it up it's gonna go along the outer perimeter my face I've been obsessed with these lip liners from Make Up For Ever these high precision lip pencils so I'm going to use a number 13 to line my lips and then I'm going to put a gloss over something really natural-looking I just want my lips to have a nice full definition so I'm going to line them up first I feel like this is a very natural looking color for me and then I'm going to use this Marc Jacobs cream in fawn over me I actually just got these in from my PR packages so it's very new and I wanted to try it out for you guys and just kind of pop it on to my lips I thought it would be shiny but it's not it's actually totally different from what I was thinking but it's a very pretty color I thought it's going to be a little bit more glossy and actually do want a little bit of gloss on my lips so I'm going to look for a gloss and then I'll be right back I'm gonna go right on top with this luxe lacquer from BH Cosmetics and this is in the shade Columbian coffee actually a perfect match for the color we just put on our lips Wow what I put on right now should be a lip kit [Music] thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did thumbs it up if you missed my last two videos they're to be below my box for you guys to watch and that's it already guys so much I'll see you in the next video bye Dolly's 
hello out of line and average cyan value call my name hey guys welcome back to my channel as today I'm going to be doing a full face of first impressions using everything that's new from PR packages in some stuff that I just just got and I'm lead on it one of the hugest things is like highly lip kissed the packaging is beautiful on this there are so many good things that I got I got a whole bunch of new stuff and I can't wait to show you guys I created this look with it and I really really like it so also I have currently been obsessed with musically I might be really late I only have a video of my uncle doing jeju on that meet which originally was not it was like a Spanish song but he was dancing sooo and then I we changed it one day I will have the Rolex challenge on there I even practicing before you go and watch this video make sure to subscribe to my channel and also take the bail so you can be a part of the quad family so if you want to learn how to get this look right here then keep watching first thing I'm going to talk about is that are these are Solley drops I haven't tried them I feel like I've seen in thousands of times on Instagram but I haven't tried them personally all I know is that they are so gorgeous these if you look at it there's both flecks it's infused with 24 karat gold look at that now you're gorgeous I just want to do it up close and iris evil will do this so I'm going to try it try it out I'm crying gold tears somebody help me into glams I'm going to put that all over my face the smell is really nice too the dry oil so it just sinks right into your skin so quick this is from glam glow right here it's the nude glow shade and it's an illuminating moisturizer it looks like so and then it's so pretty everything we're using today it has some kind of gold in it some kind of glam in it so if you have really nice flawless skin and you are don't feel like wearing makeup I would put it all over my face or anywhere I want to highlight but if you don't I would be very careful on where you put this I would have put it all over my face because all my pores will be highlighted all my blemishes it just would not look cute for me so I'm just going to put this on as a point of my face where I want a high this is going to be the base highlight basically I'm going to go underneath my I think it's a really nice to use around your eyes because it is very moisturizing and your eye has very delicate since skin around it so I'm all about moisturizing that area and if it's illuminating even better because sometimes it can look a little dull okay so next I'm going to move on to the foundation for foundation I got this Bobbi Brown Foundation is kind of watery I hope I'm praying that the coverage is good because it does seem like very light let's see let's see how this goes also I just literally got this in today this morning from Beauty Blender this is part of their summer fling collection this is the neon green one they also have a neon pink and an orange one they're super cute and I'm not filming I'm just doing my makeup on myself I don't even do foundation first I go straight for the brows I don't like it to feel really around them because then I feel like the product doesn't grip to the brow areas as easy it's kind of slippery and sliding so I'm trying to stay away from that area if you have nice flawless skin this foundation is going to be great for you I can still see my skin which is not a bad thing but I definitely feel like I need more coverage so I'd probably grab concealer and put it over this to be on it now I'm going to go ahead and move on to my brows now I bought this makeup forever brow kit is I've never tried anything from makeup forever for my brows so I'm really interested to see how this is going to work I have two shades that I think will work for me this is number forty and this is number number or fifty so I'm thinking I'm going to use this towards the middle part of my brows and this on the end so I'm going to go ahead and start right here where it's very sparse and just go back and forth and I just like to sketch my brows on like that it gives your browser most imperfect perfect one I know sometimes I like when my brows look really nice and sharp but then other times I've been really liking the way it looks by sketching them on like this it's just quicker and it gives you a more natural look if you're going for that I'm picking up the nen 50 because I just need I need a little bit more coverage right in here it's one of those pencils that you can sharpen and sharpen and sharpen and it's going to last you forever so I don't mind that I wish there was like an in-between that would be perfect for my entire brow the next thing I'm going to try this new is its their brow gel and this is in the shade 35 it's a little bit lighter so it's going to soften up the darkness just make it look a little bit more natural so the bristles at the top are pretty long and then are the rest around the rest of the brush they're really short I'm going to use the longer bristle for the tail so we can shape the little hairs well I kind of like it like this because it's not giving you a ton of product at one time it's kind of like slowly working it through and then if you want more product you can flip it on the short bristle side and it'll still comb it through but it will deposit a lot more product I really like the way it softened it up between the two colors and then this brow gel it really made my brow really nice and soft but if you have to go out and buy that many products to get a nice brow I wouldn't do it personally I have it in front of me and they're sending it to me so that's why I'm doing it but if I had to go out and buy them any products I personally wouldn't so it's up to you guys I think they work really well it's just the colors are a little bit off to me you have to buy a few products to get the perfect looking color okay so now we're going to move on to the eyes I'm going to prime my eyes first before I get into them so actually I'm going to use some concealer to do that this isn't a new concealer this is from Kat Von D it's the locket concealer let's just cover up those under eye circles real quick now I'm going to get an eye shadow I'm going to be using this new little MAC eyeshadow that just came out it's called oh my banana it's so cute it's like fruity and colorful it's so pretty these are the shades that are inside someone go ahead and take this 229 brush right here from Luxy and I'm going to go into that taupe shade and let's start to work that into my crease to add some def I'm going to go back and forth in windshield wiper motion I like that this palette has this matte taupe shade in it I feel like it's a really nice shade and I'm think I'm going to just go into the next matte color in this palette which is this plum shade right here this one please ignore my nails I'm trying to grow them back and they keep peeling off every time every few days they just peel off they just fall off randomly please ignore my nails I just want them to be healthy again so I can put more coffin-shaped nails on them that's all I want to do I just want to have glam nails again and I'm going to take this 231 from luck see it's a small tapered blending brush so I'm going to go ahead and work that right into the crease I'm going to keep it pretty light towards the inner part of the crease or the inner third and then I'm going to really intensify the outer part of the crease and I'm kind of working between both brushes so I'm building it up blending it out and then building it up running it out so there's no harsh edges if you feel like you lost some of that crease shade that taupe shade I'm going to go ahead and go back into it I feel like I've kind of lost it so I'm going to bring it right back in there you still want that bronzy glow around your eyes I think this is going to be a really pretty look so this summer I haven't used a dark shade on my lid in a really long time so I'm going to go in with the taupe on my lid haven't done this in a while we're doing it we have it on the crease and now we have it on the lid we there's no turning back now gotta keep going I'm going to Pat it on there it was just calling my name honestly I was just screaming now that we have the taupe on the eyelid I feel like I need to go back into the purple deepen it up some more and add a little bit more of a heavier hand here okay with the same brush I'm going to take that plum color right here then go right on the outer lower lash line keeping it away from the taupe shade because you want it to peek through and we want it to be a nice gradient I'm actually going to bring this small detail brush up around the crease because I want it to be a little bit more intense and this is not giving me that intensity and then because it's so small it's not going to really blend very well so I'm going to take my blending brush right here and just go around it try to blend it further away so it kind of smoothes in to the taupe shade push your brush down on your skin too hard otherwise your eyeshadows in and come out hard I'm going to take this shade right here and I'm going to pop that down on the lower lash line as well I'm going to go with the same brush and work it really close to the lash line I'm not going to go too far and with this keep it right on the outer part and then I'm just going to flip this bottom liner out a bottom shadow out I'm gonna flick it upwards towards the tail end of the brow I'm also going to take that orange shade in the palette and pop it onto the inner corners so I'm going to take this shade right here I just it's calling my name it's so gorgeous I'm going to take this and pop it on the center part of my lid and it's actually really creamy feeling and then I'm just going to take this color pop pressed powder this is out a lot I'm just going to pop that on to my brow bone right quick I just needed a nice matte shade this is actually the first one I've ever used it's kind of as a pinky undertone to it okay so now I'm going to add this purple this is from Milani it's the stay-put waterproof eyeliner in the fixed on plump I'm going to pop that on the lower lash line and take it all the way through actually the waterline in my bad I'm going to use this Mac liquid liner I don't know if this was new or not you don't think it is going to create a wing with this little guy so I'm trying out the Buddha Beauty lashes for the first time I'm so excited the packaging with her eyes on the lashes it's absolutely stunning her face is gorgeous and I am going to be wearing the fara number 12 my first thought on these lashes is that there the band is really thick which means you can use this lash over and over again I'd say maybe about 10 times or until they follow I'm going to go ahead and pop these on to my eyes I actually just got this L'Oreal voluminous original mascara in and it's a royal blue shade so I wanted to try it out in this video it's really pretty and I just I don't know I don't know how it's going to look with the look but I think it's really gorgeous and I think we need to pop this on the lower lashes just a little tiny bit to give it a little bit of a pop so it's like highlighting your hair blue a little bit [Music] ok so now we're going to move on to the highlight this is a new highlight from Tarte it's the TARDIS Pro glow in the shade Sparkle err I'm going to use that right on top of my cheekbones I would say gives you a nice medium glow it's not like super intense see myself wearing this like on an everyday basis it's not blinding but we want it to be blinding today so I'm going to go in with this violet Voss loads old highlight palette that I just got in and it is so gorgeous the palette is covered in pink roses which are my favorite roses Ceasar when you open the palette there's these huge square pans with all the rose gold highlights in the different shades so I'm going to take Fleur and petal and work that onto my cheekbones I have a nice amount of pink and gold in there it's just really really pretty then I just got this in from Estee Lauder this is a part of the bronze goddess collection which is so it smells amazing and they also have this dry oil they can spray on your body that has these gold flecks in it gorgeous so I definitely wanted to try B matte bronzer I'm all about my matte bronzers and the heat the pan is absolutely huge this one has like an orange undertone which most people don't go for I actually like a little bit of an orange undertone because I feel like it makes me look just glowy like sunkissed now I'm just going to set the creams in place with a little bit of powder underneath the eyes and around the t-zone area okay for the lips I have a new lip liner from colour-pop it's called I am yours looks like this is a pretty nude color for the grand finale the k'kaw Kylie cosmetics cream liquid lipstick oh my gosh I was dying when I saw these these are so so pretty I'm going to go ahead and eat Kimberly I feel like I just want to mix all of them together they're all almost very similar now I'm putting Kim on to make my powder look like skin I'm going to spritz on this mac fix+ in coconut its it smells so good I feel like this is going to be my new favorite fix+ whenever I solve this and my PR packages I was like I love fix+ today so let's go ahead and spritz it on if you don't like coconut you're not going to like this but just the colorful fruits and the coconut smell take you somewhere it takes you to a tropical island ally and average sigh and then thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did thumbs it

one from L'Oreal this is the visible lift radiance booster brightening primer 24-hour hydration ooh I like the color of this like a peachy it doesn't smell like anything that's good things kind of a thick primer nice and bright and ready to go if we are going for a dramatic nighttime look I want to have the full coverage on my face so I'm going in today we're doing it big using the Kat Von D lock-it foundation in medium 50 to warm up every time I've gotten this foundation it's either for a Halloween video and it's either way too white on purpose or way too dark not on purpose but I just can't find my shade so I'm hoping praying to the gods that this is my shade medium 52 let's try this please Beautyblender you see everything on my face is about to disappear every mole every acne spot blemish everything on my face is about to turn in to flawlessness so let's do this these earrings are so heavy I feel like my earlobes are about to drop to my knees okay I always tend to get foundation in my hair and I'm going to try not to do that today so wish me luck you guys blend it down to my neck I'm gonna put some concealer on using this Tarte shape tape in light/medium right on top of the panda eyes so just right in there this concealer is actually darker than the foundation you dab dab dab my little sponge right underneath my eyes I'm gonna use this wet and wild ultimate brow kit every time I find a new wet and wild brow product I get stuck to it and use it for like ever this is a brow powder in brunette I feel like the powders are a lot easier to use they're a lot quicker so I'm just gonna build up that tail end because it's looking kind of scrawny I'm gonna go ahead and carve out my brows underneath a little bit so I'm gonna take some of the concealer and just work that all over my lid and just carve out my bra to make it look really nice and sharp I'm excited to do my eyes today because I'm going to be using Karen's palette I love satays palette I'm so excited the first palette there's two one is called saucy right here which I'm going to be using a lot of and then one is I'm actually going to be using both of these pallets together I'm just going to go back and forth between them and then the other palette is called Shiki which is this one right here first color I'm gonna pick up is from the saucy palette it's this shade right here this is chic happens and I'm going to work that on to the crease oh these are pigmented oMG what I'm basically doing right now is washing it into the crease so you're going to see this is just part of the transition and creating that def there so you have a light wash of that color okay I just realized that this transition shade matches my background so perfectly now I'm going to go into the other palette right here this is cheeky and I'm gonna take this matte shade right here which is freckles for that I'm going to take this pur cosmetics brush in blending crease that's what it's called I'm going to pick up freckles and pop it into the crease hmmm is a little bit more dense so it's giving me more color you see how it's tightly packed so I'm going to actually use this one just to feather it all all these subtle hints of color are going to make a for really nice smooth gradient and a really nice smooth transition so I'm going to go ahead and pick up the purple the shade right here which is called raise II raising some kind of crazy and work that onto the outer part of the lid I'm gonna bring it up into the outer part of the crease I'm going to go back into my blending brush right here and start to soften those edges out and diffuse that color into the skin I'm just using these quick little circular motions I'm barely touching the skin so that the brush just glides across and you get a smoother blend that way I'm going to extend it out a little past my lid to give it that extra drama I'm going to grab a little bit of this brown right here this is the shade no chit and just start to darken out outer corner a tad bit more we want it to look like noce that's nice and dark I like the way that looks so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a little bit of heavy glam a little bit of that guy and a little bit of vivacious just going to mix the two together we're just going to make them best friends so I'm going to go ahead and take that on the inner part of the lid keep it toward heavier on the inner corner and then lightly sweep it into the lid I love how pigmented these shadows are they're intense I love it okay now we're going to go ahead and work those shades down on the lower lash line I'm going to first start basically what I did to the crease is what I'm going to do to the lower outer part of the lower lash line so I'm going to take this little brush right here to the t2 from the makeup shock I'm gonna first start off with his cheek happens okay and then the next color is going to be that plum shade is crazy I like saying that racy right put that closer to the lash line so I want it to be the darkest right in there take this brush right here this is from Luxy it's the 141 brush and I'm just going to sweep that back and forth just so that we can get a really nice blended look okay so now I'm going to grab this color right here this is distressed it's this matte bone color it's gonna clean up my brow make it pop and then it's also going to help the shadow that went a little bit too high for me we're gonna bring it back down make everything look nice and blended I'm gonna go ahead and take this purple liner from japonesque it's called there's no name on it it's just purple I was like a purple tip and it's purple so I'm gonna go ahead and line my waterline with this so now I'm gonna go ahead and do the wing on my eye so I'm going to take my Kat Von D eyeliner just start inside right here in that inner corner and you don't have to do one smooth motion just slowly gradually make your way to the other side and then do a little flick upwards like that bring it back down it's not gonna cut my lashes with mascara I just found out about this mascara when I went with L'Oreal toucans and they had this in my room to try oh my god I thought I love the Maybelline Big Shot colossal this is like on another level I am obsessed with this mascara it is so good the packaging is so pretty in pink and it's just so freakin good this is the wand there short little bristles it's like an s-curve to it and I don't know what exactly it does but it just makes your lashes wash like huge and so I'm just gonna pop that on to my masca this is going to be my new favorite mascara I didn't think that a drugstore would come out with something like this but they did this is better than high-end mascaras okay so now that we've coated the lashes I'm going to go ahead and pop on some lashes from who a beauty these are these Sasha number 11s these guys right here I'm going to cut them pop them on and then I will be right back so next I'm going to contour my face to contour I'm using the deep honey Tarte clay stick foundation and I'm just going to chisel the cheeks slim the nose I'm going to go real close for this this foundation is a little bit too light for me so it's going to help bronze on my face so that's a good thing [Music] okay and for the blush I'm going to take this NARS liquid blush right here just a little bit goes so long I'm using luster we'll pop that onto my cheeks I feel like it blends in really well with your finger or like a Beauty Blender and this is a really nice Coralie shade so now we are going to do the liquid highlight I'm gonna take the cover FX custom enhancer drop in sunlight pop that home you can use this alone or you can pop a highlight on top and it's going to be extreme and that's what I'm going for so we're gonna make it extreme make sure you don't have any harsh lines where you put your highlight you never to set everything in place I'm going to take my Kat Von D shade + light contour palette this is the refillable one that has like four full taka gene and I refilled it I'm gonna look up to the sky and then I am going to look down okay good look up to the sky again now I'm just going to set everything in place with the powder I haven't been doing this lately but since this is a summer night out kind of a makeup look it's probably hot it's probably dark and I don't want my makeup going anywhere so I'm going to keep it intact with this Kat Von D I'm using a lot of Kat Von D today because I reloaded my stash so I think I'm just really excited that I have a whole bunch of Kat Von D back in my life is just lightly it there all over then I'm going to grab my Estee Lauder bronze goddess whoo I love this freakin bronzer it's amazing it's me and medium deep zero 3 I'm going to take this bronzer right here and I'm going to bronze up my cheeks just a burnt piece of toast I'm gonna use this blush right here it's actually called highlight the truth it's the mineralized skinfinish from Matt I'm only gonna put on a little bit this looks like an intense blush I'm only gonna put on a little bit proceeds to put on the entire compact work that in make it a little bit more blended fill the highlight when you use the Estee Lauder bronze goddess illuminating powder in heatwave this is such a beautiful highlight literally just almost blinded my eyeball that's how good it is pop that onto my cheeks nose the Cupid's bow this is like a golden midnight glow like you're going to be glowing in the dark so now that we are glowing to the gods we can move on to the lips which is the last part of the look that I think I want to go with the new deist one this is a curvy lip liner I'm going to take 9 v 1 which is a satin lip and pop it on my lips and then after that dries I'm going to put on the gloss this is in curvy I'm going to take that and pop it on to the center of the lips thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video don't forget to thumbs it up and let

[Music] waitwhat let me try over again hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be showing you how to get this summer drugstore makeup look right here it is super easy looks great on every skin tone and that's like my goal every time I make a video or create a look I want it to be super easy for you guys to do I want it to look good on all the skin tones and there is this freaking motorcycle just like to be super easy for you guys to do so I think I achieved that with this look it's very girly flirty and fun but it's not like a winged liner or glitter and it's it's not hard at all it's super easy and it's very affordable which I love about this video everything is super affordable it's not like super expensive drugstore it's very affordable drugstore so you guys are gonna love it and if you want to learn how to get this look then don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the QWOP family and without further ado let's get on I'm gonna use this L'Oreal visible lift radiance booster brightening primer 24-hour hydration this is definitely the longest name I have ever seen for a primer let's see if it lifts our face brightens it oh it comes out like this peachy color that's cute you guys ah my face is breaking out so so bad I'm really good at taking off my makeup but one night I didn't do it or just fell asleep and bam Pizza face I thought it would be a little bit thicker because of the way it came out on my hand but it's actually pretty lightweight and it doesn't feel greasy okay we are gonna do a BB cream I have not tried this Rimmel one out before this is the radiance I'm gonna try to put this on with a Beauty Blender so I have my Beauty butter right here I'm just gonna work that all over let's see what this does for the face today oh my goodness well then what I'm using like a rolling motion to do it I mean that'll work a little bit better actually I'm actually gonna take it off because I really don't like the way it looks and it's really weird like you can't pat it and you have to move it around I'm taking this off sometimes there's got to be a point we got to tie yourself it's not gonna work out all right I decided to go with the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte because my skin is looking a little bit crazy my pores are out there my acne he's out there it's all over the place right now so I just need everything to calm down be one smooth looking surface and then we'll add the highlight in little areas that we want to so I am in the shade Sun beige that on my face my face is a little bit lighter than my body so it'll look a little bit different but we're gonna work that into our neck and everything's gonna look do you see how many breakouts I have right now when I have breakouts like this it's best to stick with something that is a little bit more on the medium to full coverage side I love how this blends into your skin it's so easy just go over the eyes redness right there just cover it up and this isn't totally matte it's like a dummy matte finish but it doesn't have those reflective illuminating particles in the foundation so it's okay for skin that is a little bit more broken out so I'm gonna let that sit and dry I'm gonna do my brows put on another layer Foundation and be right back with some concealer before I go into my brows I just want you guys to know what I'm using it's but I feel like I always tell you what I'm using it's this wet and wild it's the same line from like 10 videos already the wet and wild ultimate brow kit it's super cheap I love it it's just like I don't know it's my go-to right now so I'm gonna do my brows off-camera and also this is my new brow brush that I've been loving from dose of colors it's like very super slanted very narrow kind of disappears when you turn it on its side I'm loving the tight bristles on the spoolie so I just did my brows really quick I concealed them underneath just to sharpen them up and if you guys want a brawl tutorial please let me know in the comments I can do that in another video add another layer of foundation and I'm feeling so much better about my skin let's move on to the Panda I area of my face so for that I'm gonna go with the master conceal from Maybelline this is one of my favorite drugstore concealers this is the light/medium shade I'm just gonna use my mini micro Beauty Blender for the under eyes do you see how much coverage this concealer has and it dries really nice this concealer just glides on the skin so smoothly it doesn't settle in the fine lines it just kind of smoothes them out and then for the edges I just take the little round side to smooth everything out this is the matte format 2 by L love this palette and I want to go for a more of a Mavi looking eye this one right here I'm gonna Pat it all over the eyelids like I do just to set all the cleans in place so we don't have patchy areas if you don't have an eyeshadow that isn't pretty much similar to your skin tone then go ahead and use your face powder so the next shade I'm gonna go into are these two right here for my crease they're pretty I know but let's not talk about the nails today these are gonna be my crease color into the socket so I'm going to stay right in there and just go back and forth and these windshield wiper motions back and forth then I'm gonna go ahead and use these circular motions to kind of buff out the color at the edges always want to work towards the brow bone especially if you want more of a lifted I look always work upwards and what I'm doing to the top I'm going to go ahead and do to the lower lash line as well so I'm gonna take a smaller brush this one right here is from Urban Decay this is the moondust e210 brush and I'm just going to take those same two shades and work them on the lower lash line these are the pinky tone shades I'm going to take both of them and work them into lid so right below the crease and just Pat it into the lid I'm gonna take the red and I'm gonna also layer it right below but I still want that kind of like what we did with the crease I still want those to shade to peek through even just patting it down on the lash line would be even better I'm gonna take it all the way I have this other palette from Maybelline I haven't opened it yet it's called the city mini palette downtown sunrise and there's this really pretty color I want to use for the inner corners it's right here and it also has like a brighter shade that I can use on my brow bone so I'm just gonna open that up really quick and I'm going to use that so I'm going to take this flatter brush right here and work it into this shade right here highlight the brow bone with this and it has a soft pink undertone which works fine with this look as it is a a Mavi look and then I'm gonna take a big fluffy brush just to blend everything together and this is the part where you're gonna soften out the look you have any harsh edges if you got you missed the clean fluffy brush will definitely pick those up for you and then for the lower waterline I'm going to take this Remmel Gandil eyes pencil and it's like a nude color it's called nude the lower part of your eye or you just your eye in general such a sensitive area that you can easily get wrinkles around your eyes so try not to tug too hard if you could just press in and do this that would be fine but just try not to tug your eyes too much I personally like using the nude as opposed to the white for the lower lash line I feel like it's white is more awake it gives me more of a Halloween kind of look it's very dramatic and bright but this new just makes it look like you have a healthy waterline it doesn't look red or bright right it's just a nude yes to makes your eyes look bigger if you want to have a bigger eye or if your eyes are a little bit close together having that bright nude color just kind of softens everything out I think I want to brighten up the inner corner so I'm going to take this shade right here for the highlight drugstore mascaras of the year definitely have been this Maybelline Big Shot colossal and also the lash paradise from L'Oreal okay so I just popped on these lashes these are from Lily lashes the Miami style which are not drugstore but I will have them listed in the description bar below so you guys know where to get them so now I'm just gonna set and sculpt my face I'm going to use this pixie X Miriam a kiosk contour palette so I'm gonna go ahead and use the lighter shade to set the under eyes and then to bronze the face I'm gonna go in with this Rimmel matte bronzer and starts to work that on top of the cheekbone around temples and forehead I like this bronzer right here because it gives you like a natural looking tan to sculpt my face I'm going to use the contour shades in here so I'm gonna take these this one right here and just go right on the cheekbone ooh this is a really nice contour color it's like a natural looking color nice job mariya variance light one of my friends here on youtube if you don't know who she is you guys need to check her out she is amazing she's an amazing artist so for the blush I'm gonna go in with this NYX away.we glow illuminating powder this is in crushed rose and dusted on my cheeks for the highlight I saw this I was like oh we have a new highlight to play with it's so exciting this is from Maybelline it's the master chrome metallic highlighter very excited to try this guy out I want to see how it works so I'm gonna use my finger that's very gold and just use it on my nose and the Cupid's bow wow this is intense look at that highlight and it feels like almost like a cream when you run your finger across it this is definitely one of those metallic highlights just like it says right there I don't have any breakouts just put it in places that is going to bring out your skin I make it worse alright so now that we have that all over our face we are going to move on to the lips I'm gonna go ahead and pop on this nude lip liner it's called nude whisper this is from Maybelline and I'm gonna line my lips really quick and then right over its super

let's start class today hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be showing you some eyeshadow do's and don'ts I have all the don'ts on this side obviously and all the do's on this side can you tell I hope so so if you're having some trouble with blending or just eyeshadow in general and brushes don't worry I got you if you do any of these things that I'm saying are wrong don't worry if you're happy with it and keep doing it I'm just giving you suggestions don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and hit that notification bow so you can be part of the pod family and if you want to learn some do's and don'ts on eyeshadow then keep watching the first thing I'm going to talk about is priming your eyes don't not prime your eye so this is going to be my eye that I don't prime it's gonna be bare if I leave it like this there might be some oils on my skin that are going to mix into the eyeshadow and make it just really difficult to blend the eyeshadow is not going to look as vibrant and it's probably not going to last that long on the do side I would suggest you guys to prime your eye now I personally rather use a concealer than a primer but if you want to use a primer I have some suggestions for you guys Pro Longwear Paint Pot in soft ochre from Mac or the Too Faced shadow insurance is also good I prefer to use concealer over shadow bases just because concealers are a little bit more hydrating you already have dry skin it may intensify the flakiness and the dryness and the lines in your face but the ones that I suggested to you are pretty good I just they are a little bit drying for my skin type but I do always use a concealer to prime my eyes and if I'm using a concealer it's usually going to be the one I use under my eyes something that doesn't crease so I use either the Tarte shape tape or the NARS radiant creamy I go back and forth between them if you're looking for a good drugstore I would suggest the Maybelline master conceal this is really really good for concealing and also for priming your eyes I'm going to use a little bit of the Tarte shape tape just use a little dot of it and then just blend it in and I'm working it in with a Beauty Blender and using these bouncing motions is going to make sure that it's going on flawless smooth and your eye shadow is just going to look like nice even canvas and if you need to clean up your brows you can clean those up too after I like to take a face powder or an eyeshadow that's similar to my natural skin tone and what this will do is to set your shadow in place and also fill in any line so it's sitting on top of a smooth surface it's going to help your brush glide onto your eyelid super smooth the next don't is don't start off with a dark shadow in your crease going in with the darker color is going to make it really hard to blend out and it's also going to look very harsh also I'm using this densely-packed brush and I just dug it into the eyeshadow that's only going to make it way harder to blend if you have blending problems already this is just gonna make it worse there's no coming back from this guy do start off with a transition shade that is in the shade range that you're going with I'm going to tap off the excess because you don't want too much product on your brush or any hair so I'll take that hair off in just a second so I'm going to go ahead and use this tapered brush right here and I'm going to use a light hand so I'm going to keep my hand towards the back of the brush and I'm going to use back and forth motions literally just the tip of the brush is gliding on the skin I'm using this tapered brush it's going to make it a lot easier to find the crease and to blend into the crease and you just want to use a little bit at a time you want to start off with a light shade and then gradually get darker so you have that nice gradient you want it to look nice and airy kind of airbrushed and your crease is right above the lid so stay right in there but I really like to use more than one transition shade to get that gradient look I would suggest you use two to three eyeshadows in your crease that I know that might be a lot for you guys but if you really want that nice smooth look this is just something that always works for me start off with this really light shade right here and the next shade I'm taking is smitten I'm going to use the same brush because I'm not going to go back into this one tap off the excess and then I'm going to go into my crease right below the other shade and with very light pressure go back and forth or windshield wiper whichever works best for you and slowly build up that in city the next thing we're going to talk about is adding dimension to your crease we are still in the crease there's a lot that we need to know about the crease so when you add dimension you want to use a darker shade something that is matte so I'm going to go ahead and use the darkest darker I'm going to go ahead and use the darkest Brown in the palette which is sweet so on the don't side I'm going to go in with this big fluffy brush to add dimension to our eye which obviously this is the definite don't you don't want to use something that's too big and fluffy it's just gonna make the product go everywhere rather than getting that precise area so don't go in with a lot of product at once with the wrong brush do go in with a small precision brush that is tapered towards the end so it does give you that precision I like this one for morphe M 507 I like to also use this on my lower lash line so I'm just tapping my brush in the shadow and then I'm also tapping the excess off so I'm starting with just a small amount at a time and I'm holding my brush a little bit closer to the bristle because I want to add a little bit more pressure in a precise area so I'm just going to use these circular motions and kind of go and follow my outer V remember that shadow gets buried down right into the brush so you'll always have enough shadow to work with once you feel like you absolutely have nothing else on your brush then you can add a little bit more at a time it's still patting off the excess you want to slowly add on and not pack on all at once so the next thing we're going to talk about is blending your eyeshadows so after this is all said and done you still want to go back over with a clean blending brush so here are two brushes this one's densely packed in dome-shaped this one the bristles are a little bit more free towards the top you want your blending brushes to always be fluffy and clean so on the don't side I'm going to try to blend this out as best as I can so don't hold the brush too close to the handle this is going to make it really hard to blend and the outcome may seem super hard but you do want to use a fluffy brush hold your brush towards the back of the handle this is going to help your brush lightly glide over your shadow giving it that airbrush effect in making your eye shadow look and blended for the lid I'm going to use a really pretty color this is from makeup geek it's called in the spotlight don't use a fluffy brush to apply your lid color because it's just going to get everywhere especially if it's a shimmer that you want on the lid do use a density pack of shadow brush like this one so you can get the shadow on in the precise area that you want without making it fluff and fly everywhere all over your face so now we're going to highlight our brow bone and on the don't side I'm going to go in with a glittery pressed powder this is from morphe it's the mimosa sunday shade I'm using the right brush but it's just way too much way too glittery and just too much actually some shimmers on the brow bone look really nice if you use them just below the arch side I'm going in with a matte bone color and I'm going to blend it down into the other colors so that it transitions nicely and the whole look is really smooth and if you brought your dark crease color up too high you can always clean it up so now we're going to talk about bouncing out your eye shadow adding something on the lower lash line to redefine that lower lash line don't go in with a super dark shadow on your lower lash line and just keep going lower and lower because it's literally gonna look like you're dragging your eye down and like you haven't gotten sleep in about 10 years do use the transition shade just like we did with the crease we layered on we started off with a light shadow went a slightly darker and darker and darker until you got the intensity that you wanted you basically want to do the same thing with a lower lash line just redefining and balancing out your eye shadow another don't is don't set your face makeup before you do your eye shadow because if you have any mess-ups or want to clean up anything it's gonna be really hard to clean after you have powder and cream powder on top of a cream is basically locking it in place and if you move that around it's it's a messy sight it's a scary sight to see it's not easy to deal with and it's just not fun at all thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if

makeup it's I don't know if it looks like that much makeup it doesn't look like that to me because my skin is still showing through this is one of those weightless natural coverage looking books and it's one of those that are very hydrating my skin feels so good right now it feels very moisturized supple something different you know I like this I like the cake I like the coverage so this is very different for me and I feel like if anybody can do this I really love this look and I think that it's perfect for like the beach or you're going to be out in the Sun all day and it just looks very effortless and healthy and glowing so if you want to learn how to get this look don't forget to hit that notification bell to be a part of the Kwan family subscribe if you haven't subscribed already and without further ado let's get on with this start off with my skin because skin is so so important for any time of the year but especially in the summer you want your skin to stay hydrated and personally my skin is always dry no matter what season it is it's just it's dry so I was really excited to team up with Neutrogena and try the hydro boost line you guys know I love the Neutrogena wipes so when they asked me to do this I was like yes so have the entire line I've been trying it out and I wanted to show you what I'm using I really like how it makes my skin feels it feels really supple and plumped throughout the day I thought it'd be great to to include in a summertime makeup look or if you're going to the beach you're going to be in the Sun day these are just great products to have I've been using the hydraboost hydrating cleansing gel this takes away all the dirt from the day and it still keeps my skin very hydrated in this process of washing the face and then after I wash my face i take my hydro boost hydrating serum it absorbs into the skin super fast and this just helps boost the hydration in your skin and it lasts all day I knew that all the hydration I can get at this point in my life guys this is an intense moisture in your face like it's not a cream it's actually a water gel like it says and it's a very lightweight even though it's a gel and it's super lightweight it sinks into your skin and you can literally feel your skin it works as a cream like the creams are very like thick and heavy you feel like oh yeah it's really seeping into my skin working it's just like that but it doesn't have that thick heavy cream feeling it's just super lightweight I love it so after I do my skincare and everything is ready to go its hydrated it's plump now I feel like I can move on and actually get into the makeup so for the foundation I'm going to be using this Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating tint something that's lightweight that's not going to weigh my skin down so I'm gonna put some of this on and I have the shade buff the foundation comes with like a doe foot applicator and I'm gonna work that on my skin if I wanted to have something that is light weight I would normally just put a bunch of concealer so it can like spread to the rest of my face because my face is kind of uneven so I'm glad that they have something that's lightweight and it will even out the rest of my skin tone I'm just going to blend it in with my Beauty Blender just gonna wet it up a little bit and I'm not going for a full coverage look I just want my skin to look hydrated healthy supple plump fresh you know just all those things I'm going to go ahead and conceal my under eyes I'm going to be using the Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating concealer as well the concealers on the outside and then on the inside it has a moisturizing center if you have those like creases underneath your eyes it's going to help plump them up it's just an amazing little guy I'm just gonna put that underneath my eyes and this is very lightweight just like the foundation it's going to give you a natural looking coverage really amazed the coverages on this concealer and the fact that it's hydrating and this is actually pretty buildable coverage I was a little skeptical about it being buildable at first but I definitely see that you can build up the coverage on the concealer I'm also going to do a little bit of contouring so for that I'm going to be using the Tarte clay stick Foundation and deep bunny I love this for contouring because it just glides on your skin like a dream ooh and I like deep honey because it also kind of gives you lip bronze look [Music] so I just did my brows fill them in really quick super natural very light so now I'm going to move on to the eyes so what I'm going to do is just go over with a powder like something that I'm going to use on the rest of my face and I actually have this new blotting powder from Kat Von D right here I love her packaging it's so cute but this is in shade medium so I'm just going to take that powder I'm just going to dab it right over my eyes my eyelids so that everything is one color and it's set in place and nothing is creasing and then after we have that on our face we're going to go ahead and create that definition into the crease very light and subtle for the crease I'm going to take this brush right here this is from Vasanti I'm actually going to be using the Koko collection for by Kali cosmetics this shade right here it's just a bronzer this is her face palette and I'm going to see how much definition this is going to give me in the crease I kind of feel like it's going to be light just go back and forth when she'll wiper motions I'm going to do the same thing on the other eye and take flipper from colour-pop this is one of their super shock shadows it is so so gorgeous and I just can't wait to dig my hand in there it looks like this up close it's so pretty and I'm going to pop that onto my lid like so just pressing it onto my lid because I don't want this to go everywhere I want it to be pretty precise in that spot I'm actually going to mix in one by one I'm going to just pop it on to the center and see what that looks like oh that is really pretty I am almost done with the eyes but I want to add just a little bit more dimension into the crease I'm taking this little tart Pro glow to go I'm just going to take the chisel color right here and I'm going to pop out onto my crease just to really intensify the contour I do want to add like a little bit of a highlight to my brow bone just like I'm Matt I'm going to take this shade right here from my Kat Von D palette again you don't have to do this if you don't want to just leave it the way it is I just want a little bit more of a clean look for me I just feel like it make the colors just blend a little bit easier I love doing this to my brow bone and then for the eyeliner I'm going to take this is you a slim cream eyeliner in matte Brown I like it because the tip of this eyeliner it comes to a sharp point which works really well when you want to do like a little wing I'm actually going to just apply it normally and then smoke it out with a brush and then I'm also going to go back and forth with a little smudger brush this smudger brush that I'm going to be using is from the makeup shop this is the t2 brush and see that really harsh line right there I'm just going to smudge it back and forth to soften it up I'm going to go back in with a smudger brush and just work it back and forth so now I'm going to move on to the mascara I'm going to be using this mascara right here it's a new one from Mac it's a collaboration with Steve J and yoni P I just think that the packaging is so adorable this is my favorite shade of pink this light pastel think it's so pretty so let's try out the mascara see how this works here okay so now that my eyes are prepped with mascara I'm going to pop on some lashes you don't have to put lashes on if this is too much for you on a day out and Sun and you just don't want to worry about them I get it I just think it completes the look and I personally love lashes I just got these in from time Los Angeles these are Luna and then these are called it's ball so pretty in PC which I love those types of lashes because it still shows the work you did it still shines through so that's why I kind of like those um actually yeah I'm gonna go with its bomb so just gonna take these lashes off of this little guy okay so now I'm gonna do the lower lash line so I'm going to go in with that bronze from the Coco collection and this smudger brush we used on the lash line earlier and that just gives a little bit more depth to the lower lash line okay so that is pretty much it for the eyes I'm gonna put on this guy right here this is the hoola do the dew from benefit it's their liquid bronzer actually my lips are getting really dry unintel I'm going to put on this Neutrogena hydraboost hydrating lip treatment it goes on so smooth it feels it doesn't feel greasy on your face and that's what I like about a lot of these products it's not like a greasy feeling even though it's very moisturizing and hydrating and I feel like this helps with the texture it just smoothes out your lips completely if I don't feel like wearing anything on my lips or if you're going to the beach you don't feel like doing anything else on the lips you just want your lips to be hydrated this is perfect to wear alone it's also good to use as a primer okay so now I'm going to move on to the rest of the face I'm gonna go ahead and take the benefit do the dew hula liquid bronzer and put some on the back of my hand put some right here and I'm just gonna use my finger gonna help everything look a lot more natural and flawless for the cheek color I'm going to add this the Mac ex Steve J and yoni P collection this is a lip and cheek color I'm gonna use this

cheeks my cheekbone and this is the Moorthy M 510 brush these guys are wondering and actually I'm going to mix in a root Beverly Hills and I'm going to bring it around the warhead again is a shape that if you already have oily skin you don't have to you can skip your nose and your cheese zone area um I personally like the way it looks on the nose on the tip of the nose on the bridge and also I'm going to pop that on to the inner corner so that just think it looks really pretty I'm gonna take this brushes the morphe y22 brush pop it into both of those shades because they look really good together with a clean brush and just make sure that everything is blended moving on to the lips I'm going to go ahead and take this Neutrogena hydraboost hydrating lip shine and this is in the shade

[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I am going to be filming this look right here I created this using everything that was new at the drugstore literally today I went to the drugstore and bought a bunch of new makeup have my CVS bag right here and I just went in I just went and bought everything that was new and this is what I created with it I really like it I was shook on some of the products that were really really good and let me just tell you right now there's just so many things in here that I was really excited about that really works some things don't work as well as others but if you want to learn how to get this look keep watching and don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit the notification bell so you can be updated as soon as the video comes out me and my notification quad quad just for Haitian squad we are very tight I'm not that cool so without further ado let's get on with the tutorial I've already primed my face I'm gonna jump into the foundation I saw this foundation floating around on YouTube and I also walked into CVS today and I saw that this was like one of the main new things that they had so I was like ok you know I have to try it you know I love my full coverage foundation I'm a full coverage girl so I picked this one up especially because it says 24 hours really but does it really work though this is in the color Sunday JH 308 and even though the bottle looks really dark it's not really that dark all the tubes look really really dark and it's so funny this actually looks like a concealer like a oversized concealer when it comes out it looks kind of like a whipped foundation almost oh it feels very thick honestly thick and creamy let's put this on the face I'm gonna put what I have my fingers on my face oh yeah this is gonna be full coverage I can already feel it I'm just going to do it with my finger old-fashioned way look at that what in the world that is a really nice full coverage I wrap it around my eyelid so we can cover that redness up and you see the difference though it doesn't feel like a lot of makeup though like when I feel it with my finger it feels like it's pretty thick and heavy but when I put it on and blend it in it doesn't feel like anything you guys my skin is so so so dry right now every hydration that I have that I own face cream under-eye cream neck cream night cream during the day it's a little insane because my skin is super dry right now it's ridiculous I definitely have to say that I love the coverage of this and I like that it has like that airy whipped feel to it okay I would definitely repurchase this this is a good one you guys I got a request from my last video a subscriber for my last video had said to please do my brows on camera and I promised her that I would do them on camera so I'm gonna stick to that promise and I'm going to use the NYX micro brow pencil in the shade espresso and we are gonna do our brows on carefully this is a really big mirror yes elf look how huge that mirror is so what I'm gonna do first is start at the bottom of my brow because I want to map out the shape okay that is very very light and I actually cannot do my brows with this color so I'm gonna have to stop when I go find a drugstore brow pencil that I do have and I will be right back okay so I try to look for a different brow pencil and I couldn't find one that is drugstore in my eyebrow color so I'm gonna have to do my brows off-camera with a different eyebrow pencil and then I'll be back with my brows I'm so sorry for not doing them on camera like I promised but I will do them on camera next time for you okay I am back with my brow oh my god my hair looks ridiculous so now we're going to move on to the eye shadow and the eye shadow that I have today the eye shadow palette is this one right here and this is the new one from Maybelline the 24k news I definitely want to start off with this matte nude I'm kind of really happy that they have this in here like every eyeshadow palette should have this nice yellow tone nude matte in it because you want to make sure that everything is even it looks like one even skin tone I'm going to take this morphe y 15 brush we're gonna hack that nude shade on to our eyes I'm going to take this all the way up to the brow bone just so that everything looks nice and even your eyeshadow is just going to look a lot better it's gonna blend easier it looks gonna look a lot smoother I think what I'm going to do is a halo look here I'm going to start off with this matte Brown and I'm going to work that on the inner and outer parts of my eyelid because we only have one Brown and it's dark I'm going to take a very light hand because I want it I want to start off with a soft color so I'm going to take this right here I'm just going to start right on the outer part of my eye I'm just gonna sweep the shadow edges over towards the center like that I am gonna stop there and I'm going to pick the color that I want to be in the center of my lid I'm going to go with this shade right here on the center of the lid I'm going to go into the dark brown and use just a little bit of a heavier hand and work out on the inner and outer part of the lid and I'm just going to keep building that up until I have the intensity that I want I'm just patting the shadow down and then I'm sweeping it over towards the center so I'm just buffing out the edges so that it blends like that so it makes a little gradient effect and then what I'm going to do is just bring it over straight through the crease the parts that look harsh what I'm doing and I just want to like really explain it as best as I can to you guys so that when you do it you're doing the same hand motions the same pressure that's what I feel like really makes you better at doing makeup is the pressure that you use and the way that you're working your hand the way that you flick your wrist it sounds crazy but it really makes a difference between someone who is just putting on eye shadow so now I'm going to blend out that harsh edge and how I'm going to do that is by using a flicking motion and either clean off your brush with like a napkin you can like scrub it or I just cleaned it on my pants because yellow or you can use a clean brush if you want if you have a clean brush that's pretty much the same um what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a soft flicking motions and I'm going to flick my brush out just where the edges are and that's how you're going to get a really soft easy blend so now it's blurred out there's no harsh edge and it looks a lot nicer anywhere that I see an edge I'm just going to do that soft pressure short flicking motions I want to deepen up the edges a little bit more so I'm going to add some of that black color in there with the same brush just Pat it on there and then blend it out with that clean side okay so on my brow bone I'm going to use that nude shade we used earlier and this is one of the morphe brushes that I hate that I'm using is this so pretty but I'm just going to use it because that's what's next to me and I don't feel like getting up easy problems I'm going to pop into that brown shade we used earlier and I'm gonna work it along the lower part of the lash line so I'm just sweeping it across into the inner corners and then when I get to the edge I'm going to use circular motions to buff in that color I actually want to layer this purple right on top of that the brown and black I think it would look really pretty so I'm going to take this purple right here with this brush that we've been using on the lower lash line and I'm just going to work later that right on top to give it a different look I feel like having a purple hue would be really pretty for this look just bring it around the entire crease all the way to the inner corner so it looks like that it looks really pretty actually so I'm going to go ahead and line my waterline with this Milani supreme Kohl Kajal black eyeliner line up the waterline so now I'm going to line the upper lash line and to do that I'm use the Wet n Wild mega line and I actually don't want to create a wing with this look so I'm just going to leave it right there and I just want it to be more smoky and smudgy King than anything so I'm just deepening the the lashline so that my lashes look saying I was walking through the aisle looking for new drugstore stuff I saw this and I was like ooh the spiky ball at the end really caught my eye and then just the way the wand looks so I really wanted to try it from covergirl it's called soul ashy the wand looks like this in real life I'm not gonna lie to you guys cuz you guys know I have favorite mascaras it just wasn't like as Wow as I thought it was gonna be obviously this is a lot darker than this lash cuz it has nothing on it but I just was hoping for like a BAM effect I like it for the bottom lashes would I repurchase this probably not I actually just got these in from ardell these are their new faux mink lashes I don't feel like I'm gonna need two sets of these actually went out and finally got my favorite lash glue this is the duo brush on strip lash adhesive the best loss glue ever I'm gonna go ahead and stick these two lashes together and then I'm going to pop them on to my eyelashes okay the next new thing that I found at the drugstore is this L'Oreal concealing in contour kit it's the infallible total cover so it looks like this inside it has a little sponge I'm going to go ahead and work my concealer brush into this shade right here and I'm going to create that v-shape so I just basically mixed my brush into these two guys so this is a color that works a little bit better for my skintone I was actually worried that they'd be too dark so this is a good thing the sponge really helps with smoothing out the edges so I'm just going to use a sponge okay to contour I'm going to take that shade in the palette and I'm going to use this side of my brush and just go down the side of my nose this is a shade that I feel like you should use as a bronzer because look how orangie it is so um we're gonna just do what we can with it because I'm gonna stick to using all drugstore foundations all drugstore makeup okay so the next item I'm going to use is to set my under eyes this is the wet and wild a mega glow contouring I'm going to take this shade just to go over the parts that we did with the cream contour and then I'm going to take this one the shade right here just to and set all the areas that I highlighted and concealed in place going to tap the product where I wanted so I want to intensify the nose a little bit more I did the nose that I was like okay you know I'm going to go ahead and set everything before I do that on the rest of the face I'm going to go ahead and Pat that on just below so I'm going to take the contour powder and I'm gonna go right on top of that contour that I did earlier and then start to brush it upwards I'm going to use the L'Oreal infallible pinks super vibrant color is going to take that peachy shade sweeping it right back into the hairline I almost forgot the highlight I'm going to use the the palette that I've been using this entire time for the mirror I'm use this elf palette right here it's called the illuminating palette has four different highlighters in here I'm going to use this guy right here you know what why not just use all of them [Music] for the lips I'm going to take this Milani color statement lipliner right here it's a nude lip liner in the shade 0-4 I'm going to use this new Maybelline nude lipstick this is the naked coral matte so it looks like this very pretty and I'm going to use that on my lips today it smells really good and this is a very

[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today is one of the most exciting videos I have ever done on my channel and I've never had to do this many interest today I'm revealing my cosmetic line domini cosmetics so weird to say domine cosmetics latte palette I have giving you sneak peeks for awhile now and it is finally here are you ready tada this is my baby as you guys know I'm a mom Jaden is my son this is my second child dominique cosmetics and then the palette i am shaking right now by the way here is the palettes dominate a lot a palette i have worked so hard on both of these guys the front the back everything is all my creation i will go into more of it a little bit but first i want to announce something for you guys i have a special gift i'm giving away 5 latte palettes along with a $100 gift card to go along with it so that you can get anything you need to create a full look with the palette and all you have to do is follow dominique cosmetics instagram I will have it right here for you guys to follow and also be sure to sign up for the website so you're the first to know when the palette pre-launch is it actually pre launches on the 24th but you will be the first to know exactly when it's out and ready to go alright so now that I have announced that to you guys I am going to go into lot a palette itself and I'm gonna try not to get emotional because this is my baby literally we've been working on her for about a year and a half and we're here at this moment right now oh my gosh I don't even know where to start I'm gonna start with what it looks like this is the sleeve such a unique coppery rose gold it's super sleek it's like a brushed foil with the DC on it which is my logo and dominique cosmetics on the back it has a lot a palette with the colors behind it the ingredients and all my handles for dominique cosmetics and then we are going to open it up it's a white palette but it's super easy to clean that's one of the things I was thinking when I was making it it's white I want it to be very Instagram well something like an accessory but at the same time I want it to be easy to clean as I have dirtied it so many times and it cleans like a dream this is the back I was actually inspired by this gorgeous pillow it had like these different textures on it but it was basically like a geometric pillow and it looked really cool and that's what really inspired the palette itself and the broken lines around it this is like a dream like I can't I don't even the words in my head are like scrambling but I'm just in all of this moment right now so if I sound out of breath it's just because I'm super excited and nervous at the same time I worked really hard on this palette and I'm so so excited and happy to bring it to you as you guys know I started off with an eyeliner brush to create fuller lips uh-huh so I've talked about that video before and now I'm here with my own cosmetic line with my own palette that I've put all of my heart in tears I literally cried and threw things about this palette to get it to where it is today so it does mean everything to me and my career has basically led up to this moment so it's kind of like it's kind of scary and exciting to talk about the same time because you want everything to come out right let's open it up you can see what the inside looks like this is the inside of the palette has a really nice fit protector for your shadows you have a large mirror that you can see my camera in the pan sizes of the shadows I purposely made them a little bit larger than normal because I wanted you to get as much product as possible and at the same time somebody that's on the go I want them to be able to dip their powder brush in there as you can see there's like a banana shade the vanilla cream is a yellow undertone and you'll see how I use it in this video and actually set your concealer and brighten your eye all of these shades are very buttery and creamy but they're also buildable it's something that's gonna start off soft and then you can layer it to a very vibrant pigmented color I wanted these shadows to be very easy to work with no matter where your skill is I know there's some people out there that don't know how to work with extremely pigmented shadows so I made sure that these shadows are buildable to a very high pigment but you can start off soft the color payoff is amazing and I'm going to show you that while I'm talking about the shadows you use all of the pallet except for about three colors so I'm going to show you double shot double shot is a matte purple with a red undertone the next color is creme brulee this is a foil shadow the foils are so creamy they glide on your skin like butter and there's very pigmented actually creme brulee was made to match the outside of the palette this foil color was actually pretty hard to get because this isn't like a very common rose gold kind of coppery foil so I wanted to create a color that is very similar to this because I just wanted to put this all over my eye espresso is a cool tone brown with these gold shimmers going straight through the color it's just one of the most beautiful colors this and I'll show you how the other colors swatch throughout the video as I use them this is the perfect size you can throw it in your purse you can use it for different parts of your face so the price point for this palette is $42 this is a luxe formula and there are crushed real crushed pearls in the foils you're getting a nice pan size a beautiful accessory for yourself I wanted most of the shades to be matte so you can have really detailed dimension in your eye if you wanted someone to tell you how latte palette came about my mom loves coffee as much as I do and she always made this girl time for us where we drink coffee and we talked and they we'd always have flavored coffee that was I couldn't have coffee without flavor also basically not coffee as I grew up that became part of my routine I shared it with you guys on snapchat and began to share it with you all the time so much that mean you guys had a bond through our morning coffee I would get snaps from you guys in your coffee mugs and it just became something that really brought us together and I love lattes lattes a beautiful name I love the foam on top of the latte and I just thought that this would be perfect it goes perfectly with the warmth of the shadows the feel of the palette the look of the palette and that's how the latte palette came about if you want to know more about the palette I will talk about it throughout the video if you want to learn how to get this look right here and more about the latte palettes and don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you could be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video I'm so excited to film this video I don't even know where to start here we go I already did my brows so that they can be ready for somebody even out my skin I already put on primer so I just found this in my last video this is a really good foundation instead of using my hand I've been using this more recently just like a little mixing plate so I don't have to get my hands full of foundation like I normally do I'm just gonna take my moist Beauty but oh that's I don't like that word damp Beauty Blender and work that into my skin it looks lighter right now but it definitely oxidizes just a bit down to my exact skin tone and this is the shade 23 peach so I'm gonna go ahead and prime my eyes with you tart shape tip concealer in light medium here's my Beauty Blender and work that in to my eye so I have a nice even smooth base to work on so I'm gonna go ahead and get into the eyes this is a really exciting moment for me I am going to be using for the first time on camera a latte palette here we go so the first color I'm gonna start off with is vanilla creams it has a warm yellow undertone it's really buttery and creamy and just glides on the eye so beautifully I specifically created this shade for dullness around the eye to brighten up any type of dullness that you have you can even set your under-eye concealer with this it's kind of like that banana shade but an eyeshadow form and I want to give thanks to my mom for this shadow because I was born with super dark under-eye circles it's just hereditary for me and my family and I was kind of teased about it in school so I was so tired of it and my mom had this yellow concealer actually she didn't know that I grabbed it but I grabbed it I put it on and went to school I felt a whole lot better about my face that day and everybody's like oh wow your eyes look really good today and that was kind of like my first step into this world of makeup and really loving and embracing what makeup can do for you inside outside and I was color correcting and I didn't even realize that was color correcting and I love yellow for dullness and darkness around the eyes so thanks mom for your concealer because now I have it as an eye shadow it gives you such a bright beautiful fresh youthful look I have seven matte shades so that you can get a lot of dimension and you can create a lot of different looks with this shadows I don't know if you guys notice that in my videos I like to have a wide selection of transition shades so I made sure that I had enough of those transition shades in the palette so I'm gonna take caramel which is the lightest transition shade in the palette and it is truly a warm smooth caramel color and I wish it smelled like caramel but I didn't want to irritate anybody's skin or somebody just doesn't like the smell so for my first palette I was like you know what I'm just gonna put it on the note card so when you get it you still get that full effect but it's just not embedded in the shadows so I'm gonna take caramel and pop that on to my crease and this is just going to add a soft subtle definition what I wanted to create with these shadows is a buildable type of formula this shadow is going to really build up so you can start kind of soft in your crease and then build up the shadows so I'm just gonna work that all into the crease and I'm gonna extend it to the end of the brow bone for the next transition shade I'm going to take pumpkin spice every time I say one of the shadows I get giddy I don't know I just get like this it's a weird feeling I just get really like ahh so I'm gonna take pumpkin spice and work that in the crease as well so I'm gonna have a nice warm crease but I'm gonna keep this towards the center going back to the brow it's almost like the shadows are related to each other because they complement each other so well they just melt into one another and that's kind of what I wanted for you guys to create really easy on your own without even thinking about it so you can see caramel and then you have pumpkin spice it's so easy for them to transition into one another I'm gonna blend this out but I don't want to go all the way to the inner corner with this and just build up that crease for the third crease color I'm going to take hazelnut hazelnut is a coffee that I'm drinking right now it's such a pretty Ferrero Rocher I don't know it just makes me think of that in an eyeshadow form I'm actually gonna take a hazelnut and work it on the outer V of the eye and extend it all the way towards the end of the brow colors just blend so easy into one another it's like butter so my camera shut off and I already have this drama happening on this ice so I want to amp up the drama and the eye look so I'm gonna take mocha which is a beautiful matte chocolatey Brown it can take you from a daytime to a nighttime dramatic look so without being black and I'm just gonna focus that on the outer V like right on the end and the brush that I'm using is the morphe M 507 and I like it because you can start off soft and you can definitely end up very bold and dramatic with any of these eyeshadows you can start off soft and can go really bold while I was making these I wanted like the most pigmented shadow and as I was working with the chemist and formulating the shadows I realized that if you have too much pigment then it won't blend and it kind of sticks and it's just a balancing act I've learned so much with formulating these shadows so I made sure that they were buildable a lot goes into making a cosmetic line it takes a long time to get what you want when I was testing the shadows out I would always test without any concealer or any primer on my skin and then I would test with primer and I made sure that no matter what if you have a primer or you don't you're still gonna get a nice payoff without it be crazy where you can't move it around and not everybody can use shadows that are super intensely pigmented so I wanted it to be a formula for every and anyone and I wanted to make it super easy to follow the colors coordinate and you really can't go wrong with any color you use together in the palette so I put a lot of work into the color scheme and I went back and forth on the Browns the mocha actually almost turned black but looked brown so it's it's a real balancing act getting these shadows to perform it look as good as they do in the pan because you can put it on your eye and it's black or it's a different color or it doesn't blend so it's it takes it takes a lot and it takes a lot of research and learning this is something that I've always wanted to do this is like a new journey in my life that I've always wanted but never thought that I could really do until now very fortunate that I'm able to do this and really put my heart and soul into this formula into these colors designing it naming it really put my everything and I hope you guys love it because um it means a lot to me now I'm gonna go ahead and pop on one of the foils which are so beautiful I can't even begin to tell you how beautiful these foils are they are made with real crushed pearls and I just I feel like I got to show you because it's so so freakin good well I'm trying to figure out do I want creme brulee macchiato or espresso I'm gonna go with macchiato for the inner part of my eye you could even leave it like this it's so pretty but I'm gonna go ahead and pop on a foil whoo I can't believe I'm using a foil I'm using a foil on camera okay so I'm gonna take macchiato which is a beautiful champagne color with soft gold flecks going throughout the shadow I just when I see this I just take a breath like it's beautiful I went back and forth on so many variations of these three foil colors it's insane I actually changed one of them last minute which is creme brulee to match the the outside packaging and that is a beautiful color as well it's more of the rose gold but I'm gonna go ahead and take macchiato and work this on the inner half and I had my friends try them that came over to my house and they were so excited for them they wanted to use them as highlights and I was like oh maybe later but this is what they are now and if you want that Instagram highlight you can definitely use it and bring that down to the inner corner to highlight the inner corner as well I just want to use all of the foils on my eyes I have more tutorials coming but you're gonna see so many different looks that I'm gonna create with this I cannot wait to show you but this is just one of the many looks that you can do take a wing liner brush some fix+ wet my brush up and dip it into a macchiato and I'm gonna create a wing with macchiato for the lashes I'm gonna use my ikonics because those are not thieves just wait 30 to 40 minutes I mean 30 to 40 seconds and then pop them on so while I'm doing this I'll go ahead and put on concealer for concealer I'm going to use the Tarte shape tape just put that on so we don't have any crazy dark circles while my concealer is still kind of wet I'll go ahead and grab a translucent powder pop it on right before it dries I feel like it sets it it brightens it but there's a really small window of time where you get the most out of your powder in your Beauty Blender you can see life so don't underneath my eye really look up to the heavens and pack it on I'm gonna let that sit on my face for a second I'm gonna go in to hazelnut and work that on the lower lash line first I'm just gonna do a little bit halfway you can go all the way in for the lower lash line I'm gonna use hold Bru I absolutely love cold-brew it's a deep turquoise kind of color and it's just the perfect mix of blue and green together and you can use it all over your eye you can use it on the lower lash line like I am for just a pop of color I think you're going to die for cold-brew you were going to love cold Bruce so much this will definitely be a lot of your guys's favorite color I can feel it because when I was making it I just kept like I kept taking this deep breath because it's such a beautiful color so is double shot if you're going for a soft eye shadow liner kind of look cold-brew as a liner is beautiful I'm gonna pop back into caramel so I'm gonna blend this through the edge of cold-brew I just want to thank my mom's painting that she gave me because it inspired this color I actually have it right here I'm gonna show you guys I was so inspired by these tones of blue for cold brew that I was like okay we have to make this happen and our eyes are done oh my gosh I love this looks so much it's so easy for everybody to do the pops of color perfect I purposely made the shadows a little bit larger than normal so you can easily fit a face brush in the shadow and really use it as a multi-purpose palette and I just want to use this whole palette all over my face but you can easily set a face brush in here and pop it in and it's gonna fit easily without getting into the other colors I wanted this to truly be a mult something multi-purpose so in case you don't have your bronzer or you can't set your under eyes you have your eyeshadow palette and it can do all those things for you I'm gonna contour with my Natasha - Nonna palette right here and this is in medium I'm actually gonna use vanilla cream to highlight the center and right across I'm gonna use vanilla cream on my under eyes to show you how balm vanilla cream is for the under eye comfortably putting it into vanilla cream and it just brightens everything up it is such a multi-purpose palette you guys are going to love this palette and it is $42 but you are getting so much product so I'm going to use it right in here and I like to use it right around the corners of my mouth to where it's kind of dark for the highlight I'm actually gonna use macchiato I'm gonna start off with hover from Mac and then I'm gonna take the Y asal lipstick in number seven this little guy right here I don't know if you guys can see it but I'm actually shaking because I'm I'm done creating a look with my palette in the reveal and I just I'm

[Music] you can cover up tattoos with this look oh my god I can't even make sense hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be doing this everyday fall and natural makeup look right here I feel like there's so many bold looks going around right now and especially with the autumn season but I wanted to throw something in there that's a little bit more natural and everyday that you can wear in between the Halloween costumes and the bold lips and the bold eyes something that's more wearable I just decided to mix it up a little bit and add a cool tone book on my eyes and then I added the kylie lip the new kylie lip in autumn I mixed it with a little bit of the new Kylie liquid lip in Libra and I created this look right here I think it's very fresh and full and beautiful and somebody can wear this like every single day yes purple is not natural lashes are not natural but they are minor you can take little pieces from here customize it to your own look let me know how it works out for you tag me on your pictures and comment below if you decide to do something like this isn't that make me really happy but anyways if you want to learn how to get this look don't forget to subscribe to my channel and you hit that notification about so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with this video okay just drop my makeup off I'm gonna use my brow pencil from Anastasia this is the brow Wiz in dark brown I'm just gonna fill them in just following the natural shape this is something that this is like a brow that I would do every day on a normal basis I like them looking a little bit more natural these days so like when it comes to right underneath the brow I just make sure that there's no harsh line right underneath there just that looks more effortlessly natural to star you gotta sneeze lately I like to leave a little bit of space in between my brows it just gives it this undone imperfect look that I loved before primer I'm going to use the Laura Mercier foundation primer right here a hydrating primer you know how I feel about hydrating primers I love them oh my god this is like putting on a hydrating face cream more so than a primer I like the thickness of this primer it's not too thick it's just enough to where your if you feel like your your skin is quenched like your skin is drinking a glass of water and right on my t-zone I'm gonna take the Porefessional from benefit to help fill in those pores those large pores this is actually a birthmark that I have you can see this professional oh my gosh look at it blurs all the pores out g-way just came out with a new foundation it's this one right here it's the essential high coverage cream foundation it has hyaluronic acid in it also it dries matte and it's supposed to be oil-free so it's good for you guys out there who have oily skin but it's supposed to be lightweight enough so you don't feel like you're your pores are being clogged and you can't breathe just because my skin is really dry I like to make sure that it looks as hydrated and plump as possible and nothing settles into the fine lines this is supposed to be very lightweight so let's see how this works on our skin today on my skin today this is the shade latte so I'm gonna take that on the back of my hand and I'm gonna mix in almond with it just just a tad bit lighter so that might be a little bit too dark for me I'm gonna put in a little bit more of the almond shade and mix that into my skin immediately it covered up everything just like a cake a foundation I'm not in a bad way just covered up all of the imperfections so quickly so you probably don't eat as much as I put on my hand it covered up my veins you can cover up tattoos with this my green veins are gone that is crazy I'm gonna work this down into my neck so everything matches make sure you get underneath your choker you don't look like your heads disconnected wow this is definitely full coverage foundation it doesn't feel thick at all which is cool but it's intense the only thing about foundations that dry matte that I've noticed recently on my skin is that they settle in to my pores and little tiny lines and so when I do wear these types of foundations I won't set it I don't care if I go about my day and it kind of wears off there at the day if I'm about myself I don't mind that I'm still studying my under-eye I'm not setting the entire face because I will look like a extreme cake face I feel like you don't need very many layers of this foundation once it's on your skin it's it does the job pretty quick I'm just gonna use my foundation as a base make sure there's no lines I want to use the new Kiley purple eyeshadow kit that one's called the Chi shadow kit I want to use this it's so beautiful and it has those like everyday fall looking colors I'm gonna go ahead and take stone which is this color right here I'm gonna grab it with my Luxy brush this is the Luxy 231 small tapered blending brush so I wanted to create something that we can do every day it doesn't have to be super bold go ahead and blend this out in my crease I really like this as a crease color and an option for somebody who doesn't like to put a ton of eyeshadow on every day as their everyday look is just taking an eyeshadow color and just washing it on your lid up into the crease you can use a brush you can use your finger whatever you think works best for you and you don't have to always do like a crease color and a lid color that's not something that is always easy for everyone and everybody has their little routines for an everyday look so mine just happens to be all these steps because I really love makeup and I like taking my time with it and I like to play around with creating dimension and deaths and on my face so that's why I go into the crease and the lid and the outer crease I'm gonna take this purple right here it's the shade turning violet right here and I'm gonna focus that on the outer part of the crease and I'm gonna take this purple right here this is wine and dine and I'm gonna use the same brush and hit the outer edges with it just come in a little further and I want to keep the lid space pretty open just because that's what gives this look more of a natural effect or more of an everyday kind of wearable look rather than putting it all over the lid this is pretty much all the eyeshadow I'm gonna use on my eye so I'm gonna go right underneath the lash line with this right on the outer corners someone to take these lashes right here from a lily lashes these are goddess she has some of my favorite all-time lashes and these are one of my everyday natural go-to eyelashes so I'm gonna get the L'Oreal voluminous lash paradise and a mystic black and just start to worked out on the tips of my lashes my real lashes I won't go all the way and just because I don't feel like it really needs it all the way in there and then you might accidentally get some on your eyelid and you don't want that so I'm gonna go and just touch on the very tips of my natural lashes so take these guys now our lashes are on it feels so much better with lashes week I'm also gonna take this is you a slim cream eyeliner in matte nude I'm just gonna run that right in my inner waterline because I've been so tired I feel like my eyes are red and the key looking looking using a nude pencil on that waterline will make them look writer more awake and just look like you have a healthy-looking eye overall concealer I'm using today is from Urban Decay it's The Naked skin concealer in a light neutral down here I like a little bit with it I always like my concealers to be a little bit lighter than the rest of my face just because it adds a little bit more dimension for the rest of the face I'm just gonna contour with the benefit hoola kwikki contour stick and just go right here I feel like this is a very natural looking contour and I don't want anything crazy looking for an everyday look so I'm just gonna do a quick and then what's next so I'm gonna put on this bronzer from Too Faced it's a cream bronzer it's called toasted peach and I'm gonna work this in with my finger and lately I just have been loving creams for an everyday kind of look I just feel like it looks more natural the highlight that I'm gonna be using is from benefit this is the Watts up highlights more like a cream to powder so I'm just gonna pop it on my cheeks so this is a really natural highlight it's more of a wearable everyday kind of highlight it's not blinding but when you like move to this side you can kind of see that your face has a little bit of a glow to it going to set my under eyes once everything kind of dries down a little bit more I'm

[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be showing you how to get this easy spring orange lip makeup look that looks beautiful on any skin tone and that's one of the reasons why I love this look so much especially the lip I am obsessed and dying over this lip it's absolutely stunning I'm super excited for this video because I've teamed up with me to technology for the make up plus app which is an amazing app where you can actually get upload a picture of yourself with no makeup on and then put a makeup filter over that you can try different lip colors eye shadows it's so so fun also really love that the app is showing that you can get ultra glam and you can try any look that you can imagine and it's okay because makeup is fun makeup is an art and it's a way we express ourselves I feel like it's so much of makeup shaming is still out there it's online it's in person body shaming makeup shaming it's it's out there and it's time for us to stick together and lift each other up I really love that this app is donating to the women empowerment organizations when someone uploads an Instagram photo with the hashtag she unites and it uses the she unites filter over their face it shows that you can be bold and beautiful and you can want to try it any look that you want you'll confident and beautiful in this makeup and that's all that matters so I want to share with you guys this look right here that I've created for spring and it's beautiful universally beautiful on every skin tone I hope you guys enjoy this video and listen so for the foundation I'm going to be using this Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation stick it's super easy to apply I know it's super full coverage it makes my skin look really good and it's so quick so this is my go-to for when I need a really nice full coverage and it's quick so I'm just putting that all over my face and no specific order just get it on there and then down my neck so we don't look like our head is detached from our bodies take this is the Sigma 3 day sponge which I really like and I've been using a lot lately to bake and to for foundation concealer everything I will have the link in the description in case you guys are wondering where to get it and going to go ahead and start working that into my skin just using patting motions we are going inside the shirt guys I'm going to take light 2.5 Cannell and just conceal my under eyes and this is the NARS creamy radiant concealer let me go ahead and do my eye shadow for the eye shadow I'm going to be using the Too Faced peanut butter honey palette it's so cute Too Faced always kills it with a sense they're amazing I want to eat the package I just want to eat this what some may go wrong angles let some Tyee I freaking love this scent of this palette the colors are really nice I feel like I use these colors probably probably every single day so the first color that I'm going to pick up is this book the first color my pick up is creamed honey this shade right here I'm going to put that all over the lid the next color I'm going to pick up is peanut butter this color right here and I'm going to use a Lexi 231 brush to pick that up and work this in the crease like so just using short circular motions so as I'm working it out to the brow bone I'm going to bring it in to the out part of the lashline super close to the lashline just really working it in there washing it through the crease I want the color to focus on the outer part of the crease I want to leave the lid portion nice and bright the next color I'm going to pick up is feeling nutty so I'm going to take the same brush pop into that color and just start to work that into the same area but we want to get it low enough so that that peanut butter shade peeks through so I'm going to work that color into the crease all the way to the outer part of the lash line kind of creating this v-shape right here but you still want peanut butter to show through so try to keep it pretty low so that you form that gradient I'm gonna pick up honey brittle and we'll work that into the crease as well a lot of different colors going on in our crease trust me the subtle hints of different shades make a huge difference in the end when you're working with eyeshadow so I'm going to take honey brittle and I'm going to start to work that through the creases well now I'm going into the darkest shade in the palette which is going nuts and I'm going to take that into the crease really close to the crease so right in there this is where you're really going to show your the definition in your eyes I'm grabbing a concealer and I'm just going to clean the brow bone up and brighten it up a bit as well and work that into the other shades I'm gonna pick up this mascara right here from Maybelline's is the colossal Big Shot and I'm just gonna coat my lashes for falsies on this look to be about the lashes and the lips this lash always does this to me it always stands out never works with me it's always like this I am very this is the reason why I'm very tempted to get my lashes permed like curled up because this little guy right here I don't want to take them out as I'm scared these are nice oh my god these are so so pretty so I'm just gonna put these lashes on really quick and I will be right back so for the lower lash line I'm going to take this luck c-141 mini round brush and I'm going to pick up that honey brittle shade really pretty peachy orange shade I'm going to work that on the lower lash line and then I'm going to go in with feeling and nutty and just go right on top of that orange shade and then with a clean brush I'm just going to sweep through there make sure every edge is softened and I'm working it upwards so that it connects with the crease when you sweep up like this it just gives your eye the illusion that it's a little bit more lifted so if you just sweep your eyeshadow upwards and then towards your brow bone I'm going to take this black liner from math it's called a graphic black and I'm just going to line the upper I'm going to tightline right in here I never can get used to tight lining my eyes it always tickles so bad it makes my eyes water we're going to try to do this really fast here we go okay that wasn't too bad I have these individual lashes from blink and I think I'm going to put them on my lower lash line I'm just going to see how it looks that looks cute I think I'm going to keep going with the lower lashes I'm just putting them in the sparse areas sitting them up I'm just popping on about four lashes and then we are gonna let them get tacky and sit for a little bit all right so I popped on all of the lower lashes they are super PC and flared out which I really like I'm gonna take that going nuts shade and smudge it very close to the lower lash line just to fill in those little gaps I think this guy right here is going to be too much so I'm going to take her out take both of them out we're no longer needed so I'm just going to go over with a black liner and I have this black liner here from Kat Von D just going to go over the glue to cover it up just for a little bit of a brighter pop I'm going to go ahead and take these knees this is actually a pretty vibrant orange color I'm just going to work it on the lower lash line I'm just going to dab it right back and forth on the lower lash line and then blend it out with our big fluffy brush I'm going to take a little bit of this amazing gorgeous color from Stila I love love love these have been playing with these so much they're called the Magnificent metals glitter and glow liquid eyeshadows literally like goddess heaven in a bottle it's so so gorgeous let me just tell you how gorgeous it is I'm going to take that on this brush right here and just brush it into the inner corners now I'm going to work on the rest of my face I'm gonna start off with contouring I used my Y 5:05 this is kind of like my handy dandy contour it's like my go-to it's the one of the ultra HD foundations and what I do is just take it right on the cheekbone like that on both sides and right down the nose [Music] and then with my Sigma F 6-1 brush I just smooth everything out now I'm going to set my under eyes with the shade and light contour palette taking these two shades right here and I'm just going to set my under eyes and pop them right underneath my eyes to set everything in place this kind of brightens them up just a tad bit more so that's why I kind of like kind of love this palette because these two shades are perfect for my under eyes and then I'll just hit around my mouth just to brighten it up a little bit just to get pretty dark in that area even though I've contoured my nose I go back over it with the powder contour and I'll just go down my nose like that kind of intensify this shape brush the contour down the sides of brush the contour down the sides of the nose actually I'm going to go in with this NARS a liquid blush in lustre I like that this is more of a warm tone corley shade it fits the look perfectly they blend really nicely into the skin BAM blush and I like that it took a little bit on the warm side so it gives us more of a tan look for the bronzer to add some really nice bronze warmth to our face I'm going to go in with this bronzer it's called valises looks like so to warm up the face now I'm going to go over it with this color pop Candyman highlight then I'm going to go over the top with this Oprah highlight and Rodeo Drive now my highlight mustache is poppin and for the star of the show I'm going to take max more inge this really vibrant orange color and pop it on to the lid this is the final look I hope you guys enjoyed the makeup tutorial now I'm going

[Music] sometimes you may think you're going for natural way but your makeup tells you otherwise hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be using all of my go-to drugstore favorites to create this makeup look right here I was actually looking for I was wanting to do something with a brown lip because I found this really pretty lip from Maybelline and I once I was like looking up inspo and then I saw this picture of Kylie and she had her lip was way darker than mine but I was inspired by Kylie's look she had like a gold lid very simple and I thought it was really pretty so if I was going to the drugstore these are all of my go-to products that I would use so I hope you guys enjoyed this video it's nothing of the drugstore brows concealer foundation everything except for the lashes so if you want to see how I got this look right here don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with the video starting off with my brows I'm gonna be using the Loreal brow stylist definer in the shade dark brunette very thin pencil I'm gonna go in and do my brows first before I put on any foundation because it's gonna stick to my skin a little bit easier so I'm really just gonna go with the natural shape for my brow I have pretty thin brows so I'm just gonna leave it like that and move on to the rest of my face I'm gonna be using the new maybelline superstay full coverage foundation and this is in the shade warm nude I actually used this in a video coming up really soon and I'm in that video I'm using it for the first time but in this video I've already used it but you're gonna see this video first so if that confuses you my bad this is a very matte foundation work it into my skin whoa now one thing about this foundation is that it is a very matte foundation it doesn't make it feel like a dried-up raisin but it does give you that powdery matte finish so for me I would go over this after I'm done with my foundation then I'll go over with in spritz and fix plus or some type of hydrating mist this foundation is for oily skin you don't need very much of this foundation because it is extremely full coverage it will cover everything now I'm just gonna use some concealer so you can prime the eyes and cover these under-eye circles in darkness around my face so I'm gonna take the l'oreal which I'm literally just opening up right now the L'Oreal total cover I'm gonna go ahead and use my finger in them lightest to shade for my under eyes and right just around the entire eye I'm actually going to any bet right now so I figured why not film a video on the makeup that I'm gonna do it's clean up the brows I'm gonna use a brush so I'm gonna take that color in with this makeup Shakti 58 brush okay I'm gonna grab this Tarte blush but I'm just using the mirror I'm not using the blush so I'm just gonna go in and clean it up this is a thicker kind of concealer perfect for cleaning up the brows making sharp defined lines on the face I normally set my eyes with powder but especially with this cream you definitely need to set your eyes I'm gonna take this Gigi Hadid eye contour palette right here it's so cute it's all mattes inside looks like that I'm gonna take this shade right here it's kind of like a nudie beige I'm gonna take that all over the lid so I'm gonna take a flat brush just gonna load up my brush in that little section and I'm gonna pop it all over the lid so we have a nice base this is actually a lot darker than what I thought it was gonna be softening out the edges this is actually a really nice color it's a little darker than what I was expecting but that's okay I'm gonna go into the crease with this guy and this one just gonna mix them together take both of those colors right on the lower lash line and now I'm just picking up that Brown and working that into the outer part of the eye like the outer V area and then I'm going to take this beautiful deep warm gold right here looks like this it's really really pretty and these shadows I'm telling you are like butter yeah if you took your finger and swiped it across the butter and that's what these shadows feel like that for sure the best feeling shadows in the drugstore right now for the inner corners I'm going to take this lighter shade of gold it's more of a pale champagne and I'm gonna pop got into the inner corners this is just gonna bring light to this area and make our eyes look more wide awake bright now I'm gonna do a wing for the wing I'm gonna be using the l'oreal voluminous it's very sharp that's why I like it I like it a lot and I'm going to start my wing off right out here I'm gonna give my eyes more of the lifted look so I'm gonna angle it upwards and bring it down I like going this way cuz it glides against the skin a little bit easier [Music] for the lashes I want them to look very curled and spaced out but full so I'm gonna go with these guys right here from violet boss these are the wispy myname eyelashes and I'm just gonna pop this on really quick I just find it a little bit easier sometimes to put the lashes on first and then mush them together with mascara sometimes you may think you're going for a natural way but your makeup tells you otherwise I'm just gonna add a little pop of gold on the lower lash line so I'm going to take this Maybelline a lasting drama light liner in the shade star light gold I'm gonna add a little bit more concealer I'm using the Loreal infallible glow this concealer is actually a nice pair with this foundation because it adds a little bit of luminosity and moisture back into the face so now I'm gonna set my under eye gonna be using the Maybelline fit me fair lights setting powder with my damp at Beauty Blender I'm gonna go into the powder and go right underneath the eyes right into here well that's baking I'm gonna go ahead and contour my face with this Maybelline and master bronze bronze in highlight kit I'm gonna use that shade to contour my cheekbones I'm gonna go right underneath the hollow just having that loose powder sitting there kind of helps everything move very smoothly over the skin so if you're doing your blush or you're doing your contour it's just gonna help the other powders glide into the skin a lot easier and just make it look a lot more natural and I'm gonna just kick off the powder really quick and really focus on bronzing up the face to bronze my face I'm gonna use this middle shade right here and I'm gonna do bronzer instead of blush today's keep it pretty simple and just warm up the face and then for the highlight I'm gonna use the new master chrome metallic highlighter from Maybelline in the shade molten rose gold I know it looks really pink here but it's actually a beautiful rose gold it doesn't just look pink okay for the lip I'm really excited about it I'm gonna be using this shade right here it's called Amazonian very cool it goes on like a gloss but then it dries matte so it's nice good - okay there's another one that looks just like it it's in this tube it's called fighter and it's dark it's a darker shade but the tube looks lighter take fighter right on top that was the wrong color it's just a tad bit darker [Music] thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did go ahead and give me a thumbs up also before I let you go I want you to listen to yourself listen to your gut what is it what does it tell you to do now at this point in your life that's what you need to be listening to ignore

Aquarius is out there I am gonna be doing this really pretty pink glowing makeup look right here perfect for date night Valentine's Day it's very romantic and sultry but soft at the same time I love the way this came out I cannot wait to show you and I want to say a big thank you to Neutrogena for partnering up with me on this video using their hydro boost line which is so good so so good I can't wait to show you how I got this look and if you want to learn how to get it don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification box you can be a part of a quad family and without further ado let's get into this TV so I just woke up it's early in the morning and I my skin it looks so sleepy and dull right now so before I get started I'm gonna put on this hydro boost vitamin multivitamin booster from Neutrogena it's supposed to brighten the skin energize it it has hyaluronic acid in it so it's going to hydrate the skin really well so this guy is what I'm putting on first to wake up my dullness entire looking face so I'm gonna put it on my hand like this this is serum and I'm just gonna work it into my face I feel so hydrated and I usually do this if I'm doing sometimes I'll use the Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser it's actually a habit here at the gentle cleansing lotion for sensitive skin this is a really good drugstore option and Neutrogena has some amazing skin care products I was raised with Neutrogena my mom loves Neutrogena this is the first skincare brand that I have ever learned about I can always rely on teachers units super inexpensive very effective on the skin so I am definitely an original lover so I'm just gonna work a little bit more in on to my forehead make sure my all of my face the sir on it and you can feel the plump in your skin instantly you can just feel like so hydrated after the serum this is great if you have dry skin I have dry skin so this works really good on my skin if you have dry skin like me oh my god this feels so good do you see it feels so hydrated definitely transforms my skin to feeling from like super dry to super supple so if you have dry skin like me definitely pick up one of these guys because it is going to be a skin as a life saver my skin is prepped I'm gonna go straight into foundation for something more like soft and natural but still has a nice coverage is the NARS natural radiant long wear foundation this is one of my favorites amongst a bunch of my other favorite foundations but this one looks the most natural it feels really good on the skin and it covers like crazy this is Patagonia and then since I have a little bit of a tan going on which you can't see because I'm almost like in a turtleneck I'm gonna mix Barcelona in there as well it's a little bit darker not tanning I'm just Patagonia see it this is definitely a full coverage foundation it doesn't look or feel like one doesn't get cakey isn't getting to the fine line so that's why I'm seeing it's really good for like a date night kind of makeup it just makes your skin look really soft and flawless see you like it covers all the imperfections but it doesn't look dry it doesn't look thick or cakey it just looks really actually looks kind of nice and dewy a little but not like crazy wet looking I am loving this foundation I just forgot how much I loved it actually for the eyes I'm gonna prep them with this concealer from Maya sell I'm really excited actually to use this palette it's so pretty and I just love everything that two-face comes out with I get so excited about it cuz usually smells good and stuff so this is the white peach palette look at the packaging it's so pretty I love the packaging has little peaches on the closure this is the palette how pretty oh my gosh as soon as I saw this palette I was like yes I'm going to do something with Valentine's Day I'm gonna use these colors right in here so the first color I'm using is peach cream I'm gonna take creme delle peach and pop that all over the lid and then for the outer part of the eye I'm going to take peach sorbet so I'm gonna take both of those colors on a blending brush so I'm gonna work them on the outer part of the crease kind of going into the outer part of the lid I'm just these circular motions right here if you want to a distinct line you can always take some tape I'm just gonna put that right there I wanted to have a nice strong structure to it but I want to use soft colors so I'm gonna use the tape as my barrier so I don't go further than that but I'm gonna just work in those colors right in this spot with a very soft circular motion the next color were picking up is sweet fig and I'm just going to take that on the outer part of the crease and then for the very outer corner I'm going to take on the grill and doing this is just gonna make the look a little bit more sultry but it's very soft and romantic at the same time the color is the darkest color in the palette is actually very soft and it just works so well with all the she's the inner corners of the eye I'm gonna go in with some concealer okay so now that we have concealer on in the inner half I'm gonna take glistening peach which is this beautiful golden pink color right here that's like an iridescent and gold kind of look to it it's so so pretty I'm gonna take that on a flat brush and I'm just gonna pop that on a right on top of that inner corner that we concealed just go back in with on the grill and just and then right underneath the brow bone I'm gonna take peach cream okay so I'm gonna add a wing really quickly with the tardis and double tape [Music] okay so now we're going into the lashes we feel like they're so important for a Valentine's Day look because this is what's gonna make your look super flirty so I have these lashes here I'm trying to figure out which one I want less saline is a very expensive brand for lashes and letting you guys know now but their lashes are very very pretty these are the Shanti lashes lash style and while that dries move on to the lower lash line just pop on a little bit of shadow I think I'm gonna take sweet fig and work that on the lower lash line and then a little bit of on the grill right on top of the lash line this truly gives you like instantly a smoky kind of look and you don't even have to really try to smoke it out too much it just damn smoky and lashes should be dry right now so I'm gonna pick them up and pop them on really quick so I'm gonna contour my face not meeting the Kat Von D shade + light contour palette for blush I'm going to use the issue a blush right here it's so pretty love the packaging and this is the blush I'm using it's called blood door and just work it on the cheeks I think it's a really nice contrast to the pink and I'm gonna skip on the bronze or today so it kind of acts as that as well and I'm gonna take it right up above the hairline right along the hairline right in here as close as you can because that's what makes it look most natural when you put it right inside of that hairline and then for the highlight I'm going to use the color pop it in Newton nude and oh and new window I'm gonna take the middle shade called on the loose just as gold highlight right here I'm gonna use my finger for the nose because it's such a tiny little spot I'm gonna go right there right across [Music] so I'm going to take this new liquid lip from NARS I don't know the name of it it's like a very difficult name to pronounce for me so I'm just going to take this it's like a nude it's just a nude lip it's called lip cuff lip cover

hair don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bells to give you a part of the quad family and without further ado we're gonna get on okay before we get into the hair I'm gonna do the makeup first so starting off with this SPF rx ultra clear daily skin hydrator it has an SPF of 50 which is awesome and is great for the summertime you meet your skin needs that protection to stay young beautiful gorgeous and flawless this is actually from this month's glam bag I'm gonna be using a few of these glam bag products in this video today so you'll notice that some of them are like this tiny like this guy it's because they're from the glam bag this season my bag right here I've never used this before but it sounds pretty good and supposed to help with redness and calming this skin which is awesome because my skin is always a little irritated a little red actually it's a less red today which is awesome and I think it looks pretty good today it's really important to hydrate your skin if you don't have an SPF to put on if it's in your makeup that works too you just want to make sure your skin is protected before you get out into the Sun and start sweating everything else off except for your makeup because we have this video today alright so let's get into the foundation the foundation that I'm choosing to use today is from decay this is the all-nighter waterproof long wear liquid foundation just wanna make sure I got the name right I had a burp sorry this is in the shade six and this one I know for sure isn't going to come off of your face this will stay all day this is a more full coverage foundation if you are in the Sun and you want your skin to breathe I would go for a BB or CC cream you guys know my favorite one comment below if you know if I'm going for a glam look or if I just want my skin to look extra flawless I'll go ahead and use this guy right here because it is waterproof just in case I taste some by a pool and I have water splashing everywhere or I'm by the beach and I'm taking pictures for you know Instagram or something then we want our skin to look super flawless so this is the guy for you if you were wanting to look extra flawless on this sunny hot sweaty days sounds gross I'm gonna go ahead and pop this onto my skin my hand is basically my pallet I use it for everything so I'm gonna keep my Beauty Blender which is down down there on the side in a makeup bag I'll be right back have my Beauty Blender right here it looks dirty but honestly it is a little dirty so I'm gonna go ahead and pop this onto my face you don't eat a lot with this because it is a full coverage foundation it's easily gonna cover any and everything on your face so don't go crazy with it I sometimes have the tendency to go overboard with my foundations because the inner cake inside a few dabs right on the cheeks on the chin and right on the forehead and I'm just gonna dab it into my skin I always tell you guys if you want the most coverage out of your product make sure to use very light patting motions but with this I really don't care for the coverage I just want it to last all day so I'm going to go in and beat the face just like this actually works as a concealer too because it's so thick and full coverage you can use it to cancel out the redness in your eyes you can use it to cover those dark circles if you don't want to go over with a concealer because this thing is very very pigmented see how red my eyes are I don't know why I guess it's hereditary and go ahead and bring it up in here I usually bring it into my hair I wouldn't suggest you do try to avoid the hair it's a mistake that I always do with this foundation like I said you can skip the concealer and use this as a concealer contemplating keeping that even look rather than the bright under eyes so I'm going to add a little bit more to my hand and just dab it right under my eyes and because I want more coverage under my eyes this is where I'm going to use a lighter hand so I'm barely patting it into my face so I can get the most out of the foundation for the brows I'm going to use my precisely my brow pencil from benefit it is in the shade number three and I'm gonna go a little bit lighter today just because I feel like I have been going very dark lately I kind of want to try something different so I'm gonna go ahead and comb through the brows just in case I have any foundation in them which I know I do cuz look at this gray okay I just want to see what shape we can create with this well darken up the tail ends of the brow after we're done I'm just gonna follow the natural growth of my hair so right in this direction this is a really nice pencil if you want to get into a precise area of your brow and create those sharp lines or those hair like strokes because it is so tiny and narrow so I'm gonna go in with shade number four this is the goof proof brow pencil this one's better at getting through the entire brow hair if you want more of a narrow stroke you can also flip it on this side and it has a more narrow point to it okay the eye shadow look that I'm gonna go for today is very simple I'm gonna take this palette right here this is from kg Beauty it's called the mermaid palette and I'm gonna take this one shade they have it in this palette that is so gorgeous it's this one right here this is Sienna now first I'm gonna start at the crease and you are going to notice this is very orange but I like it so I'm going to go back and forth and windshield wiper motions kind of using a heavier hand towards the outer part of the eye I'm also going to bring it down on it to the I'm gonna top it in there really close to the base of the lashes so you don't have that gap there the next color for the crease that I'm using is this guy right here this is from Luna by Luna cosmetics this is the shade Jace and it's one of those natural colored shadows that are going to give you the definition that natural definition that you need in the crease if you put it next to your face you're going to think that it's not going to do much for you but it does so much with helping create that gradient on your eye and just making everything look smooth and transition very nicely this is supposed to be one of those long lasting formulas and it also is supposed to be very pigmented let's try this guy out and see how pigmented it is and I'm gonna work that right into the crease just going right back and forth and windshield wiper motions and yes it is very pigmented this is gonna help give you that warm unique rosy undertone that I want to create on my eye today I'm gonna go back and forth into this guy and then I'm gonna pick up more of the Sienna and mesh those together so they could be married and live happily ever after so I'm loving this sunset happening on my eye right now I'm gonna go ahead and take this Makeup Forever aqua XL color paint in the shade 142 or I forty two so I'm gonna take it on my palate aka the back of my hand so it looks like this comes in like a little lip balm to has a nice metallic bronze look to it I'm gonna use my finger to dab a little bit on to the center of the lid I want the eye to have that little bit of shine in the center but I don't want it to go overboard and take over the entire lid now it really looks like the Sun is setting on my eyes where the liner I'm gonna go in with this scone liner right here this is from Scone cosmetics this is the insanely intense tattooed waterproof eyeliner in jet black I'm gonna use this to create that wing on our eye that's sexy cat eye it has a felt tip applicator on it for me these guys are easier to apply that wing oh it's very black very intense exactly what it says right and same and as I get closer to the inner corner the dinner liner is going to get you guys that eyeliner is so good I definitely will be using it again it is very pigmented I'm gonna take that eye shadow that we used earlier in the crease pop that on to the lower lash line just to add some dimension there now I'm gonna go into my waterline with this gold pencil right here this is from beauty for real the eye line 24/7 eyeliner in 24 karat and this is also waterproof so it's going to last on your eyes especially in the waterline I feel like it's so important to have a waterproof pencil okay so I'm loving the pop of gold that's happening on my eyes right now I'm gonna go into the mascara to really bring out the look so this next mascara is also something that is sweat proof water-resistant it's the deuce a Mac / volumizer mascara in black this is a mascara that's supposed to be very creamy buildable and long-lasting as well okay so I'm just gonna pop on some lashes and I'm gonna use these House of lashes lashes and noir fairy light okay so I'm running really low on my lash glue and I found this one the huda beauty lash glue fast drying waterproof flash adhesive the lashes are on I'm gonna move on with setting everything in place and the way I like to set things in place is by adding powder so I add powder and a little bit of setting spray and I'm done take these two shades right here pop them underneath my eyes and then start to set my under eyes so now I'm gonna use the contours in this palette I'm gonna go in with this shade right here terracotta so I'm gonna go into desert Paulo out this cheekbone so we have a nice sharp cheek and in case you had too many cheeseburgers go ahead and carve out that jawline and right underneath your chin I don't know if you guys know this but if you don't know if you're eating bad or not just look at your double chin it will always tell you all the back and foods go here I get that very often so I'm have to contour my jawline right here and right underneath my chin for the bronzer I'm going to use this Tarte Amazonian clay matte waterproof bronzer in Park Avenue princess and pop that onto my cheeks anywhere that I want to look more bronzy and glowy but a different kind of glow where the blush I'm gonna go in with this the balm cosmetics balm Springs along wearing blush in the shade bomb Springs so this is a really nice earth rose tone blush that complements a lot of different skin tones and it lasts all day and just work that onto my cheeks so we can have a nice healthy natural-looking flesh of color I'm gonna go for something simple and sexy I'm going to go for a gloss today this is from the Santi it is the power all's lip gloss in supermom and I'm just gonna put this on my lips it's made with natural oils so it's gonna help hydrate your lips and heal them if they're cracked or sore okay so that is it for the makeup I'm gonna move on to the hair cuz the hair is loose looking kind of crazy I'm gonna show you how I style my new lob section it off I have my little clip with me right here I'm just gonna clip it up so I have this right here this is the belt one of the Bellamy tools and straighten with it and you can also do small curls with it and what I like to do first is make sure that everything is nice and straight and there's no parts flipping outwards like a duck so what I'll do is go to the longer pieces in the front and I'll start waving the hair by bringing it around like this I'll hold it up count to like five seconds because this gets really hot and just just bring it through slightly like that and let it go you get this little bitty curl in your hair at the very top and I just take it around the entire head and I'll do this I don't like doing them all the same way so if I curl it away from my face on the next piece I'll curl towards my face try not to burn yourself it gives your hair more volume definition texture my hair is very dark so I need all the texture that I can get I'm going to take down another section if you want a bigger curl you can also just hold it like this and wrap it around your head which is what I'm going to do for the back of the hair I'm gonna start teasing the rest of my hair comb give this guy up a little bit just to fluff it up just soft little motions with your brush and then I'm gonna go right underneath it and create that lift the more lifts the better I like when my hair has a lot of volume so I don't lose what I've already done I'm just gonna clip this part and let down some hair that I want to work with and this is basically the top of my hair but I have a little bit too much going on so I'm gonna pick up this piece right here so I'm gonna use the entire barrel and I'm gonna curl away from my face leaving this whole piece out right here because I don't want it to be curled now that we have these guys curled I'm gonna add some volume to them by brushing them up there I'm gonna take it right underneath just curl it away now I'm going to do is take the straightener and go through the pieces make sure none of them are sticking out words I want all the ends to be straight so go ahead and spray some texturizing spray this is the way texturizing hairspray and I'll just go through fluff the hair up take little pieces I really love this hairstyle it's super easy it's messy you don't have to be too perfect with it which is great for my skills I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you guys for watching if you liked it don't forget to thumbs up this video I also have some other videos over to the side so you guys can

[Music] Budda Budda hey guys welcome back to my channel and if you are new to my channel I've actually never done this part before but we're gonna try it today my name is Kristen domine and this is my little home on YouTube right here I'm gonna be showing you how to get this very cozy warm look that I have on my face perfect for the holidays that are coming up when you want to look glam with the fam and take pictures you know they're gonna be posting it on Facebook grandma aunt mom everybody's gonna be posting your pictures on Facebook so you want to look good this is a really really pretty look I think I'm actually gonna be wearing this by going down to Houston to visit my family next week and so I'm super excited and I will probably be wearing this look right here super easy to do by the way anybody can do it it looks like you're ready to eat a turkey and some stuffing and maybe my mom's broccoli and cheese casserole I'm so excited for that anyways before we get into the video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with this video why I'm going to start off with my eyes are into my brows prime my face did all that stuff and leave the foundation for a little bit later I'm gonna put on the NARS Cannell this is light 2.75 so I'm gonna start with that first and just use that as a primer actually since we're here I'm just gonna go ahead and conceal under the eyes I've never really done this before but I am concealing before foundation we're gonna break my own rules today because I usually don't like doing this before foundation because I like to have an even base first and then fill in the spots that need a little extra help but today you know what we're changing it up it doesn't look as scary as it did before I'm gonna go ahead and use this this is the new morphe dare to create 39a palette looks like this it is very large and it has all these shadows in it a lot of Browns greens so I'm just gonna take a blending brush a crease color for me starting in the crease just makes everything look a little bit better the canvas and sunder mix these two guys together they're gonna be friends now and pop that into the crease this is gonna be our transition shade this is perfect for a smoky eye the fizz is a first step into a beautiful smoky eye for the lid color I'm gonna go in with a flat shader brush I like using flat shader brush because they apply a lot more pigment at one time and it's flat so it's gonna cover more space at one time so what I'm gonna do is take mm let's see we got a big selection here this shade right here this is cut crease all the way down through the inner corner work it up a little higher bring it down to the end of the lid then you can go back and forth in these little wiggling motions just to make sure it's really blended into the skin I make sure you get really close to the lash line so that you don't have any skin showing right through here I'm gonna be careful with how high I bring it up because if you bring it up too high it could look like a messy eye somebody just hit me in the face kind of I I have this transition shade blending brush right here on hand so that I can soften all the edges as I go up and this is gonna tell me if I'm going too high I can kind of gauge how high I want this to go I'll have only one technique that I do for my for my crease I don't just go back and forth like this I don't just go in circles like that sometimes I do a little bit of in-between so I'll go back and forth circles you know just find what works for you and find where you're comfortable with holding your brush you'll notice when you play with your brush a little bit more and your eyeshadow you'll notice that your eyeshadows gonna come out a little bit softer and cleaner with different ways that you hold your hand and the different pressure you play with your brush you just have to play around with it but this is called mass you can see as we go darker it's very gradual the darkest shade will be at the very bottom of the lid so the next brown I'm gonna take is this one right at the bottom this one right here and this is gonna go on the very bottom of the lash this is a dark brown smokey eye so you really want to make sure we coat that lid like a smaller brush to blend the edges out because you can see they look crazy I'm gonna blend those out and these short little circular motions I might go back and forth with this too so what I'm gonna do is just a little bit of a lighter shade right up here and this is my Kat Von D it's just a refillable pan for the Kat Von D shade and light palette this is lyric it's that yellow kind of undertone Oh messy crazy hair back there I'm gonna take that right along the brow bone this is gonna really make the brow shape pop as well as that whole eye shadow look it's gonna look really nice and put together now I'm just gonna add a wing to this look and I will have everything listed below that I use in this video today so you guys can get the exact look that I'm doing these are the hooda boot Budda Budda these are the huda beauty fair lashes these are one of my favorite lashes alright my lashes are on now I'm gonna work on the lower lash line I'm just gonna go in to this shade right here and I'm gonna work that right on the lower lash line take it all the way in and I'm just gonna do a light wash of this color right under the lower lash line add some mascara I'm gonna take a batter up from the balm it's a long wearing eye shadow stick in the shade moonshot I'm going to pop that on the lower lash and you can either leave this bear at a nude I'm adding this because I don't want my eyes to look too closed off so I'm gonna just open them up a bit for the foundation I'm gonna take the Velvet Matte skin tint from NARS this is in the shade grown grown lend light 3 yeah you guys can you read that for me so little goes a long way I'm just gonna take that dot it around it says skin tint but to me this is more like a full coverage foundation and it has an SPF of 30 which is awesome and then I'm just going to conceal my under eyes with the NARS radiant creamy concealer in Cannell light 2.5 and it really just worked make sure you don't cover up that lower lash line which is why I kind of like doing this after I do my concealer but since we started at first we're double concealing this bronze are right here and start to warm up my face and then to contour I'm going to take the Natasha Turner net contour sculpting powder and then with the rest of my face I'm gonna keep it very natural and warm it's already warm from all the bronzer so now I'm going to take this peach perfect from Too Faced the setting powder and actually the setting powder is pretty amazing it gets rid of any fine lines underneath your eyes so this stuff is awesome and it smells so good ahead and use my Beauty Blender the Beauty Blender I used to apply my entire face so it's kind of damp which kind of works out for us I'm gonna look all the way up to the heavens so that we don't get any creasing under our eyes and just Pat it in there like that I'm gonna go in with cork from Mac right here this guy and I'm aligned my lip really quick without talking and then I'm gonna go over the lip with the NARS above it lip glide in the shade strip for the highlight I'm gonna go with Ofra it's the nikkietutorials glow goals highlighter it is beautiful pop it on the cheekbone right there nose [Music] thank you guys for watching I hope

[Music] hello yes guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to show you how to give this a neutral cut crease right here it is something that I haven't done on my channel so I wanted to do something a little different but something that you can still wear out in the day or just everyday colors I like the bold precise lines I think it looks really cool I hope you enjoyed this video and don't forget to subscribe to my channel I get the notification bell so you can be one of the first people in my comments because I am in my comments in the first 30 minutes to an hour I'm just sitting there replying back to you guys and reading all your comments if you want to be part of that squad well go ahead and hit the notification bell and if you want to learn how to get this look then keep watching so I'm going to start off with primer I'm going to be using this one here from glossier it's pour it's a priming moisturizer this is what I'm going to do to prep my face for foundation okay my eyes are starting to water so this is not the kind that you want to get in your eye fYI my eyes are watering right now oh do not get that in your eyes you guys this burns oh now that my eyes are dry I'm gonna put on some foundation so I'm just going to do a light layer foundation so that my skin looks even I'm using the Estee Lauder Double Wear this is my favorite full coverage foundation right now I'm in tawny and I'm gonna try the the makeup drop this is a silicone sponge I don't know if I use this side or this side hmmm this side feels a little bit more tacky so I'm just going to go with the front oh good night baby come here give me a hug okay so I have it on my sponge and we are going to work it into our face I'm gonna put little dots all around and then we'll work it in I'm gonna Pat it in I wish it didn't have this like edge on it because it kind of bugs my eyes a little bit the only thing is it won't soak up the excess foundation so it's literally putting all the foundation on your face mmm I don't know I don't know if I honestly probably wouldn't go back to using this just because I don't know I don't know how I feel about it it makes like a weird smacking noise I mean it works I just feel like I want to use my Beauty Blender to soak up the excess so I'm just gonna do that really quick to use this every day I don't know if I would do that because it's not it isn't I mean I guess I'm not comfortable with it but I mean I would still have to go over it with a Beauty Blender so I don't know maybe for Instagram videos for fun I'll use it is that something I would probably use everyday my brows really quick off camera I'm gonna go ahead and take this Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate bar palette using these shades and this one right here I'm going to start off with nougat take this morphe ma5 21 brush pick up some of this coconut cream shade I'm going to pop it all over the lid just so we don't get any creasing it's smooth everything out and set the the cream with this powder and everything's just going to look a little bit more vibrant and just pop out a little bit more and it also will go on a lot smoother so I'm going to put it all the way up into the brow bone can you tell I've been playing with my brow shape lately I've been doing like different brow shapes and it gets fun to like change up your brow shade now we're going to get into the crease for the crease I'm gonna use this one this is the M morphe M a 506 brush take some of this shade right here nougat it's going to go ahead and work it into the crease this is going to be our first transition shade these are the next clichéd I'm going to go in with is moose it's the shade right here work that as a second crease color and the shade right here is just a notch up from the first crease shade we used it's still very subtle but it's working your way to a really nice dimensional crease okay so now I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next color I'm going to use this one here it's called peanut butter start to work that into the crease as well okay so the next shade I'm going to take is truffled this shade right here that's the deepest Brown in the palette and I'm just going to work it through the crease I'm going to flick it out and if you're having a hard time creating the shape you want with your fluff with your brush don't worry we're going to cut the crease so nice and create the exact shape we want with the next step that we do it's like it'll never fail you if you want a nice sharp cut crease with a wing it's gonna look so good every time you do it deepening on the crease you can even add a black in there if you want it super defined I'm gonna go in with a little bit of a fluffier brush this is the morphe 518 and I'm just going to soften up the edges okay I'm going to use this brush here from the makeup shock it's the t2 brush and I'm gonna take this same shade truffled but on a more densely packed tight brush so it just gives us more pigment and I'm going to go ahead and start to line my crease out with it so you just lays down more product so it gives it a darker look flip it on the clean side and then flick the color upwards so that it kind of blends in with the other shades we have going on and I'm going to leave the crease like this it looks kind of messy but no worries because this trick is going to be amazing so I'm going to do is take this concealer right here medium one custard from the soft matte concealers and I'm taking the Mac 242 concealer brush I'm going to carve out my crease with the concealer brush kind of like your brows we're going to carve out the crease so I'm just going to start here and slowly kind of create the crease if you don't have one you can create it or just follow your natural crease [Music] it looks a little messy at first but it ends up really really nice I promise [Music] and that is basically how I cut my crease and it's like your concealer does everything for you and it's a perfectly cut crease you want a yellow undertone and this palette doesn't have what I'm looking for so I'm going to take my tartlet palette take the shadow right here this is free spirit and I'm going to pop on this shade with a Mac to 239 set this cream in place now I'm going to create a wing right here I'm going to use my Sigma wicked gel eyeliner just a black gel liner and then this winged liner brush I used to actually use this Sigma yo six brush to do my brows it's actually a really good brush to do your brows with but ever since I found blink I'm just like hooked right now and then to clean up the liner I'm going to take I'm going to dip my brush into the concealer pot and just clean it up so it's nice and sharp and then I'm gonna put on some mascara and use this one right here I've been using it for like all my videos lately I'm just going to coat my lashes and then pop on some lashes oh by the way you guys I went over the black eye line the gel liner with this black shadow from the palette it's called licorice and I just like layered it on top so it looks super dark now I'm gonna put on some lashes these lashes right here from violet Voss I started to take it off but then I was like wait let me show them what it looks like so looks like this there's some like long and short pieces it's like really PC it's really pretty I want it that way that's a really long name for eyelashes but I'm gonna go ahead and pop these on and I will be right back so I decided to clean up the brow bone and I completely forgot I wasn't filming after I put on my lashes I just basically made my brow a little bit thicker and then I went in with the same concealer actually this is light 2.5 creme brulee okay so that's pretty much it for the eyes I'm going to go ahead and do the rest of my face put on some concealer underneath my eyes actually I'll just put it all over the areas that I'm highlighting actually I just put it all over my days basically I am doing the messiest contour right now I don't know why cutting my cheeks I'm gonna go ahead and blend my contour with my Beauty Blender I'm going to go ahead and set my under eyes so I'm going to take the Kat Von D shade and light palette and I'm going to use these two colors right here work it outwards towards the temple I'm going to take this powder right here from coverfx pop it underneath my under eyes so I'll let that sit there and then I'm going to do my lower lash line everything that we did to the crease we're going to do to the lower lash line and just run it down the lower lash line so I'm just going to go ahead and remove the excess powder now if your bronzer lately I've been using the Estee Lauder and that's like the Victoria Beckham Estee Lauder bronzer and I don't know I just love this shade of this bronzer and I feel like it just gives you a really nice glow it's also matte and we'll work this bronzer on my cheeks and just doing circular motions going back and forth and sweeping it into the hairline and then I'm going to bring it up across the temple and then for blush I'm going to use this one right here this is the makeup geek blush in rendezvous I'm going to take some of that and work it onto my cheeks like so I'm going to take this highlight from what is this and anastasiya this is champagne and work this in with my finger on my nose it's a little bit right there I feel like these highlights are a little bit more natural looking and I don't want anything too crazy so I'm just going to pop it on right there just accentuate my new nose that I created takes this brush right here some more feet M 5 10 equal [Music] you just got these bite Beauty lip liners in so this one right here this is number 22 and then for the lips I'm going to use the tarte

[Music] hilarious let's pretend that you can't see the extensions of the bangs just use your imagination if this isn't Texas in the 90s I don't know what is I feel like I should be on a southern home cooking show right now oh my god I look like Jim Carrey's daughter in Dumb and Dumber to look creepy oh my gosh hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I am going to be recreating my glamour shot picture that I took it when I was 7 it was 1994 and they had a really interesting clothing back then so I was all about the glam even at a very young age no I was actually a tomboy growing up but I found this my mom me my mom actually remember took these pictures posted him on Twitter as a throwback Thursday and I got so much feedback on this picture I was talking to Patrick and he was like you should totally recreate this look it'll be so funny and I just thought it was a good idea so I decided to try and recreate the look today so the background isn't exactly but I tried my best to get it to what it is and I can't take myself seriously in this hair and clothes right now but if you want to see how I recreated of my glamour shot picture from back in the day then don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bow so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with this video all right so we are getting started with prepping the face I don't know what they used back in the 90s to prep the face besides moisturizer I'm not really too sure but I'm gonna use this Oprah cool as a cucumber moisturizing primer I just got it in and it feels so freakin good I have such old like dry skin and I've told you guys this so many times so I'm always looking for the next moisturizing products for my especially if it's in a primer so this is a primer it's an all-in-one it's gonna smooth it's gonna soothe and it's gonna hydrate it feels very cushiony on the skin it's definitely a little bit tacky so I know that my makeup is gonna stick to my face I may use this foundation it's the NARS natural radiant foundation in Patagonia and I'm gonna apply it with a Beauty Blender to even out my skin I don't know what they my skin looked so good in that picture by the way this was before acne ever existed on my face but this foundation is just so good because it like fills in and hides texture it hides blemishes red spots but at the same time it your skin still looks like skin it doesn't look like it has caked up foundation all over the place you know it just looks like nice things so that's why I really like this one I'm gonna add some concealer the one that I've been loving lately is this Mac water weight concealer and I like that it just comes in this dropper it's just fun to apply even though it does nothing when I apply it like this it's just so fun to see it go down on your face like that this is MC 20 in case you guys are wondering my shade I'm gonna go ahead and set my lid area with this wanderlust wander buddy powder foundation and this is in the shade medium this is going to mattify and set everything in place I'm gonna go ahead and bake because we can't skip on baking I don't think they did this back in the day I would love to speak to the makeup artist that did my makeup on that day let it sit and marinate for a second just like that and then I'm gonna work I think my foundation is pretty dry by now so I'm gonna go in with my brow pencil the one that I've been loving lately and then using it and I travel with it everywhere is this Dior one it is in the shade black but it's actually not black it's a very deep brown I love this eyebrow pencil and it's super tiny portable and it has and it's so cute could just close it up that's just chic portable and it does an amazing job so I've been using this lately I'm just gonna try and follow that shape that I had before I you know tweeze the life out of them starting with this brow that's so crazy to see on my brows work my brows have always been like smaller here and thicker out here try to recreate that that's funny I always thought I teased my brow weird to the point where it doesn't it grows in like this but it actually has always been like this and then it comes and then I always extend my brows so far out I swear I've always thought that I just over plucked my brows but I guess I didn't pluck them out too bad it's just that's how they are naturally that is crazy okay so this is how my brows sit naturally on my face if it was up to me not trying to recreate my brow exactly not exactly how it was but the shape of the brow from when I was a kid I would be changing them extending them adding more brow hairs but I'm just gonna leave it because this is supposed to be how my natural brow shape would be and I'm gonna move on to my eyes I remember being in front of these big lights I was I remember this little shoot that we did I remember vaguely but somebody did put some type of a brush on my eyes so I'm gonna do just a light wash and in the picture it almost looks like I have like a gold like a oranjee gold kind of color right on the inner corners do you like a natural crease like a natural contoured eye crease so I'm gonna take the Dominique Lotte palette I'm gonna take caramel and mix a little bit of mocha in there I'm going to take a vanilla cream and just pop it on to my lid so it looks nice and bright okay I think we're done I want a very soft the most natural looking crease that you have ever seen that's what I what I'm going for and then for the inner corners I do have a little bit of something there so I'm gonna take creme brulees that actually works perfect and then all I had on was mascara for my lashes so what I'm gonna do is take a mascara and the new one that actually just came out from benefit is really really good so I'm gonna take that one and it's super cute packaging it's this one right here it's called bad gal bang the wand is really really nice and angled and narrow towards the very tip and wider at the end and just the bristles are so tiny they grab onto every single lash and pull them out so I really like this is gonna pull out all your secrets all the lashes on the bottom where will come out you see how far that comes out so I'm gonna take one of the most natural looking lashes of my favorite lashes these are the Lily lashes and Goddess they look like so they're so pretty and they are gonna be a little long longer than what I had in the picture these are my natural lashes so it looks like I had blush on most of the makeup was just mascara blush and lips so I had like a light pink blush on so I'm going to take this really pretty g'way blush duo and I'm gonna take this blush right here this is called tease me it's the Coquette blush duo and pop it on to my cheeks looks like they had it right where I smile like right here my nose I feel like was so much cuter when I was seven because now it's like crooked and it's not as like round and cute so I'm gonna contour my nose that's the only thing I'm gonna contour my face was pretty full and almost looks like I may have had a little bit of bronzer on my cheeks so actually I'm in a contour a little bit because it looks like I had a little something going on my cheek so I'm gonna just contour this sides a little bit and then the nose we're really gonna go in I'm contouring with it by the way you guys cuz I show it so much the Kat Von D shade in like pilot just taking the middle shade in the palette and the first shade I'm going down my nose I basically contour my nose to look like how it was when I was a kid anyway so I'm just gonna keep the same kind of method I go around the nose right here to make it look a little bit more turned up and then I go ahead and cut off this full point eat area and it's a little bit shorter and then I curve in right here just so it looks more rounded and button and then I'm gonna go back over with a banana shade actually in my palette because it's not as yellow as the one in the shade and light palette so I'm just gonna get across like that I'm gonna go with the urban decay trivial liquid lip a little bit darker but it's pretty pretty accurate it looks like this Center on my lip was a little bit highlighted okay so it's a little bit darker so I'm going to lighten it up with the L'Oreal color riche shining peach shade just okay this is perfect tada the only thing we're missing is the hair so I decided to do the hair on camera for you guys so they didn't think it was gonna be enough makeup to actually be a makeup tutorial I think the way they curled hair then was just with curl curlers there was no curling wands so it was a little bit bigger and like more billowy and fluffy so this is gonna look a little bit different but we are going to make it work and then each layer I'm just gonna fluff up so I'm gonna take my teasing brush and add volume cuz there was a lot of volume going on actually I faced hi my little sister and my mom was showing her the picture and she was like you look like you have a wig on or you have a hat so my hair was super to mind you this was in Texas it probably was all over the United States at this point but for sure in Texas big hair has always been like a thing so maybe that's why but yeah we had big hair so did my mom my mom did glamor shots on the same day her hair was so big if I could find a picture I will put it in here and I will show you her glamour shots to show I would be really embarrassed but she won't mind talking won't be really embarrassed but we'll see it will talk to her to see she'll let us put it up so you guys can see it but I'm just gonna curl this part of my hair if you see this it's just the tag to the shirt that I tried to make out of a vest hey my hair was much shorter was like I cut my own bangs but I'd need to curl them I guess oh my god this is going to look hilarious oh my gosh you guys this is so weird okay I can't with this hair I give up on the hair but this is basically what we did know for the last part of this load I'm going to put on these weird earrings that actually made myself to look like the picture so I just added an extra pair of earrings split it through the back so it looks a little bit bulkier just let's pretend that you can't see the extensions of the bangs just use your imagination this isn't Texas in the 90s I don't know what is thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did and you want to see more things like this I think they're just so hilarious then don't forget to let me know in the comments and before I let you go I want you to just find a baby picture and look at your brows to see if you're doing them in the correct shape I just want you to go look back at your baby picture it my the only one that realizes

Dolly's 
[Music] [Music] 20 good girl blender clarity blend hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be showing you a full face of first impressions using a bunch of new makeup some things I really love some things I don't really love and you'll see what I'm talking about later on in this video but before we go into this video I have a special surprise for you guys I am doing a huge giveaway right now starting right now I'm giving away this stuff right here there's going to be three winners each winner will win a $100 gift card to Ulta a punch a punch a bunch of makeup just a bunch of girly stuff you're gonna be flooded and I'm super excited to do this for you guys all you have to do to enter is follow me on instagram like my latest picture and comment your favorite emoji

like you mean the world to me and I just want to get back to you guys so yeah that's it don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of it squad family and without further ado let's get over to the new foundation from the balm is called even steven it's a whipped foundation in this little tiny jar I have a light medium one and a medium so I'm going to go between the two I'm gonna start off with light medium and then see how this is looking on my face and if it doesn't work out I'm going to switch to this guy so it looks like this it's a wit foundation it is I don't like anything I have to dunk my anything in this doesn't seem right we're gonna see how it applies on the face so here we go it's a little cakey looking and it might be a little too light for me that is way too light for my face okay I had to take that off I was looking super pale and I'm going to go ahead and apply the medium shade on with my finger I think that'll be a little bit better so let's with like this automatically it is drawing extremely mad it feels like this foundation just sits right on the top of your skin it doesn't sink into your skin it just sits there on top it's like the medium is a little too dark and then the light is way too light so you would have to get both of them just kind of to kind of mix it up to get your shade and I just I don't know if I how I feel about the way this dries this dries super matte I'm going to mix in some of the light if you have dry skin this isn't going to be a good foundation for you because it's going to really accentuate any lines that you have yeah I am not feeling this foundation you guys used to be honest I like other things from the balm but this is just not one of them I'm gonna go ahead and move on to the concealer which is not a first impression I can oldie but goodie this is the Mac Pro Longwear it's gonna brighten my under eyes and highlight a little bit and then you will move on to the next first impression I'm very excited about this I even have some of these guys go ahead and go into the heat vibe I am going to be doing my eyes using the urban decay and naked heat pallet I'm very excited about it this palette is so gorgeous my naked were super popular they're all very cool tones this one is on another level this is an everyday palette for me I loved every single shade in this palette and I'm very excited to use it start off with a low-blower this shade right here working on the inner and outer corners of the lid just patting it in and then following up through the crease and then with the brush from the Naked palette I'm just going to diffuse the edges and that's going to be our first transition color I'm going to bring it up a little bit past the crease just to add some more drama to the eye I usually like to keep darker shades away from the inner corners but with this look we're going to go in with use dark shades so you want to change the look up a little bit for the next color I'm going to take key double right here this matte shade right here same brush just using the other side and I'm going to work that right on top you always want to keep that first color peeking through I really like this the side of the brush that it comes with for blending it works really good it just grabs the color and it moves it exactly where you want it so what I'm going to do is take a larger fluffier brush to really soften the edges I believe that center part of your eye nice and open okay now I'm going to make Cayenne and sway go together build up that deep intensity I think all these colours going to work great together really deepening up the inner and outer corners it's gonna look like a fiery hot cheeto honestly you guys when I get lazy and I'm like I hope you're like taking forever to blend my eyeshadow I just pack it on it looks messy and then I go in and blend it and that's where I do all the work now I'm going to smooth everything out with this larger fluffy brush y'all are not ready for this xxx hot shoot I'm taking my eye shadow a little bit further out than normal and a bug bit me right here so I want to cover it up well likely this looks because it's like the purple in the Reds are not exactly in the same exact place which is what I like about it is kind of just marbled everywhere so for the center I'm going to take this super gorgeous color right here called moon but it's such a pretty color look at it I'm going to pop this gorgeous color right onto the center of my lid I didn't realized how red this was going to be so I'm going to go ahead and take more of that purple on the end it's the matte purple right here it's called ashes I'm just going to take that a little bit more in fist and just work it into the outer corners I just cleaned up a side I feel like it was going a little bit too low so I cleaned it up made it into an angle and then I'm just going to soften up the edges a little bit on the outer corners I'm going to take this makeup Shakti 11 brush and just fluff I'll buff out edges right here find a good girl blend apply a blue mini blend by the brow bone I'm going to take chaser right here and pop that on to the brow bone and I'm using a city color brush if you guys are wondering what the heck this thing is right here this is in a mosquito bite that is making my eye shadow look deformed we are going to fix that with the brow don't highlight I want you guys to look at your brow bone highlight as a second chance you're having a bad eyes shadow day your brother and highlight got you girl this is the L'Oreal luminous lash paradise to coat the lashes I want a little bit more of a pop on the center I'm going to go back into the palette and then it takes the lightest shade it's called one set I think I'm just gonna dot a little bit in the center just to have that extra pop pop of light there's these two liners that came with a palette that came with the PR that I got from Urban Decay a brown pencil and torch and then this plum one in alkaline please alkaline tough to line the top and just run a line right across okay so I'm going to go ahead and pop on the lashes before we move on anywhere else I need to feel the glam right now so I just wrap these lashes these are the new ones from house of lashes my dryers on also these are the Elora light I thought these would look really cute with this look so I'm gonna go ahead and pop these on really quick usually just pop them on let me just see they would look like I think they look really good yeah they're cute they're not too crazy there's still spikey force all right so my lashes are on they have just enough volume to make the look complete so I'm gonna go ahead and start on the lower lash line I'm going to take cayenne and then start to work that on the lower lash line bring that in like this on both sides leaving a little space in the middle because we want to pop that highlight in the center and now I'm going to go into n Fuego and I'm going to work that right on the lower lash line as well here to keep it really close to those lashes and then I'm going to take the purple and I'm also going to pop it onto the lower lash line now I'm going to take B mascara and I'm going to work it into those bottom lashes alright so that is it for the eyes they are dramatic they are out there and I am loving it this isn't something new this is not a first impressions my kat von d palette I'm just going to pop this underneath my eyes so we can seal that in place and brighten it up I'm a zero go to contouring with some powder contour this time so I'm just going to go right underneath the cheekbone with this the weaver brush right here alright pick that and I was in shape so now I'm going to put on a bronzer bronzer that I have been loving a lot that I don't I don't have a new bronzer to show you guys but this one I have been loving so much this is the Estee Lauder bronze goddess so good so I'm just going to pop that on to add some warmth to my face to give my face in color so Kat Von D has her new blush a Lolita is like hot it's the hottest liquid lips that she has it's very popular and now she has it in blush form and a lipstick fork a matte blush I always get excited from that thing so I like to start at the hairline and then bring it up upwards I want to make this a very warm look so this color is going to go perfectly this is a very pigmented blush I barely have any on my brush and it's just coloring in my cheek bone like crazy I'm really liking it still in it oh my god I do have a new highlight but they broke when they came in so I'm so sad about it but I'm going to try it so we're going to try it i swatched it on my hand on insta stories and it was like so beautiful so I definitely have to try this highlight this is see new urban decay afterglow highlighting palette mind is a little broken these are the shades they're so gorgeous I'm going to take side piece and then pop it on to my cheeks oh my goodness I'm sorry but the last time or Nicki came out with their highlight like a highlighter or a looot an illuminator I didn't like it I feel like it was chalky and it didn't stick on to the skin it wasn't highlighting anything this is another level like this is a beautiful highlight I am so in love with this highlight I'm going to put some actually on my nose right there right here in right the packaging - is so gorgeous look at that Lancome came out with some new juicy shakers I actually never tried the juicy shakers they do the juicy shakers on my

sauces is so good it's so affordable I just love it it lasts all day I'm actually surprised I need to try it cuz I've never tried it um no but my brow hairs are actually really really coarse so I can't really do much with them like you can create a whole new shape if you want it to because your brow hairs are so like yeah like fine and like soft mine are like pubic hair or something my brow oh yeah I'm gonna use that on the outer part of the brow you do that ombre effect I try the straight vowel thing clearly and I don't think it works on my face shape so now I'm trying to go back can't do

Jacobs makeup so I recently tried their concealer and I actually really like it it's like creamy but full coverage it kinda reminds me of the Norton Arzo AHA mapper or a complete soft matte I'm gonna know I can't find the right shades for me in the NARS one this is not too pink not clean up my brows and stuff with that one denars yeah I could see that alright so I'm just gonna blend in this face how'd you get ahead of me okay this concealers everything here we go I don't know I did that just tapping off my concealer so I guess I'm using the remarkable concealer from Marc Jacobs full coverage very creamy here's something that's full coverage and it's creamy do that like skin like finish yes I'm like give me it right now I feel like I'm only using expensive products which is so weird for me traveling so basically everything I'm using in this video is like the items that I've been my go-to recently so I just threw my bag and I'm like okay I'll just go with that for my trip and then everything else is kind of like my OG products yeah so probably boring if you're watching me a lot because you know I use these like pretty consistently but it is what it is I'm using the Jaclyn hill palette that's a good one yes I'm kind of late to the party on this one for sure but it's an amazing palette so I'm gonna try and create a look with it Kylie Jacqueline so I'm gonna go into all the transition shades so that's this one right here we're just gonna go in there I'm gonna highlight my brow bone with one of these bad boys probably a little mixture both of them you know oh you're starting with the brow bone highlight different do you do that laughs what do you I do that laughs I like to do that first and then I kind of bring it down you're like I can't really blend it very well if I do a loss that's what's me oh that's it it's cool to see how somebody else does their makeup in the order that they do yeah yeah everyone does it so differently but we all have our things like I get so tripped out if I try and do it a different order like messes me are like this isn't right yeah I'm just gonna put that on the outer and inner corner of my eye and I'm gonna leave a space in the middle for one of these gorgeous freakin gorgeous shades right here from the G wait skinny-dip palette that palette is just so beautiful to look at to like it just blinds you by looking at it I'm gonna do a little halo like today I think I might go in and I think I might do a cut crease ooh am i over achieving right now let's see this let's see I'm gonna go in with this February I love it this one mm-hmm probably mix it with that I'm just like so it's not as bright yellow she did such a good job with this palette there's a really cute package it is really keep acting super cute and the colors just make you happy to look at like that baby blue just was like so pretty do I have a Canadian accent tell me a little bit know when you say certain words those are people tell me but they never tell me what those certain words are like I haven't said you out about yeah right there that's what it was about yes that's so neat what do you say about what you can actually I need some of the Jackson Hale Paula he's really dark brown down here it's got whatever you could bring in the drama it's got whatever you could possibly need okay I'm making some progress but it's very slow progress like very very slow take your time doing right I'm going in with like all the different brushes I'm using a little bit here yeah it's very exactly what I'm doing um yours is coming along nice so everything really pretty thank you I feel like if I do a hollow eye my the sunken in this of like my eyes like how deep said it is it just gets accentuated yeah so it looks literally like my eyes are two little circles like protruding out of my head so after my transition shade I went in with that orange II know I was the orange yeah I went on with that Warren G Brown shade then I was brown ended up mixing it with darker Brown but now I'm going in with like this Brown here to deepen it up and that's a color that's what we're here - all right I'm gonna go into these you a skinny dip palette where we're going in to skinny dip right there I just want to show you what it looks like on my finger oh I'm trying to think what color I should do unlike the lid lid the mobile lid the moving lid

[Music] but new makeup that was very very dramatic let me let's try that again oh hey guys welcome back to my channel so today we are gonna be doing nothing but new stuff we got in PR all the new makeup is on my face right now I created this really pretty look with it and I'm so excited to show you we got some Kylie some new YSL foundation I've never tried to milk makeup but we're trying it today NARS just came out with a new color in their liquid blush Mac we have hourglass the bomb we have all these new makeup that I can't wait to show you and can't wait to try on my face so if you want to see how I get this look right here mm-hmm don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you can be a part of the quad family and without further ado we're gonna get on to its product that I got is from milk makeup I have never tried anything from milk before I know that's kind of weird but this is my first time it's called a luminous blur stick give that soft light effect on your face but I'm a little nervous about this because it is it is definitely illuminating so imagine putting that all over my like pimples I'm actually putting that all over my texture yeah I don't know how I feel about that so I'm gonna start off by putting it right on the cheekbone and see where that takes me so here we go I'm gonna put it on my face we're gonna blur and illuminate but the thing is I want to try it on my face because what if it like blurs out the texture it almost has like a powdery feel to it but I'm gonna go ahead you know I'm gonna keep this on my highlighting spots it almost looks dewy it doesn't it look shimmery it just looks dewy which makes me want to try it on my cheek area so hopefully my face doesn't turn out too crazy what we are going to try it here I really like the way it smells it smells like a light has like a citrusy scent to it it's mixed with something really warm I don't know it's it smells really good and it feels really nice on the skin so I'm gonna go ahead and pick up my why sell some new wise self foundations I got in I'm so excited these are the all-in-one glow foundations and this is supposed to be a do we make up with a natural medium coverage so we're gonna try it out this is the shady d40 is a yellow undertone it's very tan I fake baked recently so I'm gonna use this one has a little pump on it I always love pumps or less mess is the best so I'm gonna take that on my handy dandy mixing plate yep that's gonna match my neck wow this smells so good like a soft rose kind of scent it's so so pretty and it's it's not really covering too much but let's see if it's buildable I do like the way it feels on the skin it has a light plushy feel to it it does have like a dewy kind of look to it it's very glowy dewy so if you have a oily skin you may not like this but I really like it because I have a really dry skin so I love it I'm starting to get a little bit oily right in my t-zone just a tiny bit but I honestly don't mind it because again I've always been dry my entire life so I'm gonna take my second layer of foundation I'm just trying to cover up this spot right here I really like that natural kind of glow it gives you the coverage is in bad it is very soft and natural feeling so I like it but it is very kind of a wet looking on the skin I'm gonna let that dry down so to prime the eyes I never use a primer I always like concealers I really am NOT a primer fan for the eyes but make up forevers just came out with this step one skin equalizer lip and eye primer which I'm excited to use because I really love their primers for the face just gonna take this guy it's also 24 hours so that's cool I'm gonna take some of my finger like that just pop it all over the lid that's interesting that this is for your eye and lip so that feels really good on the lips we got in the Kylie blue honey palette this is it right here she always has those tears coming down which resembles the colors inside of the palette so super exciting here we go I'm gonna put that natural shade I always do this with every video I think I can even skip this part as you guys kind of know it if you watch my videos by now set it in place but does it move around anywhere it's a nice pink undertone to it which I like okay what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start off with this guy down here I'm gonna say this is honestly I'm always confused with the way that they're flipped so I'm gonna say that this is busy bee work it all over the lid up into the crease just all over the place all in the crease and I'm gonna kind of work it you're usually supposed to use a flat brush for your lid but I'm just gonna use this brush and go back because I just want to wash up this color around the eye I'm gonna really focus on that funny shade I think that's gonna be really pretty with brown eyes this almost reminds me of like a melon color or like the background so after that then I'm gonna go in with a flat brush so that we can lay this color down it's so pretty this is sweet like honey I'm gonna take this guy right here and I'm gonna use a flat brush for this as a zoeva 234 and I'm just gonna place that all over the lid and I just feel like it's going to bring out brown eyes so beautifully so I'm just gonna work that all over and then go in with a new clean brush just to diffuse the edges and then I'm just gonna go around the edges of the honey color and pop on busy bee or honey mood take that brown and just go right around that crease and just darken everything up I'm gonna take that golden oil I think it's royal jelly okay before we get down to the lower lashline I'm just gonna pop on some concealer this I just got in PR this is the Mac waterproof running water weight concealer and this is in the shape and c20 so I'm going to take this out it looks like a dropper like that wow I did not expect the coverage to be that great because it says water weight maybe because it doesn't feel heavy on the skin for my concealer dries I'm just going to set it with the laura mercier setting powder which is definitely not new and do that so I'm gonna go back into the Kiley palette I'm going to use this blue shade right on the bottom it's like a green green color actually and I'm just gonna use it right on the lower lash line for a pop of color I'm going to take a clean pencil brush and just go right underneath we wind it up I'm gonna take a tiny bit of this color right here I'm just gonna work it right underneath the blue we can have that cool 3d kind of look on the lower lash line it's not too flat this is from the balm it's called mr. right and it's in the shade see more date nights have the cutest names for their products and I'm just gonna hold down just a tiny bit with my nail and make sure that this waterline looks nice and bright it's gonna keep our eyes open if you have smaller eyes and you're using a dark color around them you can definitely use this trick to keep your eyes wide open this is from hourglass they have a new eyebrow pencil it's called arch it's the brow sculpting pencil one side has a it's fully on it the other side is just this little triangular shape right here this is in dark brunette so I'm just gonna work that into the sparse areas of my brow and then when I want to fill them in I'll just lay it flat down and it'll fill in a larger space brows are filled in I actually really really like the new hourglass arch pencil it's not too light to where you really have to work your pencil back and forth but it's not too dark to where you have to be scared to put your pencil down so it's right it's like a happy medium right in the middle and it just I love it I definitely I'm traveling I'm actually going to New York tomorrow putting this in my makeup bag a for sure we're gonna need some bigger lashes so I'll be right back because these are the velour lashes and serendipity so just you know pop them on really quick and I will be right back with lashes and we're gonna do the rest of the face okay I'm back with the lashes I know I'm just going to wipe off the extra powder I think it's really settled into my skin at this point for blush I'm gonna take the NARS liquid blush in hot Knight Hot Tin room took me a really long time to try to say that then you start to work it into my job okay that is very intense I do not suggest you do that so take the tiniest tiniest amount work it in your vase but we are gonna we're gonna work through this so I'm gonna take the cleans out of my beauty blender then just start to work it back into the hairline and you can actually diffuse this so don't be too scared if you if this happens to you you just go on the clean side of your beauty blender and you keep twisting it until you've used each clean inch of your Beauty Blender instead I'm gonna take it all the way up into the temple and actually gonna use the rest of this right in here using a little bit of red like this does kind of give you that and I've got a little bit of a burn from the Sun um it gives you some color it gives you like a nice fresh kind of look I don't have anything new to contour wet so I'm gonna do that off camera and I will be back with the next new the mary-lou manizer it's the liquid mary lou manizer it's a all-over highlight in a tube like this like so and I'm just gonna make a little tiny mark right there right on the cheeks and then I'm gonna do right across the nose down the nose right on the Cupid's bow this is a very natural-looking highlight I'm just gonna take the Ofra pillow top right on top of it I just got this in I've actually never tried pillow talk I don't know if it's new or not but I've never tried it so I'm gonna use it in this video right on top of the mary lou manizer or lit mary and doom and I was let's call it Larry I'm gonna take this brush right here from the makeup shock it's a 243 brush and some of pillow talk and then we're just gonna pop it on right on top [Applause] it's got this in from colour-pop it says colour-pop lux and it is a whole package full of their new lipsticks and they're so so cute and they have so many different shades so I'm gonna choose a shade right now and let me just show you up close okay so this is the packaging has little stars on the top and this is color pop so whenever you twist up the lipstick you have all of these really cute little stars imprinted all over the top I just love when brands do this little stuff it's so so cute so I'm gonna go ahead and take a lil ad on the lips [Music] okay the next

[Music] a spy also today I am going to show you how to get this wet dog razor-sharp hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be doing this look right here something that I do no matter what time of the season or what time the day it is this looks good no matter where you're going and it looks good on almost anybody so I'm going to show you how to get it it's like a feline cat cat eye with nude lips a little bit of gloss and highlight it's an easy simple glam but anybody can do and I feel like this is like a staple and a necessity that you just want to need to know how to do in your life you know just have in your pocket on one of those rainy days don't forget to subscribe to my channel and also hit that Bell right there to be a part of the quad family and without further ado let's get on with this I'm going to start off by using the herb ourian glow cream right here this also can be used as just the highlighter it's really pretty house like a holographic look to it and if you have like texture dry dull skin that's kind of what I feel like I have right now this is going to brighten it up smooth it out and it's kind of like a really nice primer I'm going to use a very light layer on my the highlighted points of my face so I'm going to take it on the back of my hand so you guys can see how cool it looks it looks like it's a white cream like this but then you let me just show you how cool this looks gives you like a really nice hydrated lightweight feeling my face has been really dry and just really dull looking and the texture is definitely there the good thing about this is going to help with the texture it's gonna fill in those fine lines but at the same time it's going to brighten the skin and make it look a little bit more alive so after that I'm going to go ahead and get into my makeup so I'm going to be using this Estee Lauder Double Wear one of my favorite foundations I actually have this in my foundation routine video if you want to check that out so I'm going to take a little bit of this on the back of my hand it can be a little drying I'll either take the custom cover drops or I'll take these little drops right here these are the first Sally rose gold elixir drops so I'll just take a little bit of that I'm so excited to show you the I found a new alternative to a Beautyblender so if you want a cheaper alternative to a Beautyblender this one is really really good I haven't seen anybody talk about it this is better than the Real Techniques Beauty Blender it's it's not expensive at all it's from L'Oreal to drugstore and it just blends everything in perfectly they actually have three I haven't tried the other two but I like this is the foundation one and I really like it so I'm gonna take some of my hand here I'm just gonna work it into my skin like so just balancing it so I'm gonna let that sit I always put a light layer a foundation let it dry and then I go back over with another layer I'm gonna let that sit and dry and while that does that I'm going to go ahead and do my brows off-camera it takes a really long time for me to do my brows I don't want to take 100 years so I'm going to go ahead and use this wet and wild ultimate brow kit I always fall in love with their products I love the brow products from wet and wild I'm going to be using both of these guys a darker one on the tail end and then the lighter one towards the the front of the brow I just feel like it's so much more natural using a powder and it's just easy and quick I'm going to go ahead and clean up the bottom of the brow so I'm going to take some concealer on my Mac 242 concealer brush right here so I'm just going to use this as a primer and also carve out the shape on the bottom of the brow so I'm just going to lay that down all over the lid and then blend it out with my finger I think skin to skin makes for like a really even smooth flawless slend just makes it look really natural so I'm going to go ahead and do the other side okay so now that that's dry I'm gonna go ahead and add a second layer of foundation put on some concealer and I'm going to use this one from Tarte it's the shape tape samo trusty and then I'm just going to highlight with it as well the nose keep pressing it into the skin okay so while that sets into my skin I want to go ahead and do my eyes so my eyes are pretty simple so that the makeup doesn't fall into the creases and kind of make lines I'm going to go ahead and set it in place with this powder from la girl this is in the shade beige use this brush right here from the balm it's called give crease a chance such a cute brush and it's like delt dual-ended I'm going to take this flat side I like that it's flat and kind of why so it gets all the space on the lid at one time so for the eyeshadow I'm going to go in with this palette right here this is the baked Browns from dose of colors I always take this with me if I'm traveling but you can do so much with these few colors so I'm going to go on with this shade right here it's called deserted so I'm going to take desert is grab a little bit of that crease color and start to work it in it's so precise and densely packed that it's it's not blending out the edges very well so I'm going to take another clean fluffy brush Luxy 228 crease brush and I'm just going to feather out the edges so it doesn't look super harsh I want the lid to look bright and healthy the eye to have like a natural looking dimension I don't want anything dramatic for the next crease color I'm going to take this Brown right here the darkest one in the palette this one is called rock bottom we are literally going to do the easiest by a shadow today it's gonna be so easy and I always have a clean brush with me just so that we can diffuse the edges and that's why we have these big fluffy brushes just to diffuse harsh edges and just really blend out and make our eyeshadow look soft so I'm going to go in with this color right here this is tea light and I'm going to pack that onto the lid so I'm just taking a flat shader brush right here this is the zoeva 234 brush I don't want my eyelid to be too white I just want it to look like a nice healthy-looking lid pack on just a tad bit at a time so I don't overwhelm the look the lightest hand possible I'm gonna go ahead and take that same shade right along the brow bone I'm also going to take it and put it and put that same color right in the inner corners just to brighten it up so I'm gonna go ahead and do the wing I'm gonna use my Kat Von D trooper tattoo liner I'm going to do my winged liner really quick I want to do a bold winged liner I do one little flick upwards and then I bring down and then I inch my way towards the inner part of the eye now that I have my wing on there I can really see where I want to intensify the crease and where I want it to stop so I'm going to go back in with my morphe M 507 brush and a little bit of that dark the darkest shading the palate diffuse the edges I'm going to go ahead and do the same thing to the other eye and bring it down to the lower lash line just a little bit just so we can have some kind of depth there for that I'm going to take this shade right here in the middle it's called outdoorsy I'm going to take that shade right there with this same brush and just run it along the lower lash line just like a light wash of color right there I'm going to take the same brush drive and blending everything out with and just go right underneath this so it's not any harsh edges and then for mascara I'm gonna go in with my current favorite mascara this is from laurie Alice's the voluminous lashed pyridine this is a good one this is a really good one for the lashes I have three pairs if I'm trying to figure out which one I'm gonna want to want to kind of want to wet I think I'm gonna go with Lux because they look a little bit more fuller than the rest so I'm going to just do this off-camera and when I come back I'll have full flirty lashes BRB so I just popped on the lashes I'm just going to use this black eyeliner from Milani and I'm gonna pop it onto the top of my waterline to tight line and I'm going to just do that right now because you can still see the skin it's kind of weird whew so there we go you can't see the skin anymore um I don't like doing this but it sometimes is necessary I'm going to take a little bit of that black eyeliner and also drag it down to the bottom waterline just a little bit just take it in a tiny bit don't go all the way in and you will get that like sharp cat eye I'm just going to contour really quick so I'm going to use my Tarte clay stick Foundation and deep honey and just carve out the cheeks and I'm just blending everything in with my Beauty Blender and I'm going to go in with this NARS liquid blush and orgasm and I'm using it as a base today so you can go about your day using this and this is really pretty but I'm going to go on top of it with the powder I want to lock everything in place so I'm gonna go in with the shade and light contour palette and I'm just going to go right over the cream contour and the cream highlight that I just did and just make sure that it sets it in place and it also intensifies it a little bit more I'm gonna take my morphe y12 brush and I'm just going to go into the contour shades and really intensify the cheekbones and I always like to blend any shadow upwards you go down like this create a shadow like a five o'clock shadow you don't want that so I'm just going to go ahead and keep take it around the temples just where we contour with the cream and if you're having a chunky week I also like to take it right underneath the chin makes it look slim all right and now I'm going to go ahead and go under my under eye area and just brighten it up with those lighter shades in the contour palette for bronzer I'm going to go ahead and take my Marc Jacobs bronzer the ten test it but this is a morphe brush it doesn't have a number on it but it looks like this and just start to warm up my face like right around the outer perimeters okay for the highlight I'm going to take this Max superb extra dimension skin finish right here it's so gorgeous look at that so I'm going to take that on a more pm5 ten brush I always use this one to highlight and I'm just going to put it right on the tops of the cheekbones right there apply the highlight right where I want it also I want to go ahead and pop it on to the inner corners I'm gonna take my y22 brush from morphe and just pop it right on the inner corners and I'm trying to be really strategic the way I'm putting on this highlight because I feel like I am breaking out so much but I don't want to bring extra emphasis to that area so I'm just going to put on a little bit more powder so now we're onto the lips so I have a few options I couldn't make up my mind like just going to put all the options right here these are all new this is actually a new one from bite Beauty it's their lip pencil in 0:40 there's no like name to it it's just a number this is Brown looking shade and it's super pointy so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going away and then in the center I'm going to take Lolita or no this is Ludwig from Kat Von D in the center that I'm going to use this cocoa by Kylie cosmetics gloss and this is in sugarplum and i'm just going to basically highlight my Cupid's bow a little bit of gloss create that wet shiny look towards the center I feel like it gives your lips more of a pouty effect love it and then I'm going to go ahead and go over my cheeks with this kylie press blush powder in barely legal this is actually very similar to the liquid blush and orgasm from NARS so I'm just going to pop that right on top to lock it in place and then to make sure everything stays in place all day I'm just going to take my morphe prep and set to and spritz that all over thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed
