If you look closely you can see thousands of worshippers who were there for the teachings of their spiritual leader.

welcome to the ancient city of Messine this is incredible it's an hour and a
half from Costa Navarino in the Peloponnese region of Greece. Messene is a 3,000 year old city where you can explore the stadium theater all the
baths and mosaics it has 9 kilometers of thick ancient
walls around it and some are still standing today unlike other ruins we've been to in Greece this one is nearly deserted we have a place all to ourselves Methoni Castle dates back to the 4th
century BC but it has changed hands many times between the Turks, Venetians and
Greeks. The star attraction is definitely walking out to the small islet of 40 to
see the stone octagonal fortress and we We are in Costa Navarino and we're taking
a cooking class with Loola and Anna to learn how about some traditional Greek
cusine I am so excited I can't wait to make it and then eat it smell-o-vision you need it I can tell you how to make that now I am making that when I get home Yamas! it's an incredible view up here just
outside of Navarino looking at the beach if you do come here make sure that you
do a cycling tour with Navarino outdoors and then you get this awesome food and
picnic with K Food Stories really authentic Greek food and it is delicious Off to the first village How was it Dave? it was tough was on a gravel road
because mainly tough because we're seriously out of shape this is hard We're going way up and I'm way out of shape but it was really steep it's about 500
meters I'm impressed because our guide Simon did it all the way up. He had all our camera gear in his buggy so that was impressive it was but the most impressive thing is getting up here seeing this beautiful view and man it's time for some lunch up here we have a picnic this is amazing unless you have this
great view but this is a total feast they'll probably never be able to eat it all Or maybe I will we stayed at the Westin Costa
Navarino resort which was the dream of captain Vasilis a local of the area and
it was his dream to promote the region of Messinia, while protecting and
preserving both nature and culture of the area it's now a leading example of
sustainable tourism and environmental protection in the Mediterranean This is the life. the water density in here is the same as the Dead Sea so I'm just floating 
We're off to explore the crystal cave here in cayman islands let's go where are the Crystal Caves tour here on Grand Cayman and behind me is our first stop, it's the red birch tree. Fun little fact, the locals here call it the tourists tree, because it's red and always peeling, just like us Ha I love it. Pepper Cinnamon Tree Smells like cinnamon, but tastes like pepper. Canella Winter Anna That's what this is Numb tongue Down we go, first cave. Ooh If you look right here, this is why we call it open ceiling cave. Funny huh? we got to explore a lot of caves here in the Crystal Caves and it's pretty amaizing diverse and there's a lot of stalactites and stalagmites here And there's still even more caves to be explored Wow What a fantastic tour 
Well it's an exciting day here today in Sri Lanka We're heading out on safari at yala national park Looking for some leopards and some elephants part of the fun is looking for leopards. Yeah I don't see anything I can see it There in the Tree Is he in the tree? It's behind the tree   oh I'm on the wrong tree i'm at the total dead tree   just explain to me You keep taking photos but just explain Where in the tree I don't see it? Things are going good I'm getting some great photographs Here in Yala. we're here in yala national park and
having a really good day. We've already seen seen a giant rock python And now we see a pond heron eating  a fish! So it's pretty cool. the cinnamon wild leopard project is a
project that helps the local farmers keep their cattle safe they have they provide fences and safety
for the cattle so that leopards do not snatch the calves. Now this is really important because in the past farmers would retaliate kill the leopards But as we all know, leopards are endangered so this is a way for them to preserve the Leopards But also appease the farmers. What an amazing safari When you come to Sri Lanka make sure to go to Yala National Park .

today so what's your first tip date number one this is for everybody you've got to check in online the last thing you want to do is get to the airport and have to fight the lines and all that kind of stuff trying to figure out how to work those machines so check in online this gives you a huge advantage number one you can pick your seats and a good tip for taking seats make sure you check out seat guru check them out they have seats for every plane on every carrier and tell you which seats are good which are better which have power which don't all those kind of things so you can pick the most legroom yes so you can pick the most comfortable seat for you before you actually get to the airport a little tip if you travel as a couple especially if the the configuration of a plane is 3 and 3 or 3 4 3 where we like to fit is we like to sit in the middle and the aisle sure you'll get some views on the on the window seat but it can be way less convenient by sitting in the aisle in the middle you only have to crawl over your partner not somebody else and you don't have to you know crawl over everybody and just to clarify Dave talking about that 3 3 3 configuration we don't take the 3 by the windows we take the 3 down the middle aisle but it works as a couple I think it's fantastic we always ask for the middle people think we're crazy when we say can we have the middle seats but know that middle aisle is great for couples one other little tips also if you're traveling as a couple and you're in a 3 3 configuration if you know it's probably not going to be an overly popular route or overly sold out book a window and an aisle and leave the middle open because chances are most people will not book a single middle seat if there's people sitting on either side so that way you can end up with the whole road to yourself and believe me we've done that it's luxury yeah especially if you happen to buy the extra premium feed at the front sometimes you just have to pay thirty five bucks for a premium if you do a window window in an aisle and leave the middle open nobody's going to paint 35 bucks for a middle seat so chances are you've got it all to yourself I bring a little care package with me for all of my items that I'll need they offer headphones a lot on the plane but just bring your own get noise-canceling headphones I use earbuds gave you uses a beat what do you think joystick yeah the Beach Boys can duck or better yet don't even worry about the entertainment system bring an iPad or we use our iPhone 6 plus because they're nice and big we don't have to carry an iPad that way can we load it full of movies and videos and then we have our entertainment all the way to China if we need it also in that care package we have an eye mask so you can sleep on those flights where they leave the lights on we make sure that we have socks as well those are good things little travel socks they're perfect you don't have to put your shoes on to go to the bathroom you can put these on then take them up and throw them in the trash when you're done there's also a toothbrush in there too you know keep your teeth nice and clean afterwards so if you want to give your honey a kiss after you land after a 12-hour flight she's not repulsed and well and I always bring a sweater or scarf because even though even if you're going to a hot climate planes are always cold it seems so I just always make sure that I dress in some layers that I can put on or off I'm always cold I love wearing my silk cashmere scarf food can always be a challenge when you're on the airplane so a little tip that will give you is order yourself a special meal it can be a vegetarian meal it can be all they got they got every kind of configuration oil low salt you name it and that way you'll get served first before everybody else so that can make a difference of you know easily like 20 minutes if you're sitting at the back of the airplane which we tell you not to do if you're sitting back there you could be the last to get served so in order to get a nice hot meal and get served first order a special meal simple easy and you always get drinks first as well they always come from the front and work their way back something that everybody wants is lounge access it's not just for people with status let me tell you you can get lounge access as somebody who doesn't even travel a lot by getting the priority past yeah this gives you access to 600 lounges around the world what she said yeah it's amazing it doesn't matter if you fly with a certain company you don't have to do Star Alliance or one-world it doesn't matter whatever you fly you can get into these lounges and you know what a lot of times they're way better than the other lounges now the way we got our priority passes with our American Express card but you can just buy the priority pass online as well we used to work with American Express full disclosure we don't anymore we still pay for again because it is fabulous getting that priority pass loans I highly recommend we do recommend you do get a rewards travel card that's something we you know if you travel get something that's going to allow you to excuse me late point and preferably point that you can transfer one to one to any airline or any program so that you're not stuck with one but that could be a whole other video about that but speaking of rewards cards find out what card is used in your home Airport that they give privilege to because in our fare Airport in Toronto Canada they give front of line security and access and parking valet free valet parking all kinds of perks and of course the loans to American Express card card holders and I've been around other parts of the world and in the states where they say certain visas they get from the line access here they get lounge access they're a MasterCard only here on route there so look to see what is good for your home Airport that will give you the purposes of the dependability it's fabulous one of the things we've learned over all these years of traveling is to make sure that you get yourself a unique bag you don't want one that looks like everybody else's so get something that the different color has a different pattern something like that that way someone's not going to walk away with your bag I've seen so many people go to grab a bag and then someone come running going past my bag another thing you can do is say you do have just a generic black bag if you can get these straps that go around or I've seen people put ties on their day I think that's a really cool thing all these colorful ribbons and things like that so if you travel a lot like we do get yourself the Global Entry in the US or the nexus card here in Canada it is invaluable it allows you to pass all the lines when you come off that plane you see everybody standing in line to get in you can just breeze right through if you're coming into your home country or going into the u.s. so that'll do it those are our travel hacks that can allow you to travel smarter and a little bit more efficient and if you're looking forward to more travel tips make sure you subscribe to our

let's go on a lobster tour So this trap is waterlogged, it's soaked and it's a wooden trap that he's bringing on They were very muscular to do this. Lobster. Here we go! So when you take it up. You grab the lobster. You gotta be very careful out here. because if you get hooked up in the rigging, you could go over the side. So we're on the lobster tour here with Gillis Lobster safari And this guy's about eight years old. You place the guage right in behind his eye socket. and measured out is back. If it goes over here The edge of his thorax, you have to throw it back in. so as you can see this lobster's legal. This is the crusher and that's the pincher If they get a hold of you, they can hurt. So we put these bands on them. Just turn it like that it's pretty simple This is a mackerel, we're mackerel fishing here. This is the easiest fishing you'll ever do. All you gotta do is let the line out and the fish, they just bite within minutes. I tell you. So you let the slack go as fast as you can. See and then I'm like that. Lock! And then you do that. And now I reel.  And I bet there'll be some on there. They're just always on there. It's a lot of fun actually. If you do this you gotta do the mackerel fishing here. go for it. I'm not much of a fisherman but I'm having fun with this. Oh, I just got a little one this time. He lives another day! Okay we're going. This is fun! They touched me. They touched me. Alright. We're having a blast here On the Gillis Lobster Tour. Outside of Port Hood. We got to learn about lobsters and conservation. And how they catch the lobster. And now we're doing some mackerel fishing. I'm telling you it is full of fish out there All you gotta do is drop the line and you
get like three within minutes It's a lot of fun now that was a lot of fun 
we are at the Hard Rock hotel here in
Panama City. And if you are a rock fan like us, I bet you always wondered what it
was like to be a Hard Rock Hotel. i know I have and let me tell you it's like
staying in a rock and roll museum. There's memorabilia everywhere. So we thought we'd give you a tour from bottom to top of Panama's Hard Rock Hotel Megapolis Well, there's no shortage of bars and restaurants here at the Hard Rock. They got 5 bars and five different restaurants. You can eat
drink all day and night long. So I can waste hours just walking through the Hard Rock Hotel And looking at all the memorabilia. Look! It's Debbie Gibson. I don't know if she's exactly Hard Rock. Oh hey how's it going? You caught me playing here You know here at the Hard Rock one of the things things I really love this is amplified
package. If you are a Rock n Roll fan like I am In your room they will give you a Fender guitar A whole set of pedals. You can even watch television and get some instruction on
how to play if you don't know how to. Then you can throw on your headphones Plug it in so you
don't bug anybody else. And just head off and start rockin' and rolling. Something you can do at a Hard Rock hotel is one of their signature spas. The synchronicity spa, is where you get a massage to rock music that comes out of a dome
overhead and vibrates the whole bed. Even the hallways are filled with memorabilia. You got Marc Bolan from TRex back here which I was a huge fan of. So everywhere you go here
at the Hard Rock, there's fan-o-bilia. That'll do it for our tour of the Hard
Rock Hotel Megapolis here in Panama City. Rock On. That's all I gotta say. Peace Out. 
Hey everybody today we are talking travel photography and one of the most frequent questions that we get is what kind of gear do you carry and what kind of gear do you use while you're out there on the road well let's take a look at what I i actually have in my bag and what I use it for. first the sony rx100 IV perfect to throw in your pocket take anywhere shoot incredible 4k video as well as it has that stabilization a lot of other features that comes with a very fast 1.8 Zeiss lens so for low light stuff that's fantastic If you're on the run this is the camera for you. I also carry two other bodies my main body is the sony a7r2 to and my secondary body is the sony a7s2 to these are great both full frame cameras I use the a7r2 as my main body 42 megapixel five axis in-body image stabilisation it has everything you need as a high-end camera as a professional photographer The a7s to i use as my second body or for any low light situations 12 megapixel camera again a hundred sixty-five point autofocus in-body stabilization both great for video and for sort of any low light or astrophotography. As far as lenses go i carry four lenses are three main lenses are the 16 to 35 f4 zeiss the 24-70 f4 Zeiss and the 70-200 f4 sony.  This gammet it has really been with me for a very long time even when I shot canon this was the range of lenses that i use it covers everything from architectural photography, and landscape photography all the way up to portraiture so with these three lenses you you're set for any kind of situation when you're out there traveling I've recently added the rokinon 14 mil 2.8 to my arsenal mainly just for astrophotography i'm starting to get into that this is quite economical it like 250 bucks its sharp from edge to edge 14 mil gives me a better field of view So, with all of this stuff i can shoot all my travel photography I can to portraiture as well as astrophotography so this kit sort of includes everything that you need to shoot while you're on the road.  And you may be thinking oh you know if you're a professional photographer you want that extra stop of light with a you know a much faster glass at 2.8 but i have found with the with the iso performance in low-light performance of both cameras that it's negligible. if you're looking to purchase any of these products or look for any more information on them check in the description below i'll put a link to every single one of them leave a message in the comments if you like if you have any questions I'll get back to you as soon as I can so what do I carry all this gear in? well i've been using the same bag for about four years now and i absolutely love it it's the f-stop Loka. h Here's what she looks like right here what I love about this bag is that the front part is not how you access the bag it's from the back so it prevents for any theft or anything like that and especially for doing adventure photography what is great about it is that you can lay this part down on the snow or wherever you are wet ground and access all your camera gear from the back so that when you actually put it back on your back to take off your back not all wet so the inside of this is great you can see opened up like this and it runs on a insert system so you can buy three different-sized inserts so that depending on what kind of camera system you have and you can these inserts come in and out so if you have you know just a small set of that you're taking with you can have another insert put it in here there's still room for a coat and a bunch of other things in the top it's a it's very comfortable and you can throw a water holder in there as well as got you know for a camelbak or something like that for an adventure photographer travel photographer excellent excellent bag you can't talk travel photography and not talk a little bit about filters i should a lot of long exposure photographs you know to get that streaky water or those streaky clouds in the sky and there's certain tools that allow me to do that I use a particular filter system which is the format hitech system i recommend you check them out it's a it's a it's a square filter system is very quick to implement and very versatile comes with a holder you have different mounts like this for different-size lenses and also mounts for circular polarizers. For me i carry a range of filters i have graduated ND filters a 3, a 6 and a 9 which allows me to actually keep the sky dark where the foreground can stay properly exposed it allows me to balance out those exposures now when you're looking for that streaky effect or you know that is a very smooth water than ND filters are what you're looking for I carry two I carry a 10 stop ND which allows me to actually get that effect during the day. It stops a lot of light coming in which allows me to slow down the shutter speed and I also carry a 6-stop ND which is more for maybe dusk or something like that if i want to streak lights,  or if I'm shooting where I want to slow down the water in a cloudy situation. I use the Firecrest Model of their filters there's almost no color cast their little bit expensive but well worth it once you see if you're getting into the the heavier ND filters like this you really want to look for something that doesn't have a color cast because you don't want to have to be dealing with that in Photoshop in post another little thing I like to carry is a polarizer this is a circular polarizer which fits on the front of this mount so the whole system goes together this allows me to punch up the colors a little bit more or even give me a stop and a half more neutral density if I'm using it in combination with one of these so if you're into landscape photography and looking for those kind of effects, I highly recommend a filter system like the formatt hitech system I can't talk about travel photography and not talk about tripods I've used quite a few tripods in my days and found that it's worth paying extra money for a piece of gear that you're going to have for a longer amount of time I've recently purchased last year The Gitzo GT 2542 mountaineer series it's a carbon fiber tripod again quite expensive at like 800 bucks but when i look at all the money that i spent on other tripod that I've had to go through and they haven't really cut the mustard then spending the money on a quality product like this really has its advantages i'll probably have this forever has a lifetime warranty it's super durable at excellent excellent tripod and I use that in combination with a manfrotto head this is the MH 54 Q5 Head I like to use a ball head just because it's so much more versatile in any situation i can use for quick framing anything like that ball has really good it's made of magnesium so it's super durable put these two together and they are a little bit the head is a little bit heavy definitely but it's worth carrying a little bit extra weight to get those super steady shot. I just wanted to quickly touch on accessories these are not necessary things but they're things that I carry. I have an underwater housing for the sony rx100 IV.  Fantastic forr kayaking or any kind of water activities I also carry a cable release i know that Sony has you can do this through apps but i find using the release is what I'm used to it does a really great job and it's this is this is quite cheap it's the Vello Shutterboss II fits right in there allows you to timelapses and long exposures and things like that without having to touch the shutter button i should also look into if you're looking for straps the blackrapid system these are the top-of-the-line almost everybody i know uses them they're versatile they screw right into the tripod mount in the bottom of your camera and they're very very comfortable when you're talking memory cards we carry quite a ton i would say i wouldn't travel with any less than 10 just because they're so we have so many different cameras and such this little case here hard case I recommend for carrying all your memory cards in keeps them safe keep them from getting lost which I have lost mine many many times so these accessories are again not things that you necessarily need but they make your photography a little more comfortable and more convenient a little bit more safe and keep your equipment actually safe so that should do it that's a look at our travel photography gear and what we carry while we're on the road if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to our channel we do new videos every Sunday 
Did you know Jamaica has crocodiles? well they do and we're going to see them on the black river safari we've been on safari for about five minutes and already seen three crocodiles, awesome so we've just had a great tour here on the Black River but we also in the crocodile nursery they have put 78 crocodiles back into the wild and most of the crocodiles in here have been rescued from backyards or on the road or they've been through some fights and they're nursing them at the health some will be released and some are not fit to go back into the wild so they will go to other facilities but it's pretty incredible to see 
Hey everybody welcome to drinking with Dave. Today we're going to make a classic Canadian cocktail Actually what i would call the Canadian cocktail Which is a Bloody Caesar Now it is similar to a Bloody
Mary but women better and the things But way better And the that you're going to need to make this cocktail are the following You will need Mott's Clamato juice yes not tomato juice clam and tomato juice you will need work Worchestershire sauce you will need some Tabasco sauce to spice it up 'cause it's a spicy cocktail You will need celery sticks And the most important thing what really really makes a Caesar is celery salt So you'll need this for the rim oh yes and there's one thing that you
can't forget this is not a virgin bloody caesar It is a Bloody Caesar So you will need Vodka Which I love Why is this such a great drink? well I think what makes it a great drink
is two things like I said the rim and how its put together. As well as the
secret ingredient which is Clamato Juice. Now if you're going to make this
really, to make a perfect Caesar you have to have a big tall beer
glass that's how I like to do it anyway and before you put the ice in it or
anything like that you need to set the stag. By set the stage I mean you've
gotta put the rim on So how we gonna do that? Well we need to
get that celery salt on this rim of the glass. First thing you do is you have a
plate with water in it that's going to wet the rim and then the other plate with
your celery salt you just dip it in and voila you have a celery salted rim which
in my opinion is what makes is what a Caesar. Once you've done that can get in and throw
your ice. I like to use these but the ice just falls out so I'm going my fingers. I consider myself a bit of
a you know Caesar connoisseur I've been drinking them for quite a long time now.
I've drank so many different kinds of one spicy ones not so spicy ones ones
with beans you can really do whatever you want with this to make it your own as long as you have the main ingredients.
So once you have your lovely ice and your rimmed glass you want to add the
important stuff the alcohol this is a shot and a half of alcohol sometimes you can put more sometimes you can put less. Now, you've got the vodka in there now the next thing you need to do is you
gotta spice it up this is where the spices coming because it's got to get on
the ice see and it also has to mix with the vodka so we start with Lea &amp; Perrin's Worchestershire Sauce. Usually you use it for steaks are cooking. I put about six dabs
that is it a little bit of a tanginess. then you want to spice it up course with
our tabasco sauce again to taste to me I'm spicy kind of guy so 1,2,3,4,5,6 I'm
going to eight, 10. I'm going 10 is going to be one spicy season which I know once
that's done i like to move it around and get all those spices with the ice and
the vodka in there so it all mixes together what makes this
quintessentially Canadian well it is this. Clamato juice because who else
would think to put clam juice and tomato juice together than Canadians. Yes it's
true it sounds gross right sounds awful really if someone came out to being
offered me a clam juice I probably walk away. Even if it had alcoholic but mix it
with tomato juice and it becomes a yummy drink even on its own but much better in
a Caesar so first we're going to shake Shake it on up get on up gotta mix all the clam juice
and tomato juice together to get all that clammy goodness. One note this also
comes in regular and spicy so if you don't have the spices to put the caesar
you can get a spicy Clamato juice. Next thing you gotta do is you gotta stir it
in Canada who stir sticks? who need spoons? I don't need that i'm using a
celery stalk because you know what this isn't just a drink it's a meal so take this celery stock give
that a stir oh yeah there you go. That stays green
red very colorful drink and finally you can garnish it with whatever you want to
see that garnish with hot beans in gardens with lines from my bartending
days. That goes on there that and boom ladies and gentlemen there you have the
classic Canadian cocktail The Bloody Caesar One other thing is when you get
this cocktail at a restaurant or your order anywhere even to have it home a
lot of times it's over with a straw I take the straw of why because the key
to tasting in the beautiful sumptuous taste of a Caesar is getting the celery salt
in. So you give the lime squeeze you want to get that in there yeah and it goes a little stir with your
celery stick and then make sure you get Like this see? You get the celery and the
drink all in at once. Oh baby that's good. Man and you know what does not a summer cocktail it's no a winter cocktail it's an all-year-round Canadian cocktail You got a drink you got a meal got some clam juice and
some celery what more could you want?   
well good day everybody it's a beautiful
afternoon and we are here to talk to you about our favorite travel movies Dave
and I spend a lot of time on planes and we binge watch a lot of TV series but we
also love movies we love watching movies to see and get inspired about the places
that we're going to travel to we love watching movies to remind us of the
places that we've already been hey we just love watching movies that inspire
travel so we're going to count down our favorites for you today let it begin let
the countdown begin here we go well by far my favorite
travel movie has to be planes trains and automobiles now you might be thinking
well that's not really an inspirational movie or a very deep movie but the
performances in this movie with John Candy and mr. Martin are absolutely
fantastic it had me rolling in the aisles it reminds me a lot of you know a
traveler that you don't want to sit beside or travel with and it's it's
hilarious especially when John Candy takes off his shoes and socks in the
plane that is worth watching that movie one of my favorite travel movies is
Julie and Julia I'm a huge Meryl Streep fan so of course I love her but I also
love the fact that this is about Julia Child and cheese and France cooking food
and it really makes you just want to eat French food I also have a soft spot for
this because it's about Julia the other Julia is a blogger Dave and I are travel
bloggers so it was like you know the old days of travel blogging where every
single day you updated your post about your daily life so it was really
inspiring I love that movie if you're going to France and you love food check
it out I  have to mention one week it was a very popular Canadian movie with
Joshua Jackson in it you would know him from Dawson's Creek yep Pacey from Dawson's
Creek and he goes on her I don't want to get the the the whole premise of it away
but he goes on on this inspiring road trip all across Canada stopping at all
these crazy monuments that are like all across our country which a lot of people
don't know about like giant moose or a giant nickel all these kind of things
and it's it's sort of a journey of transformation and it is an incredibly
inspirational movie and again his performance in that
is great you don't have to be Canadian to enjoy this movie either I think it
transcends all countries okay one of my favorite movies based in Europe is in
Bruges with Colin Farrell and brendan gleeson I just love this movie because
it's it's a kind of a caper Colin Farrell he's a hitman who has a job that
goes bad and they have to go hide out in Bruges and the whole time is really
funny because they they put it in in a clever way Colin Farrell's character he
hates Bruges he's always like I hate Bruges and then brendan gleeson is going
through touring Bruges so you get to see the beauty of the city and see the the
hitman going I hate it here I'm stuck in this lousy town but brendan gleeson
going i love it here let's talk about the the all of the beauty of the city
it's also one that I really I sort of I really fell in love with Colin Farrell
in that one I think I probably one of his best performances really I think
it's his best performance I really hated him when he did Miami Vice and no shoes
no socks and yeah exactly he did some really oh my god she did Alexander that
was a really terrible movie but when he did in Bruges I was back on the Colin
Farrell team I loved him now you can't do a travel movie list without
mentioning the bucket list oh definitely one of the great ones most definitely
Morgan Freeman Jack Nicholson and it's basically it's the first time I ever
heard the term the bucket list I don't think it was very popular before that no
I think people had life list and inspirational lists but when it came out
the bucket list and when when Morgan Freeman what he described it when Jack
Nicholson's like what the heck is a bucket list
he's like everything I want to do before it kicks the bucket I thought it was
perfect perfect it really is and that's why we have that phrase around today
yeah it's really an emotional movie it's funny it's uplifting and it really gets
you inspired to go out there and live life to the fullest most definitely here's an oldie but a goodie and it really stands the test of time
Romancing the Stone I just think the chemistry between Kathleen Turner and
Michael Douglas it's outstanding I love that she's a
novelist of romance novelists and she always lives just in her head but then
she has to go on this great adventure and I'm telling you I know so many
people that want to go to Cartegena just because of Romancing the Stone the
next movie that is on our list is the Secret Life of Walter Mitty now I'll
tell you the truth I wasn't overly keen on seeing this movie I was like I might
be okay but Ben Stiller at this time I think he had kind of run his course
didn't find him that funny well after I saw it I thought it was
done so perfectly just all the places that he visits and if you're a traveler
you are definitely gonna love this movie the underlying story about why he's
going to all these places is fantastic you have to watch the movie to find that
out but again it's something that inspires you to want to get out there
and travel and explore the world and that's what all these movies are about
right they want they inspire you to get out there and travel and see the
beauties that this planet has to offer a movie that I really enjoyed was the Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel it took me a long time to to get Dave to watch it he
wouldn't watch it with me he wasn't interested in it but it was really great
because it showed that you're never too old to have an adventure and I really
felt that it captured India well like the really positive side all of these
seniors going and having this adventure in India just really good and Dev Patel
he's the owner of the Marigold Hotel and he lures all of these really lures all
of these seniors there and kind of takes them but then they become friends and
then it becomes this great heartwarming Dev Patel actually is the center
of a lot of great movies about India Slumdog Millionaire is one of my
favorite movie it's just a spectacular movie Academy award-winning and it
really captures the true nitty grittyness of India but also the beauty of it
all and it makes you really want it it's kind of the flip side of the marigold
hotel right it shows the two different sides of India and how contrasting it
really is yeah and I recently watched Lyon with Dev Patel again it's got the
trifecta here but there's something about when you see it you still want to
go in and feel that and experience that because India is such a different exotic
place and hey it made you want to go to Australia that too you know that first
scene when he comes out when he's surfing and you see us Joe
like I want to live there he's a lucky dude another movie that I love that is a
lot about travel is into the wild now I originally read the book and then went
to go see the movie I thought the movie was a good interpretation of the
book Sean Penn did a really great job directing it and it did a I mean it
showcases the beauty of Alaska which we've been a few times and I absolutely
loved it out there it's gorgeous I think that what's great about it is it delves
into the psyche of why people travel or why they go on these adventures and
maybe that's why I related so much to this movie in especially at least the
first half of the movie I really it really hit home to me and that's one of
the reasons why it's on this list because it does anything that pulls at
your heartstrings or has relevance to your life you know is obviously gonna
have an impact right speaking of Jon Krakauer he's a he's a
writer of into the wild another one that I really loved was Everest yes
I thought that Everest it was a real big-budget Hollywood who doesn't love
Jake Gyllenhaal I'm sorry I loved him I thought he was great in that we climb
down Mount Everest base camp a few years ago and when they were going through
nancy bazaar and the tea houses and they're in Katmandu i was so excited for
it it was I thought it was a good movie I thought that it really makes you want
to go to Nepal maybe not go and climb Everest I maybe go to base camp and do a
we did it gets a great feel and you don't have the dangerous of dying
especially those opening scenes in that movie like you know the helicopter shots
and all that stuff that really shows you what what the Himalayas look like it I
thought it really gave you a great sense of what it would feel like to be there well we just came back from Africa so I have to at least mention one movie that
I loved from Africa there's many but one that makes this list is Tarzan I was
totally surprised I did not want to see this movie I thought it looked cheesy I
thought it looks stupid and then we watched and I was like that was fabulous
it really was it was a great interpretation of the story of Tarzan
and it again it got to showcase the beauty of Africa and uh unto itself like
the movie is a great story but pair that with the visuals of where they are in
Africa and ma you want to run to that continent right away and speaking of Africa one of my favorites of all time is Out of Africa
with Meryl Streep and Robert Redford and it's a classic and it's worth watching
it's just nothing can go wrong with Meryl Streep everything she plays is
perfection and she's once again perfect in this she's a married baroness who she
can't fall in love with Robert Redford but she falls in love with Robert
Redford they have this unrequited love they can't be together great chemistry
between those two as well you can never go wrong with a young Robert Redford now you can't do a travel list of movies were talking about up in the air Clooney
in this movie just encapsulates what it's like to travel frequently for a
living which we really relate to you know going to those airports picking
scanning to how to be in the right line at the right time what to do how to pack
all that kind of stuff he covers it all in this movie in a great performance as
well I have a real soft spot for under the Tuscan Sun Dave and I just spent
some time in Tuscany this year and all I could do would keep referencing under
the Tuscan Sun first I love the book I read that first and then we went and
rented the movie with Diane Lane and I think she's fabulous she's one of the
most underrated actresses I just love her I think she's great and she's it's
about a woman who her husband had an affair she left him and then she moved
to Tuscany to open a villa and we met the actual real villa woman yes Elena a
Borgo Argentine and Tuscany just go to her villa and you are going to
experience the real under the Tuscan Sun but anyway that's a fantastic movie and
speaking of more movies like that where people make a switch yeah I'm a fan of
also a Good Year now this was really different for Russell Crowe this was
early just a little while after gladiator and all that stuff so it came
in all dumpy and fat we're kind of used to it yeah but hey I think it was all
that French wine he was drinking so he's this rich hotshot guy from London and he
inherits a vineyard in Provence from his uncle and it's a great story about how
he adapts to moving down there and he just goes to sell it but then of course
he falls in love with the French you know and it's a great movie about wine
and grapes and it just makes you want to
learn about the art of drinking wine which I think we Dave and I are pretty good
at we can drink it no problem Alright before we go we're gonna do some quick
honorable mentions because there are so many great movies out there what can we
do quick Dave what's one of one of your quick ones that you
The Bourne series goes all over the world travels all over the world great
adventure got to be in there well speaking of spies I think any of the
James Bonds of course especially the new ones with Daniel Craig I'm a huge
fan of that but the new ones I really just want to go around the world and
travel and be rich I want to go to Casino Royale I want to gamble I want to
walk off the beach looking gorgeous it just makes me want to travel me too and
you can't forget Indiana Jones you know he travels all over the world in those
adventures Harrison Ford is fantastic in them and it just makes you want to be an
adventure I want to get myself a fedora and a whip and travel that way so

Wow, Tivoli Gardens is beautiful
Especially at night. They have a pantomime, they have a laser light
shows. It's all lit up all of the gardens. You really have to come here. Tivoli Gardens is the second oldest amusement
park in the world opening in 1843 It's located in the heart of Copenhagen and
it's not to be missed. Especially at night. Now we're heading down the midway. Time for some fun. Walt Disney modelled his parks after Tivoli Visiting the parks several times before opening Disneyland. Let's go see what's in here. It's the funhouse mirrors. There it goes! Tivoli Gardens is way better than I expected. I thought it was going to be a little bit
cheesy. But when I walked in, it's beautiful. It's quite magical actually. 
hey everybody today we're going to be talking to you about something that is close to Devon eyes heart and that is responsible travel and we're going to talk to you about all the different ways that you can make your travels more responsible and meaningful when you travel the world recently Dave and I took the pledge to reduce our plastic waste the world Travel and Tourism Council is trying to get people to make the world a better place by doing little things that can make a huge difference because when there are millions of people out there being more responsible we can make the world a better place I think everybody knows that plastic is a huge problem in the world I remember seeing it the first time when we were traveling in Asia when we were in Cambodian some guy gave us we asked for a coke and he took the coke poured it into a plastic bag put a plastic straw on it threw the can in the river and gave us the plastic bag and when we looked over at the river it was just like just a sea of plastic bag so it's been a problem for a very long time I know that a lot of people think when they're traveling they can't do a lot when it comes to plastic but you do not have to drink bottled water even if you are worried about contaminated water there are ways that you can do it without having to bind plastic bottled water one of the ways that you can do it is there's a ton of water purifiers out there you can either get tablets the SteriPEN or you can get an actual water bottle that has a filtration system in it which is what we really recommend because it's refillable you can bring it with you wherever you go and it gives you access to clean water no matter where you are yeah life straw is very popular and we use the katadyn system you fill it with water and then you sleeve the water through a filtration system and when you drink it you have pure water so you don't have to have all of those plastic bottles just going into the oceans another thing we recommend is to bring your own canvas bag so when you go down to the store and they offer you a plastic bag then you can just put it in your own little canvas bag kind of like you do at home already you know you can't really get plastic bags in a lot of places so why not carry on that tradition when you're traveling this is a huge problem in developing countries when we're recycling Africa we saw so many thorn trees just covered in plastic bags it was really sad to see and a lot of that is because of tourists it's us that are really contributing to the filth and the mess out there something that is really close to our heart is wildlife we have seen wildlife be abused and traumatized and troubled by tourism in the past and it's time that we as tourism's really start taking responsibility yeah definitely one of the main things out there that have been really been in the news is elephant rides whether it be in Thailand or any other of those or India or any of the other Asian countries you know please if you can don't ride elephants or if you're going to go and to see elephants and you want to see them in the wild or you want to see them go to a sanctuary we did that when we were in Thailand where they take rescued elephants that have been abused or that were former logging elephants and then and tourists riding elephant here as well they were they were saved and they were brought into a sanctuary so that they could live out their life in peace once and for all and your tourist dollars go to actually helping the elephants rather than harming them so make sure you do your research and find out you know what travel company are going with or that they do offer elephant rides and make sure to ask the questions and say hey you know what I don't agree with this and I'm not going to take the tour because of that because if we all take a stand then we could all make a change another thing that is very popular out there is swimming with dolphins if you see enclosed dolphins and they offer rides where you can go and swim with the dolphins and ride on their fins and get involved and up close and personal with them just don't do it Dave and I have swam with dolphins many times in the wild and you know what they love human encounters when they have the choice if you are out in the wild and you're in the middle of the ocean and dolphins see you they're going to come and they're going to play with you and circle around you and jump up and down so if you do swim with dolphins do it when you're out on a snorkeling excursion but please do not touch them do not reach out just let them come to you so it really comes down to two things it comes down to one you actually speaking up and saying something and to doing your research and making sure that the companies that you're going with in the tour operators are going with our environmentally friendly and they're not you know harassing or corralling the animals as well if we all do yeah we've seen that where they're like trying to corral them into one area for tourists or you know the cheese from the bar or chasing them are getting too close there's so many ways that you can affect an animal in a satchel habitat and you know they don't necessarily have a voice when you do so up speaking up and telling the operators and telling the tour companies that is not okay will help that change yeah so keep your distance go out to the wildlife and observe and if they come to you and they're curious that's great but please don't chase them another way that you can contribute to responsible travel is to make sure that you hired local guides I know when we climb Mount Kilimanjaro we hired local guides when we went up to Mount Everest base camp we made sure we had local guides that we hired right there on the ground so you're employing and actually contributing directly to the local economy so there's nothing wrong with going with a tour company we do it all the time we're going to Africa with go-ahead tours and we know that they hire local guides because we did a trip to Scandinavia with them where we had our one local guide Derek who is fantastic he was from Europe but every time we got to a different country or city in Scandinavia a local guide joined us and they told us about the local customs and they led the group and it was amazing and I think that's really important to talk about our company and say do you hire local guides on the ground and do you support the local economy and that's a really important thing to do another way that you can contribute to traveling responsibly is to honor local customs I can't tell you how many times I have gone into temples and Thailand or Burma Myanmar you know where you know women and men are not dressed appropriately just because they haven't taken the time to educate themselves on the local customs and and local religion and you don't really to be able to go in and see these places is one thing but you have to honor their way of life now we talk about water at the beginning but I just want to talk about a little bit more especially when you're traveling to countries where you know water is an issue or lack of water is an issue you can do your best to conserve water you don't have to be in there and take a 20 minute shower in a place like Sudan where they're struggling for water try and limit your showers down to maybe three minutes four minutes or you know what just don't take less showers you don't have to shower every single day especially when you're traveling unless you really want to offend your spouse no do your best to conserve water while you're traveling another thing you can do is to support the local economy I find that a lot of times people are stuck on the resort or stuck on the cruise ship and they only seem to good buy their drinks on the cruise and their food at the resort and they don't get out and support the local economy but you know what those street vendors and those local shops they depend on your money and you're going to get something way more authentic and that's just a lot of heart and soul went into it and you're going to save a lot of money so to sum up traveling responsibly there are so many things you can do just think about the local customs think about the wildlife think about the conservation and the nature of the area you know it's just common sense the way you want your home to be is exactly how you want your travels to be so we hope that we gave you some ideas on how you can make the world a better place and go to our website and read about it there's a link below about how we are taking the pledge and we give you other ideas about how you can take the pledge as well and if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe and come

our private ride when Cajun encounters there's the waiting area and the boat launch tour the Louisiana swamp tour is one of the most popular tours out of New Orleans we booked a private VIP boat tour with Cajun encounters that lasted two hours it took us along the Pearl River and into the back water swamp a [Music] fun stop is to see the wild pigs that have become domesticated after learning they could be fed if they stopped by to see the tourists there's a lot of wildlife on the river it's not only beautiful scenery but we saw Gators which are abundant in the summertime we saw fish eagles nesting cranes and nutrients now nutria is our giant River Rex they're very cute but they are an invasive species in the area [Music] [Music] one of the most fascinating parts of the tour was seeing the people who live on the Bayou some people live here full-time while others use it for weekend escapes fishing camps and for hunting all of the camps have electricity electric wells for water and septic tanks so it's pretty cool to learn about all of this Cajun encounters flat bottom boats are more eco friendly than the airboats offered by other tours they don't disturb the swamp life below and they have less noise pollution but the ride is still fast and thrilling and you cover a lot of ground our guy Jacob was knowledgeable and friendly and we had a great time learning about the floral and fauna of the area as he shared his expertise it has no root into the soil we don't have any freezes like a couple years in though freezes this was also great it just brown slightly like a plum that's called an apples apple snail okay another note for detail [Music] cooking with Bailey's that's awesome you just cut it right here [Music] we highly recommend this tour it's a great way to get out of the city and enjoy a little bit of the Louisiana bayou had a great time here on our swamp tour with Cajun encounters [Music] 
that's good eh? yeah yeah that's good Oh Canada! oh so patriotic it is hey everybody we are celebrating Canada's 150th birthday this weekend and we are so excited because Canada's getting old old by our standards but not by everybody else's I don't think yeah exactly and to celebrate we thought that we would teach you how to speak Canadian because we're a little bit different up here in the
great white north and if you come to visit us you might get a little bit confused by the way we speak well these things that we're going to go through today will teach you a few words a few a few phrases a few how to say a few things so when you do come up here you will fit in the first word we want to
teach you is something that every Canadian uses from birth I think it's
the first word I said when I spoke it is the word eh there was a dramatic pause there that was a very dramatic pause you have to learn how to say the word eh properly everybody always puts emphasis on eh and it shouldn't be that it should just be a easy flow with the sentence exactly and when you use the word eh it's just to add a question to something so if you're asking a question we just put eh at the end of it like if you meet me and you find out I'm Canadian
you can come up to me when we're traveling and say oh so you're Canadian eh? so let's do a little bit of a breakdown of the words that you need to know when you come to Canada ok Dave, What do Canadians call a backpack a knapsack ok what do we call a couch a chesterfield Chesterfield what do we call the letter
that comes after Y Zed what do we call underwear gitch it's true well let's move on to something a little more sensible ok do we have Do we have any sense up here? of course sticking with the tradition of
shortening things when we go to the beer store and we want to buy a case of beer what
do we ask for well we asked for a 2/4 because there's 24 beers in a case of
beer now most people call it a case or I know in Australia they call it a flat a
beer and they get a really good laugh out of us calling it two four but that's
just logical if there's 24 beer I get a case of two
four and I'm going to drink for the weekend and then you know what's even
better is we have a long weekend at the beginning of every summer that is a
queen Victoria's birthday its Victoria Day It's what the traditional name is
called but Canada calls it My 2-4 Weekend we know that we pick up a 2/4 of
beer and then we go up to the cottage we grab a Timmy's on the way because it's
always a three-hour drive to the cottage because everywhere you go in Canada is a long drive and then we drink our beer all May to for a weekend long ok what's Timmy's is our National Coffee store yeah it's our coffeehouse It's our really that like at national source of pride a Canadian icon started at hockey player Tim Horton only do you need to know that it's
called Timmy's but you have to know how to order when you go If you pull up to
a drive-through Dave what do you order? i order a large double-double you're probably going what the heck is a large double-double well it's a large coffee
with two cream and two sugars oh yeah that's Canadian slang a large
double-double what's next Deb I would say the next thing that Canadians have a pet peeve with is when people say to us oh you're Canadian eh are you gonna go oot and aboot Canadians do not say and
aboot no that does not feel good on the ears don't I'll ever say that We say oat and a-boat that's how we talk about it's more back in the throat oat you know and about is more like a boat not a boot Not a boot you put on your foot But a boat that you go rowing in yeah that's exactly it. so it's aboat four o'clock that's how we say it not it's a boot four o'clock so let's hear everybody is
said about four I just said a boot What do we call a small bottle of booze a Mickey 375 mil what do we call a brown-noser a a keener you're a keener what do you call a guy's potbelly why that's a Molson muscle and why you call it a molson muscle well because
we're very good at drinking beer our beer is made by Molson and hey it does a good job of building up this muscle they work very yeah the men up here work
really hard on that Molson Muscle there's a little bit of pride there now I thought the whole world knew that we called our $1 coin a loonie I thought so too. but I was telling some people when we were in Istanbul a couple months ago and they were like you call your currency a loonie? and this is what a loonie is people it's our one dollar coin Dave why do Canadians call our one dollar coin
a loonie? well you know it's actually for a really good reason because in Canada as you know we're very practical it's call things what they actually are it's because on our loonie is an actual picture of a loon. a loon is a bird that goes, coo coo Well, the call of the loon So when you're sitting on your deck at your cottage consuming
one of your two fours Or perhaps perhaps having a Timmy's you can listen to the call of the Loon oh I know one other thing. okay it's washroom oh yes that's what we call our toilets up here it's not toilet
it's not bathroom It's not ladies room, it's not powder room it's not water closet there's so many
different names it's actually washroom yeah we call it a washroom because you go in there you go to the washroom and you wash your hands we call trainers I guess
or sneakers or tennis shoes runners yeah any sort of athletic type
shoes is called a runner up here so you can run in any type of athletics shoe we're not we're not prejudiced against what kind of shoes you wear no we call it all the same I call them running shoes tat's what I personally calls them all my
life like I said I need a new pair of running shoes not sneakers I never ever called them sneakers now we don't just have the loonie Toonie came about just because it sort of made sense and it rhymes with loonie what do we call macaroni and cheese that's KD I don't think anybody who
is not Canadian will guess what this word means are you ready pogie who knows what pogie means you know it's not like a stick you jump on it's not like uh uh the wiener on a stick no, pogie is our um, slang term it's a slang term for unemployment or social assistance yeah well no we don't call it social assistance up here we call it unemployment if you get laid off from work It's pogie. yeah, you go collect your pogie. okay the next thing that is very Canadian is something that we all wear in the wintertime we wear something called a tuque what a tuque is,  is it's a hat it's usually a wool hat or something very warm that comes down over your ears and usually it has a pom-pom on the top as well that's very very
Canadian and we call that a tuque so if you're wondering what a tuque is, it keeps your head warm and it's quite fashionable and one final word work on learning how to apologize apologize to a table if you run into it apologize to a pole if you run into it apologize to the person that runs into you that's what we do we always say I'm sorry to everything and that brings us to the end

[Music] one of the one of the beauties of being out here that you don't actually or at least myself I didn't quite realize until I actually got out here was sort of leaving everything behind you know there's there's nothing out here you can't you can't there's no cell signal there's no internet you only have yourself and the people you're traveling with to rely on and I think that allows allows you or at least it allowed me to get an introspective into myself you know [Music] hey everybody its Dave and out of the planet decom and we're in beautiful Northern Ontario and we're heading up to the missin Abbey to do some winter camping and tracking by all traditional methods I can't [Music] while we're just getting ready to get off the train here it's been yeah I guess about eight hours now that we've been on here and it's it's dark outside it's getting dark outside so you know the first day starting off with a little bit of excitement now we have to go and set up our first camp and we have no idea how to do in the dark yeah something I think that is really great about doing something like this is it takes you out of the comfort zone I have never used to saw before I have never wielded an asteroid and Here I am chopping down trees chopping wood I'm cutting boughs it was pretty amazing Lesley's going to teach me how to get water it's hard work man we have water look at that filling up one of the most exciting things about doing the mission Auggie you know your your trekking your your snowshoeing a hundred kilometers from one rail line to the next but you're doing it all by pulling your own gear you're doing it on a sled your camps aren't set up for you you come in and you help create that camp every single night you build your adventure as you go really is what it is the Portage's are different every single year you know you're slashing through the trees you know you're you're cutting your own path one of the things I was not very good at dealing with was the slush I literally can't move not only a slush a nightmare on your snow shoes it's also a nightmare on the bottom of your sleigh to collect snow and just slows down before coming on Laura the north I was really nervous about walking on ice and by the end of it here I was walking beside these streams of flowing water on these ice shelves and actually having a great time one of my favorite days was when we were just walking along Rapids and looking at the spectacular scenery and there was open water right beside me and I couldn't believe it that I wasn't terrified found for me that maybe my new normal temperature being out here is about -20 because I you know when I was out taking photos of the Stars which unto itself in it and then half a sphere like this where there's no light pollution you only have the glow of the tent you can see the Big Dipper Orion's belt and out there taking that all in it and it was you know it was minus 35 but I didn't actually I didn't actually feel it maybe I was you know warned by the scene that I was witnessing while I was photographing and it really was I was one of the most amazing nights hear your emotions go up and down like crazy one minute you're high the next minute you're low it is way below zero and I think that's what's important in life to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable because when you go back to your real life at home you start going you know I think I can survive this the device just survived 100 kilometers in the middle of 32 below weather in northern Canada sleeping on a lake I can survive anything I think one of the amazing things about doing an epic adventure like the lure of the north is that you come away with this feeling of accomplishment you know when you get to the end and you know you're there and everybody's high-fiving each other and you you realize what you've accomplished that's the stuff that makes you people you know every adventure that you do by pushing this off out of your comfort zone it just helps you build character that helps you build yourself you realize that you can do these things and you realize your ability then that in turn builds your confidence it builds you as [Music] you [Music]

the wings of the Kyrgzyk a nomadic people who have relied on the horse for two and
a half thousand years to carry yurts and people over mountains when visiting this
small yet proud Central Asian country you must take a horse trek into the
stunning Jyrgalan Valley Well we have arrived at our camp for the night in
this beautiful valley surrounded by horses what a great place to spend an
evening here in Kyrgyzstan and here's camp for the night and hey we
have a special guest it's my favorite time of the day here while trekking it's
tea time right guys we're at the top of the world here in
Kyrgyzstan let me tell you you don't realize how
sore you are until you get back on the horse from the day before so for westerners like me I gotta do my horse stretches in the morning ready a multi-day horse trek in Jyrgalan is not
easy the mountains are steep it's a very rocky trail and the high altitude trek
is hard on both the horse and the rider see how deep the mud is go to the right little rough for the horses we had to walk
now they're ready to go We're just herding some cattle just riding on horses and then some cattle
drive came through they're moving from the mountain down to warmer lands see you at the top nearly there off we go so we're on our way back from our  Boz-Uchuk Lake hike this is the Boz-Uchuk lake Trek that we did on horseback and
when we got here I guess it was around 5 o'clock 5 or 6 o'clock our guides told
us that the horses can't go to Boz-Uchuk lake but the problem is we have six
hours on a horse tomorrow and then that then we would also have a six hour round
trip of hiking so we're not going to be able to do it so sadly we're gonna miss
Boz-Uchuk Lake it's difficult for the horses to get here because one they
can't do too long of days they can't start later early in the morning because
of the wet wet grass so we have to start at 10:00 every day and then they're
quite slow going up and down the passes because it's extremely steep so you can
hike it faster and that's the way to see these lakes but Wow it is one beautiful
Trek anyway well the welcome-wagon is coming to say
goodbye

hey everybody hello we're here today to talk to you about some pretty cool travel gadget yes more specifically travel gadgets for the tech lover out there Dave and I are going to give you all the little tin bits that we use to keep our electronics happy and healthy when we're out on the roads I'm going to start because there is one gadget I can't live without and I seem to always carry it anyway and it is my portable USB charger I love this actually we carry two of them I seem to always carry them both so it's always carried in my bag and Dave goes can you charge this for me that's just the way I realize - hahaha yeah but anyway we carry two of these and they charge everything including our iPhones I love that it has two charges because we can charge both iPhones at the same time it charges all of your Sony camera systems it charges our GoPros and I love that you can get this anywhere you can get it at Walmart you can get it at Best Buy just pick it up look for the white block for charges and a flashlight and you're good to go we'll also make these easier for you as well all these will be listed with that link so you can get them off of Amazon again I'm sent right to your house if you want to as well now let's get into gadget Oh actually one thing that I can't travel without what I travel is music so one thing I make sure I always have with me is noise cancelling headphones these ones are beats by dre which are absolutely fantastic they're not only noise cancelling but they're rechargeable you can get the wireless version as well and you know what they're pretty damn stylish - I would say you look so sexy and pardon me oh yeah and you know what as a husband you can put these on and tune your wife right out it works oh it does your gardener that doesn't matter now the next thing I want to talk about is probably what I would consider the most popular travel gadget and that would be the Belkin mini surge protector what I love about this is that you know we carry a lot of electronics when we travel it's got three outlets that you can charge plus it's got two USB chargers in the top as well and it's surge protected so you don't have to worry about you know wherever you are around the world are getting power surge or anything like that and frying your equipment so it not only protects what allows you to charge tons of things it's small it fits anywhere to carry this wherever we go yeah and we have to have that plug into something now in the old days way back like maybe three or four years you know I used to carry a whole bunch of different plugs with me but now you can get a universal adapter and I love this baby this one's from Eagle Creek and it's good for any country in the world all in one place the thing I love about is everything just pulled out I put this out show you hold that so that you can get any type of country you're traveling to there to Europe of course another thing I like about this one is there are USB plugs as well so if you didn't know by now ah charging is a really big thing for us we carry a ton of charges with us because when I have everybody like we carry a lot of electronics so speaking of electronics that we want to charge one more one more plug we're going to plug one more thing and that is this a skoshe e 12 volt 2 USB adapter if you love road trips like we do then you got to get yourself one of these a small throat in there put it into your cigarette lighter adapter wherever you go because not all cars when you're renting cars wherever you are around the world will have USB power outlets so this keeps you cover so you can charge everything while you're driving all right let's move on to storage the most important thing I think whenever you're on vacation or traveling are the photos and the videos that you capture and everybody always wonders what we do with our photographs in our videos we don't just leave them on our cameras and in our computers we actually can't do something Dave can you tell everybody we make sure to bring a portable hard drive we use the LaCie 2 terabyte rugged hard drive because you know some people are clumsy and it can fall but this is protecting against Falls this is actually a raid system as well which I won't go into but all you need is a portable hard drive with you that you can backup all your photos on so something does happen at least you have a second copy of them and these are these are quite reasonable now as well yeah can attest I am the clumsy one and I've actually dented the thing before but all of our photographs survived so I highly recommend this I know firsthand that it is rugged man whatever you probably do need protection right now protection for your photos but also protection for your gadgets I can't recommend this enough I've tried a whole bunch of different cases for my phones but the light proof cases are absolutely fantastic I mean these things they're shockproof they're waterproof they're dirt still there Dave and Deborah's really we taken the lifeproof with a snorkeling we've taken a canyoning we've taken it all through water and we've done rock climbing with it you know and it's been durable and it actually survives falls from a high place as well getting drop just send it to us we'll put it through the cases so with all these gadgets you probably have a ton of charging cords right and they're you know they're always messy and you know that you're pulling them out of your wife's purse or she's pull them out of her purse and they're never organized you never know what they I carry everything super shocked I am I'm you're sure but I totally but we like to carry with us is these little gear ties now what they are is they are actually they form you can see they form like this so and they come in four or five different sizes and they're color-coded so what you can do is you can use them to wrap up your noise-cancelling headphones if you want any kind of chart your iPhone charger or smartphone charger camera chargers all that kind of stuff can be all kept nice and neat and organized with these little things that take up absolutely no space which is hugely important I always recommend bringing your own videos on the plane because I have flown all the way to China with a broken entertainment system not fun so bring your old iPad I was really upset I didn't have any movies loaded on my phone or my iPad and I was miserable for what 14 hours very upsetting Dave had the brothers fun sitting beside her on that flight separately and speaking of the iPhone that's what we use Dave and I use the iPhone 6 plus because it's the and we watch all of our movies on here we load up TV series and movies and videos and stuff for the plane and we plug in our noise canceling headphones and we watch our movies let's move into hiking and camping and fat country because there's a question we get a lot because we're in adventure travel vlogs that well what do you do when you're out there in the backcountry not only to keep your stuff charged but also just you know what sort of equipment do you bring with you so for charging we do bring what we talked about before the couple of these but we've recently discovered the power add which is a solar charge power bank so it doesn't have the the two USB slots on there just one couple Harry Kim yeah but when you're out there in the backcountry and you for quite a while anything that solar that's compact like this and like you know that is really a backpackers or a hikers best friend so you can keep all your stuff charged with this solar power bank I love it something I highly recommend carrying to keep your electronics safe is a dry bag we used to not carry one with us and we found it has become so important when we're traveling we hook it to kayaks when we're traveling when we've gone to holy in the Holi festival in India this has been a great thing to just set all of our electronics in so it doesn't get dirty and wet I think a dry bag is a really important thing to have to keep all of your electronics handy and if you're in the backcountry of course yeah sure you'll have a waterproof backpack but isn't it just a little nicer to know that your electronics are safe in an actual dry bag but no backcountry trip will be complete without a great headlamp and I found that these are not only great for when you're camping or in the backcountry but hey if you're staying you know in budget accommodation where there's you know the lights are turned off at night or you know it's on a generator or anything like that this can help you get around it's better than trying to carry your iPhone with it's light on it it keeps things hands-free bring some rechargeable batteries use lithium batteries in the mid well as well if you can because they last longer especially if you're going to be and if you're anything like us you probably have a lot of photos that you take that you go through when your vacation is over and one thing that we like to do is we like to keep our memory cards organized our favorite thing is this memory card holder I just love it if I could open it it would even be better and look at this baby holds 16 if you call the micro and the regular SD card so you can hold quite a bit of memory in here baby and it's protective it's hard face baby Deb proof so that should do it those are all the travel caddies that we carry with us when we travel them we recommend you carry with you and for more travel tips make sure you subscribe to our channel as we post new videos every single week now

it's bloggers rally Bucharest. We going to get in some rally cars and race around the track I'm at a Titi Aur Academy and I'm going into the impact simulator I'm so excited This is really cool because what it is it's
about safety and getting you used to crashing, so now I know what to expect if I get in a car crash. you don't want to do it um close your mouth so you don't bite your tongue Oh my! okay I have to close my mouth not to bite my tongue what was I thinking? I am nervous Woah Woah Woah Wow you really feel it holy cow1 Like it was nervous going up, then calm then shock and then all the energy like all of your
adrenaline you just start laughing it's pretty funny Alright getting ready for the role simulator Ive seen it in action little bit nervous but I think it looks pretty cool too. Woah it feels so weird. Oh! oh, Wow that is so heavy oh wow that was amazing. You really get a feeling for how much the power that seatbelt has  and you can trust it and then you see how hard it would be to push open the door great lesson to learn definitely Do I have to get out upside down? Oh This is really important to take one these courses no matter where you are trying and do that because the minute you get into a car accident your instinct is to get out as fast as possible now we know to stop, think and think about not releasing your seat belt too soon. or you can break your neck so that's a really good learning lesson. that was totally different that was stressful. I got a little claustrophobic. So Dave's drinking and driving okay so you're drunk yeah? imagine. Turn a little bit. here is the ball I have the ball. it should be right in front of me. this is this is what it feels like when you have four or five beers and you're trying to get your is your bearings you can't so the lesson here is don't drink and drive or play football okay we are going to be learning the side slip we're outside now a we've moved on from the simulator Oh the fun begins now fully left Woo! Woah Women are better at this! I did good all right we're going on two wheels it is really exciting here we go! here we go Oh, this is crazy look at we're driving. okay here we go Oh my God this is crazy is absolutely nuts now let's put it back here we go we're coming back. woohoo woohoo guys love it wild We had a great day at Academia Titi Aur If you come to Bucharest, you gotta do this 
So one of the things you have to do when you
come to the Cayman Islands is come out to Stingray City. You get to hold them, Feed them, and get up
and close and personal with these beautiful creatures. And I also recommend, if you are going to
do it, you also come with Cayman Luxury Charters. it's really great, they have a beautiful SeaDoo
on the back and they really really help you get up and close and have that personal experience
with these beautiful creatures. That was amazing
they're just so calm and docile here, you can just hold them for all day
Hey beautiful day here in the Cayman Islands. 
we have a very important topic to talk
to you about today it is the importance of why you need travel insurance now a
lot of people don't think about travel insurance when they're when they're
heading out on even a short trip or a long trip really but we're here to tell
you that you definitely need it and we know from firsthand experience yeah Dave broke his back in the Amazon a couple of years ago yes he did and if we didn't
have insurance it would have cost us well over $100,000 and we'd still be
paying that sucker off right now but because we have travel insurance we had
medical evacuation we have hospital stays covered we had x-rays and CT scans
everything was covered and we I had it all under our insurance otherwise if we
didn't we either a would have been paying all of that in a pocket or even
worse what many people do is think well maybe it's not so bad maybe he just has
a really badly bruised back for everything and maybe we'll just try and
get ourselves back to Canada it wouldn't have worked he had a broken back you
broke two vertebrae in your back and thank God for health insurance because
you have a full recovery I did I'm standing here today though most people
think oh well that'll never happen to me I'm not gonna break my back you know did
you do it doing some adventure obviously cuz we're adventures no all I was doing
was stepping into a boat and I happened to slip and fall backwards and hit my
back on a metal stair so it can happen doing anything anywhere that's why it's
great to have the best coverage when you're away you don't want to be stuck
with those medical bills like Deb said for the rest of your life
and it doesn't have to be something also it doesn't have to be something that is
super serious you know I know this happened to Deb brother he was down in
Florida you know dad down in the US and he slipped and broke his fall with his
hands you know didn't hurt anything but about an hour later his wrist wrist all
swelled up and he had to go to the hospital to get it looked at and if he
didn't have medical insurance we all know what the cost can be in the US and
he was covered so even though he was just going to Florida for a short amount
of time he understood the importance of having travel insurance no matter what
the length or where you're going of your what destination your trip is in too
many people think oh it's just a short trip nothing will happen
well things do happen Dave and I can vouch that things happen all the time
when we least expect it when we're climbing or kayaking or doing some treks
in the outback nothing ever happens to us no but
whatever we're just in the city or doing something mundane that's when it seems
like we hurt ourselves we never worry about how much it's going to cost us the
minute we feel something an ailment or sick or hurt ourselves we go to a doctor
overseas and we make sure that it's better so let's talk about a few of the
misconceptions that people think of why they don't need health insurance or
travel insurance one thing people think is that oh I'm covered as long as I got
that travel insurance with my credit card not always so we always recommend
for people to check the fine print read see what's covered a lot of people don't
do this and you don't want to be in a destination and have to use it and find
out you're not covered we recommend buying supplemental
insurance on top of your credit card insurance because just then you know
what you're covered for and you don't have to worry about things so reading
that fine print buying a little bit of extra coverage especially we're doing a
longer trip is well worth the cost a lot of people think they have coverage with
their company at work or with their home province or state that's not the case
most of the time the minute you step foot out of the country or even out of
your province or state you are not covered so you want to make sure you
find out about that and the coverage that you need to get you want to make
sure that you have emergency evacuation insurance that's really important if you
have a severe injury you need to get out of there and get on an air ambulance and
get home or get to a facility that can take care of you when Dave broke his
back in the Amazon we were in the middle of the jungle and he had to spend some
time in a little tiny jungle hospital that did not have the facilities and
things No thank God we had that air ambulance insurance that could take him
on a stretcher back to Canada where he could get the health that he needed now a lot of people say oh I don't need
trip cancellation or trip interruption insurance well this is something else
you should have as well especially if you're going on a longer term trip if
you're doing something a little bit short where the cost isn't that big I
wouldn't really worry about it but if you're doing a longer trip I would
definitely recommend it because if something comes up a medical emergency
or anything like that you can get your flights and everything refunded which is
which is a great thing especially if you've dished out you know five to ten
thousand dollars you don't want to eat that money so it'll be covered under
your insurance you also want to make sure what kind of coverage you are
covered for do you have a private hospital room do you have hotels covered
do you have food covered that's all really important when you if when you
have your loved one in the hospital when dave was injured I didn't have to worry
about the extra days I was spending in in Peru or the extra money I'd be
spending on a hotel or food everything was covered all prescriptions were
covered and the great thing about a lot of those flights the medical evacuation
insurance if you don't even have to pay for that that money goes into paperwork
and goes right to the insurance company so you don't have to fork out fifty to
one hundred thousand dollars right then and there who be happy about that yeah
now baggage insurance is another thing that people don't really think about it
a lot of times it is included in your credit card insurance or in your travel
insurance policy but again it's always good to check the fine print it's a
really good thing to have because if your bags get lost or they get stolen
or they don't get there in time then you have that insurance where you can go out
and buy clothes and and toiletries and all those things that you that you need
to they actually find your bags or you know to get you to the store when you do
have a medical emergency you want to make sure that you have all of your
paperwork in order Dave wouldn't really know about this then he was on a lot of
drugs when we were in Peru he was really really in badging but I had a lot of
work that I had to do I had to gather up all the paperwork I had to make sure
that I called my insurance company before anything happened and luckily
there was a satellite phone on the ship we were on I called American Express was
who we we used and I said my husband has had a bad fall I need to know what I'm
covered for and if you can't get on the phone beforehand you have to do it right
away soon as you get to the hospital make sure you get on the phone to your
insurance company a good insurance company will be on there telling what
you what you're covered for telling you what paperwork you need I needed to get
all of his x-rays all of his doctor's notes everything that he possibly had
all of his prescriptions and another great thing that insurance companies
offer our translators a lot of times you can do the basic conversation with
people when you're in a country but you can't do the really important things so
having a translator come to help you out set things up and gather what you need
is invaluable so as you can see we are true believers in travel insurance we
have used our insurance a lot we've had a motorcycle accident in Thailand I've
had a knee infection a very bad blood infection in Africa gave absolutely
broke his back in Peru and we've always had travel insurance we've never had to
worry about going broke because we get sick when we're travelling so we highly
recommend you getting it it's very little money for a lot of peace of mind
so before you head out on your next trip make sure to call your insurance
provider or your credit card see what you're covered for and make sure you
have all the right covers before you head out there and travel and for more

Hey everybody today we are talking travel photography and one of the most frequent questions that we get is what kind of gear do you carry and what kind of gear do you use while you're out there on the road well let's take a look at what I i actually have in my bag and what I use it for. first the sony rx100 IV perfect to throw in your pocket take anywhere shoot incredible 4k video as well as it has that stabilization a lot of other features that comes with a very fast 1.8 Zeiss lens so for low light stuff that's fantastic If you're on the run this is the camera for you. I also carry two other bodies my main body is the sony a7r2 to and my secondary body is the sony a7s2 to these are great both full frame cameras I use the a7r2 as my main body 42 megapixel five axis in-body image stabilisation it has everything you need as a high-end camera as a professional photographer The a7s to i use as my second body or for any low light situations 12 megapixel camera again a hundred sixty-five point autofocus in-body stabilization both great for video and for sort of any low light or astrophotography. As far as lenses go i carry four lenses are three main lenses are the 16 to 35 f4 zeiss the 24-70 f4 Zeiss and the 70-200 f4 sony.  This gammet it has really been with me for a very long time even when I shot canon this was the range of lenses that i use it covers everything from architectural photography, and landscape photography all the way up to portraiture so with these three lenses you you're set for any kind of situation when you're out there traveling I've recently added the rokinon 14 mil 2.8 to my arsenal mainly just for astrophotography i'm starting to get into that this is quite economical it like 250 bucks its sharp from edge to edge 14 mil gives me a better field of view So, with all of this stuff i can shoot all my travel photography I can to portraiture as well as astrophotography so this kit sort of includes everything that you need to shoot while you're on the road.  And you may be thinking oh you know if you're a professional photographer you want that extra stop of light with a you know a much faster glass at 2.8 but i have found with the with the iso performance in low-light performance of both cameras that it's negligible. if you're looking to purchase any of these products or look for any more information on them check in the description below i'll put a link to every single one of them leave a message in the comments if you like if you have any questions I'll get back to you as soon as I can so what do I carry all this gear in? well i've been using the same bag for about four years now and i absolutely love it it's the f-stop Loka. h Here's what she looks like right here what I love about this bag is that the front part is not how you access the bag it's from the back so it prevents for any theft or anything like that and especially for doing adventure photography what is great about it is that you can lay this part down on the snow or wherever you are wet ground and access all your camera gear from the back so that when you actually put it back on your back to take off your back not all wet so the inside of this is great you can see opened up like this and it runs on a insert system so you can buy three different-sized inserts so that depending on what kind of camera system you have and you can these inserts come in and out so if you have you know just a small set of that you're taking with you can have another insert put it in here there's still room for a coat and a bunch of other things in the top it's a it's very comfortable and you can throw a water holder in there as well as got you know for a camelbak or something like that for an adventure photographer travel photographer excellent excellent bag you can't talk travel photography and not talk a little bit about filters i should a lot of long exposure photographs you know to get that streaky water or those streaky clouds in the sky and there's certain tools that allow me to do that I use a particular filter system which is the format hitech system i recommend you check them out it's a it's a it's a square filter system is very quick to implement and very versatile comes with a holder you have different mounts like this for different-size lenses and also mounts for circular polarizers. For me i carry a range of filters i have graduated ND filters a 3, a 6 and a 9 which allows me to actually keep the sky dark where the foreground can stay properly exposed it allows me to balance out those exposures now when you're looking for that streaky effect or you know that is a very smooth water than ND filters are what you're looking for I carry two I carry a 10 stop ND which allows me to actually get that effect during the day. It stops a lot of light coming in which allows me to slow down the shutter speed and I also carry a 6-stop ND which is more for maybe dusk or something like that if i want to streak lights,  or if I'm shooting where I want to slow down the water in a cloudy situation. I use the Firecrest Model of their filters there's almost no color cast their little bit expensive but well worth it once you see if you're getting into the the heavier ND filters like this you really want to look for something that doesn't have a color cast because you don't want to have to be dealing with that in Photoshop in post another little thing I like to carry is a polarizer this is a circular polarizer which fits on the front of this mount so the whole system goes together this allows me to punch up the colors a little bit more or even give me a stop and a half more neutral density if I'm using it in combination with one of these so if you're into landscape photography and looking for those kind of effects, I highly recommend a filter system like the formatt hitech system I can't talk about travel photography and not talk about tripods I've used quite a few tripods in my days and found that it's worth paying extra money for a piece of gear that you're going to have for a longer amount of time I've recently purchased last year The Gitzo GT 2542 mountaineer series it's a carbon fiber tripod again quite expensive at like 800 bucks but when i look at all the money that i spent on other tripod that I've had to go through and they haven't really cut the mustard then spending the money on a quality product like this really has its advantages i'll probably have this forever has a lifetime warranty it's super durable at excellent excellent tripod and I use that in combination with a manfrotto head this is the MH 54 Q5 Head I like to use a ball head just because it's so much more versatile in any situation i can use for quick framing anything like that ball has really good it's made of magnesium so it's super durable put these two together and they are a little bit the head is a little bit heavy definitely but it's worth carrying a little bit extra weight to get those super steady shot. I just wanted to quickly touch on accessories these are not necessary things but they're things that I carry. I have an underwater housing for the sony rx100 IV.  Fantastic forr kayaking or any kind of water activities I also carry a cable release i know that Sony has you can do this through apps but i find using the release is what I'm used to it does a really great job and it's this is this is quite cheap it's the Vello Shutterboss II fits right in there allows you to timelapses and long exposures and things like that without having to touch the shutter button i should also look into if you're looking for straps the blackrapid system these are the top-of-the-line almost everybody i know uses them they're versatile they screw right into the tripod mount in the bottom of your camera and they're very very comfortable when you're talking memory cards we carry quite a ton i would say i wouldn't travel with any less than 10 just because they're so we have so many different cameras and such this little case here hard case I recommend for carrying all your memory cards in keeps them safe keep them from getting lost which I have lost mine many many times so these accessories are again not things that you necessarily need but they make your photography a little more comfortable and more convenient a little bit more safe and keep your equipment actually safe so that should do it that's a look at our travel photography gear and what we carry while we're on the road if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to our channel we do new videos every Sunday

failing actor and you know really the highlight of the whole movie is just
seeing Zach Galifianakis stick his stomach and Robert Downey jr.
'he's face that for sure is worth watching the movie I thought Jamie Foxx
is worth watching a movie did you yeah a little cameo in one of the first movies
I ever saw was Smokey and the Bandit and I think that's a great one with Burt
Reynolds he was so cool Burt Reynolds and Sally Field and a Trans Am in the
70s driving across country as Smokey was hot on their trail because they were
trying to deliver some beer it was it was Coors well the truckload of beer
illegally across the country as fast as they could they had something like 48
hours to make it happen and smokey who was Jackie Gleason was hot on their
trail he's pretty funny for all those people out there who love to travel in
an RV then you should definitely check out were the millers is with Jason
Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston where Sudeikis plays this small-time pot
dealer and he convinces these people to come with them and pose as his family
while he's trying to smuggle pot from Mexico Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper
and there's just like all kinds of weird things that happened in this movie I
didn't expect to like this movie but I thought it was a hoot I thought it was
really funny yeah so I hide it if you want a good laugh get weird the Millers
and Jennifer Aniston did a good job playing comedy yeah I think she's great
at comedy well she was in friends of course she's great a company I suppose
so now I saw this movie at the theater no
no I did not know what I do not know what to expect with Priscilla Queen of
the desert and it was really wild and really what's introduced me to Australia
because way back in the nineties I hadn't been to Australia yet I didn't
travel yet so I saw these drag queens going cross-country across the outback
with the sweeping costumes and it was incredible landscape and because I had a
theatre background I just love the movie so much and it's a young Hugo, Hugo
Weaving from Lord of the Rings we all know him Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp you like these suggestions so far don't forget to subscribe to our Channel
one of my favourite Road Trip movies and it is a must-see even if you don't like
roadtrip movies is vacation you got the Griswalds with their family it's Chevy
Chase they're heading to Wally world and there's all kinds of crazy things
that happen in between getting from their hometown all the way to Wally
World it's from you know I think their grandmother dies the dog dies they race
Christie Brinkley in a Ferrari come on you got to watch the movie just for that
right it's a good road trip one for sure make you want to drive a movie I just
re-watched recently with Little Miss Sunshine a new movie yeah it's actually
very bittersweet and sad and there's a lot of of levels to it and that's what I like a
lot it's you know it's Steve Carell when he's in a dramatic role when he said its
finest we all love Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette and they're going across
country to have the daughter perform and a little miss sunshine beauty pageant
and it's worth sticking around till the end they go through a lot of high jinks
as well a grandparent dies and that one as well. Is there a theme? there's a theme with road trip movies now I like the older movie so I'm gonna go with Cannonball Run it's a
classic you got Dom DeLuise you got Burt Reynolds
you also have Sammy Davis jr. there's touch there's all types of characters in
this and they're doing a race all the way across America is absolutely
fantastic they get up to all kinds of high jinks in that one I really love one week with Joshua Jackson it's a road trip movie across
Canada on a motorcycle what would you do if you only had one week left to live
well Joshua Jackson takes a road trip and discovers all of the great monuments
across Canada from Toronto to British Columbia if you're looking for a road trip movie that will really make you laugh laugh check out Tommy Boy it's with two
guys that I absolutely love it's with Chris Farley who unfortunately is not
with us anymore and David Spade they were a good pair
they were they were a really good pair they played off each other well it's
where Tommy Boy who is Chris Farley his father passes away and he's trying to
save his his business there and his mom is bo Derek they go on this crazy road
trip he is a sales agent and he pairs up with David Spade
David straight-laced in it and Chris Farley as the buffoon and it's
really fun it's classic Anthony Hopkins is one of my all-time favorite actors
and I think the world's fastest Indian is one of my best performances and if
you like motorcycles it's awesome.  Yeah it's so understated he plays a Kiwi and I'm from
New Zealand obviously and he wants to take his motorcycle to the United States
to test it out on the Speedway on the Salt Flats
and he overcomes all the obstacles and money and it's really heartwarming it's
showing that you're never too old to have a dream it's showing that you never
give up and you can make things happen and it's just one of my favorite movies
whenever I just want a good smile with a little happy cry I watched that movie and let's not forget Thelma and Louise yeah in the 90s Geena
Davis and Susan Sarandon work the Queen's of you know everything they were
winning an Academy Awards they had all the top box office and this was the
pinnacle Brad Pitt is in it they go across the country across the United
States and it really shows off great beauty of the desert of the United
States of the landscape it's also got a lot going on it's not just for fun
they're doing this road trip they are running but it's really great acting
great visuals and an excellent story that
stands the test of time well nothing says road trip like the movie planes
trains and automobiles with John Candy and Steve Martin this is like it says
there on planes trains and automobiles going across country and Steve Martin
has to get back to his family for Christmas and he hooks up and can't
really get rid of John Candy he tries his hardest to get home in all different
methods but he always ends up traveling with John Candy so you can imagine what
it's like pairing those two guys together
classic roadtrip movie this is one that's on everybody's top travel movie
let alone road trip movies and that's the motorcycle Diaries it's a young Gael
Garcia who plays Che Guevara before he became che and this is where a very
innocent movie about him just going cross-country across autocross continent
across South America and this one really resonated with me because I think that
it is travel that makes you sparks you to do something you know of course you
do in his case maybe was the start of his revolution you know so I think it's
really great it just showcases the landscape and the people and the
cultures of South America and if you want a good road trip that'll take you
on some traveled journey on places you've never been this is the place to
go so that'll do it that wraps up our favorite Road Trip movies now let us
know if you have any suggestions in the comments if you agree with us if you
disagree with us just let us know and if you like what you see here make sure to
subscribe to our channel for new videos every week see you next week where we're
gonna give you some travel tips and advice see you next week 
we have a jam-packed video for you today because we are going to go through some really cool travel gear items that you may not know about or may not have thought of these have worked for us for the past decade of travel and we're going to share some ideas with you yeah it's going to be stuff that we use for packing stuff that we use for electronics stuff that we just take with us on our travels that makes things a little bit easier now the first thing that probably everybody knows about we're gonna start off easy is a packing cube we carry a bunch of different packing cubes all different colors we stuff our clothes into them and they are fantastic for packing your clothes you can actually get some compression cubes as well so if you have some bulky items you can put them in zip it up and then zip it up again to make everything small it keeps your packing and your suitcase really nice and neat and organized which is something that we need so there's not like different clothes all over the place like that now that I've gotten older and I actually care what my clothes look like when I get to a destination and because we do a lot more business travel I like to keep my shirts as neat as possible and pants and all that kind of stuff so there's these great things by Eagle Creek which are actually folders for your shirt and the way they work is absolutely fantastic that they light they light flat they're just open like this with Velcro they give you a guide on how you can feel how you fold your shirt exactly like this you stack them on top of each other close it up all zipped up nicely and lay it in your backpack or your suitcase boom and it keeps everything nice and folded rather than crumpled up so this works great in addition with the packing cubes you can use for stuff that you can stuff but this lays nice and flat so I highly recommend this if you want some good-looking shirts when you get to a destination and you can pack three four or five shirts and one of these fantastic and they come in different sizes there's actually a small medium and large yeah so put a jacket in there yeah your sports coats or pants you can you can do any kind of clothing that you want to keep neat and non wrinkled in one of these if you are worried about carry-on items and you go carry on only like many people for your liquids we carry Lube to we put all of our shampoo and conditioner and any liquids into these they comply with the airline rules of being a hundred under a hundred mill and they're pretty attractive too they come in different color codes so you can go my shampoo is green my conditioner is white my alcohol is blue No so these are great for your liquids and they what I really like is they have a really wide bottom as well and they're easy to fill and then at least I know where my facial moisturizer is and my hand sanitizer you can keep them all in these things yes days where it's very very expensive facial okay can I throw these sure yeah sure it's wrong now whoa what we are also still talking about packing and what you're putting in your suitcase I love to bring this up because I haven't seen many people with this but this is what we use for our laundry bag and it's actually a mesh bag so that you know when you put your dirty underwear and everything else in there it doesn't stink up so if you put this in the hotel room put all your stuff in there when you throw it in it's not holding the stink yeah which is great that's it breathe anymore nicer way of saying it than Dave stinky words yes and it's washable just throw it in the washing machine boom God it's clean and it's good place to keep your dirties one more thing I like having it because when I bring my laundry to the laundromat or anywhere to get it cleaned I'm not using a plastic bag that they give it back in they give me my laundry back in my mesh bag and I'm helping the environment as well speaking of laundry we have always traveled with this what is this a big black thing this is a portable clothesline which is perfect for any long-term travellers out there where you're doing your own laundry and sinks I know everybody's done it come on admit it this is great it just sticks up its suction on either side you can hang it over the bathtub or wherever you like and your clothes actually fit inside these little things so pegleg less you don't need clothes pegs at all yeah I also use it when we're drying our soup I just interrupt Dave he had stuff to say when I interrupted them I like to use it when I'm drying our swimsuits or our songs as well you can just hang them outside on your balcony and it's not just suction there's actually velcro on it as well so you can wrap it around poles well no not now I guess you covered everything next let's do the packable day pack I love this because you know wherever you go you don't want to necessarily bring a huge heavy backpack we bring it with camera gear but for day trips where you just want to shove maybe an extra jacket or you know a small camera some water and hit this is great it packs up super small Eagle Creek makes them and it turns out into a relatively well I think it's a good sized day pack that you can fit like I said a whole bunch of stuff in and it's just meant for day stuff it's not super padded or anything like that but great to take with you and it fits nice and easy in your suitcase another thing that we like to carry is a little collapsible water bottle for when we go on the plane you know you can't carry bottles with you anymore on the plane so we just put this on through and then when we get through security we fill it up and it's great it doesn't take up a lot of space you can have fresh water for free and it's kind of nice and shiny too it saves you a ton of money right you know like waters insane to buy when you get through security right so this actually helps save you money and it helps save the environment as well because you're not you're not using those nasty plastic water balls here's something I bet nobody has really thought of or not very many people we travel with hard drives and we talked about it in another video when we were talking about travel gadgets with little portable hard drives and stuff like that and I like to keep mine in a Tupperware container this gives it a layer of extra protection its airtight so it's no problem you can make sure it's all sealed in there and it's protected and again it doesn't take up much more extra room you would have with your hard drive but I keep it extra protected you put the chords in there everything it all stays in one area okay let's talk about one more thing about the environment we've mentioned it quite a bit one thing that we have added to our travels is a canvas bag just a very lightweight bag so when we go shopping in the markets we actually have our own plastics becoming a real problem in the world so bring your own bags with you and it's great if you're overweight when you're at the check-in counter and they say your your carry-on is overweight we just shove our computers and anything in this little bag and it makes it look like we just went shopping and if you are super weight conscious and you don't want to bring an extra little tote bag remember if you had the packable day pack you can use that as well take it with you the market through all your stuff in there anything anything we can do to help the environment in a safe plastic something that I'm a fan of and I just got a new one I change one every year because I go through it so much if I carry a pack safe wallet it holds my passports here it goes on my ID all my credit cards it has place for my money and zippers and it's pack say so that means this RF ID meaning that nobody can stand my credit cards and get my information and I just think this is great to stay nice and organized and then I keep it in my pack Saints bag hey on our website I have a great blog post called eight great travel organizers that we carry all of our bags in that's a whole other video so we're not gonna worry about that but this is a cool piece of travel gear that we really like think RFID woo perfect one of the things that a lot of people don't think about is having unique luggage or a unique suitcase so that someone doesn't walk away with your luggage you can identify it on the belt nice and easy and maybe you don't want to buy new luggage or anything like that because it's you know luggage is not cheap these days but there's a few solutions out there that you can use we use two number one is a handle identifier like this dur√°n it goes on the handle of your suitcase it's velcro so when your black suitcase comes out and you see the one with the red handle boom you go poop that's mine easy small and carries very well there's also the luggage wrapped like this and this is great because if you're into fashion or anything that's a little bit more-- now as you can tell then this is great it goes right around your whole suitcase you can put it through the straps of the suitcase as well buckles up here so that you don't have to worry about it coming off we have two more items to go through here and these aren't things that you necessarily need but if you're going off the beaten path I highly recommend bringing them something we brought with us when we travel through India was the pack safe and this is a little cage for your backpack now we were saying in a lot of questionable bungalows and places like we stayed in places for four bucks a night so it was really easy to break into and we had about ten thousand dollars worth of computer equipment and cameras so we were worried but with the pack safe we didn't have to be afraid of leaving our stuff behind what the keys just fell out what it is is I'm gonna take it out is a cage that goes around your backpack and you can't get into it at all you zip everything up you put this cage around it and then there is another chain that you can tie around we actually put in the bathroom and put it around pipes we locked it to the bed we locked it to the radiator anything like that we gave it a lock and we felt that we could actually leave everything behind for people staying in hostels I think it's a great idea because if you have your valuables with you you can put it in here lock it on your bed and no one to get in and take it they're also great if you're doing like overnight trains or anything like that again like I was saying we used it we used it in India where we would you know put our backpack in there when we're going to sleep and just strap it around something that it was is immovable that you can't get to so it just gives you that that extra peace of mind to know that you know you're not worrying about something getting broken into or somebody taking while you're not there and one last thing that I wanted to mention was a suture and syringe kit I know a lot of people don't really think about this when they're traveling they have their medical kit where they bring bandages and all that kind of stuff but this is great to bring especially if you're going to you know off-the-beaten-path destinations or like lego city or there developing countries where maybe if you go for as a medical care you might not be in the using the needles that they're gonna use to give you a shot or to stitch you up or anything like that by bringing your own syringe kit you know that it's it's safe and it's clean and they can use this and it's a great thing to bring with you just in case well I hope that gives you some idea of some things that you might not have thought of when it comes to travel gear we use all of these things and have used them for years they're tried and tested and true we'd never recommend anything we hadn't used so hope you learned something here and if you want any more information you can check the link down in the description that will go and show you where all these products are and if you

Hey everybody
Today we're going to be counting down the best things to do in Iguazu Falls Brazil My number one pick for the 
best thing to do in Iguazu Falls is the Macuco Jet Boat safari
it's amazing it takes you right into the centre of the
falls you get under the water and what a thrill One of the things I highly recommend you do
is head out to the Itaipu Dam
It is the second largest dam in the world and let me tell you
you really feel the force of the water while you're there While you're out there do a sunset tour of the Itaipu Lake it's a
great way to go out and watch the sunset and have a little cocktail while you're at it When you come to Iguazu make sure you take the catamaran tour that sunset is beautiful And don't forget to visit Parque das Aves the famous bird park
lot's of great birds there to see, some of them you can't even see in the wild Half of the birds here are rescues and half are actually bred here An Amazing place to come if you're in Iguazu Come to Marco das Americas to see where Argentina,
Paraguay and Brazil all meet And if you're looking for a place to stay
I highly recommend the Belmond das Cataratas it's the only hotel that's right inside Iguazu
National Park And it gives you access to see those waterfalls
and sunrise and sunset where you have them all to yourself And when you're inside the park you've got to go down to the catwalk and walk right out
into the falls it's really cool to be surrounded by waterfalls Make sure you go and visit a bit of the downtown there are a lot of things to see
there's different museums One thing that stood out to us is visiting
the traditional mosque And you go to a Chinese temple and walk around
the peaceful gardens If you want to see the falls from a birds
eye point of view A helicopter tour is always recommended
This wasn't the best helicopter tour we've ever taken but it was a great way to
see the falls for a very short time up in the air If you want to get into the heart of the jungle go to the Bananeiras Trail this is really
cool you can do a ten kilometre bike ride into
the jungle then a hike then some kayaking and even a
speedboat tour It's a full day of adventure So those are our favourite things to do in
Iguazu Falls in Brazil if you like what you saw today make sure you subscribe to our channel 
Hey everybody hope everybody is well today we're going to be talking to you about our favorite GoPro accessories now we carry a couple of GoPro cameras with us a hero 4 black as well as the hero session 5 black some of you may have different models but most of these all work with whatever GoPro you have GoPros are great for adventure travel and we do a lot of adventures so these are our go-to accessories for all the different situations that you may find yourself in in your travels.  The first accessory that we recommend you have is the suction cup mount. This comes with us everywhere it's great for any type of driving shots it's completely adjustable anyway and it's good up to like a hundred miles an hour so you can put it on any sort of moving vehicle and get great shots. We have used this and felt very safe and never lost it and we have driven on the highway on motorcycles, cars driving through lakes and rivers so it's fantastic and i highly recommend it. If you're looking to get those cool underwater shots you know the split-level shots we recommend the GoPro dome and this is another thing that we don't leave home without if we're going to any destination where there's going to be water. It's really great dispersal of water across the front allow you to get a half above and half below photo if you want to learn more about it just make sure you check out our other video on how to use the GoPro dome just by hitting the link just right up there in the corner and you can learn more about how we use this beauty. I know lot of people don't love selfie sticks but when it comes to using a GoPro you really need to use one it's all about capturing yourself doing these amazing adventures. I like the GoPro stick I can hold it out when I'm snowboarding, when I'm ziplining, any kind of adventure that i'm doing i can just catch myself and i really like this because it's adjustable for several layers you can go closer far it's really super before I used to use the quick pod and it pulls out and. I like how light it is but i do like this better because i found that the quick pod sometimes get corroded when we use it underwater when we've been scuba diving or snorkeling it's great we can hold it out in front of you but we have found that again little rusty and it gets a little loose so go for the GoPro stick. Now you don't always have to have a long pole as well I just like having a GoPo in my hand so having something just to hold on to it a lot better than carrying around the GoPro in your hand that way your finger your summer your wrist will get in the way you can just nice and comfortably carry it around I like this one and the one that comes with a GoPro Dome because they both float in the water but if you're also doing some water you might want to get yourself a floaty as well for your GoPro so that if you do let go of it , it will float and you'll be able to find it however always have a hand strap when you do working with your GoPro because you're going to be doing great adventures and you're not going to be concentrating on holding onto that strap I think that leads us into mounts which there's three that we travel with all the time to make sure we can cover all the action from all different kinds of angles first would be the chest mount i highly recommend this for anything like biking anything that involves running because it keeps things so much steadier than the head mount what's great about this is obviously worked with the center of gravity of your body where it stays motionless. It goes on it's not too not too uncomfortable allows you access to all the controls and gives you that unique point of view. Now I like this one much better than what Dave's about to show you the head mount. This is a popular one that a lot of people use they put it on their head so that they can capture the moment, however I find that I end up moving my head too much and whenever I go to edit I really have to be careful because I'm looking around a lot, my head is moving doing everything if you do use the head mount, really be careful and conscious of looking straight ahead or looking at what you're doing for at least 5 to 10 seconds each time so that you have something to edit to. And one other mount, or body mount if you will,  that we carry with us in the wrist mount i find this is great if you're jumping off things. It gives you a great POV sometimes it's better than the selfie stick so that you don't have to actually hold something away from you. You get a much closer view of yourself and it turns as well so you can get your POV as well as the POV around you It just fits on your wrist it's pretty small and gives you again another unique point of view is which which is exactly what you're looking for when you're using a GoPro. Your GoPros don't have the greatest sound when they're in a casing and that's why I tend to like the session a little bit better because it's not in a casing, so if you want to record any speaking you're going to have clear sound. But another accessory that you can use is the Rode Mic The Rode Mic just sets into your iphone or your smartphone or whatever you use and its records you're speaking that you can sync in you're editing and I think it's really great for GoPros because they are not known for their sound so whenever you are doing any videos and you just using a GoPro you can get excellent sound with the Rode Mic. Let's talk a little bit about underwater one of the things that i found i always had a problem with this color correction underwater so when you're using your GoPro i highly recommend these PolarPro filters which will fit right on the outside of the actual casing like this and if you go below eight feet it will color corrected for you so you don't get that really green gross tinge of being underwater again it's something i bring whatever i'm going underwater along with my GoPro Dome and it really helps you get much better footage. continuing on with mounts obviously you get these when you buy a GoPro but we always like to have a bunch of different mounts with us, both the rounded and the flat kind they're disposable so you can either leave them on whatever you attach them to or you can actually take them off but they're not reusable so they're a disposable thing but they're great for quick mounts if you need to have it on a snowboard you need to have it on how many a helmet or a paddleboard or something like that you think are fantastic to quickly mount them you don't have to worry about them coming off. So that's all of the GoPro accessories that we use do you have a favorite that we missed? Leave in the comments below and let us know what we should get next and if you like what you saw today make sure to subscribe to our channel for more travel tips and travel advice from around the world that we share weekly right here on the planet d.

Hello, travel and sports lovers! The Olympics-- they
are starting this week, so Dave and I decided
that we need to talk to you a little bit about Rio. As many of you know, we were
in Rio just a couple of months ago, so be sure to check
out all our videos, especially the best things
to do in Rio de Janeiro. But what are we going
to talk about today? Drinks, of course! While you're watching
the Olympics, you have to celebrate with a
traditional Brazilian drink, and that Brazilian
drink is a "caipirinha." We were sent a bottle of
spirits-- right here, people. It is Pitu Cachaca, and
that's the main ingredient in a caipirinha. This is similar to a rum, but
it's made from cane sugar, and it is the main ingredient
in a caipirinha, which everyone drinks in Rio. I know we drank many ourselves. When in Brazil, you must try the
national drink, a caipirinha. Whoo, that's strong! The main ingredient in
it is a lime, of course. Safety first, I take my little--
so that I don't hurt myself. And now, you cut up a
lime, it's very easy-- Ooh, this is a good sharp
knife-- cut it into wedges. As some of you may not know,
when Dave and I were first deciding what to
do with our lives before we came
travel bloggers, I was interested in
trying anything, so I went to bartending
school for a little bit-- hence my very professional
way of cutting a lime. I've cut it into my
quarters and then you want to get a
little rock glass. We have our nice
little "Pitu-hirinha--" I don't know how to
say that-- "Pitu-rina," instead of caipirinha, this
is a "Pitu-hirinha," people. So put that half
a lime in there. There you go, that's the
main ingredient right there. If you have one of
these things, I'm sure that anyone
can get something like this at a store to break
up anything-- the mortar and pestle-- this is for
your drinking pestle. You want to get in there
and really mix around the lime juice, oh, yeah,
the messier, the better. Look at that. I think I've got this
lime pretty smushed up. Now, the next
ingredient says that you must add some white sugar. Well, I only have
golden sugar, but I'm going to put in a few
spoons of golden sugar-- to me sugar is sugar-- if
you have white go for it. Get in there and make it nice,
and sweet, and delicious. Smelling good. So that's looking
really good, now I'm going to add a bunch of ice. I don't know, for people who
don't have a home or anything, we seem to have a
lot of bar stuff. Does that say
something about me? One more. Now, if you have a nice
crusher in your fridge, it would be a lot
better than what we have-- we don't have an ice
crusher, for but that's all right. I'm just going to put
the ice cubes all around. And then the piece
de resistance-- is a shot of this Pitu Cachaca. I just love saying that. I think this is more like
a shot and a half glass but it will do. Oh yeah, people. Ha-ha! I found a stir stick--
I am always prepared, and it feels so Brazilian with
the green and yellow colors, my goodness. So I'm going to stir
that up in there, add a little lime garnish. Now, whenever you're
putting a garnish, just cut a little
slot in the middle so it sits nicely on the side. And voila-- you've got
yourself a very professional looking caipirinha everybody. Thumbs up! That's the very first
caipirinha I've ever made, and that tastes just
like the one I had on Copacabana Beach in Brazil. For those of you who
missed the recipe-- well, here you go, it's pretty
easy, take a look. Hey, Dave, where have you been? Been hanging around. I was making caipirinhas,
I started without you. As long as you didn't
start drinking without me. I certainly did, I
already had one on the go before I even started making it. Well, let's put it to the
test, and see if it's any good. See what you think-- Cheers. Oh man, that's so good. Taste mine. I think yours is a little
bit better than mine. That's my demo, this
is the good one. Hey, if you guys

hey everybody today we're going to be talking to you about free things that you can do when you visit that beautiful city of paris. I love visiting Paris because a lot of cities are really expensive to go in and see any of the sights but Paris is different, there are so many free and cheap things to do and we're going to round up all of our favorites. First thing I recommend you do is go check out the cemeteries. Paris is renowned for those big gothic cemeteries Pere la Chaise is the first one you should go visit because it is the most famous there you can see the grave sites of the great Doors singer Jim Morrison Oscar Wilde, Edith Piaff, so there's lots of places to walk around and look around the famous graves, but also check out all the other ones there. Super interesting there are other cemeteries as well like the Montmartre cemetery and the Monteparnasse cemetery so you're not just stuck seeing one and they all have equally as exciting people to visit. And if death isn't your scene while you're in Paris make sure to check out the museum. Many mediums in Paris offer free days once a month, like the mus√©e d'Orsay here, on the first sunday of every month you can get in for free. Did you know if you are 25 and younger and a part of the EU you can get into all museums for free but never fear if your old farts like us you can get into museums on the first sunday of every month for free that would include the Louvre that would include musee d'orsay and it would include the Centre Pompidou so make sure that you check those out on the first sunday of each month and also Paris has 14 city museums that you can visit for free at any time and hey this is Paris so if you're going to a museum is going to be spectacular. Yeah, any museum is a good museum when you're in Paris Here's a tip to help you save money whenever you see the emblem of Paris on a museum it means it's free When you're in Paris be sure to take advantage of the free churches like Notre Dame here. They're absolutely beautiful inside and they're free If you do want to go up into the bell tower or down to the vault there may be a small extra fee but just seeing the churches on their own is a grand  and spectacular thing to do in Paris. For your next tip of Paris on the cheap come to Sacre Couer it's free to go in and you get this absolutely amazing view of paris and we're always looking for stunning views when you're in Paris yes a lot of them like if you go up to the Eiffel power you have to pay but here's a little bit if you had out the sacre-coeur to the steps of sacre-coeur and Montmartre you have what I consider one of the most beautiful views of the city. I'm on the steps of Sacre Couer in Montmartre and it's the best view of Paris, save for the Eiffel Tower or Monteparnasse, but  this view is free and while you're there bring a bottle of wine you can drink some wine and have a picnic When in Paris make sure to take advantage of free tours They're all over the place and it's a great way to learn about the history of Paris Just look up free walking tours in Paris on the internet and you'll find ones that leave daily from the Montmartre area and the Latin Quarter you just join a group and they'll take you around to see all the sights of the area I've got to say my favorite area of Paris is Montmartre,  it's the artists quarter so you can walk around, they have markets there and have artists performing their art they're all day long and really you really feel like you sort of step back in time when you're in Montmartre. Yeah there's a lot of cafes so you can sit outside and sip a cappuccino there's street performers everywhere and there's a lot of museums that you can visit as well in Montmartre. And if you look closely you can see where a lot of film shots of famous scenes, Yeah you can check out our blog theplanetd.com and check out our Paris Movie Walks, if you really want to see where some of the films that have been shot in Montmartre are. Paris really is a walking city, you can really put on a lot of miles i always find when we're there, we're putting on tons of miles just walking yeah there's great just walking towards to do on your own you know definitely walking up the Champs Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe Which you can also get into for free the Arc de Triomphe it's free to visit just as long as you don't go up. If you want to go up and see the city view there's a fee but otherwise you can explore all of the ground and see the tomb of the unknown soldier and check out the gorgeous archways. What's another great walking tour area I think walking around Pont Neuf and along the Seine there, just even walking along there if you get these beautiful views and you get to really take in the grand architecture that Paris is known for. You don't have to go into all these places and pay to actually see them just walking around will give you a feel for that je ne sais quoi, that you get in Paris taking a stroll along the seine  is a perfect way to spend part of your day These vendors have been here for years. I know it took David I four trips to Paris before we even went up the Eiffel Tower and we were always just happy to just go stand under it and look at it from the banks of the Seine and just take in all of the different views that you get from it from the city. Place de la Concorde, known for its executions during the French Revolution is also free to visit You can't go to Paris without enjoying some music if you're looking for something to do for free the music conservatory offers 300 student performances a year good and you can get in and see them for free Radio France also offers a hundred and eighty free concerts a year at the Museum of Fine Arts. And if you happen to be there between May in September you can do a little dancing with your loved one on the left bank of Seine for free. And don't worry they offer free tango lessons if you don't know how Paris is known for its fashion and while you can go and want loves along the Champs Elysees and check out all the great fashion there are free fashion shows that happen every friday at the Galeries Lafayette so there you have it those are our Free Things to do in Paris. hope you enjoyed it.

Well hey everybody! I‚Äôm all comfy here
Dave‚Äôs going to do all the work Of course! I‚Äôm just going to sit around‚Ä¶no! I‚Äôve got my paddle
we‚Äôre going tandem today This is a great, relaxing kayaking trip
I highly recommend it you just paddle along the coast
beautiful scenery and you get snacks
banana bread with homemade jam and chocolate chai tea Had an amazing day here with North River Kayak
Justin was fantastic we got to see some beautiful scenery
If you come to Cape Breton you better come here 
We love South Africa
so we decided that we want to share with you some of the favourite adventures that we‚Äôve
done on the Garden Route The first thing we have to start off with for
sure for me is diving with Great White Sharks
that was amazing down in Gansbaai getting into the cage getting into the water
only ten minutes off the shore something you have to do It‚Äôs a great way to get up close and personal
and learn about Great White Shark conservation When you‚Äôre in South Africa
you definitely have to go on safari We went to the Kariega Game Reserve
which is a private game reserve which is fantastic because you can really
get up and close to those animals There are all types of safaris you can go
on as well we went on a horse safari and we went on a
night safari and that was up near St. Lucia in the wetlands Now if you‚Äôre looking for some high flying
adventure I highly recommend taking a Microlight flight
over Durban what a great way to see that beautiful South
African coastline and get a good idea of exactly the size of
Durban South Africa I believe is Africa‚Äôs adventure
capital and when you‚Äôre there you can do all kinds
of things from bungee jumping to gorge swings
but we went on a canopy tour a little more relaxed
and you can go zip lining and do a few fun things in the jungle
that‚Äôs a really great idea And if you‚Äôre looking for something really
different while you‚Äôre in South Africa why not try some sand boarding
you can do this just outside of Cape Town where there‚Äôs these massive dunes
now let me tell you it‚Äôs a little labour intensive
but the rewards are well worth it One of the craziest adventures that we did
was kayaking with crocodiles I mean what were we thinking?
there were hippos in the water there were crocodiles in the water
and here we were on little kayaks kayaking through the water Another great thing to do in South Africa
is to go to the Cango Ostrich Farm
it‚Äôs right near the Cango Caves pretty wild you‚Äôve got to go there too
and go through the adventure caving which is skinny and scary only she could do it not me but when you go to the ostrich farm
you learn about how ostriches are raised you may even be able to ride one if you under
60kg and you can also feed the ostriches and that‚Äôs
a lot of fun So those are our favourite adventures in South
Africa do you have any favourites?
Share them with us in the comments below! 
heading on the Natchez riverboat here in
New Orleans hey everybody we've arrived at Bourbon
Street So Bourbon Street is just electric I'm telling you everybody's out drinking they're carrying the drinks out
on the street It's about four o'clock on a Sunday afternoon so I am just dying to
see what it's like at night Oh I can't wait to see that make sure you visit
Mardi Gras world where they store all the old floats and make new ones when a New Orleans come to the Voodoo
museum Ooh take a streetcar out to the Garden District and visit the Lafayette
cemetery this is the only cast iron tomb in the
Lafayette cemetery and it was used as a prop for interview with the vampire very cool we're starting this cemetery tour here
in New Orleans New Orleans is really a city of the Dead there are about 12,000
 souls underneath the city right now now No video cameras are allowed on st. Louis cemetery number one so we can only show you photographs they're very strict about this rule make sure you come to cafe Dumont for Bagnettes The original New Orleans has an amazing food scene make sure you check with the concierge so the hottest spots in town to eat when on Bourbon Street you have to make sure that you have the traditional cocktails like the hurricane or this Gin Fizz at the Bourbon O bar they shake it for six minutes to get this perfect consistency 
it is a listicle day Dave and I are in a lists mood today and we want to talk to you about something that we love to do Road Trip doesn't love a good road trip right I love music so if anybody knows Dave and I they know that we love music so a road trip is a perfect excuse for us to throw the tunes on and get going I know a lot of people think that you know the thing that a travel song would be about leaving on a jet plane or on the road again or what else what's another one route 66 those are great songs about road trips and about travel but we aren't going for something completely different it's about what you need to put on your phone so that you can get rockin during that road trip I got to tell you my favorite tune the first one I put on when I get into the car is sympathy for the devil by the Rolling Stones this just the way it begins with the bongos and the way it builds and you can sing along it's just it really gets you in the mood for wanting to put the pedal to the metal and get going yeah and you know what I always think about the Guns N'Roses version from the interview with the vampire when Tom Cruise was starting to drive along with Newey's with Brad Pitt good and they started playing sympathy for the devil it's awesome it's a perfect driving song [Music] okay one song that has been on my road triplets for decades is Hotel California I'm a huge fan of the Eagles I just think they're one of the best bands I love the guitar in it I just love listening to the lyrics all I want to do is sing about California I was saying to Dave I think they need to make a musical about Hotel Kelly it could be that easy yeah I think that that would be definitely lends itself to totally the way that meatloaf is doing bad out of hell the Eagles need to do Hotel California add it to your list man and speaking of meatloaf you got a love paradise by the dashboard lights it's one long-ass song but it's perfect for being in the car and again it's another one of those ones where if there's two people in the car you can sing along I sing my part Deb sings her part top of the lungs that's the way that song is meant to be sung stop all right when we're running out of gas Dave and I put on running on empty we got to find a gas station now cuz we're runnin on empty drowns out our arguing because of whose fault it was that we ran out of gas now when you're traveling who doesn't like to you know stop in to the pub and have a pint after you've been driving when you're done and that's why I home for arrest by the spirit of the West is such a classic road trip song they you know if you can learn the lyrics to that you got it down they speak really fast it's all about drinking in the pub's of London and you know keeping the bar shiny with the sleeves of their coat it is a perfect sing-along song lawyer in the in the car it's a perfect travel song to because I love it because it starts off with you'll have to excuse me I've been drunk since I left okay are we all traveling and drinking all the time that's exactly they capture the spirit of traveling and I love it okay there is a reason this song has been played for decade after decades I'm singing to believe I know but I love it and you know what no matter what even when I hear it again if I'm flipping through the radio station and I hear it I have to stop and sing journey's don't stop believin I just love that it makes you just ready to drive it was made for people who can't sing yeah we have you're only in a car we all scream at the top of our lungs told we can't it's only meant to be sung in a shower or car yeah now when it comes to sing along songs you can't really get any better than Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody I love Queen you know I mean I love this song long before they did it in but who cares it allows you to make up your own right so I'll sing for you one day Beelzebub tryin to try and do the harmonies oh really bust your vocal cords fun fact Dave and I have been to where Freddie Mercury was born and that was in sports bar and we were at the place where he died in Montreux in Switzerland so we are huge huge huge Queen fans definitely that tells something about us I don't know what that says so as we'd like good music and why you should listen and make sure all these songs are on your playlist definitely that's what it means now as you can probably tell I'm a big fan of long songs I like long drawn-out songs on a road trip because it just yeah really gets you into it you know and American Pie by Dawn McLean is another classic it's it's definitely an older song and the people in the older generation will remember it but it is such an anthem and it tells such a great story and I love songs that do that so you can learn all the lyrics it's a it's another one great to sing together at the top of your lungs while you're in the car and it lasts for a really long time as many of you may know Dave and I have a soft spot for Africa and that's why one of my all-time favorite songs when I want to slow things down a bit is Africa by Toto it just takes me into Africa actually when we were cycling the continent of Africa I played this one a lot I was always playing it and listening to the dogs echoing in the night and thinking of Kilimanjaro rising above the Serengeti yes those are the lyrics now I'm sure I'm gonna get some flack for this song maybe not the song but maybe the band but I love this song by Nickelback Rockstar is is if you listen to it you may not like Nickelback Oh back what did they ever do to anyone who hates Nickelback no they didn't do it's a good song I think it's his hair I think it was his bad dye job with his big eyebrows I'm not sure but I love something to do with it listen to rock stars really funny so if you don't want to be embarrassed you can put Nickelback on your playlist you can do a silent and call it something else alright this if this isn't one of the ultimate roadtrip songs I don't know what is because hey even Ironman thinks it's a good driving song and it's a CD C's back in black yeah metal heads out there unite but it's a great song Becky in black I can't sing it I have a little high voice but it is a great song definitely another great driving song it's just like do you do you notice like a lot of these have like good back beats to them they're really they're really driving songs that you can not only sing along to but even you don't know the words you can groove along too which makes it those are two good things that you need to have in a good driving song if you don't like the songs that we are saying and you're saying we're stuck in the old days back in the 20th century bring us up to the 21st century and leave some comments below and tell us what we're missing out on we do want to update our roadtrip Tunes but I'm telling you we're never getting rid of these so those are our favorite roadtrip songs so make sure you add these to your playlist if you have any

so do you ever wonder what Dave and I do
on the road for our water well we're in Kyrgyzstan right now on a three day
trek and this is what we do we're going to fill up our bottle with stream water
then we're going to sterilize it ah good glacier water this is probably pretty
pure on its own but we'll just give it the purification to be safe because we don't want any parasites so using the SteriPEN it's pretty easy I've got my water from
the stream here and this is the SteriPEN here there's a couple settings on it
when you start it up all you have to do is press this button once for half a
liter or 500 milliliters of water and twice for one liter of water and you'll
see there's two green lights that will show up here one will show for half a
liter and two for one liter so you press twice because I'm doing a liter
it shows two on there make sure you submerge it put it right under so that
the sensors are under and just start stirring and it will be 48 seconds for
half a liter and 90 seconds for one liter that's all there is to it still going and when the flashes two green flashes You're good for water Ah, that's good! 
  Well, we're here with Nova Shores
Adventures on a two-day kayaking trip it's been really great here on the Bay
of Fundy because we've got to see the landscape at both low tide and high time
which is drastically different We've landed here at Seal Cove and we've
seen the weather change from beautiful sunny days to foggy days to beautiful
morning's like this.  It's a really great way to take in the beauty of the Bay of
Fundy wow that was a really cool experience to
kayak on the Bay of Fundy we went out to the Three Sisters and the Sun magically
came out and lit them up for us then as we were paddling back the fog came and its
really ominous very cool to just see it rolling in almost we think that ghost ship is just around the corner You can go for a hike after kayak as well Cheers to a good day, Cheers We're camping on the Bay of Fundy We see some seals, be very quiet, be very quiet Well there you have it the Three sisters
behind me here at low tide is a very cool time to be here you can see the
base of them. This is an excellent view of the Three Sisters and a Pillar! I don't know why they don't call it the Four Sisters, it's the Three Sisters The Three Sisters are a magnificent rock
formation on the Bay of Fundy. Local Mi'kmaq legend states that powerful god Glooscap Turned his three sisters into stone when he left the land and bade them to remain until his return Behind me is Elephant Rock. It really looks like an elephant When it's high tide you can actually kayak right through that
so we will be back. So there's the elephant that we walked to earlier now you can paddle through it. Incredible Just shows the power of these tides. The Bay of Fundy has the world's highest tides moving more than 100 billion tons of
water every six hours and 13 minutes that's more flow than all the world's
freshwater rivers combined. The tides range 35 to 55 feet Every Day 
Hey everyone we're at a cooking class here
at Borgo Argenina and Elena is teaching us how to make some
pasta This is the number one thing that you have
to do when you come to Chianti Classico First course, make the pasta fettuccini and asparagus, zucchini and carrots Second course, chicken cacciatore with salad and then surprise Oooh It's the traditional machine So when you do the pasta you press it in a
traditional machine five times making a thinner setting each time, give it a good stretch and then set it on a cloth made right here in Tuscany I always smile like this when I make pasta So the best way to dry pasta is to get five people with fans fanning it. That seems to be working here. Look you see, this is how we do it, the old
way And then we turn it around Look at that, I can see it drying right before my eyes So back in the day they would make the pasta in the morning and then spend all day to dry it But this is modern times and we don't have a lot of time anymore So you have to just dry it with fans This, this is a fiasco and you have to drink with the local people in the fiasco to get a real taste of Tuscany. So that's what we'll be doing tonight. Zucchini needs to be transparent That's pretty good you see? I'm cutting up very very thin zucchini see you can see through that. See? So that it can go in the pasta for the primi plate Look at that Wow - Tagliatelle I stir and stir and stir It smells so good. That's what the chicken cacciatore The chicken that is made on Sunday When the men go hunting I didn't realize that Smashed tomato, No sauce, no cooked nothing, just smashed tomato Salt oh the salt I love that And I'm making up uh, our dessert And uh also drinking wine how could you beat that? that's just egg whites? and Marsapan oh okay. This is for the second course and this is for the pasta and a true Italian would never eat pasta in a flat dish So now we enjoy the fruits of our labour yum Time to dig in Bon Apetito Salute 
We're about to go on a hike to Usge Ban falls. I think it's Usge. Usge. Let's go So the hike to the falls is pretty easy
it's just a one kilometre hike on a very simple trail but I hear it's gorgeous
once you get there So this is really a beautiful hike. One
thing that I'm really loving are all of the trees that are growing out of the
rocks their roots are completely exposed covered in moss really stunning Ah, and there's even scenic rest stops along the way So you can totally take your time   
welcome to the Maldives the Maldives is known for its over the
water bungalows and when you go you have to stay in one. So you can go snorkeling right off your dock. You can go swimming in the crystal clear waters and you can sit and relax on your own private deck this is paradise when you come to the Maldives make sure you do some diving we gotta dive here right the Maldives is one of the best
destinations on earth to go scuba diving the water is crystal clear and the
visibility is second to none and if you don't have your scuba diving
license you can see just as much above the water when you're doing some snorkeling we got to snorkel with some sea turtles
and let me tell you that was the highlight for me here in the Maldives Come see the Sea Turtles when you come to the Maldives. now these islands were made for romance so make sure you make the most of it and have some romantic moments like doing a couples massage it's a great way to relax Well it's massage time here in the Maldives and you know what? I'm feeling pretty relaxed
afterwards go for a romantic dinner on Afterwards, go for a romantic dinner on the beach There's all kinds of places. You can go on the beach on the pier Overlooking the beautiful sunset. It's a
great way to spend some time with the one you love that it is Muah! The Maldives is one of those dream destinations and let me tell you when you get there it doesn't disappoint no it's everything you imagined. It has those over the water bungalows on those beautiful Blue green seas it has those
islands all unto yourself and a lot of a lot of things you can do while you're there And no trip to the maldives will be
complete without actually seeing it from above that's where you get this true appreciation of all these islands that extend out all around you so taking a
seaplane and taking that in really is an amazing thing to do here when you go make sure you try some
dolphin watching I have never seen such a playful dolphins in all my time and
they were leaping out of the water their pods of them everywhere. It was a lot of fun. wow that was incredible the
dolphins were jumping right in front of They put on quite a show absolutely amazing so if you get a chance to come to the
Maldives, which i know you will. Make sure you get off the resort and learn a
little bit about maldivian culture so one of the things that I found really
interesting in the small maldivian islands, is that you know you can see for
one side to the other side of the island there and it is a thriving kind of
community here. They have a lot of a manual labor building brooms and making
coconut rope but also have tourist shops around so obviously they can sustain
themselves out in these Islands in the middle of nowhere when you come to the Maldives you
definitely feel like you're in your own TV commercial Those beautiful crystal-clear waters And basically feeling like you have the world all to yourself and that all comes true when you visit Maldives. And if you want to visit more destinations around the world make sure you subscribe to our channel for weekly travel videos in your inbox every tuesday and thursday

Welcome to Scandinavia our Go Ahead tour took us through five scandinavian countries and six cities starting in Bergen Norway and ending in Helsinki Finland So something I really love about this grand Scandinavia tour is all the different transportation that we're taking we're taking trains planes buses and boat but this isn't just a ferry this is an actual cruise ship that we are taking from Oslo to Copenhagen it has a swimming pool it has a casino it has several restaurant and this gorgeous Deck. I can't wait to see the scenery we're going out to explore the fjords and what a spectacular day we have couldn't have asked for anything better great way to explore the fjords of Norway We're traveling in style here in Copenhagen we have this luxurious bus they gave us some danishes and some coffee that's the way to travel One of the easy things about being on a tour is you don't have to search for transportation or wonder how you're going to get to your hotel it's all organized for you Love it one of the things that i love about this tour are the whisper sets that we get what is the guide talks into a microphone and we all here through our earpiece giving us the freedom to explore the destination so we don't have to stand right by them to hear the information so i can wander off and explore I please we're on the world's highest railway we're here in Norway and look at one of our stops, impressive this waterfall that's our trusty guide Derek, it's a madhouse here I tell you you have five minutes and they seriously give you five minutes. Only Otherwise you sleep up here in the mountains and it's cold. We're here in the the viking museum in Oslo Norway and it's really impressive these boats behind me are over a thousand years old from like 800 AD. And the reason they are so well-preserved is that there are preserved in blue clay which didn't allow oxygen to get through so they stayed almost in their original state So whenever we get to a new destination we always go on a feeler tour with our Go Ahead Tour here. We do a bus tour and then we get out we do some walking we get our bearings and then we're free to explore on our own and actually know where we're going. After we check into our hotel we have the option to join Derek on a leisurely walk through town and learn a little bit about the history come to the old town and Stockholm the The Gamla Stan Welcome to Estonia Our GoAhead Tour through Scandinavia gave us lasting memories of the people we met and the new friends we made along the way 
we are enjoying one of the great road
trips in the world the Amalfi Coast here in southern Italy and let me tell you it
is beautiful we are driving along the Amalfi Coast and let me tell you here
this is the most spectacular coast I think I've ever seen I had heard that it was beautiful but wow it is really beautiful it puts on the coastlines to
shame I'm not joking check this out everyone come on up and take a look the
Amalfi Coast of Italy. we got out of Sorrento, it was way too busy and now
we're going to go look for another hotel and I think it's much quiet over here in
Amalfi Town and Positano. or Posatino, I don't know what the town is that's where we're on our way to see you there the town is pronounced Positano
and if you go to the Amalfi Coast splurge on a room with a view here for
a night or two it's the most stunning town on the entire coast okay so as you can see it's a little
crazy driving along the Amalfi Coast it's really narrow roads people are just turning out in front of you bikes are passing you big buses are
going by. it's a single lane but it is so much fun get yourself a little tiny car we
rented a Fiat 500 I can fit anywhere I can zip around anything and if you're used
to driving standard it's only 75 bucks for the week. ha amazing in Ravello here there are a bunch of
foot paths and it looks like you can walk all of the adjoining cities there are signs
to Amalfi one way and signs to Minori the other I think we'll drive yeah you got to have
a car it allows you to get out there and to explore the coastline a little bit more
rather than doing it from a bus you can stop and take photos or just admire the view grab a coffee lots of more freedom if you're driving Woop Dave's decided he's
going to stop here alright we're going to the lookout this
is what happens you just go to flow luckily we have a really small car so
we think we can park somewhere in here we don't know if we're supposed to be
going down here or not but we have a car so we're saying let's go for it we have
a wee little car getting we're getting We're getting offly close to Capri, I can almost swim there now. oh yeah we come to a parking lot it's not really a parking spot we're
just going to go look and see what's out there let's go Dave got a tripod he's
expecting something beautiful never know This is beautiful well there it ladies and gentlement I
said I would get you look out for Capri and there it is
That's where all the movie stars drop their anchor when they go on their yachts come
to the Mediterranean in Italy the road trip continues on the Amalfi Coast and
behind me is a Amalfi Town it's much more beautiful than I thought Gosh. what a drive should do it at least once in your life And that was the Amalfi Coast 
It's a very exciting day here at The Planet D because we are going to find out our ancestry DNA we've been traveling the world full time for eight years having adventures in more than 100 countries on all seven continents and sharing our experiences on ThePlanetD.com Welcome to Antarctica welcome to Dubai Welcome to the Maldives welcome to Scandinavia As you know, we travel all around the world we visited a ton of countries experienced a lot of cultures but never really looked into what our heritage is all about and what our Ancestry is so that's what we're going to do today. People always ask us when we travel to places like Ireland and Wales and the UK. They say "oh are you from here" and we go. "I think I have a Scottish heritage or I think I have an Irish heritage but it's about time we find out once and for all where we're from So we picked up our DNA kit and that's what we going to do today let's open them up and see what it's all about after AncestryDNA sent us our kits, we activated our code online and it was so easy Just spit into the tube release the stabilizing fluid, shake for five seconds and send it back in the postage-paid envelope I don't know whether I have that much spit in me but we'll see almost there ready to go so we're going to talk to Ancestry today about our DNA results and our family tree but before we did we thought that we would actually go through what we think because something I think is really funny as Canadians is a lot of us don't really know a lot about our family tree or we tend to know the wrong information right? Yeah definitely I mean because you know obviously Canada's all immigrants you know you don't really know where people came or you have these things that are all assumed. I have always said I am French and I am English and that's pretty much I always thought it was pretty basic and it's funny because I thought most Canadians are from France or England because we have French Canada and English Canada. I know for me I'm really looking forward to seeing if you know my limited history of what I know about my past which is not very much is true I want to know whether I'm Scottish if I am from Scotland then where am i from there and you know maybe I can delve a little bit deeper maybe there's some royalty in there or something like that.  I don't know. I don't know a lot about my mother's side because my mother is adopted so I'm super interested to see if they can sort of track something down and maybe be able to dig a little bit deeper into that and I've traced my roots back to like Dukes in England and I know that I'm related to Richard the Lionheart and I always am upset that I don't have any other royal money even though I suppose a royal blood so that bothers me. So we're going to be getting on the call in a couple minutes I'm very excited me too we're going to know where the heck we came from During our meeting I found out I was not only French in English but I have a lot of Irish and a little bit of Scandinavia too so that was pretty cool what we have today. We always joke there's a little Viking in all of us. Yeah, it is really cool because I always get that when we're travelling when we're in Europe people go "Oh, do you have Scandinavian routes? yes and I've always joked, "no I'm too short to be Scandinavian but I guess like, my look, people think I look a lot Scandinavian. Well there are a few things that really surprised me about my AncestryDNA and family tree number one they were able to find my mom's birth mother and if you remember she was adopted and what was really interesting is how they did this they were able to do it through the DNA. Someone else it submitted their DNA through through the Ancestry program and they found such a close match they found someone who was actually my cousin oh my gosh Wow in this world first cousin is not related to you through the Bouskills so it's your mom's side somewhere. So she had an extensive family tree. Wow the surnames that start to show up in this tree on this branch. Frasier, Bane, McClean, they are all big clans, That is so cool so your grandfather was actually born in Scotland oh I didn't that. There you go I had no idea He is part of Clan Frasier oh neat. Now this particular clan has lived in Nova Scotia for a few generations they came to Canada it looks like, as part of that highland migration. Right.  Until we get back to place called Gairloch Scotland Oh, I'm going there. Next week. there you go! that is so wild. Gairloch is actually one of the places where the Highlanders were allowed to come this particular community was set up by a man who's last name was McKenzie and he started inviting these Highlanders to come to this community This is so cool That's Cool We're here at Gairloch, Scotland where I found out I am from. during the Highland Clearances Gairloch was one of the few places where the Highlanders were allowed to come it was set up by a man named Mackenzie another one of my ancestors who invited the Highlanders to settle here it brought a whole new level to my travels knowing that I was tracing my ancestors roots and history. I've gotta say being on this trip and being in a place where my great-grandfather's were from really had a profound effect on me as I was walking through Gairloch, I felt more like I belong there like this was my homeland rather than being a tourist it was like there was this connection and that's something that I never felt before when I travelled and I think finding out that my heritage was Scottish and I was from this area just a week before that I thought I actually went there was a bit serendipitous and sort of was meant to be so it was this calling while I was in Scotland that I know I'll definitely be back now that we know that we have ties in Scandinavia Scotland, Ireland and even Spain, it's motivated us to get out there and explore our family history and we want to give you the chance to find out about your own heritage so we've arranged an exclusive Planet D discount code for everybody out there so you can check out where you are from just follow the comments and the links below to find out your own DNA and don't forget let us know what you find out in the comments says we'd love to know where all of you are from

hominoid existence at 3.5 million years old amazing so it's a very exciting time we have
three male lions and a female with her cubs and they're all having a standoff

do a canal tour. we're off to explore the city They even bring you beer for the boat ride make sure you walk up the spiral
staircase of the Round Tower there's a lot of things to do here in
Copenhagen and if you're going to be here for 24 hours or 48 hours a great
value is the Copenhagen card this gives you access to 75 different
attractions and museums around the city it gives you access to public transit
all for one fee which is about 50 or 60 US dollars
A real bargain here in denmark come up to the tower at Christiansborg Palace
for a birds eye view of Copenhagen visit the royal palace at Christiansborg well I must say this is a very impressive palace to visit
it's so ornate, it's an amazing shape beautiful tivoli gardens is beautiful especially
at night . It's all lit up all lit up, all of the gardens. You really have to come here
it's quite the historical site as well. that was Amelianborg, where the royal
family lives So as you can see we‚Äôre here at the
Little Mermaid and man the crowds are absolutely crazy you can't really get
here from walking from the city so it's all bus tours that come out here. hence the mob of people. One of the things you have to do when you
come here to Copenhagen is definitely take a
walk around the pedestrian street it's a great shopping streets with all shops like Louis Vuitton stuff like that but it's great to see street performers and
bicycles all out on a beautiful day In Copenhagen 
Did you know Jamaica has crocodiles? well they do and we're going to see them on the black river safari we've been on safari for about five minutes and already seen three crocodiles, awesome so we've just had a great tour here on the Black River but we also in the crocodile nursery they have put 78 crocodiles back into the wild and most of the crocodiles in here have been rescued from backyards or on the road or they've been through some fights and they're nursing them at the health some will be released and some are not fit to go back into the wild so they will go to other facilities but it's pretty incredible to see 
We're out here exploring Loch Ness we may not have found Nessie herself but we found some beautiful scenery I am so excited to be here at Loch Ness
in Scotland I've always wanted to come here and now we're here Dave and I are going to go drive along the Loch and see if we can find Nessie woohoo well what a great choice this was for
viewing Loch Ness what a beautiful sunset tonight this is obviously the
place to come and look for the monster because the Nessie hunter has set up
shop right here on this beach that's  pretty cool so you know if somebody is
an expert is on here this is where you got to come to look for the Loch Ness
monster when you're in Scotland well we made it here to clava cairns
just outside of Inverness and these are 4,000 year old tombs and a fun fact here
if you read the book or watched TV series this where Clare went back in
time when she went into the land of Outlander we're here at the culloden battlefield
we're back in 1746 30,000 men fought here on this battlefield it was the Brits
against the Jacobites and it was a slaughter we're here at Glen Ord distillery with
Alastair here who has given us quite the education on the brewing process and how everything goes here now it's time to taste some Founded in 1838 Glen Lord is the closest distillery to Inverness and it's still malts its own barley on-site a tour of a distillery is
something you must do when visiting Scotland We've had a great time here at Glen Ord not only learning about how the
whiskey's made thank you very much Alistair there but I getting a chance to taste it
which is the most fun part in my opinion I think I found a new favorite Scotch here in the 15 year old singleton you can you can only get it here or in Asia so I'll be drinking it sparingly When exploring Loch Ness at the Visitor Center in Drumnadrochit be sure to visit Uquart castle located on the shores of Loch Ness it's a beautiful ruin dating back to the 13th century and finally just a short walk from downtown are the Ness islands where you can explore the three miles of trails going
through natural parks and attractions 
Hey everybody hope everybody is well today we're going to be talking to you about our favorite GoPro accessories now we carry a couple of GoPro cameras with us a hero 4 black as well as the hero session 5 black some of you may have different models but most of these all work with whatever GoPro you have GoPros are great for adventure travel and we do a lot of adventures so these are our go-to accessories for all the different situations that you may find yourself in in your travels.  The first accessory that we recommend you have is the suction cup mount. This comes with us everywhere it's great for any type of driving shots it's completely adjustable anyway and it's good up to like a hundred miles an hour so you can put it on any sort of moving vehicle and get great shots. We have used this and felt very safe and never lost it and we have driven on the highway on motorcycles, cars driving through lakes and rivers so it's fantastic and i highly recommend it. If you're looking to get those cool underwater shots you know the split-level shots we recommend the GoPro dome and this is another thing that we don't leave home without if we're going to any destination where there's going to be water. It's really great dispersal of water across the front allow you to get a half above and half below photo if you want to learn more about it just make sure you check out our other video on how to use the GoPro dome just by hitting the link just right up there in the corner and you can learn more about how we use this beauty. I know lot of people don't love selfie sticks but when it comes to using a GoPro you really need to use one it's all about capturing yourself doing these amazing adventures. I like the GoPro stick I can hold it out when I'm snowboarding, when I'm ziplining, any kind of adventure that i'm doing i can just catch myself and i really like this because it's adjustable for several layers you can go closer far it's really super before I used to use the quick pod and it pulls out and. I like how light it is but i do like this better because i found that the quick pod sometimes get corroded when we use it underwater when we've been scuba diving or snorkeling it's great we can hold it out in front of you but we have found that again little rusty and it gets a little loose so go for the GoPro stick. Now you don't always have to have a long pole as well I just like having a GoPo in my hand so having something just to hold on to it a lot better than carrying around the GoPro in your hand that way your finger your summer your wrist will get in the way you can just nice and comfortably carry it around I like this one and the one that comes with a GoPro Dome because they both float in the water but if you're also doing some water you might want to get yourself a floaty as well for your GoPro so that if you do let go of it , it will float and you'll be able to find it however always have a hand strap when you do working with your GoPro because you're going to be doing great adventures and you're not going to be concentrating on holding onto that strap I think that leads us into mounts which there's three that we travel with all the time to make sure we can cover all the action from all different kinds of angles first would be the chest mount i highly recommend this for anything like biking anything that involves running because it keeps things so much steadier than the head mount what's great about this is obviously worked with the center of gravity of your body where it stays motionless. It goes on it's not too not too uncomfortable allows you access to all the controls and gives you that unique point of view. Now I like this one much better than what Dave's about to show you the head mount. This is a popular one that a lot of people use they put it on their head so that they can capture the moment, however I find that I end up moving my head too much and whenever I go to edit I really have to be careful because I'm looking around a lot, my head is moving doing everything if you do use the head mount, really be careful and conscious of looking straight ahead or looking at what you're doing for at least 5 to 10 seconds each time so that you have something to edit to. And one other mount, or body mount if you will,  that we carry with us in the wrist mount i find this is great if you're jumping off things. It gives you a great POV sometimes it's better than the selfie stick so that you don't have to actually hold something away from you. You get a much closer view of yourself and it turns as well so you can get your POV as well as the POV around you It just fits on your wrist it's pretty small and gives you again another unique point of view is which which is exactly what you're looking for when you're using a GoPro. Your GoPros don't have the greatest sound when they're in a casing and that's why I tend to like the session a little bit better because it's not in a casing, so if you want to record any speaking you're going to have clear sound. But another accessory that you can use is the Rode Mic The Rode Mic just sets into your iphone or your smartphone or whatever you use and its records you're speaking that you can sync in you're editing and I think it's really great for GoPros because they are not known for their sound so whenever you are doing any videos and you just using a GoPro you can get excellent sound with the Rode Mic. Let's talk a little bit about underwater one of the things that i found i always had a problem with this color correction underwater so when you're using your GoPro i highly recommend these PolarPro filters which will fit right on the outside of the actual casing like this and if you go below eight feet it will color corrected for you so you don't get that really green gross tinge of being underwater again it's something i bring whatever i'm going underwater along with my GoPro Dome and it really helps you get much better footage. continuing on with mounts obviously you get these when you buy a GoPro but we always like to have a bunch of different mounts with us, both the rounded and the flat kind they're disposable so you can either leave them on whatever you attach them to or you can actually take them off but they're not reusable so they're a disposable thing but they're great for quick mounts if you need to have it on a snowboard you need to have it on how many a helmet or a paddleboard or something like that you think are fantastic to quickly mount them you don't have to worry about them coming off. So that's all of the GoPro accessories that we use do you have a favorite that we missed?

We're off to explore the crystal cave here in cayman islands let's go where are the Crystal Caves tour here on Grand Cayman and behind me is our first stop, it's the red birch tree. Fun little fact, the locals here call it the tourists tree, because it's red and always peeling, just like us Ha I love it. Pepper Cinnamon Tree Smells like cinnamon, but tastes like pepper. Canella Winter Anna That's what this is Numb tongue Down we go, first cave. Ooh If you look right here, this is why we call it open ceiling cave. Funny huh? we got to explore a lot of caves here in the Crystal Caves and it's pretty amaizing diverse and there's a lot of stalactites and stalagmites here And there's still even more caves to be explored Wow What a fantastic tour 
here's a Panama Canal and it's a bit crazy but it's really really impressive we're here at the Pacific entrance of the Loch which is the Mia Flores locks there's actually 3 sets to get you from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean pretty cool because 35 to 40 ships come through here a day and they've built you can just see behind me they've actually built a bigger one that takes bigger ships only five ships go through but they can take up to 14,000 containers pretty impressive it's pretty wild being here at the Panama Canal this is one of the seven industrial wonders of the world and I can understand why it's amazing and Wow it's still very popular there's a lot of people here to see it look at everybody it's a very interactive Museum here and interesting at the Panama Canal way back to the 15th others they actually maybe I of creating this so this is a long time in the making it was a great trip here to the Panama Canal - it's a really important day because 39 years ago today is when the treaty was signed by Jimmy Carter pretty impressive if you do come here make sure you get up to the fourth floor check out the amazing view watch the ships come in and out but also get down to the museum because it gives you a great idea how things were built the struggles that everybody went through and it's quite interactive a great highlight here in Panama 
so have you ever wondered how people get those shots of half in the water and half out the water and they're both in focus well I'm going to tell you exactly how you can do it in order to get those shots all you need is two things you need yourself a GoPro and you need one of these babies a GoPro dome what this does is it actually pushes the water away from the lens so it allows you to get a much better shot and it also allows you to get focused underwater and above water at the exact same time before you take your GoPro and put it inside the GoPro dome you have to make sure you do a few things number one make sure it's all set up with all the settings that you need to take the proper photos or videos my tip is to make sure it's on burst mode either 5 or 10 and then that way you're not going to miss the shot finally once you have your GoPro all set it's as easy as this flip open in the back take it put it inside case like this snap her down and you're ready to go so let's head to the pool and I'll show you exactly how to use it I have the GoPro app you can download and throw it on your phone or your Android and it's a great way to actually control your camera well it's inside the go and you can also frame and see exactly what you're shooting so I'm going to use Deb as my model here and you'll get to see the result and that how it's done 
it's a very exciting day here we are off to explore Hobbiton the movie set of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit let's go everyone Frodo [Music] so if you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies a trip to Hobbiton is a must when you're in New Zealand now be warned it is crowded it is a very fast tour and it is expensive so I only recommend it if you are a fan of the movies it is actually kind of cool to see the Peter Jackson says though they scouted this location way back they were looking for the rolling hill in this area of New Zealand is perfect they've left all of the facades of all of the Hobbit doors and circles there's one that you can go in which is Bilbo Baggins house but the rest are all closed as you know any of the interior scenes were filmed in the studio so they are just facades and there's nothing inside [Music] we're on the way to Dragon Inn for a pint of dark doubt get 15 minutes to do it so I better get drinking thank you Cheers the oak tree above Bilbo Baggins house is fake they attached 200,000 fake leaves to which Peter Jackson has them repaint after seeing them on set because he didn't like the color green become a New Zealand and if you are a fan of Lord of the Rings do it if not skip it and that was Hobbit [Music] you 
while we're here at Honolulu we're about to cut up on a beautiful helicopter ride over the island with blue Hawaiian helicopters and this is everything I have to leave behind good to go [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a helicopter tour of Oahu is a 45-minute flight that takes you from Waikiki to the North Shore the pilot gives complete commentary through your headsets and passengers can ask questions using an microphone [Music] it's not the best setup we've ever had on a helicopter tour as only the left side of the helicopter seemed to have the best views dave was stuck in the middle and I had a lot of only ocean views being on the right so I felt that I missed quite a bit but for only 229 dollars it's a pretty good deal sites you'll see on the tour are the beaches and the city of Waikiki the extinct volcano Diamond Head a waterfall and the beautiful coral reefs offshore you'll then glide over the rainforest towards the north shore will you catch those big waves that everyone talks about and marvel about how all those surfers get up the nerve to get into that water it's crazy and what a great bird's-eye view [Music] and then you'll head back over the dole pineapple plantation it's home to the world's largest outdoor maids [Music] the tour ends over Pearl Harbor where you'll fly over the Arizona Memorial sunken battleships and the old army barracks and that was our flight over Honolulu [Music] 
we're going in to taste some scotch today at Glen Ord distillery. It is one of the oldest distilleries in Scotland Founded in 1838 Glen Ord is the closest distillery to Inverness and it still malts its own barley on site. A tour of a distillery is something you must do with visiting Scotland people are passionate about scotch as they are family and football you're guided tour will take you through the distillery to show you the mashing processing, fermentation and finally distillation such a sweet smell Unlike Ireland where they distill their whiskey three times, Scotch is only two distilled twice the Scottish say, this gives their whiskey more flavour. So let's put it to the test We're here at Glen Ord Distillery with Alastair here who has given us quite the education on the brewing process and how everything goes here and let me tell you it's been pretty involved and really really interested now it's time to taste some Wow it is, I taste uh definitely some. Like a little bit peppery in there. For sure and ginger. Also a bit of a toffee taste as well Excellent, excellent. We have 6 key flavours you see But a generalized flavour, toffee it's sweet, there's a sweetness there too You've got that spice, you've got that ginger There's a great balance of that the sweet and the spicy Just a little bit more rounded. but I find these ones quite a lot less spicy than some of the other one that I drink so the more sort of spicier it is the more i like to put water in it so for these ones in like they're very smooth and no uh. It hangs around in the mouth. And other little flavours can a spark, fully We've had a great time here at Glen Ord, not only learning about how the whiskey's made thank you very much Alastair but uh getting a chance to taste it which is the most fun part in my opinion. I think I found a new favorite Scotch here in the 15 year old singleton you can only get it here or an Asia so I'll be drinking sparingly 
hello everybody today we are going to talk to you about something that we get a lot of questions about and that is how to get paid to travel now we run a travel blog as as most people know and that's how we get paid to travel but there's a ton of different ways that you can go out there and earn money while you travel and get to see the world one obvious way that you can go out there and get paid is to become a flight attendant you can head out there you hit all these different places we have a friend Kerwin who's a flight attendant he's out there visiting all these countries and you're getting paid to do it it's a great job to get out and visit different countries that you probably would never even get to and a painting to do it yeah and flight attendants get a lot of perks they get free flights they get upgrades you get layover is where you can explore the country and I know our friend Kerwin McKenzie and there's another girl Heather Poole out there they have turned their flight attendant careers into becoming very successful travel bloggers that's another thing to point out you don't necessarily have to give up a job that you love in order to go out there and travel and get paid to travel as a supplemental part of income there's lots of ways that we'll talk about later on about blogging and stuff like that where you can make affiliate income and all this kind of stuff work it's passive income so why not start a blog and pair it with the job that you're doing right now and then you can get a passive income stream going a great way to see the world and to travel is to work on a cruise ship I actually did this in my 20s I was a singer in a previous life and I worked on a cruise and I got to see the world by singing and traveling it's a lot of fun it's a great way to get out and get paid to travel and not have any expenses now you don't have to be a singer there's lots of different ways you can be a dealer in the casino you can be a housekeeper you can be a bartender you can be service staff you can be a cruise director there are so many different ways that you can work on a cruise ship and it can be a lot of fun I have friends that are still doing it to this day they love working on a cruise so much whenever they feel like traveling or whenever they feel that they need just a little bit of extra cash they say I'm going to go get a contract on a cruise ship for six months and they take off and see the world now we have a lot of resources on our travel blog the planet a calm that has all the links to the places where you can apply there's always forums and cities every year where cruise lines come to recruit people to come and work on the cruise ship so there's lots of ways you can find it just go to our website the link is below another way that you can go out there and make money is to become a guide we have met so many people around the world that have been from North America that are that are guiding in whether it be in Chile whether it be in in Asia or whatever so you can get a job as a guide working for companies such as you know like intrepid traveler dia benches or any of these places where you can go and you can go and travel the world I know when we are traveling with go-ahead tours when we were in Scandinavia our guide Derek he had been working for them I think for like it was like 20 years I believe it was and then he gets the goal all over the place and he runs these tours he's great at doing is very personable and if you are a personable person and loved you know working with people and learning about or actually teaching people about history and all that kind of things i guide could be a great way for you to get out there earn some cash and see the world if you won't even go deeper if you have a special skill that's another way to travel the world I know people Dave and I at one time thought we might want to become dive masters so we went to Honduras and to work on our dive masters because we thought what a great way to travel the world and have a special skill if you have these special fields you can get paid more money and you can see the world we've had a kayaking guide here in Canada from Argentina we did as I said scuba diving courses all over the world where guides are from everywhere the dive masters are from everywhere think about it if you teach to teach rock-climbing whitewater rafting what else is there out there any kind of special skill that you can think of cycling you can lead these tours and make more money that way because you have the special skills so think about what you can do one of my favorite things to do when I travel is to visit the spa and I think this is a fantastic idea for people to get paid to travel people are going to spa more often than ever right now they're booked all the time and I just love going in and smelling the aroma Fair uppy and hearing the soothing music and those massage therapists they go around the world we've been on cruise ships in Alaska we've gone to Asia all seven continents we have had a massage okay I was on a ship in the seventh continent but we have had a massage you can be a massage therapist and get paid really well at one of those high-end five-star resorts or on a cruise ship and sail around the world and that leads us into another way that you can make money which is to teach so you can either teach something like yoga you know if you love yoga at home you can you can go and take a course and become an instructor and then go around the world and teach yoga we've met again it's kind of like massage therapy we've done a lot of massages we've taken a lot of yoga courses as well and almost all every time it's instructors that have come from other parts of the world that are teaching in these exotic locations also teaching English you know we have a ton of friends who started off their travel blogging career travel influence or career by teaching English and you can do that anywhere around the world it's another thing where you can take what you've learned and what your cert certification you have and apply it to different countries as you go around and it allows you to immerse yourself in the culture a little bit more as well rather than hopping from destinations a destination by working on a cruise ship you can actually immerse yourself in the culture by taking maybe a six month or a year contract teaching English you understand Tech and WordPress in the internet you can also work on websites we hire website developers we hire people to help us with our back-end we hire people to check and proofread our writing and that's something that you can do the support team for all of the online world is huge and people can make a lot of money doing that so being a travel blogger again as we said is one way to make money but you can also make it through freelance writing I know a ton of people out there who are fantastic writers but they're submitting articles and writing for publications like National Geographic or Travel and Leisure any of these places where you can go out there and make some more money but still there's lots of people out there making a great living with freelance writing and if you are a great writer it's a good way to do it how many of you out there know and understand social media how many if you really get YouTube or no Instagram well you know what I have a lot of friends that run social media accounts for other people even Dave and I have people help us with our social media you can apply to other bloggers to companies to all kinds of people who any other company out there that you can think of that needs help with their social media and show them your expertise do you understand the nuances of Facebook we'll get to a company that needs some help and apply and the beauty of doing this is that you can be location independent you can do it from anywhere in the world you know you don't have to be in New York working for a company in New York or in Toronto working for a company in Toronto you can be halfway around the world we have assistants that are over in Europe some that are in Asia you know so you don't have to be located somewhere so it gives you the freedom to go and travel the world and live where you want not having to be in the place where your work actually is now let's talk about YouTube for a while because I know you're on here and you love this platform we actually have had people help us edit our videos and I know a lot of influencers out there who have other people edit their videos because they just don't have the time all kinds of companies are looking for people to edit videos because that's what is really time-consuming and if you have the skills if you understand it and you can do a kick-ass video well there might be a job for you and like Dave said earlier you can be location independent because you can edit a video from everywhere you can just get the files from wetransfer or Dropbox edit them send them back and there you go voila you have a job and you're getting paid to travel one of the things that's beautiful about today's day and age is that you don't have to actually be a blogger or anything you can be what's called an influencer where you focus on one particular social media channel and be have influence on that channel you can be an Instagram or you can be a youtuber those are the two bases you can be a snapchat er you know there's there's there's lots of different ways that you can make money through individual social media channels and my one bit of advice here is to pursue a channel that you love because you know like with everything else involved that we talked about about getting paid to travel is that you to put a lot of work into it so you have to love what you're doing I think that's really important you know if you hate Instagram don't try and become an Instagram influencer or just because you can make money on it but if you love YouTube and you and you enjoy spending time on there and creating videos then that's the platform for you so make sure that you're invested and you love that particular channel that you're going to stay going to get involved with because you're going to be spending on a lot of time with it so as we said at the beginning we want to give you a few little tidbits of information of how you can become a travel blogger because that's how we actually make our money there are a lot of things that you have to do there's a lot of work you put into it one thing we find about us being a travel blogger is you have to wear many hats now I took a course way before I started blogging I went to I had my full-time job in the film industry where I was a makeup artist and at night I went to school to a community college and took a travel writing course and that was invaluable to me because it gave me the confidence to know that actually when I was writing things on the internet I knew what I was doing today there are a lot of online courses that you can take yeah like travel blog success which is a great community and a whole package that can get you started and educate you and you can go there for information as your travel blog career grows or their superstar blogging by nomadic Matt where he has it broken down into different modules where if you want to learn just about the business of blogging or about writing or about video he has different courses for all of those sections so you can take it at your own pace and both of these are great I love them both because they offer a community and I think that's the real asset to both of these is that there's Facebook groups then email groups and chat rooms that you can go in and talk to people who have actually taken the course and who are successful at blogging so you can you always have mentors there and I think that's important with the course and the online world is a visual world so make sure you learn how to take great photographs dave was a part of a photography group before he got into travel blogging and travel photography and you also works on movies where you lit a bunch of movies like The Incredible Hulk and Chicago I'm bragging a little bit about him he's a little out of big blockbuster movies but the thing was you learned and understand the importance of light photography before he started even putting it out online and there are photography courses out there if you go to our blog we have a lot of information or in the links below on courses you can take but just make sure you know your skills and really take pride in putting out good content and then that's how you will grow your travel blog now we have an entire other video that's going to be about how to travel blog but that just gives you some ideas of how to get started and check out our blog for some more information we're going to put all the links below so you can read all of that but we hope that this gave you some ideas on how to travel the world and get paid for it and if you enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe to our Channel put out videos every week to teach you about things as well as travel around the world 
Hey everyone we're going with Cayman Island Helicopter tours for a helicopter ride a beautiful Grand Cayman Island. Are you ready Dave?I Oh I'm ready isn't going to be epic. So one of the things you have to do the Cayman Islands is definitely come to Stingray City. You get to hold them, feed them,  and get up and close with these beautiful creatures. And I also recommend if you are going to do it, you have to come with Cayman Luxury Charters. It's really great, they have a beautiful seadoo on the back and they really really help you get up and close and have that personal experience What a beautiful day here in the Cayman Islands.
