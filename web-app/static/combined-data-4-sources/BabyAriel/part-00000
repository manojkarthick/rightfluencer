what's up guys I love love I think out of every single week in the entire universe this week is Valentine's week and it is probably my favorite week because I just love love I mean who doesn't love love you have to love love so I am sitting here is my bear his name is I don't know commenting with him in the description I tweeted you guys and I said tweet me any questions about friendships / relationships really any type of love questions that you guys have and I'm gonna answer them we can just talk about love together because it's the best week in the whole entire it's about I just first thing I want to tell you are my view off the top of my head favorite love songs / love movies because if you didn't know I'm obsessed with movies so take your notepads out because you have to write down all of my recommendations because trust me I'm gonna give you some good recommendations movies Titanic but notebook love Rosie I'm holding two fingers and I'm on the third one love Rosie my favorite love straight movie of all time When Harry Met Sally it's an old movie but I guarantee you'll like it he it's on Netflix such a great movie not all the people know about it you have to watch it and there's two that my dad said I'd have to watch I haven't watched them yet Love Actually and say anything I got all these reference movies to me and he's never wrong so oh and a walk to remember comment down below if you watch any of them songs off the top of my head Julian Michael's issues and heaven she just put up heaven and it's so good Daniel actually talking about the song yesterday oh my gosh I've been listening to it and non-stop it's so good it's called 2 a.m. by Anthony Rizzo so good listen to Daniel Caesar any Daniel Caesar saw there's this song called best part and get you that are my favorites old Taylor Swift I guarantee will put you into your feelings you have to listen to some old Taylor Swift Justin Bieber her h er Sousa love galore supermodel and then probably Bryson tiller madisyn beard Kalani put some clogging what's a baby our yellow in there guarantee you she'll put you with your few so now they got the questions you guys sent I'm going to start off with friendship and go into crushes and then relationships and then breakups I'm gonna go in like you know that order how to get over fake friends so you're gonna meet a lot of people in your life it's inevitable some people are gonna stick with you some people are gonna stick with you for a short amount of time and they're going to turn out to be really sucky people have to remind myself that it doesn't matter how long I've known this person at the end of the day if this person is not treating me well that I'm going to have a conversation with them and I'm going to tell them exactly how I'm feeling and number one if they take what you're saying and they say oh my gosh I am so sorry I am oblivious to all of this I did not know that I was treating you this way I'm going to try to change it and they do change it and that's not a fake friend they just didn't know that they were hurting you know second if you go to them you talk to them about it and they say oh my god I'm so sorry and they try to change it and I'm not changing it they don't listen to you they don't care about what you've said then you say unfortunately look I tried with you I told you how I was feeling you're not taking how I feel into consideration then you're not a real friend always treat a friendship a close friend as a relationship you know the same way like in a relationship you're with someone non-stop when your friends are best friends with someone you're gonna be with them non-stop the same way you would talk about in a relationship same way you would break up in a relationship you have to do the same thing with friends it's a human unhuman relationship you have to just talk to them Amanda said I don't have friends I'm your friend I love even girl your friend tips on how to make some considering I'm shy in school it's hard making friends I'm not gonna lie to you is difficult best way to get over that hurdle joining a club a bunch of people will tell you oh go stay with someone new at lunch if you're able to do that then please go ahead I know me as a person every time my mom would say to me I'll just go sit with someone new at lunch I'm like mom it's not that easy joining a club however or an after-school activity I'm sure there are a ton of kids joining this club is club that they are all very passionate about they don't have friends either trust me just trust me second thing let's say you join this club or let's say let's say you're in a new class for example you go to the new school if you're in class and if someone is next to you to ask someone oh I need help with this problem I need your advice on this start with little conversation you can continue and I'm sure they're gonna reciprocate and I'm sure over time you guys are gonna become best friends and fall in love everything will be perfectly fine moving on to crushes there's a lot of questions that I'm seeing what do you do when you have a crush but don't really want to tell them yet how do you overcome the fear of rejection and tell your crush that you like liked them when is the right time to tell your crush that you like them so I'm gonna just answer all of those questions just talk about it first thing when you're developing a crush don't become obsessive I think everybody on this planet has had one of those and you had to learn how to pull back because let's say this crush of yours is not someone who's close to you and you can't see them every day and we're even if you can't spare a day and you're close enough you're gonna start thinking about them all the time and your brain is going to be consumed it's gonna drive you crazy and it's going to just make things a lot worse if they don't have the same feelings back for you stick to reality and figure out ways that you're able to talk to them start with that little conversation and be yourself say hey do you have the math homework see if they reciprocate any person who wants to get to know you sometimes you have to be bold to make the first move if you start talking to them first next day they may ask you a question show them that you're interested in them if they don't know that you're interested in them is very not going to maybe reciprocate the feelings because they're also scared of being rejected let's say you have this crush now okay and you don't know if you want to tell them you like them or not there are two sides to this story and in my frame here my clear love counseling brain hey you guys are the best of friends and you know that they really care about you as a friend and then there's be this person doesn't know who you are if this is me personally if you're really close to someone you know that they care about you tell them you don't make it weird you don't make it awkward maybe they feel the same way back because you guys are so close and maybe they like you not maybe to a movie or something if that's normal for you guys or after school say hey I really think that I'm starting to gain feelings for you uh-huh if this is someone who cares about you they either to tell you that they like you back or they're gonna say look I love you as a friend unfortunately right now I'm not feeling those feelings back and that's okay maybe this person is not for you think about this if one of your best friends came to you and said I'm starting to gain feelings for you some of that you care about you're not gonna be like us go get away from me I don't like you no you're gonna be like oh my god I'm sorry I love you as a friend they're not gonna hurt you now the other side of the story if this person doesn't know you exist yet which is fine we've all been there we've all done it trust me it's just it's I wouldn't tell them yet yes but they said a few minutes ago start off with a little conversation and get to know them start to get to know them the same way you're getting to know a friend and once you guys have built a pretty good friendship you feel like you're close and maybe you've heard something from your friend that says oh this this person starting to gain feelings for you that's what I would tell them how do you talk to your crush ask questions and be very open to just listening show them that you're interested you asked about their hobbies their favorite music what keeps them up at night their worst read their favorite dream do they have any siblings do they have any pets what's their favorite animal where do they want to live when they're older who are they in love with hopefully you their favorite flower a favorite TV show looking up questions because I'm not good at this their favorite constellation I love constellations what do you find hilarious but most people don't find funny what was the best year of your life so far but your favorite thing to do on the Internet what fad have you held on the fad have you held on to even though it isn't popular anymore there if you look at what the line trust me how to pop your crush you'll get a whole list of questions let's say you are talking stuff at lunch for example and you find yourself asking them all of these questions and they haven't asked you one question then that probably means that they're not interested which is okay again maybe this person isn't for you someone who is at least the least bit interested in you will ask you anything they'll want to know everything about you I guarantee what is your idea of a perfect date perfect date well let's see there are so many perfect things I feel like my idea of a perfect date is probably wake up we get coffee we spend the whole day let's say I'd an amusement park or something and then we come back to your house we play board games play video games watch a movie hang out and just talk and eat ice now moving on to relationships / breakups I'm not getting as many questions about relationships how do you deal with an oblivious boyfriend like a boyfriend who doesn't get hints I mean boys in general just don't get hints I think they just suck at hints boys and girls honestly if you recognize that they don't get hints you might just have to whatever you want to tell them just tell them but any more hints that you give them it's gonna give them get them even more confused I'm the type to be like oh you should like go talk to that girl then which means you should talk to me hello and now I talk about breakups and dealing with breakups which really honestly suck there's no good way of going around a breakup let go of that person you're gonna feel this urge to want to talk to them again because they were the biggest thing of your entire life and now all of a sudden they're just gone tell your friends not to bring them up anymore you have to just for your own sake honestly just refresh your mind to surround yourself with people who love you and who care about the UK weight step one and a half a minute go back allow yourself time getting over someone is not going to be done in a day getting over someone is going to take time and everybody's time is different people maybe they get over someone someone in a day some people may take three months a year allow yourself time and don't stress over the fact that oh my god not over than you I'm not over them yet cuz it's okay surround yourself with people who love you and care about you and are gonna hang out with you if it's someone to talk to now let's say you've been home for a few days iron you've been crying fine we've all been there you have to get up by getting up I mean you have to one day say you know what I'm done sitting down I'm done grieving get outside put your phone down take a walk take a run travel go skating make a schedule for yourself if you're busy and you keep yourself busy and you keep your mind focused trust me it's weird from one day to the next you're gonna be like what I don't think about that person anymore thank you guys so much for watching this video if you enjoyed it make sure to give it a big
