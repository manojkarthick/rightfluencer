Remember when we could eat a summer salad as we sipped rose out on the patio and not be cold while doing it? LA is going through a SHOCKINGLY chilly period  and it‚Äôs caught us all by surprise.

We‚Äôve been dissecting the ‚ÄòModern Victorian‚Äô trend lately with the final ‚Äòlighting‚Äô post and roundup on the blog today. It‚Äôs not all crystal chandeliers (in fact  it's very few) and most of it is unexpected and frankly VERY exciting. I will miss this trend very much.... Perhaps it's because I want to put fringe everywhere in my life. üì∑ Cochrane Design - http://bit.ly/ehd-mvl.

For Today's ‚ÄòI Design  You Decide‚Äô I pose all the options I‚Äôve considered for the fireplace  with the poll essentially being ‚ÄòShould I work with the stone we have? or demo and start fresh? Honestly I‚Äôm SHOCKED by what is winning by 80%. Head over to the blog and vote if you‚Äôd like. #EHDmountainfixerupper - http://bit.ly/ehd-mfp.

Man  I‚Äôm over this bullsh*t algorithm..... Happy Sunday - and thanks to all of you who commented yesterday. I‚Äôm still reading all of them (both on blog and Insta) and while I‚Äôm not feeling ‚Äúhappier‚Äù per se I do feel more connected and there is a relief knowing that so many of you who own guns want more restrictions and checks. Thanks for weighing in  guys. Lets not stop talking. xx. I stayed up until 1am writing a post about GUNS that I just published. But it's not what you think. It's an ‚Äòask the audience‚Äô for those of you who like guns. We all live in bubbles so I‚Äôm trying to get out of my bubble and find out how those of you who own a gun feel about more restrictions and the easy access of the AR15. It's in the spirit of trying to understand something that I truly don‚Äôt. No judgement (and yes  you can be anonymous). I guess I‚Äôll ask it here  too - if you own a gun do you think there should be more restrictions with tighter background checks  less loopholes  and banning of military style rifles? If not  why? I actually think there are way more gun owners who think there should be more restrictions and its that demographic that needs to speak out more. Those of us pro gun control are in an echo chamber and man  it's just GOING NO WHERE. We need responsible gun owners who don‚Äôt want AR15s to be for sale to speak up  call their congressmen  mobilize their state to say ‚Äòhey  lets reign this in a bit and ban military style rifles at least.' We‚Äôve been shouting for so long and nothing changes. Thanks for weighing in respectfully - https://stylebyemilyhenderson.com/blog/why-do-you-like-and-or-own-a-gun. The mountain fixer upper is about to be totally demoed  putting our weekend escapes from LA on hold. As much as I can‚Äôt wait for us to be able to go back  that does means more time relaxing at this home and I‚Äôm real ok with that. Have a great weekend xx üì∑ Sara Tramp for EHD. Quick Q - Are you a minimalist or a maximalist? üì∑ David Tsay for EHD #styledthebook. Last month I spent a weekend at the magical Ojai Valley Inn with my best friends from home.

Mixing an array of different cutting boards on your countertop is an easy way to add character  interest  warmth and depth to your kitchen. Plus you are READY TO CUT SOME MAD FRUIT. Bonus points for moody flowers. üì∑ David Tsay for EHD. Four years ago but I‚Äôm not mad. The old ban.do office we designed was F.U.N.  and midway through the week maybe we all need to have some?

A personal post. Our nanny  Sylvia is available for mornings or even full time  because our kids are now in preschool in the mornings together. It PAINS me to think that she would leave us altogether  but I want her to find the best long-term situation for her. I almost want to interview you before you meet with her because she deserves THE BEST family. She is hardworking  positive  has a GREAT attitude  is amazing with kids (obviously) and incredibly helpful in every way. Our kids LOVE her. Ideally you would live on the east side and need help 9-1 (or somewhere in there) and likely she could be full time this summer as we might be living up at the mountain house.... if you are a family (or if you know someone) who deserves to have this amazing person care for your kids in the morning  please email hello@emilyhendersondesign.com for her phone number.. Today on the blog we are digging our design claws back into the ‚ÄòModern Victorian Trend‚Äô we intro‚Äôd the other week.

Our living room  shot last year  has changed a lot already. Writing the post about it now for this week. Any guesses? Hint: Rhymes with ‚Äòjug  smook-snelves  and Gart‚Äô. Remember when I had bright colors all around over my house?? Have I gotten boring? older? Oh man  PLEASE DON‚ÄôT ANSWER THAT... or maybe just trends have changed? Or maybe I‚Äôve just shifted to explore a different side of my brain? OR Maybe it was a better fit in this house and less so in our new house ?..... thoughts? I missing it in this photo for sure.... After a very busy week of traveling and designing at supersonic speeds (I seriously can‚Äôt wait to show you more of the design plans for BOTH houses) I am ready to relax and watch some Super Bowl commercials.

You learn a lot of fun stuff when you design a house - for instance  did you know that normal tap water can ruin your risky ‚Äòlive' finish brass fixtures? SUCH A FUN FACT.

the Hendersons get into the holidays all of us and I want our kids to you know explore the creativity and decorate however they want to however I still want to sleep really beautiful so with the help of target in our house I'm going to show you how you can have a really kid-friendly holiday that still looks sophisticated the kids wanted really bright colors and while of course everything can look good together on a tree I wanted our living room to feel a little bit more neutral and calm so we give them their own trees to decorate in their own rooms wish they had loved so we headed to targets under shop so let the kids choose a tree a tree topper and they have a ton of great ornaments for only $3.00 now they wanted literally everything there and shot in the two toddlers isn't exactly easy but have one choose a couple ornaments minted build very grown-up Charlie's favorite color is red which makes our job pretty easy at this time of year working with the current theme of his room we brought in a green artificial tree and then decked it out with a bunch of shatterproof ornaments the twinkle lights and the holiday sheets make him actually really excited to go to bed Elliot is barely 2 she has less opinions as of now so I got to play out my fantasy holiday in her room it's silver gold and whites with no shortage of blush i clustered a few small skinny trees together to create a mini forest and then I've peppered them with kid-friendly ornaments that I knew she would love and then I scatter this pink and glam motif all around her room she loves it but just to be clear I wish it was my room the living room is the main area of our house where we spent almost all of our time so I wanted to go all out but I wanted it to still feel neutral and calm and easy to maintain I went with the color palette of blues grays greens Silver's blacks and whites and then I warmed it up with some wood and gold tones the artificial tree from Target fools everyone it looks so real and we love that it has no mess and we can use it year after year not everything needs to scream holiday targets threshold collection has classic affordable pieces that will add a lot of warmth to your home a trick of mine is when in doubt just add greenery and twinkle lights I'm obsessed with these battery-operated LED string lights that last all season make the room Sparkle but without any hassle of cords repeating the same elements over and over makes your holiday decor look really cohesive at the same time it makes it really easy to buy and arrange I went with trees and animals and I've styled each vignette with those pieces when you walk into the room it feels like the holidays for sure and yet it's really called a nun chaotic it's sophisticated without being stuffy and it's festive without being too fancy you think it's safe to say that we're all pretty into it happy holidays found the Hendersons 
hey guys it's Emily Henderson so if you caught my last video you know I'm working with method to bring style and personality to this lovely and airy living and dining room space in their home there's a great base to work with sure well it doesn't mean that I'll have a lot to do to really take things to the next level I'm using methods bold and bright cleaning product as the color and style inspiration but while I'm at it it's rather good at doing another job with our table cleared and cleaned I'm ready to dress this nakedness some personality there's a ton of natural light in here which makes this white wall feel really blank and empty and since we're hard up for wall space I want this to be a statement something to really create conversation and add a lot of energy this dining room needs color and life to make it feel more inviting enter the new rug it not only grounds the dining room but immediately makes the space feel happier this seating area feels a bit serious and I want to lighten things up so I'm gonna style these chairs is something that feels more young and poppy now let's move on to the piano the problem here is as gorgeous instrument is just sitting there all alone let's give it a friend all it needs is some beautiful artwork to instantly complete the space let's face it cleanliness breeds happiness no matter what style so it's going to make this room feel even more bright and airy you [Music] and with that we've transformed the simple house into a colorful fresh and happy home full of style and personality be sure to check out my fellow designers who are tackling the other parts of this dream home until then thanks for watching bye guys 
hey guys it's Emily Henderson and today I'm designing a space for a pretty adorable four-year-old named Sienna with the help of targets new pillow for kids collection we're gonna put the word play in flavor Jen and Jason run the site green wedding shoes calm and they want the room to be fun functional and cozy but match the contemporary aesthetic of the rest of their home we moved into our house about maybe four months ago when we saw the loft upstairs like that would make perfect playroom I think that's why we're looking Emily like we need a little help trying to figure out how because we definitely know what we like and our daughter doesn't knows what she likes so it's sort of the point of marrying those two styles and trying to give her a rad pad challenge accepted I also love red pads first up a pattern wallpaper and a built-in daybed to create a really cozy reading nook now it's time to bring in pieces to create that play area but we had a life-or-death decision to make pink or mint pink or mint I don't know so we pull the trigger on mint because we love the way that it works with the princess canopy and we added a sconce for some nighttime reading time for some critical feedback how about I make it fun yeah how about I make it bring us some pink do you want to go on an errand with me gee what's your favorite store that was not scripted just so you know so off we went we were looking for baskets pillows and lighting all in the new pillow fort collection and it was looking really good the client was happy but getting a bit anxious she was desperate to find that perfect piece that would really tie the whole room together aha well her priorities are a little bit different than mine back of a house it's time to get styling it was starting to look pulled together and playful my plan was working but my client had some edits apparently sneaky sneaky but hey that looks really good and now the finishing touches it's time for the reveal with all my fingers crossed alright CNS open your eyes what is your favorite part about the playroom the houses of the wallpaper yeah and that's the ball paper - do you feel like this is now a playroom that you can hang out with your kids definitely looks a lot like our style but definitely like hers it's got the pops of pink and a bright colors that she likes fun pillows the functionality of our toys can get put away and nobody sees them do you have you have your arts and crafts table you have your cuddling and that was a big thing cuddling and reading and feeling comfortable they're really soft rug you have a teepee fort you have lots of storage for your toys do you have everything you need for your plate playroom are we done should we go home uh-huh thank you you were very good client very demanding but you know what I wanted to give you what you wanted she got her rad pad full of fun and functions the whole family now can read play crafts and generally just hang out together but Sienna had one last very important announcement 
[Music] this is something that I have never done before taking a space that was never meant to be lived in and transforming it into something beautiful any interior designer loves to work with natural light today we're gonna be working in a space that was specifically designed to be flooded by it to pull this off I'll be working with Nicky Brant mark of a my Scandinavian home to completely rethink this overgrown and forgotten greenhouse [Music] to help us design the greenhouse we are working with Samsung and the frame TV it's the first TV I've ever seen that blends seamlessly into the design of a room with beautiful design options the frame TV truly is designed for your space how incredible it's big like we can do a lot with this the light is amazing I'm kind of thinking these Colonie lot and they are like it is a carnie it's sort of a Swedish allotment and you're allowed to live in this little house somewhere to sleep and you know little sitting room it's very very basic but it's a little bit of a house I mean this would be a magical place to stay for a summer you live in Sweden so you're the the scandi expert here what is what would it look and feel like if it was to be a Scandinavian even though you wanted to be like a home it's still quite minimalist okay kind of come maybe we keep how I used all the painters but then give it like a fresh flooring it's a lot about textures as well so like a really really light palette of new toes like light Gray's sheepskin yeah all right little dining area sitting area I think this seems like the best corner to put the frame yeah all right so we need to rip a bunch of stuff out we have some a lot to do this is the TV I was lying about this is the frame now it comes in with just a standard black finish or there's white the beige wood and there is a want look it's nothing I know this is really pretty and it there's a really good wood grain ah it's you know if these pop off and those pop on just that's it that's it this one I feel like it's more contemporary it's more for like a modern home yeah I think that this one's lovely but I think the white one fits and more with the fact that we're going for the Y to the light gray and I just think we'll blend in so well with the room and the white so there is a whole catalog that we can choose from scroll through all the art lovely it's like what we've all together or as far as TVs go because it just becomes a piece of oh yeah this is gonna be so perfect in the greenhouse it's gonna make also every living room so much prettier alright we have this Swedish allotment theme but what a like what does that mean what do we need to get for it um quite basic okay no frills remove all this handle this that's all gone you can get down to this bare floor what should we do for the floor I'm thinking it could be just lovely just to go for a simple whitewashed wood so right now if we put the dining table here we'll put the frame in this corner and you can put it on the studio stand this base like this is to live the Scandinavians dream because it is just so nice and light and bright I do know a tiny bit of Swedish go on then yeah for 40 good Moscow great that's us you know we shouldn't but but it was spot on still all right so we know the general look and feel I do like the idea of a round sisal rug underneath caesarian table because because the floor is white and the tables white and we need something to break it up let's see we were thinking a cot or some sort of like temporary feeling bed we had that nutty corner for the teepee so may be mounted on the wall or we could put it on a studio stand and thank you we love this lights and the Arab we don't need a lot of accessories but we want a lot to play with so if you can bring us way too many options and then we'll just reject most of them that would be very I will take them all that maybe a credenza or a dresser for the east wall very clean line okay I think really for some sense that we can kind of like growing taking over the the green house so you know what could be awesome is having a plant in the middle by the pole it's right now and that's where we have the most Heights you know this is gorgeous I think that isn't too tall because it's in the center of the roof it could be really pretty this is a time when we can actually bring in outdoor plants inside and they'll live jeez it's huge it's like a bed yeah it's very comfortable though I love the I love that size I'm not sure about how is that I understand why it's such a smart and we have more space than we thought because we originally thought that this cot was something over there and we like it better over here so we could actually try and find a daybed that's a proper mattress there so we found this tree at the nursery what's the chances that we can plant it into the ground instead of just having it in a pot very good should we put like white rocks on top that's great that's great how are you feeling about everything it was a really good cool on the daybed cuz after we saw it in there it did look a bit too small so I feel a bit better now that we decided to change that I think what's being a bit interesting is normally when you work with a space sort of when the night goes round it comes cold or warm but this has got glass all the way around since actually the first time I've worked with a space that actually got north south east and west one room so it's it's a happy room I think if we just take one of these don't really ones away so it stays fresh we're really doing the important things first it's important to get the napkin styled on the table I was gonna say mmediately it's just coming in in nowhere so the gold is too ornate yeah [Music] there we go it's amazing that's looking good so you're watching TV and eat turn it off and it becomes a piece of art instead of the black box like that thing that we always hate in the room is now a piece of art I was trying to envisage like what piece of artwork we could have in here I looked through Samsun collection and the art store and I've narrowed it down so for example this one that is very pretty so I also thought this one though I thought I'm super pretty I just thought in this space it's very calm very clean and it doesn't matter how late or dark your room actually is because there's a brightness sensor so if a cloud was to come over right now for instance it would adjust you could see it just as well it solves so many problems [Music] so here we are finally finish when we first stepped in there it was it was had so much potential but it was definitely dirty and rustic and full of beautiful weeds I had quite a strong vision of how I wanted it to look I kind of had this idea that it would be light bright minimal s and every detail is finished should we go look at it yes I can't see it it turned out Waiver kind of imagined it's just it could completely transform this room okay so we have our cute little dining area for three me you and a stranger that we meet and I love how the rug that's off the table from them okay over here we have our Lightwood scandi style credenza that's new I was a little bit nervous that this ohm chair was gonna be too big I mean she's big yeah but it's the chair with the rug with the side table and the lamp it just creates this perfect inviting vignette it's not your Danish classic I did not expect it this room would turn out so anything I really didn't the layered and easy I'm so glad we went with this instead of that cot do you know I think actually that the kitchen section is one of my favorite corners it really is it I can't believe we found this salvaged sink and this is reclaimed from the shelving which I barely even remember by the way like I don't remember how this looks before it's crazy well I can't believe how well it just masks this Center pole by bringing in all of these big plant moments it does still feel like we're outside except we're in this beautiful living room I'm so pleased that we went for the white frame it's it's so simple it looks so good in here and I'm really pleased with the studious stand so we're in here watching this wonderful nature show this makes me feel like I'm in Sweden back home and when we want to turn it off look at that it's just a simple piece of art it just looks like it's on a an easel and then if I want to be back in the forests of Sweden you could put it back over a TV again oh it's been such an interesting and inspiring project and so I was so excited when I was presented with this idea that we would be working with a greenhouse cause it's just the closest dwelling you get to actually living in nature I thought this is brilliant what a great opportunity to do something really really fun [Music] you 
so I'm trying to get things on me alrighty alright hey guys this Emily and Brian Henderson and inside this box is the gender of our second child soon the doctor has called or actually emailed Ginny Ginny put something that was the blue or pink in here and I don't know I think in my heart I picture myself a mom with two boys but then I but I feel like it's a girl really ready okay the color of the confetti anything Oh

hey everybody it's Emily Henderson reporting to you live from Los Angeles California where we are doing eight two day makeover the living dining room it's my team real people real budget help with a French target so watch as we turn this living room dining room from okay - OMG so Aaron and Carson just bought this house renovated and just moved in all the furnitures kind of hand-me-down so if we bought their 20s they don't want to like anymore I'm Aaron and I'm Carson I'm where the McKay's was so stupid during the renovation I didn't want to do anything else just focus on the renovations so this came at a really great time because I have been able to do any decorating here shopping so this is first up out with the old chunky furniture now it's time for some new target pieces the dining table was a little bit shabby chic for us so we decided to paint about a modern gray color and while we're at it we decided to refinish some other pieces too meanwhile Carson was building a mantle from scratch when suddenly you say it never rains in Los Angeles but when it does there's really only one thing to do Charlie decided he wanted to help us shop I think you might have inherited my shopping problem while we stick it to our loot parsing that's work on the custom mantel one wall down one to go Erina Carson had a lot of really pretty art which made our job a lot easier all we had to do is reframe a few pieces and arrange him on the wall next it's time to bring in the finished pieces and last but not least is the styling my favorite part you tada I love it I'm leasing it I think I love it so much it did so it is so beautiful you guys had a sofa here the big coffee table which he likes but it was really big apart and now because of this sectional and because of the white furniture it feels so much bigger yes the room I feel like just be like gain all this space by getting more proportional furniture for the space do you have a um I really love the near top I know I think it might be my favorite thing to imagine he made us look very good I like the leeming thing the chicken Dallas's that was the surprise I was not expecting that and I love that I like him in the TV higher what he's higher than away oh that's a point of attention I was gonna say I like the thing behind the couch to put stuff on yeah it's nice to have like another surface you know to just put stuff on we brought the bright colors from the living room into the dining room what was dark and heavy now light and airy I'm very happy with everything like but it just has more personality it looks just like home even my press like I feel like the whole room very us I'm very happy I'm great you 
just on your mantle so your mantle is basically the focal point of your living room the centerpiece of the house if you do it wrong it's pretty much like going to work without your pants on it's not only a missed opportunity but it can kind of make everything else in the room not look nearly as good so I'm going to show you three different ways you can style your mantle if guaranteed to look really beautiful first way is just choose one really large really beautiful piece and have it to stand on its own very simple very minimal the key is to make sure it's big enough this piece for instance is too small my rule would be to have the piece be at least 2/3 the size of the mantle itself this looks dinky and bitsy and accidental so it's not gonna work now something like this piece it's huge it's a really big piece of art and I love it but it's a little bit too vertical so if all those empty space here all those empty space here it's just too vertical to stand on its own this parrot is a bunch of other awesome pieces of art would be great this piece is very commanding it's beautiful enough to be in your living room and to be the centerpiece and it's definitely big enough it's practically the size of the mantel in my book you can't go too big it could even be bigger just don't go too small option number two is to use a collection of artwork so if you don't have something that's big enough but you have smaller pieces you can put two or three together to make it feel as visually big as a piece like this the key to styling art together is to make sure they're three different sizes and even better three different shapes so I have a tall vertical rectangle a square a small horizontal I think it looks good but it could look better it's three really hard shaped pieces and I want to soften it up a bit so I'm going to take away one of these rectangles and add something really feminine in sculptural to you soften all the hard edges of the squares I mean what's more feminine than pink peonies a key to option two is to have odd numbers to choose three or five things and then to make sure that they're different shapes and sizes and then to layer them in front of each other like this option number three is to create a collection of things on the mantle that work really well together and represent your personality almost consider a little mini world of all of your favorite things so I'm going to start with something really big that I love this peacock painting you still need something fairly large to ground this base doesn't have to be that big but you don't want like a little bitsy collection of things you need contrast in size and shape in scale in color and texture and finish the more contrasts the more interesting it is you can add in books sculptures picture frames I'm going to add in more shapes and some more colors so by styling your mantle not only do you create a beautiful focal point for your living room but so you also bring a ton of personality into your space do it you 
hey guys I'm Emily Henderson I'm an interior stylist blogger TV personality and general hopelessly market addict and now I wrote a book it's called Styles and these are the five reasons America number one because you'll finally find out what your true style is through my style diagnostic quiz are you more 70s Scandinavian industrial or contemporaries and bohemian take the quiz and find out number two because you'll find out my ten steps of how to make your house actually look like a beautiful egg number three because you'll learn my secret styling process for each room in the house starting with the basics the sofa credenza bar card etc diving in the east vignette and then finally how to pull it all together so this cohesive and yet effortless number four because it's the first book to have ever been ghost written by a cat number five because you learn over a thousand do's and dont's to styling your own home everything from how to create a unique color palette and what angles are the most flattering to photograph to what object you should never ever ever under any circumstances to put on your coffee table like ever so by our book hail maker house were beautiful and it will support cat litter picture across the world 
I never thought that I would love having soft and filtered water so much I'm Emily Henderson and I happily hired a coal again to soften her water even before they reached out for this partnership so yes I'm a fan of cold and water and here's why the water that we drink is obviously very important and with a cold in whole home water treatment system we can ensure that both the family and the house coz the best possible water the filtered water that comes out of both the fridge and the water faucet is the cleanest most delicious water I've ever had when we remodeled our house I really wanted this beautiful live brass finish for all of our faucets and hardware typically hard water means more chemicals minerals and toxins that can tarnish your faucets but with this system we can ensure that it's all filtered out even before it reaches the pipes or the faucets in our house it also helps to prolong the life of your appliances because it removes some minerals that can add to wear and tear less hard water spots on your glassware dishware silverware and countertops hard water can eat away at the fibers and your clothing so once softened your clothes will last longer it'll be cozier and it's better for your washer the benefits of soft water are visible in the bathroom as well soft water helps prevent hard water spots which makes it easier to clean your skin and your hair are so much softer because all the harsh chemicals and minerals have been removed so that's why I love our Colgan whole home system having clean filtered drinking water and softened water throughout all the pipes and faucets have been a really lovely benefit twofold our health and our health 
so as a blogger joique has a lot of stuff there 14 a ton of storage some it was really pretty some of it is really not so we do a combination of open and closed storage for the closed storage for joy keeps all the unsightly office supplies and then buddies we chose these really simple white metal cabinets but we want to check them out a little bit so we added these gold hardware and decked up toe-kick with some cheap paper for the open shelving we chose a really inexpensive very simple IKEA shelving unit but then we want to fit out a little bit by adding some paint color on the front while the shelves and then in addition that we added these half bugs on the top which just added like a fun architectural feature to see what we could see see see but all of sides you and all you saw was me I fell asleep so quick 
hey guys it's Emily Henderson so as you know we have two small kids and I really want to create a space that would inspire their imagination and creativity obviously that means putting a castle clubhouse in our backyard first we chose the far corner to kind of help create a focal point the entire family agreed that the castle theme was the way to go so I enlisted my friend Chris Lumpkin to help me execute it we partnered with wood naturally and chose this beautiful pine because of a durability affordability and its look and they'll be stained it little bit darker to make it more rich we designed it to be big enough to feel like a room even for sleepovers and yet we kept it off the ground to maximize the play space underneath the moldings drawbridge flags and windows make it feel really special even though the design of it is actually rather simple and then we put a pebble pit moat underneath it for them to dig and explore and hopefully spend hours entertaining themselves without us as you can see the kids love it even more than I do and trust me I love it a lot you [Music] 
so office seating areas can be really boring and we wanted this fee would be colorful and be really fun and look like joy so I kind of approach it just like I would a living room we started with this green sofa which is really saturated but we didn't stop there instead we added these hot pink club chairs and then because Joy's have so many friends or artists we decided to take all those prints and paintings and create a huge gallery wall behind me 
hey guys Emily Henderson here and today I'm going to show you how you can make masculine style with feminine style so you both feel represented and you don't for a blueprint using a piece of furniture the first tip is to start with very streamlined foundational pieces so I had this sofa that's very modern and masculine the credenza superstrate and wooden whites is still very streamlined and same with the shelving unit none of them are really detail-oriented or have too many flourishes they're very very simple tip number two think leather and wood bringing in leather and wood makes a space feel a little bit more masculine but not in a way that's totally dude tip number three is to mix these rectangular kind of masculine pieces with pieces that are a little bit curvier a little bit more feminine tip number four is that make sure you have a balanced color palette of both masculine and feminine colors so this sofa isn't exactly terribly feminine but it's not masculine either it's kind of a light aqua let me have a teal back there and a hot pink that is considered a bit more feminine but we have also mixed in a lot of darker tones for instance the black chair some really rich woods the coffee table the shelving unit and the credenza to help it feel all balanced together tip number five incorporate the TV and the media but in a way that feels a little bit more disguised and more refined so here's what you do look for credenza that has two different compartments the top part is open so the speakers that can always be exposed but the bottom part is closed so you only light it open when you and watch TV instead of having cupboards that are out in the middle of the room makes it much easier alright tip number six is get crazy and feminine with your accessories it's a lot easier to put feminine accessories on top of masculine furniture than it is masculine accessories on top of feminine furniture so this is where you go a little bit nuts all right so you can see now with accessories it's a wildly different room all of a sudden that has so much more life and personality so remember you don't have to break up just because you guys have different tastes and furniture both of you can live in the same space both feel represented 
[Music] every time I passed an old barn I think it would be so much fun to design something in there to use some of its rustic charm to create a modern living space well now I finally get the chance I'm going to work with style blogger Louise Rowe to design an elegant and stylish space in this classic barn this is absolutely incredible with its aged wood and rough stones will look to maintain the soul of this truly historic place there is so much character and history you can feel the soul in it using Samsung's TV the frame will be mixing modern technology with century-old details to tell a new story in this 120 year old barn like what does this lend itself to being besides the most like predictable rustic living room like we wanted you know take it up low without using the word rustic I wonder if there's a library feel we could bring to it what if we turned it into some sort of like gentleman's lounge just like we're this multiple seating areas and it feels like sophisticated yeah but with a bit of glam I think the bones of it all very rustic so we were saying instead of going twee we're gonna elevate it I was thinking about a bar over here can we build a wall there and then back there we want to create a library so bookshelves pretty planetaries so then the question is TV TV we could put it on the new fresh wall put a gallery wall around it I love the idea of making it into a gallery wall so that you don't really see the TV when it's off yep I don't think I've ever been this excited about something electronic it is a TV but it's not a TV it's masquerading as a piece of art which is music to my ears because I hate essentially ruining a beautiful wall with a giant TV screen agreeing and this doesn't look like one and so for us we're going to serve in a gallery wall and it's gonna just look like any other beautiful piece of art that we have that's such a lovely idea to just have it disguise itself into a gallery wall actually I'm very excited about the frame because you get a lot of different options and colors and I don't know about you but I'm loving this walnut I like the juxtaposition of the dark word with our word decking right behind alright so it typically you have a cluster of course yeah coming down from your TV right well with this TV you have the invisible connection and it's this yes this h√°jek power cord that's it it is it's so tiny this from a design perspective changes the game what's the overall look and feel we are thinking library and elegance but by that we mean tufted leather very rich textures I think we have an option to get this black leather sofa I actually like the fact that it's more of a modern shape because like you said we don't want to go to old school alright for rugs we could go for a collection of antique that's a blue wall it does give a beautiful idea of how it can really bring a wall to life so we want to put the frame in the middle of a gallery wall right yeah okay so we have chosen yeah oh no way you are never gonna guess the name no I decide gentlemen's gray we didn't plan this you're more in the fashion beauty world so how do you feel that in a project like this very excited I predominantly am in the fashion and beauty space but I started my career out in magazines in the UK and actually I did a lot of work with makeovers and interiors and those are my favorite things to do and also I love the fact that there's history to this building I love about anything with a story I do hope we chose the right blue like we did it pretty sad I know you know we were both totally into it and I feel like it was the perfect shade I really do like its confidence we nailed it gallery walls coming to life we have a lot of a pieces to choose from yeah we do so we know what we have but I think there are some things we need to go get some gap yeah all right let's go it's horrible that we have to go shopping now so maybe art lamps I think we're just gonna no let me see it yeah the thing is you really have to dig because some of the best stuff isn't like just out there for you this chunks are good this top one could be a coffee table so you know how we're doing the whole library theme this is like a card catalog I absolutely love that and in all the pictures we have on the mood board we don't have that exact thing but that's the vibe ompletely yeah I think so this is a love it or hate it peace do you do you love it or hate it I appreciate it I wouldn't have it anywhere near my house no I do think it's great for this [Music] this I think we're nearly there guys so the constructions all done now it's time to play we know that we like a sofa here and if we did do back-to-back then they could each have their own rug hold on this is gonna be too big for here don't do it so do we want to do like a game table here yeah yeah I think it looks great [Music] does it seem like too much of a lonely vertical piece like pretend I'm a tree yeah nice an impression things need something modern to break those two up top I love it though really love it great those TVs can be an eyesore and when you put so much work and effort into a beautiful room it looks like a piece of art because it's so close to the wall there's no gap so this I just thought was cool that's very pretty this one I love because it is actually a library I really like it because we do have these hits of weight everywhere and I love that it's a new modern photograph a bite of an old world spit yes which is very much what we've done here huh here's the moment let's see it yeah yeah feels right I love that once it's mounted most TVs that's it they're removable but this guy can wiggle how am i doing I think that looks perfect here we go yes a few years ago hey junk and dust and cobwebs but it still looks like the same barn just better I think that's key is that it's kept its soul it's character it's just a very cool space with so many areas and details I'm gonna check them all out I think that this has really come to life fresh garnishes some color the greenery a giant mirror it's modernized it it's brought it to life our truck is just a beautiful piece of history which goes with this the lovely character of this room remember this piece I love that it was in all that library card catalog and speaking of library I was just gonna say it we do need a card catalog cuz girlfriend we got my books books to read so it's very in keeping and I think the colors are brought to life and the one piece of art I was skeptical about I got to give it to you it looks fantastic it really does a fresh enough this area and make it feel more modern can we talk about blue paint gentlemen's grey earlier I thought it was a bit too blue and then second coat dried art books it I think it's perfect I think if it was any darker it wouldn't have the same vibrancy that it has now imagine if you came over here for a party I'm imagining and say you were sitting here and you'd look up you would not even know that's a TV never the fact that this was found downstairs below the barn and is a real old safe means so much and keeps the story alive of this quality I bet this guy never thought he'd see the light of day again and here is pretty impressed with this entire situation I can't tell you how many articles I've written on how to hide a teeth this is what everybody wants to to know about and now that problem has been solved samsung solved it with the frame cuz I can go from Washington TV with one button to heart and instantly it takes this room from being the TV room to being any room you want it to be whether it's a lounge and living room a dining room it's it does transform it in one button and it looks fantastic it does I've never decorated or designed a barn like I've done modern farmhouse together a legit barn like this and I feel happy just sitting here yeah me too okay I think that because we left so much character it's just it's completely transformed it but kept-kept its soul it it feels warm and romantic and welcoming but very cool yeah I think the word cool actually sums it up yeah it's super cool [Music] you 
hey everybody my name is Emily Henderson and I am an interior designer stylist blogger TV host person and typically I do videos but they're more about how to style your mantle or how to like arrange pillows on a sofa and this video is going to be way different so here's the story there are 50,000 homeless people in LA there's probably way more than that honestly they don't even know how to count them and many of them thousands of them are children like infants two-year-olds eight-year-olds you know like kids they're living on the street or in cars I'm today at the San Fernando rescue mission which is a family homeless shelter you have to have children or to be able to temporarily stay here the shelter burned down last year and it's been being rebuilt ever since then and naturally you can imagine that they don't have a huge budget to hire a design team or even to have nice furnishings and that's where I come in and that's where you come in so I am volunteering my team to redesign the space or to design the space for the first time I guess but we need support we need money it's sixteen thousand square feet it's really really big and my goal and my job is to make it really inviting and homey and comfortable with the right amount of furniture and accessories and artwork and just a place that makes them feel not just safe but also inspired shelters like this are actually helping helping the entire world because it's changing the lives from when they're really young like them that can actually fix these problems become successful in independence adults especially as a parent now knowing that your children have a safe place to sleep that's huge it's something that I for sure take for granted like I can't imagine like worrying about whether Charlie has a safe place to sleep or not and so I'm one of lucky ones and and whatever you call how you were raised those lucky charms blessed if you weren't living in your car you you were one of those and and a lot of these families that stay here they're not this mission right here the rescue mission it's so lovely it's a nice place to I mean just everything is appreciated from the food to the big house people have really poured out their heart to people that come and feed us they have really been an example for our vote for me because I'm looking at them and I'm looking at myself in the future of coming and helping someone I was one that slept in the corner with my kids um and I had to do what I had to do I mean no child should have to endure that but through the mission I mean you know this has helped a lot of people and in a gift of dignity and belief back in and that love for the families and that's what you Bank on our goal at the mission is to provide that dignity I'm Wade tremor I'm the director of the San Fernando Valley rescue mission what originally inspired me to get involved in this issue of homelessness is that 20 years ago I was waiting for a movie in Westwood and this little girl walked up to me and asked me for food and it never occurred to me before that a child would be homeless I knew of you know adult homelessness that to think of a little girl who was homeless it really just ruined my life in a really good way and so I got out of line and I just asked her why she was homeless I just wanted to hear her story and she just explained to me this just awful story of this monster that her mom had married and she ended up getting basically booted out of the car on Hollywood Boulevard with a backpack and explained to me that she'd already been involved in you know just things that nobody should ever be involved with much less a twelve-year-old girl and so I just I was really frustrated that night because I didn't know what else to do for Angel and just kind of made a commitment to myself that I would never be in that situation again 60% of our guests in our shelter throughout the years have been kids who were school-aged children and the youngest kid in our shelter right now is in one bowl so being able to intervene that early in a child's life is just critical to their long-term success and you know really thriving as people and contributing to society so on May 3rd of last year we I woke up to find out that our building was on fire we lost everything unfortunately for the families that we serve they had the very little that they did have they lost that and so thankfully nobody was injured in the fire we are queer so committed to opening a shelter as quickly as possible and so we're the new shelter now and we're in the midst of building again this 90 veg shelter that will be done in April of this year that's inspiring that really helps with their healing and that helps them move forward and this should feel like a home we want people not to live in a facility but to live in a home which is what we all want $10 thousand dollars hey if you have $10,000 extra laying around please please donate or if you have services that you want to donate instead which is awesome you can go to my blogs style by Emily kinder CENTCOM for those of you that are about to click donate thank you so much for me from the mission and from most importantly the families and we start living here you 
there's something really special about being close to the water it's as if we're naturally drawn to the setting there's this shared sense of call where the water meets the shore that's why I'm working with Kate Aaron's of Witten delight to use the rustic charm of this empty boathouse to design a space for collecting lasting memories have you ever designed a lake house or a boathouse I have not so this is on my bucket list to add a twist to the project we'll be using Samsung's new TV the frame to show keys photos of Kate's growing family and this lakeside retreat [Music] it's it's rustic but it's really pretty this is awesome this stonework with the wood is so beautiful what elements should be in here like what are we doing in this room one thing that I've always wanted living in Minnesota is a place by the lake that is really like home you know so we see that so many of our friends cabins would be nice to be able to have a place to party oh my god this would be a great place to have a party up we definitely want a central place for the family to hang out I think that we should put a big sectional here but not like a you know a narrow seat lots of toughing like a big family deep comfortable sectional right we also need a place to I think gather around a big table I love the idea of being able to open up these doors and have their breakfast or dinner or lunch by the water let's get started I think we can definitely rip this off yeah like I want to see that natural light yes like cleaning this up forget all the benches out of here then obviously they need a place to store their 19 boats this is the frame this is the TV that's gonna anchor our comfortable cozy seating area I hear that it mounts directly to the wall like no gaps or anything it's like a like a picture frame I have a few photos that I took in the recent vacation that feel perfect these yes these are feet I can't leave you check these what's great is that we can really upload whatever photo that you want on your phone so it's really pretty seamless you said in the collage I think these two look really sweet together well I think that we've got some good options here so we can get the room put together and decide and later on what we want to finally put up I could show you some of my photos oh I wouldn't see your baby's my baby's baby shot I have two kids you are about to have two kids yes we are well-qualified to make this a family friendly weekend retreat well one thing I've always wanted to create as a space where you can make memories as a family and with friends and that's what I think is so special about you know places you get to return to [Music] so one thing that I like to do when I'm designing rooms mostly because I come from a graphic design background as I'm I get drawn to color palettes and printing pattern so I thought that like just white and blue patterning they don't bring in that into bugs or pillows like that can kind of guide us that'd be great I love that idea and what mixing rugs weird we're totally mixing I'd love for sofas yep something like this really deep really comfortable and loungy I like this sort of neutral tone it's got enough to ground it this leather ottoman nice to fit right on the protec sofa yeah one piece that I know you tell us I'm so excited about is this chefs lounge chef we're at style for a while and I was always trying to bring them back I was like why are we not in shez lounges it's because we all don't know how to say it does that well here we have it should have it sheds lounge but house is cleaned out but we're unpacking all the furniture the rugs making some design decisions and it's beginning to come together so we've brought in a four major rug options and I was hoping that we could mix all these people who rugs together but they're all too big this is ten by fourteen yeah it's huge so that's pretty much our fault brighter creams for pillows okay we definitely need we've got to do a little bit of shopping so I think we're gonna go and pick up a couple things but we're beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel this town it very adore this really cute look this place looks good you're like little old buoys I think that's very coastal yeah maybe to coastal maybe to coastal really on the head that's okay I am gonna buy it look how beautiful that I mean I know it might save our house but just as covered in ivy oh that's so nice what should happen over here you know those gallery walls with all the little Hugo Guinness sketches yeah that's kind of what I was thinking and we can probably have someone cut these mats to custom fit that I can't believe you just sit and do these thank you I like these two okay okay so so boat and awesome chair they'll be very cute well we've got the frame up so the last thing that we need to do is select the matte sand feels too dirty the puller is a little too bright white in here I think warm is perfect antique is a bit but I mean that's actually pretty nice but go back to warm you really see the photos like those pop alright so let's do warm that looks so beautiful in this room yeah it really does so I think it's now time to finally decide what frame option we put on the frame so let's snap it on here looks great I wish matting real picture frames were that easy I feel like we need flowers for the party later these are so really pretty I think it's a good color cuz you know yellow complements Llewelyn it'll kind of bring in an accent color we don't have right now you just have a nice height to them you know love the color it is pretty we don't have there's not that much color in here so which i think is good on a day to day basis but that's that is pretty fun for a party collaborating with Kate has been awesome she knows her stuff I was like nervous to work with Emily we gonna feel like we're definitely on the same wavelength so it's it's been a lot of fun brooms all done should we open these guys up let's do it do you remember how dark it was and dirty and look at it now I know it's a I mean it's wildly transformed just let it is completely it's an actual livable space and a comfortable one at that it's our weekend retreat the decision to put the dining or my table over here was was a good one because remember we could have put it by the fireplace yep but we would have lacked this great view and the sounds when we're sitting you know with their friends and family over a great meal all of the rugs combined really lives the whole space because the cements floor well it is kind of you know chic and away if it isn't exactly inviting and I love that we brought in some bamboo and some sort of unexpected dining chairs with these director's chairs feels really kind of eclectic and and brings up the cool factor I think all your drawings it's really fun to add personal touches to the space and you forget that sometimes little sketches can can make a impact in the frame I may need to take one home you can have one everybody wants to be the person that gets - yeah that gets us in here I've been scoping that seat out so you brought that piece in and then the bookshelf I mean who can't sit and read when you've got this sitting right here and I like that you know we can style it out a little bit on top and you don't I mean this you absolutely do not realize this is a television exactly I like that this is like a self-contained conversation area yep you know with the sectional and that side chair and even these floor pillows a lot of people can gather around here hang out play games talk and then you know so we can retreat so then when we want to relax also watch some TV one of my favorite features about the frame is I can change whatever is on the screen based on my mood or the occasion like let's say my in-laws are coming over and I've got these great new photos of my son and I I'd quickly just put up the photos that I selected earlier and we're ready to go oh look at that chubby baby I think we're all set I know for people to start writing me too they're gonna freak out hello hi [Music] well this was the boathouse now it's our weekend getaway only gets better as the Sun Goes Down so we've got front-row seats right here [Laughter] these are photos that Kate took by the way with her phone so she is a note it's one button art mode to TV come on over we need to catch up I can't see we haven't been on a boat yet this is amazing [Music] you

hey guys it's Emily Henderson and Orlando Soria and today we're going to talk to you about how to choose the perfect size rug for your living room alright so the biggest mistake that we see and we see it all the time is that the rugs tend to be too small for the space so the first thing we do when decides the right rug size is we actually measure the size of the seating area all right so measure the room and realize the room is pretty big the seating area is at least we need like an 9 by 12 but first I want to show you what happens if we bring in a rug that's too okay so the rub works in one sense that it is a little bit bigger than the sofa on both sides and I like for the rug to be at least six inches bigger on both side of the sofa so we're about hitting that so that's good but none of the furniture legs are on it and the room is really big so the proportion of the road to the room is totally off this isn't like wildly too small but it is bigger be better and the orientation of it being horizontal with a sofa it's actually kind of like squashing the room and making the room feel smaller so did you want to try it oriented vertically sure all right the good thing is there is at least six inches on both sides of sofa or rug so that dimension is correct yes it's wide enough it's just not long enough I think our lesson is that we have to go up one more size so here we have a 9 by 12 what's very well it's off all right so this guy is a 9 by 12 it's big nice big rug for a nice big room so let's see what happens we put all the furniture on top of it this is our rug perfect rug size 9 by 12 is any bigger it would be like running into both sides of the room so we don't want a 10 by 14 but now all the furniture fits on it so it dictates a conversation area and makes the room feel very pulled together all right so just to recap first tip is measure your space and make sure that you're getting the right rug for the right room tip number 2 is be consistent so if your legs are on have them all on or if they're off have them all off or if they're half on have have them half on but don't have your sofa on and your chairs off that really cuts a conversation area tip number 3 orientation right mm-hmm orient the rug the right way for the right room true so you don't want to orient it to the sofa and then cut off the chairs you want to make sure that if it's a long room oriented lengthwise all right there you have it guys how to choose the right rug for your space so happy rod hunting 
the holidays can be nice I know because I have two small kids and I want the home to look pulled together but my main priority is to create a home where they can laugh and smile as much as possible so I partnered with Target and their new wonder shop to share with you some of my secrets start with a consistent color palette that way you have some parameters to help guide your decor this is the time of year when you can really bring in some bright colors so we chose traditional red and green but we mixed in blue just to help shake it up any colors work as long as you have some neutrals so doesn't feel so chaotic tap into your inner kid even if you don't have kids frosty Santa and Rudolph are all familiar happy faces for your kids pepper them around your house mix them together and the more at the merrier keep it low maintenance it'll make your life easier and theirs or fun remove anything within reach that they can break or the can break set hang fragile glass ornaments only on the top half of the tree and use wood plastic or fabric ornaments on the bottom create forever memories together make and hang ornaments and be sure to put a picture of your kid or a loved one or a pet and one of the frames and add it to your personal collection have activities that get them ready for the big day an advent calendar not only gets I'm excited but it teaches them at patience and numbers too a toy train becomes the go to morning activity is the gift they get early but it keeps them really entertained which is kind of a gift for you too I know the holidays can be overwhelming but make it easy on yourself and just make your kids smile because really that's all that matters

hey guys it's Emily Henderson and today with the help of Target we are going to redesign a teeny tiny nursery for a teeny tiny little baby there might be a lot of pink and a lot of bunnies involved Jen and Jason run green wedding shoes calm and they're having a new baby but the nursery is totally empty when we first sort of got a view of the space the nursery is a little smaller than we would have liked and we tried mapping out how it could work and we tried about ten different ways and we were bumping into tonight's tans and bumping into the crib everywhere we went so yeah our old old furniture was not fit I'm looking for a space that feels really like sweet and nice but kind of also fun and a little bit more on the sophisticated side I could use some help you want to be my assistant thank you I would love that you and me I asked for her resume but she gave me a smile instead good enough let's hit it this tiny room will be some high impact but in a quiet way since it's a nursery so enter pink bunny wallpaper obviously a nursery is seemingly easy to layout right the major elements are a crib a changing table and a chair but this one was strangely difficult to figure out so after trying out approximately 350 7 million trillion different combinations we finally found the right one so to celebrate headed to target we needed the final layer you know the fun stuff a my assistant Sienna well she knows a thing or two about that we wanted lamps pillows and some tiny accessories but we needed to divide and conquer so I grab some whimsical shelving and she well she kind of lost focus but whatever she's very very cute back at home I had some tough design decisions to make so I turned to the person who I trust the most god she's a genius sienna and I finished styling the room and thanks to the target baby and pillow fort line it came together pretty darn quickly and now it's time to see what our clients think are you ready it feels bigger to me I didn't think we're going to fit so much furniture in here I like how we can fit a crib in a chair a changing table we need to think about a toy box I love love the bunny wallpaper and I also love this little sitting area because I don't spend a lot of time there yeah I didn't - I set it up myself since I have a baby and I was like yeah I want to tip here and I look at the window right can I hold you for a second you I just want to say thank you very much for helping me design your sister's room you have a real potential for interior design do you are you interested in the internship unpaid 
hey guys I'm Emily Henderson and welcome to my succulent garden today I'm going to show you how to make your own a succulent garden because they're really easy they're really affordable and they're super fun look how much fun I'm having and so what you're gonna do is start with a bunch of succulents obviously and some planters I have a lot of vintage planters because I'm kind of a hoarder and what am I do is make an arrangement with in one of the planters so it's important to get succulents for their varying height styles colors and textures and I prop them in the planter first so I know the composition you don't have to be that anal you can just kind of go for it and then I throw a little dirt down like so and I start with the biggest one the one that's kind of gonna ground the entire collection of succulents this succulent is really tall and spindly so I shove it down and make sure it's really firm it's not gonna go anywhere and then next to it I add a short fat guy because I like how it contrasts against the tall one next to it so I keep going like that making sure to not put two next to each other that are too similar and making sure they don't have too many spindly flowery ones because they can look really busy so you want to make sure you have a combination of the ones that are more spindly with the ones that are more graphic so it looks it looks really well-balanced and professional very professional despite how dirty that table is so there you have it there's my succulent garden they make really great gifts I put them in the office because it makes me really and they're super hard to kill so that throw is good I'm Emily Henderson and that's my circulant garden 
as its Emily Henderson and Orlando Soria and today we're going to talk about how to add personality to your neutral space so we're at a house of a friend of mine and they live in a rental so they can't paint the walls and they don't want to splurge on a really colorful huge piece of furniture so what ends up happening it happens to people all over America is too many neutral pieces not enough color color so we're going to show you how you can still keep your neutral pieces but add a lot of personality to the space all right so when it comes to color think about the code that you're most attracted to and in this case Jim implies the most attractive to teals and blue together so we're going to bring in some seals and blues so a good tip when you have a big beige back of a sofa like this is to break it up with the colors we'll throw it like this all right so we have pops of blue pepper ground the space evenly but we're not clearly we're not finished it and we need to add a lot more texture what's not the right answer yes all right so what's so great about this chair is that totally engages this corner and previously this was completely blank and now it there has there's something with height without something that really blocks the view and the texture of the wicker combined with the texture of the fur I have just a lot of depth and dimension to the room so what other textures did you bring all right so we have linen in the sectional we have vinyl in this chair and ottoman we have shale in the coffee table wood in the credenza wicker in the chair but you know what we're missing what life oh yeah we've got a very handsome life and easy plant beans and plants and we know what's so great about this what i like the amount of life it brings but also textures again with the texture two birds one stone two birds one plant obviously a good way to bring personality into a room is to bring things that are personal into the room like vintage photographs going alright folks so basically all we did is that some color some texture some plants and some personal items so this room that once was very neutral is now squirming with personalities glowing overflowing with personality so this is Emily Henderson and for Manu Soria signing off all right guys 
hey guys Emily Henderson hair today I'm going to show you how to create it's indoor plants are now indoor plants were kind of out for a while and now they're back to becoming way more popular I'm going to show you how you can do it looks really thick and collected but at the same time intentional first tip is make sure you start with a plant or a tree that's really large in scale if you have a ton of plants and they're all really small it looks really busy and can be very messy so you choose one big plant and build the collection off of that this is my favorite it's called the fiddly fig tree and it's so great because it's really graphic and really bold tip number two is make sure you have a variety of different levels so I've brought in this white lacquer table because it's going to keep all the plans from Bank off of the floor if I just have one big tree and then the rests there on the floor it's gonna look unintentional and kind of messy again I'm going for a more modern look so this white lacquer table is going to keep everything really clean at the same time it is waterproof and wipeable so you don't want to obviously put it on wood where it could get damaged tip number three is to have a well balanced composition so I have a huge plant over here so I'm going to balance it out with a more medium-sized plant over here you could have them be symmetrical but for a more collected look I want them to be a little bit imperfect so I have big medium and then in the middle I have a collection of various different heights and make sure that they are kind of overlapping each other you don't want them to be perfectly placed that can look really forced and boring instead create a really pretty landscape effect tip number four make sure you vary the texture of the plants so I have these big leaves that are really big and bold and graphic then I have this plant which is a little bit airier and softer and drapey and they have this fern that's long and skinny you can appointee so they are all grains they all work together obviously but they have different textures so it gives it more of a collective feeling okay so for tip number five make sure that all of your pots coordinate and are in the same color palette you want to bear the textures of the pots and you know this one obviously has a lot of personality and some of them are simpler but you don't want to have a ton of posturing crazy different patterns and colors unless you're going for about look and that's a little bit more old-world here I'm going to do something more modern and clean and fresh so most of the pots are white then I have one little pot and one gold pot because that is working with the rest of color palette in this room alright so there you have it folks how to create a really beautiful indoor plant garden very simple and very easy just follow this five rules and you can be someday 
hey guys it's Emily Pearson and today I'm going to show you how to design a kid's room that they won't grow out of now you might remember that I did a little girls always room so it's a lot of the same tips but it's gonna be way more masculine and more bully related so designing a kid's room is actually a lot like designing any room first you start with speller college what I love is super bold crazy saturated color on the wall you do end up wanting to change it after a couple years so to avoid having to repaint I would choose a color that is more neutral and a little bit more sophisticated so I chose this gray on the walls and while gray is a very popular or sophisticated color it still feels a little boy to me because there isn't that blue in it if you want to have really bright colors but have it feel a little more grown-up is to combine it with more modern more masculine more like grown-up colors like this Navy so we have yellow we have teal and those are both really bright really fun so the Navy grounds it keeps it a little bit more sophisticated well you all know that I love mixing patterns a lot a good general rule is that the more patterns you have a room look the more chaotic feels and the word energy it has and while you do want your kid's room to have a lot of energy they already have a ton of energy so you need to kind of keep it a little bit more subdued by only mixing a couple patterns in this case we have the Navy bedding which is small scale pattern mixed with the rub which is a large scale at yellow pattern another good tip is symmetry always makes a room feel less chaotic and more pulled together in this case we have matching side tables matching lamps and what that does is it balances the room obviously but if there's less distraction for your eye and therefore things feel more calm just like any other bedroom you want to create a focal point behind to your headboard so in this case for Londo and Alexis basically made this huge frame stretch canvas and painted this really minimalist kept kind of exciting painting on it this peaceful is super fun and obviously does a lot for Grahams room one of the things I love so much about it is that in 25 years and he is like living in like whatever newest Williamsburg there is in his loft he's gonna have this amazing theater more Londo so it was something that was really personal but also totally immersed in the space right now you want to make furniture that you actually love enough that you can put in other rooms the shelving system could easily go in an office the black lamps could easily go into a den so just because it's in grams room right now and he's five doesn't mean that it's really little kid think about for an attributive more long lasting average that you actually like because then later you can bring that furniture into other rooms all right there you have it it's a little boy's room that is full of pattern and playfulness and usefulness but with enough integrity that's gonna last for 10 years I like layers 
hey guys Emily Henderson and Orlando and today we're going to talk about how to create a focal wall first way is to just get one huge statement piece huge now a good rule of thumb is that your piece of art needs to be at least 2/3 the size of your sofa or if you're doing in a bedroom with 2/3 of size that brand for this piece is just too small to engage the entire wall take it away I don't ever look at it again I got you a present I had a portrait painted of more oh my god it's not bad but I think when you go slightly bigger to fit our two-thirds rule right it's just beginning I think this is big enough its massive it's giant so it fits our two-thirds rule as clearly it's it's even more than two-thirds the length of the sofa it's probably the entire length sofa but it definitely fills up the entire wall so first option a huge statement piece is a very good option all right so your second option is to have multiples of similar pieces of art alright so here we have two pieces that are different very similar with the same styles they have the same color palette so they work almost as like one piece of art together you don't do this where you could want to do I got you don't do that you don't do this we're going to do is put both of them right next to each other so it just looks like one big cohesive piece of art okay so we treated the two pieces of art like one piece of art and basically a center above the sofa we made sure there's at least 2/3 size the sofas a nice job there lastly we took the measurement between the sofa and the molding and centered the art vertically in that space I'm okay this is pretty successful no I like this I would totally keep this but we have one more option to show everybody you have to keep going we have to keep going we must explore okay option three is the ever-popular gallery wall so it's a good idea to start with an anchor piece right yes and then you don't want to put your anchor piece exactly centered in the middle you want to always off-center we finished your gallery wall and while we're doing it we tried to keep in mind a few different things first is color balance so we made sure that we have this pink that goes up there and then we have like a pop of yellow pop of blue and the black and white is sort of the main thing tying everything together very good so basically what you don't want is all your color in one corner and then all of the pieces that kind of have more negative space is another corner you want it equally disperse it around to whole gallery wall another tip is to make sure you have many different sizes of art so you we have our babe anchor piece which is this guy and then we made sure to have some that were vertical some that were horizontal and then don't forget about the teeny tiny pieces like okay current trend and gallery walls at least what I'm loving right now is making sure that they fit the entire wall so not just having a collection that's kind of in the middle ears out so in this case we make the collection from sofa to the ceiling and wall to wall it really engages the entire wall so don't be afraid to put them really high or put a really low just try and fill that wall all right so there you go guys one wall three different ways big statement piece a grid of similar pieces of art and a gallery wall so now you guys decide which is your favorite

hey guys it's Emily Henderson so the number one question I get almost every day is where do you get your design inspiration from and the truth is it's kind of everywhere and nowhere it could be vintage design books traveling abroad my baby drifting fashion he can even be a random pinata store in the valley just keep your eyes open and see what happens in front of them so when method asked me to style the living and dining area of their home using their product as my inspiration I thought well that's a new one but as a fan of their brand bright colors and beautiful designs I figure it's sure why not the dream home itself is super modern has a really bright and airy floorplan it has great foundational pieces and certainly good bones but it's missing that last 15% it needs some personality and some court getting some style it is that final layer that really takes it from a show house to a home you want to show off first we need to decide on a color palette like the beautiful colors of the method product I really wanted the space to pop so I'm going for a lot of whites and pastels with a heavy dose next come style so I'm going for eight mid-century Scandinavian vibe with unique pieces and really simple shapes and then I'll balance that out with a lot of layers and texture now it's time for execution here's where we take that inspiration all those colors and textures and styles and really wake up that blank canvas with the help of methods inspiration I'll take this beautiful house and turn it into a clean fresh and happy phone full of personality make sure you check back on October 19th to see how it all comes together till then hey guys 
hey everybody it's Emily Henderson and I'm back with another weekend home makeover this time its famed fashion blogger Nicola Mason her new wife Ally and their pug Frankie we've got three days and four people and lots of help from our friends at Target to take this place from the lackluster chip it up nicholette nalli moved in a few months ago but they haven't had a chance to do anything with it it one big white blank campus which makes my job really bump my name is Nick black Mason I'm a design consultant and blogger at nickel at Mason calm my style is incredibly feminine unabashedly so and I love pink but someone else has the final say Franky's really the queen of the castle we think it's my style that we're playing with but it's really Frankie's first off we need a major dose of color and pattern I love this wallpaper the palm pattern grabs your attention but the colors are still seething and calm I wanted to bring in Nicholas love of pink and this rug certainly does that job but once on the floor it felt too small and really loud so it had to go while we waited for a second option we kept moving the whole space was in dire need of some glamorous lighting end of the day time to pack it up the next day we're right back at it all hands on deck except someone was getting rather restless it's almost like she was trying to tell me something Frankie is ready to go shopping we're on the hunt for accessories and pillows that would complement the fun wallpaper without making them feel too busy I'm thinking rose gold and blacks and simple mid-century shapes and maybe something just for us girls we have this beautiful vented dining table painted and refinished but which chairs should I pick any of these colors could work but the black really tied in with the black accents in the living room making the whole space feel cohesive rug option number two has arrived it's the bigger size and a better color so fingers crossed it is the one and it is this solid rug creates a quiet foundation that we need to let the rest of the room shine but the major piece is in place it's time for the fun part the styling all the copper rose gold and black accents from Target give this room the perfect eclectic balance of styles and make the room feel totally pulled together and on-trend well this room could go overly feminine the simple shapes the accessories balance it out and make it feel more modern and we're done let's see what the client thinks hi hi welcome unity linger it looks amazing what's your favorite thing in space ah the colors just make me so happy I think that we have the greens and we have the nice light seiji Challenger and also a little bit of emerald we have pink I just feel like the colors are always going to make me feel really happy if you're Dennis empty literally empty I had four bar stools and that was it I've never would have thought to put a gallery wall over a dining table when we first moved into the space I was really drawn by how open the floor plan was I was scared that bringing you things in would lose a little bit of that openness yeah let's start feeling closed off it still feels really open and airy yeah it's so much better than I even ambition the real question is what do you think of the room you bet I think I think she might like the room I think that's a stamp of approval for sure 
hey guys it's a really Henderson and today I'm going to show you how to make what I'm calling conversation coasters basically they're coasters with a game on them so for your awkward work parties or your family gatherings where uncle Cheney was talking about how he sells magic water you can then pull out a conversation poster and have a much better time they're really easy all you need is some leftover fabric scissors a Epson printer with a iron-on cartridge and an iron boom that's super easy super treatment super fast all right step number one is make your coaster basically all you need to do is take fabric and cut it into four inch squares pixels so I chose linen because I like how the edges really Fridays you don't so then you don't finish them in any way but you can choose any kind of fabric all right there you have it easiest coaster in the world alright so step number two is create your phrases and in this case we're gonna play the game would you better all right so you have your coasters and you have your super provocative phrases now it's time to add them on so I'm going to take my phrase and I'm going to cut it up word by word and arrange it all alright so the words are arranged really casually on the toaster and it now it's time to air it or not all right so I'm all finished in western perk 
all right mixing patterns can be overwhelming clearly overwhelmed trite and have my patterns you can either mix way too many patterns too many colors and if you mix them all together wrong you'll end up looking like you're schizophrenic and saucy but if you do it right then you'll end up looking like somebody that's just effortlessly chic obviously that's what we want so today I have four tips of how to mix patterns but looks really beautiful and collected and effortless but at the same time stay look coordinated first tip is to edit your color palette so right now there is 95 million colors behind me and we want to get it down to three to four so my colors today are going to be hot pink blue with hits of yellow all the rest I'm gonna get rid of so I've edited down the color palette to three colors now it's time for tip number two which is to mix the scale of the patterns for instance these two patterns are both large scale patterns and they're fighting with each other they're competing and to go too similar to be next to each other but if you get rid of one of those and instead bring in a smaller scale pattern then your eye can actually differentiate the two I have a bit of a rule that if you can squint your eyes and still see the difference between the two patterns then they're different enough but if you can't then they're too similar for instance these two very large and in charge patterns way too similar so your eye doesn't know what to look at they're fighting with each other instead get rid of one of them and bring in a small scale pattern and obviously these work way better together so just having a cohesive color palette isn't good enough you also need to make sure you have the right mix of scales so now I'm going to take that rule and apply it to all the pillows behind me we mix up our scales leave a large scale floral and medium scale floral small scale stripe medium scale polka dot technically with mix-up our scales that we have too many patterns which leads me to tip number three limit the amount of patterns on your sofa to two or three and in one room three to five this is too many patterns what I'm going to do is edit a little bit more add in some solids instead to give your eye a little bit of a rest very hot pink and let's give out these as they have textures or not just a solid so they they're quite but at the same time adding some sort of depth okay now we're down to two patterns perfect and two solids but tip number four is that you shouldn't have all of your patterns together instead they should be evenly distributed around the room the right now I have two patterns over here and and then over here clearly that's a problem because this has just so much more visual weight and this corner is a lot busier and this can apply to your entire room by the way not just a sofa so I'm going to move one of these patterns over here so here's what we have folks we have a consistent color palette mixing up scales only two patterns on the sofa that's perfect and lastly we have distributed the patterns evenly so they're not all clumped in one corner for tips to mixing patterns where it looks effortless but at the same time coordinated 
[Music] collaborating with other creative people is always so amazing getting a peek into their creative process as each of us takes on a challenge in our own way it's inspiring for me today I'm in Brooklyn with artist Timothy Goodman working on a project to help him display some of his original art will be working with Samsung and their new TV the frame to take over this old barge and transform it into a floating pop-up gallery all right we have ourselves a barge folks this floor is amazing if the beams are amazing you know how do we kind of take aspects of it and but like modernize it I like that it's an open you know it's a pretty open space we'll get rid of all this stuff temporarily that says barge yeah we could even put up you know blank canvas walls for you how do you feel about bringing in a gallery wall in here where we mix in the frame with some of your pieces listen I'm all for it I'm done maybe we have floating shelves of books this could be a huge installation of your pieces I like that beauty of all any of the stuff we do as creative people as it's about the process of enjoying that process you know so you start with pulling swipe and pulling references and finding the things are inspired by because no matter what you do as a creative you have to have context of what you're making what should we do first do you wanna maybe sketch it out yeah start thinking about where we're gonna put everything okay we know that one wall will be a gallery wall where are we gonna put couches so we have two sectionals and a sofa to play with something amazing needs to happen right in here and find out what unique I think there are key looks awesome alright see we go and check out what's happening in the space with the walls yeah I can't wait Wow there she is big ole blank canvas for you so you're gonna put up the frame TVs yes so the frame sits flush to the wall right so that you look like a piece of art and then we'll hang picture frame it's like floor to ceiling wall to wall empty though and then like so a gallery wall with the frame TV with different picture frames yes around it okay so they completely mix in yeah and then you come in and you do whatever you need to do inside those blank picture frames love it so I'll just draw a regional art right in the picture frames yeah that's cool what are you gonna draw you're gonna help me draw no so gallery walls are super popular right everybody wants them generally like I have some tips that I always give that's like you know you want to vary the sizes of the pieces the orientations so some horizontal some vertical some square yeah maybe do that go a little lower that works turn the other one horizontal and you want to have all the frames in a particular color palette this is black this is how it comes standard you don't want to have like all blacker than all you know I was in one white you have all these customizable frame options this buckling could go down there that's good the key to a good gallery wall is the art he has to do fifty three original piece of art in one day and all of them are different like some are they'll still life some are words some have references to the job that we're doing he just like came up with them on the fly and it's like watching an artist work like that is very impressive have you seen it stood back and looked at here do you want to or do you want to wait to the end okay [Music] is that it are you done all 53 yeah I think so I think so just one bit more yeah I'll done folks oh my gosh it was just dark walls now it's just full of so much personality and life and style and I mean originally I want to keep these colors look amazing I love the cactus and the TVs you can't even tell you easy no yeah no it's it's insane how I think it's especially since the profile of our picture frame yeah well you just walked in and just like a first time you would not be able to thought this whole collaboration was to show how the frame can look like a piece of art and mix in with Tim's pieces you cannot tell which is a TV it's so beautiful and 100% looks like you're in a gallery except you can also watch TV this is the art store so and there are hundreds of illustrators photographers fine artists to choose from and I love that I can just like I'm not feeling that today I can go to something else you know for tomorrow this one looks really cool with all the art on the wall yeah it does it's like the whole block is still graphic still touches on all the pieces you've picked out here so basically all these art galleries from all around the world they have curations on here so you can literally just go in here and like check them out like for instance like I love saucy art and I can go and check out like different artists that I don't even know about this one's so cool okay so you're hanging out with your friends you guys are all appreciating you know your amazing art but then the game's on and you're like what and then you press one button and from art to TV video colors you're like totally master you know pairs are it is an RKG your sports game is with our pals thank you it which is that which is your favourite piece that you did today that I did that you did yeah I really do love the fresh frames I do too I thought was kind of funny I think what's great about what we both do is at the end of the day the

hey guys it's Emily Henderson I'm at Animal Haven down in Soho a cat and dog rescue where I've teamed up with Armand Hammer clump in zeal to redesign the space today I'm going to show you some tips that you can actually use in your own home to make it more cat friendly so cat toys accessories and furniture can be everywhere in your house when you have cats but you don't exactly want to draw attention to them so here's the trick folks have those accessories match the color palette in your home already in this base for instance I used orange blue and white and so for all the toys accessories they are in fact orange blue and white so as a cat owner and the biggest challenge is the litter box litter box is 10m spell and they're also generally not very attractive so here's what you do you buy a litter box that's inside a piece of furniture there's a lot of them out there and they completely disguise that box you can't even see it second is you buy Armand Hammer clump and filled litter and that litter actually guarantees a seven-day odor free home so a question I get all the time is what kind of fabrics are really cat friendly in other words what perks is your cat not going to destroy because cats love to cloth fabric so skip anything with an open weave like linen or cotton and instead get velvet performance velvet or ultra suede so cats like to climb they just do but if you have curtains and drapes they will try and climb up them and often will ruin them so think about getting shades and said this is a shade if something goes up and down instead of left to right

hey friends Emily Henderson and today's video is all about how to style your nightstand clearly style your nightstand isn't nearly as important or even daunting as a huge shelving unit which is what I like so much about it it's just like these little moments you can put on a nightstand that makes getting into bed that much more fun so I'm going to style three different nightstands for you and show you why they work so the only thing that's really crucial that you have to have on your nightstand is lighting you don't want to have to obviously go to your wall and turn off and on your overhead light once you're going but so I have naturally a hot pink velvet vintage hanging pendant and it is kind of filling all this vertical space here okay my nightstand du jour right now is this amazing vintage seventies burl wood Milo Baughman piece what's so great about it is that it's the right height so you set the height of the bed you don't want too much higher you could have it a little bit lower but you want it about the same height as a mattress I also like something that smells really nice so are you bringing a candle or flowers or sometimes nuts I'm going to add some pretty books why this works is that you have the lighting being this big vertical piece up here then you need something horizontal to ground it like the tray and the book and then you always use something sculptural or something quirky to kind of throw things off in this case the flowers are what's like sculptural about this vignette and there you have it a wonderful child nightstand nice date number two this night and also a very good height for this and a very good storage as well this vignette is going to be a little bit more modern and a little bit more fresh yeah staying in my color palette blues and whites clearly but I want to warm it up a little bit so I'm gonna add some wood this box is actually a jewelry box it's one of the more masculine jewelry box was out there but I like brings a little warmth with all the blues Mike's we're almost there it's looking good but it is missing a small wooden shoe oh so we have a pretty consistent color palette blues white with some would torment up we have the lamp that has some height we have the jeweler box that is our horizontal grounding piece in this case and then we have this little shoe for our sculptural and quirky moment nightstand no booty and vignette number three for this one I brought a nice vintage burl side table that I love very much um if the height is a totally amazing it's definitely a little bit short and the fact that there isn't very much storage isn't totally amazing but it is totally amazing so it's good enough for me to you as my next hand alright first ingredient we all know but at this point is lighting so I have an accordion lamp that I'm obsessed with it's definitely filling all this vertical space that we need filled but I still want something a little bit more vertical on the table every bedroom doesn't need a potted plant or a succulent but when you have them that are this cute it doesn't hurt to put on your nightstand all right back to tray or something horizontal somewhere to put your jewelry that you take off at night I love this tray stange was in the color palette here we have blue white wood gold and we've added a cowhide on the rug to add even more warmth I'm pretty much done here and we have all the elements we need but what we don't have is a brass plain sculpture so I'm pretty sure is this every dan could also use a brass sculpture plane everything looks always better in odd numbers so I have a grouping of three items and I have something with height something that's sculptural in the middle and something that's very low and flat to help ground the whole space there you have it folks through the night and vignettes all in one bedroom in mine and don't be too precious about it it's not that daunting you can change it up all the time it just have fun and go for it and stack
