[Music] journey home begins we're currently 40,000 feet on one of ft huts ten Airbus a380s if you don't know already the a380 is my favorite aircraft for a number of different reasons mostly because it's a smooth quiet beautiful ride airlines have done a lot with their a380s Emirates first came out with showers that kind of revolutionized first-class ft HOD up the game with this apartment [Music] there is a single aisle through this front portion of the upper deck so there's a 1:1 configuration on each size on an a380 that's crazy there's so much room there's a seat portion and then this folds out into a bed now there are some downsides though because the seat this is as far back as it were clients so you don't get a nice recliner if you like to watch movies you can watch it from either a fully live flat bed or from a moderately recline seat let's see the moment of truth if I can get on the Wi-Fi I guess I'm just gonna have to eat drink and sleep my way through these 13 hours there are two champagnes for reds and for whites so see what we can get through let's see how it's known for its food so there's actually a chef on board that I customized my meal and it's a la carte dining so you can have whatever you want whenever you want [Music] follow although the one downside is there's no caviar in first-class that's only for the residents guests thank you [Music] you know fish some planes is really hard to do it's usually too fishy too salty this melts in your mouth and that has a little bit of a crunchy ER and then a lemon zest it's perfect best piece of dish like I've ever heard of an airplane TPG approved so the best way to redeem for the FT ha Department is via American Airlines advantage although the partnerships really wonky you have to call up and ask an own agent to look up availability and they have a lot of issues so the easiest way even though it requires one miles is via at the hot zone frequent flier program at C Hut guests there a transfer partner of both American Express and city so it's about 125,000 miles one way for this flight which isn't so bad considering it's an 8 that was another ticket and a lot of carriers charge more than that for business class if you're a baller and want to purchase this I highly recommend putting it on your MX platinum card because your earn 5 points per dollar on all airfare I value MX points at almost two cents apiece that's basically like getting a 10% rebate for buying airfare I put all of my airfare on the Annex bottom [Music] looks like Christmas [Music] yes [Music] the days that garlic that was good the lounge and grill you can pick your meat how you want to cook add in some sides and they even have steak free [Music] that is one thing that can be done really well on an airplane a freshly baked [Music] thank you [Music] the verdict is in Mike Hurst I'm flying ahead to that apartment and it was a fantastic experience not perfect but really really nice highs are amazing space I've never had so much space in a first-class cabin the service was impeccable food was delicious and even though the seat doesn't really recline that much the bed was super super comfortable at the lounge in Abu Dhabi was spectacular there are a couple downsides the Wi-Fi didn't work on this flight they don't serve caviar which is one of my personal favorites I want caviar but overall there was a really solid experience give me caviar firstworldproblems

Vietnam has been high on my travel must
visit us for years now from New York the quickest route are via Asian hubs like
Tokyo or Hong Kong but for my first trip there I wanted to play the national flag
carrier Vietnam Airlines and their brand new Airbus A 350 and that meant routing
from Paris but first an overnight stopover in London This is TPGtv I loved London, and one of the reasons I
wanted to stop through with the check out the Great Northern Hotel which is
now part of Starwood Hotels new Tribute Collection the Great Northern was also
super convenient because it's right across the street from St. Pancras
Station where I would catch the eurostar to Paris for my Vietnam Airlines flight Rates were 227 pounds or $325 however the Great Northern was a
category 5 property at the time where you needed just 12K points per award night the Great Northern has since moved up a category so it now cost 20K points per night to say there Although I booked a standard couchette room thanks to my SPG platinum status I was upgraded to a club room which is named in honor of the hotel's architect those typically go for 50  pounds more per night than the couchette room and are more spacious The overall aesthetic felt very nineteen-thirties Art Deco with leather furniture and walnut furniture, high ceilings and huge windows overlooking Kings Cross Elite upgrades  are one of the perks I'm most worried about being affected by Marriott impending takeover at Starwood because
Marriott platinum currently do not get suite upgrades, and I hate to see that to  policy remain when the program's emerge As an SPG platinum I get confirmable suite upgrade certificates but this is not the hotel to use them at since their one-bedroom suites are really just normal Wainscott guestrooms with the small separate
living room the hotel's restaurant Plum &amp; Spilt Milk was great for
breakfast as an SPG Platinum elite I can choose complimentary continental
breakfast during stays as my bottom amenity but like many other SPG hotels
the Great Northern treated me to a full breakfasts where I could ordered dishes a la carte so I opted for the eggs benedict juice and an Americano since I had just
a single day there to explore I asked my friend Fletcher Cowan as a TV host and
general man about town to show me around some of London's more colorful
neighborhoods We met in Neil's yard a borderline psychedelic ally in Covent Garden and caffeinated up Free Range People Cafe a hidden gem with some great drinks Speaking of drinks our next stop was the
Gin Journey with Leon Dalloway after some samples, and some more samples, and even some specialty cocktails in between We came down to the signature
batch number 2 In just a short time with Leon, I learned more about Gin then I thought there was to know. After tasting all that gin I promptly I forgot
most of it. As evening approached I was getting a
little tired but I was excited to have dinner at London's highest restaurant To get to it you took a high-speed glass elevator 40 floors up London's Heron Tower From hear the views of London are spectacular but we didn't come here just for the panorama chef Daniel Doherty has been
making a big impression on the London dining scene since the restaurant opened
back in 2012 we were treated to a spicy ox cheek donut with apricot jam and
smoked paprika sugar and a thirty eight-day angus bone in ribeye
with winter vegetables ingribiche sauce but of course we had to try the signature dish duck &amp; waffle a fluffy waffle topped with a confit duck leg and a fried egg as well as mustard maple syrup As dinner went down we toasted to a busy, but amazing day in London and my trip to Vietnam On the next TPGtv Going from York to London to Paris was all worth it just for the chance to fight Vietnam Airlines new A 350 and you're coming along with for the ride 
[Music] well hello welcome to TPG digs desert edition I've been dying to stay at this resort for years and it's basically an amazing Safari tent meets Maldives overwater Villa meets just awesomeness [Music] let's go check out the bottom the moment of truth legs can go straight out and I could sit up so this is a pass for me it's going to be close going to be close going to be close [Music] the guy [Music] TPG of Arabia [Music] can you tell if that's an Etsy had a 3d our ba so watch out [Music] [Applause] [Music] can't beat a million-dollar view for just 39,000 star points per night [Music] you [Music] 
sign up for loyalty programs they're free so you might as well and it's much being here to get miles for a flight when you put your frequent flyer number on your reservation before you fly then if you try to do it afterwards if you have one within the last six months and forgot to get miles you can request them from the airline but they may ask for a copy of your boarding pass can make sure you keep it for every single flight 
if you travel a good amount may want to think about getting airline and hotel elite status even though the rules have changed over the years these programs can be extremely valuable so it may make sense to give your loyalties to one or two different programs they do a lot of time and money in the long run 
I'm Brian Kelly the points guide and I've earned millions of points over the years by maximizing credit cards but most people make simple mistakes that cost them a ton of points one of the mistakes that people make is assuming that No Fee credit cards are better than those with annual fees now while some cards with annual fees don't make sense because if you're not getting valuable to first out of the card some of the best points earning cards out there's come with annual fees so don't always assume that a No Fee card is better than one with the fee another mistake that people make is being too loyal to one card some people have airline credit cards that offer perks but chances are that's not the best card for every day spent it can absolutely make sense to have an airline credit card but don't put all of your miles in one basket you want to diversify so that when it comes time to redeem you're not at the mercy of one airline program because they can and will change the rules another mistake is not understanding how FICO and credit scores work many people are too timid to get a credit card because they think it'll destroy their credit which is absolutely not true yes there may be a temporary two to five points being off your credit score for getting a new line of credit but the main factors of FICO score is perf ico are paying your bills on time and paying your balances off another mistake that people make it's not understanding how credit and FICO scores works I have 28 credit cards but my scores over 800 because I pay my bills on time pay my bills off in full every single month which are the two largest factors of a FICO score for a FICO but if you can control your finances the number one way to rack up those miles and points is getting strong signup bonuses and then - every single dollar you spend and paying those off the poll every one another mistake that people make is undervaluing the perks you can get with the credit card many travel credit cards offer really valuable perks like check baggage or purchase per section that can pay for the annual fee many times over so when you have a credit card take some time and understand how to maximize the point but also how to maximize the perks 
(upbeat music) - Hola! (speaking Spanish) - Thank you, so good to be here. There's no better excuse. Am I allowed to drink
while you're driving? - Sure. (laughs) - Wow! This is awesome. - Welcome to your Palafitos. - I see little fish! - Here you can have the minibar service that is all-included. All the premier liquors, such as vodka, whisky, rum, and tequila. - And wait are those free too? Yes sir. All mine. - We have the room service menu. - You can actually look at it on the phone as you're ordering. - 24 hours. - My mind is blown! I love that the toilet has a view. The shower test. If I can jump, and not
hit my head, it passes. Okay, I'm six foot seven,
TPG approved bathtub. This is the first. - And here you have the outdoor shower. - It passes. - Here you have your terrace,
your own private pool. Stairs to go to your dock. - This is awesome, I like this. That's awesome. (sighs) (upbeat music) - Hola. There's nothing like
fresh guacamole in Mexico with a view like this. It's like summer in a bowl. It passes the plunge pool test. This is nice, but why the heck am I in
this small little pool when I've got a whole sea out there? This is actually my first time
going in the water in Mexico. (splash) It's about three feet deep. See you later. 
I think the 6 year old child here can probably kick my ass, but with a little bit of practice I'm going to become a pro boxer. This is TPGtv While sanitation and street sewage burden almost every area of Accra There is something special that stands out about Boku. The gritty inner-city neighborhood known mostly for its boxing. Of the roughly 40 boxing gyms in Boku
the area has produced more world-class boxers in the last 75 years than
anywhere else in the world. And as a New Yorker I knew I had to visit this area when I found out that a lot of these boxers and the coming to New York for
tournaments in the Bronx. But I wanted to learn boxing first hand so I arrive mid-afternoon at Akotuko Boxing Academy to meet Francis AKA The Black Tiger At 25, Francis has been boxing for 11 years and is working his way up the professional ring here in Ghana. And when I asked him
where the name Black Tiger came from I thought well this seems like the guy I should be learning boxing from So we hit the concrete jungle Okay, I'm wiped here, and its only been 20 minutes. sparring was really interesting how you pick up that natural instinct to protect yourself. Even though I was not very good at it. And just when I thought I was unscathed in the ring from fighting with the Black Tiger, the rest of the group invited me
to work out with them doing everything from jumping jacks to squats and some
very dizzying hips ways Brian: I'm going to fall over and even in this ninety degree heat this
was one of the best workout of my life Brian: How did I do? Did I do okay? yet somehow I still have the energy for
a nightcap so I met up with some friends at the Republican Bar. A cool outdoor
drinking venue close by for some Ghanaian beer and a little dancing if
you're looking for a cool area of town Where you'll see expats and locals alike Osu is it. and because I'm a nice guy I bought some new friends rounds of drinks on my
Chase Sapphire Preferred Card which is what I used for almost all of my dining abroad because it gives double points for dining and no foreign transaction fees On the Next TPGtv I jet off to Rwanda Stay up all night and knock something big off my bucket list 
Landing in Hanoi for the first time is
breathtaking. The streets are filled with exotic smells, and lined by enormous buildings there are motorbikes everywhere and the
traffic is overwhelming but the unfamiliar faces are kind. This is TPGtv I spent the morning exploring Hanoi's stately avenues and getting a feel for the city Then it was time to head back to my home for the next three days, the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi before coming to Vietnam I was told by
countless friends at the Metropol is THE place to stay. The historic property open back in 1901
and Jane Fonda stayed here during her notoriously is it to Vietnam in 1972 the
rooms here are beautiful especially in the historical wing where I stayed I had
access to the club lounges as well, where they served breakfast, lunch and dinner the Metropol is a Sofitel property these days so it's part of the Le Club Accor Hotels programme as a general member of the program I would earn 2.17 points per
dollar and you can redeem points at a rate of 2k for 40 euros off a future booking however I booked my room through hotels.com instead because the rate of return towards future bookings is much higher I paid $566 per night for 3 nights on my Chase Sapphire Preferred Card earning 3,396 Ultimate Rewards Points thanks to double points on travel. In anticipation of a big night out I hit the hotel's impressive dinner buffet I had heard that Hanoi has a really vibrant
nightlife scene so I asked out guides to connect us with someone to show us out
and who better than one of the city's most famous DJs, DJ Hung Hanoi at night was like a completely different city. Good thing I used the spa Ironically we started our night out at a
place called The Hang Over Then it was off to Ultra Going out in Hanoi solidified what
people have told me, because Vietnamese are among the friendliest in the world and they definitely know how to have a good time. On the next TPGtv I discover a Vietnamese dishes so good I become determined to learn to make it myself 
Ever since I was a kid I knew I was
meant to travel but growing up in a middle-class family of six international
jet-setting wasn't exactly an option that is until I figured out how to
maximize my dad's frequent flyer miles at the age of 12 to take my family on
a vacation to the Caribbean. And almost twenty years later I've created a community of millions with my blog The Points Guy, teaching people how to
maximize their points to travel for a fraction of the cost. And now I'm taking you with me. this is TPGtv Thanks to my miles and points I have been able to travel the globe and visit amazing destinations,
however there's so much more to travel than just a luxurious resort and first class seat. Over the past few years I've gotten more and more involved with PeaceJam, an amazing organization that develops young leaders through the teachings of Nobel
Peace Prize winners PeaceJam has a small but thriving presence in West Africa and when I was invited to Accra, Ghana to see it first hand I jumped at
the opportunity,  but first I had to figure out how to get there. There aren't
a ton of nonstop flights to Africa from the US most route through Europe
nearly doubling the travel time however Delta flys JFK to Accra non-stop, but the flights aren't cheap overtime I accrued these Delta SkyMiles by not only flying Delta but also taking advantage of various credit card sign-up
offers. If you need Delta SkyMiles you can also transfer AMX Membership Rewards points at a one-to-one ratio and Starwood Preferred Guest transfers with the 25%
bonus for every 20,000 points transferred While Delta SkyMiles are not the most valuable airline currency out there, they can be extremely useful especially when redeeming on
Delta's unique routes. So not only can you save a ton of travel time by flying
nonstop but also save a ton of cash since Delta charges a premium for these unique flights especially in business class. And if you're flying into JFK there's a
brand new Sky priority entrance to check-in which minimizes lines and gets you
through in almost no time Then there is Deltas consistently fantastic staff; this is Sylvia. 
Sylvia: Have a safe flight TPG! the real gem of Delta at JFK as their new
24,000 square-foot Sky Club which you can get access to it the AMEX Platinum
or the Delta reserve cards or if you're flying Delta one even on an award ticket. And for Delta one passengers you get a tapas sampler and premium glass of wine. But my favorite part of the Sky Club is the Skydeck where you can plane watch to your heart's content and soak in some sun before your flight and who doesn't love
the smell of jet fuel on a beautiful New York City afternoon Delta flights JFK to Accra non-stop on their Boeing 767 300 ER aircraft which has just 26 seats in Delta one and 200 in Delta
comfort and economy combined on this on plane in Delta one I personally like
the odd-numbered window seats because it offered the most amount of privacy and
while Delta does have a nice Tumi amenity kit they don't provide PJs so I
recommend packing some breathable clothes but before I sleep it's time to eat. And this isn't what you think of typical plane food. Tonight I'm starting with
shrimp followed by a delicious cedar plank salmon and topping it all off with
a hot fudge sundae the perfect mix for food coma which was enjoyed in my lie-flat bed with Westin Heavenly bedding. Traveling over 50,100 miles for over 10
hours and being pampered while doing it it tough to be four $5.60 cash out of
pocket and waking up in Africa is priceless On the next TPGtv meet the next generation of Ganna's youth in a program that is changing both the city and the region. 
(upbeat pop music) - Hey! But I still have 7,000 days until you all graduate from college! Think you'll be as tall as me then, Kara? - Yeah, I'll be.
(laughing) 
[Music] set a goal and achieve it it can be confusing with all different miles and points but once you have a goal in mind and are working towards it all of this make sense and I can guarantee you when you first redeem your miles and points for a nearly free flight or hotel today the Russian gets and makes all of this worth it 
I've never seen at the Grand Hyatt Roppongi so I'm really excited to check it out so I used points for this day room rates are over $600 it's a peach cherry blossom season but I got rooms for just twenty five thousand points a night which gets me over two cents per point in value which is one of the reasons why I love hyatt points and you can transfer them in one-to-one instantly from Chase ultimate rewards but paying for incidentals I use the Hyatt credit card because you get three points per dollar spent after almost eight thousand miles of travel today I am exhausted even though it was in first class it's still really tiring so I need a hot shower and some sleep so we can explore more fun anymore I'm pretty impressed with my room at the Grand Hyatt here nice king-size bed we've got automated blackout shades and daylight shades which are convenient what I really like is all of the power outlets we're in Tokyo after all and it's high-tech another plus is the bedside light master switch shower wise two thumbs up two thumbs up for amenities I love hotels that give toothbrushes and razor cuts without having to call and get it from the front desk and then of course we've got the automated Soto one of my favorite perks of high a diamond is free daily breakfast and at the Grand Hyatt they've got this beautiful lounge with tons of Japanese items like salmon and miso soup as well as Western items this is my first time staying in Roppongi and there's no shortage of things to do it's known from nightlife and restaurants but now I want to check out some art and luckily attached to the Grand Hyatt is the Mori Art Museum one of Tokyo's finest let's go check out some modern art Oh you 
some people say flying isn't what it used to be to that I say you have a fun evening I'm Brian Kelly also known as the points guy and right now I'm currently somewhere over the Atlantic flying to Ghana and the total cash I spent for this ticket was just five dollars and sixty cents and this isn't a one-off I fly around the world in style for cheap by leveraging frequent flyer miles credit card points and amazing deals and now I'm taking you with me the bottoms you're gonna hit me how much is this one I'll take it

challenging and you don't want to let your miles and points expire. So join a free online mileage manager like
Award Wallet or Points.com, and they will even alert you if your miles are going to

[Music] wait is it Christmas Day no its residence day the SD Hut residents experience doesn't start at the airport it starts when you leave home good morning how are you I'm good hi good morning I'm Brian like the worst cars mine most of moon rising we might have a few cars yes sir okay then that's right two cars one for the bags and one for me [Music] starting at the airport in entourage of Etihad employees took my bags and whisked me through check-in and since I was the first passenger to take FD Hobbs inaugural a380 flight from JFK to Abu Dhabi I was also the first to experience their brand new lounge in terminal 4 which has a special private area for the residents guests like my own studio apartment in fact it's bigger than my apartment and after some caviar I didn't know Brooklyn caviar existed until about 20 minutes ago and now I'm gonna try it and a specialty cocktail at the bar this is Sir oh and a fresh shower what I really like about the shower is being 6 7 I hate having a duck but I'm pretty sure any NBA player would be just fine it was time as a residents passenger you have the option to board first or last and I clearly chose first at the gate and met my Butler Aaron who brought me on board and introduced me to my three cabin suite which to be honest was a bit smaller than I expected well I may be six foot seven the key thing I'd change about the residents is to make the living area into a fully live flat bed so someone can sleep in the living room and another person in the bed but at least I did provide very comfy PJ's then I was served abu-dhabi caviar yes it exists and a vodka martini of my favorite brand double-cross the bottle of which they had engraved with my name and flight number nice touch and just to see how well at jehad caters to their residents guests I requested a special meal a Thanksgiving feast at 40,000 feet I invited fellow bloggers Carrie Anderson to dine with me she had used her American airline miles for a first-class apartment we ask them they make turkey dinner Thanksgiving stouts it's Thanksgiving week apparently ask Italian chef Enrico and you shall receive and Parvati go Mangia Mangia grants enjoy what do you think before this holiday season definitely my miles and coins which is my copy so you didn't spend thirty two thousand dollars per ticket only nineteen thousand that's amazing a week when did you book the ticket to find that was it right when they announced of white probably wasn't looking and after the feast with a fine wine tasting from around the world I was ready for the most expensive map of my life but first I needed the shower and let me tell you this is a true pleasure in the sky but the bathroom is much smaller than some of ft HUDs competitors and while Aaron shined my shoes I got cozy in the comfiest double bed I've ever flown in and the six luxury pillow short help make up for Eddie HOD ultimately forgetting to load my bag on the flight and while this was a once-in-a-lifetime splurge at thirty two thousand dollars for the residence ticket its twenty five hundred dollars an hour to sleep so I think I'll be quite content redeeming for first-class using models and you 
I'll admitted, at 32 it's a bit weird to
start thinking of what kind of coffin I'd like to be buried in, but when I came across
the Kane Kwei Coffin shop in Accra I discovered something unexpected Ghana's culturally significant business in dying Brian: It's actually really peaceful... I'll take it Bye guys This is TPGtv As you get closer to Accra city center
things get busier and busier and busier and the Movenpick Ambassador Hotel is an oasis in the myths of the city bustle. As one of Accra's more prestigious hotels the rooms are big and clean, the restaurant's decent, but the real shining star is the
pool. Which is a tropical oasis in the center of this concrete jungle where the waitstaff zip around on rollerblades. I booked it through hotels.com and credited the nights to the welcome rewards program which is pretty simple. For every 10 nights you pay for,  you get one free and the value of the free night is based on
the average room rate of the ten nights you paid for. This program's basically a 10%
rebate, so if you're ever booking a hotel that's not a part of a loyalty program
you might want to consider hotels.com When first exploring a new country I love to know about its quirks and Ghana has no shortage of them. When a friend of mine
mentioned the Ghanaian cultural phenomenon of fantasy Coffins I had to
check it out for myself. Right in the heart of Accra is Kane Kwei Coffins. The city's oldest and most well known proverbial coffin shop or a
Abebuu Adekai as they're known locally. Ernest here is the owner. His father
handed down the shop to him after he passed in 1992 I arrived with my friend Jaime Who came to Ghana with me for the PeaceJam event. And decided to join me for my orbit tour of the coffin factory. With the help of our translator, what I gathered from Ernest is that these coffins take months to
build up to $2,000 or more consensus seems like a rather niche industry I was
curious, who's buying them? It became pretty clear from George and
Ernest fantasy coffin industry here is not only about paying respect your
family members but also a status symbol of the disease a gesture taken so
seriously that some investors savings on a special coffin related to their
loved one's life work, take a farmer for example or a fisherman Throughout the tour, I got so into this I actually, considered buying one myself but first I wanted to try it out. But first I wanted to see just how much work does it take to make one of these things and then I thought maybe Ernest is onto something here. in fact he had. Kane Kwei coffins has long received international acclaim. From Germany to
Tokyo their coffins have been featured as art installations globally and most
prominently at the Pompidou in 1989 in Paris. And while I admire this little hidden gem of an industry. An art form in Ghanna I think I'll let Earnest here continue building his fantasy. On the next TPGtv I'm putting the gloves on,  these boxes are on the rise and as my first time in the ring
I said game game on 
it's 4:30 in the morning and we are headed to the famous ceg fish market but of course they don't take credit cards so I'm going to get some cash Fortuna is it matter bigger the number one means it's the best quality we've seen the best in the world what are some of the things you would look for to me let me guess I would say this one's better yeah 1.2 kilograms of fresh red snapper I've never made sushi but I've looked into proximately 700 kilos in my life so this today is a very happy day for me I love Wasabi's just one and you go right I like this one all right what's my I'm gonna look like chef cheetah domo arigato gozaimasu no Davis me hmm I just don't make it like this in the US the best movie I've ever done so if I fly you over with my frequent flyer mileage but you never know the fresh tissue with you how do you fly to Singapore love all right Singapore I know that's what we do so then if you have to fly Japanese parodies Japan Airlines or a na that's what we're flying my henna tonight you fly from Tokyo Haneda to lndia I always use this tiny star lights okay so you're good with your business so this is perfect so you trade me sushi and I'll trade you star lights points because I want to entertain also well thank you so much I really appreciate it you 
Cape Town has no shortage of hotels where you can earn and redeem points but my favorite is the Weston this is tpgtv as an SVG category for hotel free nights cost ten thousand star points and the sweet spot is when you book five nights because you get the fifth night free bringing the cost down to just eight thousand points per night the location is central right by the Convention Center and a short drive from major attractions like the V&amp;A waterfront as a Starwood Platinum Member I got upgraded to a spacious junior suite and start with Platinum's also get access to the recently renovated Club Lounge which has a nice breakfast spread and afternoon wine and snacks and an especially spectacular view of table mountain no trip to Cape Town is complete without a visit to the Cape wine lands a 45 minute drive from city centre I've been to the Cape wine lands numerous times but this time I wanted something different which brought me to Stella Kaia firstly the tasting room isn't on their vineyard instead it's an old whiskey cellar right in the heart of Stellenbosch and secondly the head winemaker has a larger-than-life personality and has shattered many glass ceilings in her career I started as a junior winemaker and then 2005 fight to take over let me look at the amount of wineries we have in South Africa and the number of women and who are making wine this is Natsuki by allah after being recruited out of high school to study wine through a south african airways scholarship she quickly became the first black female wine producer in South Africa stedy kaya we are known for the cabinet stellenbosch areas so you guys produce only red wines why is that you specialize upon the red that is designed for it one in that the center phases there we've got the mall beds and that's basically a speciality also stella kaya's vineyard is on a rolling hillside ten minutes away from their bottling plant it's picture-perfect especially for droning so did you always want to be a winemaker and I noticed I noticed that you said that you you were forced to become the head winemaker so what's been your best year of grapes what are they known for producing I look for this amazing Bob Wian wine while I'm here in South Africa you live and breathe wine every day so do you still like to when you take a personal vacation go visit wineries or is a vacation for you like a beach and so it's a must it must be wine so travel wise I have to ask so you've traveled a good amount Iran the world down how good are you with your frequent flyer miles it's like free money you know you got a I know not like now let me say I started actually to ten mile well if you if you didn't collect miles on any flights you can still probably submit but that way you can go on a much-needed vacation okay enough of my unsolicited points advice I was here to drink wine and because I'm such a nice boss I used one hundred and thirty thousand United miles to fly TPG director of marketing Kate O'Brien to Cape Town for her first time on Lufthansa first-class and apparently she didn't want to get off the plane Pina Taj is one of my favorite wines and it's everywhere in South Africa but for some reason it's really hard to find in the US so I took advantage of a strong US dollar and bought three cases which came out to just $4 per bottle and even though shipping via UPS cost as much as the wine itself it was still a bargain since the Pina Taj is not sold in the US by distributors wine tasting is harder than it looks and we worked up quite an appetite one of my favorite restaurants in the Cape wine lands is the del aire Graff estate they have not only exquisite cuisine but intoxicating views of the Cape wine lands you can actually see the clouds roll through an absolute must and to top it off the service and the meal were flawless it's days like today that reiterate why South Africa sits so high on my list of favorite countries on the next tpgtv I braved the dunes outside of Cape Town in one of the most thrilling adventures of my life you

it's 4:30 in the morning and we are headed to the famous ceg fish market but of course they don't take credit cards so I'm going to get some cash Fortuna is it matter bigger the number one means it's the best quality we've seen the best in the world what are some of the things you would look for to me let me guess I would say this one's better yeah 1.2 kilograms of fresh red snapper I've never made sushi but I've looked into proximately 700 kilos in my life so this today is a very happy day for me I love Wasabi's just one and you go right I like this one all right what's my I'm gonna look like chef cheetah domo arigato gozaimasu no Davis me hmm I just don't make it like this in the US the best movie I've ever done so if I fly you over with my frequent flyer mileage but you never know the fresh tissue with you how do you fly to Singapore love all right Singapore I know that's what we do so then if you have to fly Japanese parodies Japan Airlines or a na that's what we're flying my henna tonight you fly from Tokyo Haneda to lndia I always use this tiny star lights okay so you're good with your business so this is perfect so you trade me sushi and I'll trade you star lights points because I want to entertain also well thank you so much I really appreciate it you

(electronic music) - So last time I flew Delta
to Asia was in June of 2011. It was the day I quit my job
at Morgan Stanley to pursue doing The Points Guy full time. I actually left my cubicle
in Times Square and went and flew and they had
recently started flying to Haneida so I flew a 777 to Haneida, and I was like you know
this TPG thing I can't believe this is my life right now. Look at this beautiful plane! It's like my first day of school! Wow! It smells like new airplane! So 8C I like because it's inside, so you're not as close to the aisle. Wow, look at this cabin! I am currently in plane geek heaven with the first ever commercial
flight of the brand new Delta A350 and the new
plane smell is glorious. Excited to fly to Tokyo, 14 hours, I'll probably ask them
to keep going around because I'm loving this already and we haven't even left Detroit. Are we gonna have a smooth
ride to Tokyo today? - Pretty smooth, little
bumps out of here probably. - And flight time? - About 12:30, I guess 12:49. - Maybe I'll be a captain one day, no I much prefer it back here. As always Delta, their amenity kits, the Tumi was great, you
can actually get your Tumi amenity kit engraved if
you go into a Tumi store. (upbeat music) The seat itself is
spacious so in full recline I'm 6'7, it was 6'6 so about
an inch my head was up, which for me is no problem
because I'm a side sleeper and even at a small
elevation with the pillows, I was perfectly fine, very
comfortable, I love the privacy. I like these feature
lights they're kinda cool. Wow, get outta here! - And what beverage can
I start you out with? - I'll just do a glass
of champagne please, and a sparkling water with lemon. - I have here your burger
and your Caesar salad. - I'll do the pretzel please,
yeah that's good thank you. So far so good, I'm a
huge Caesar salad guy, hard to mess it up, butternut
squash soup was really good with a little zesty zing to it. And even though it doesn't look fancy, the duck was delicious. And you never go wrong with a pretzel roll so time will tell on the main
dish, but so far so good. The moment of truth. (upbeat electronic music) Konichiwa, we're in Tokyo,
flight was overall pretty good, but there were definitely
some positives and negatives. So let's just start off,
oh you wanna hear the bad parts first, okay fine
I'll just dig right in. First off the WIFI was terrible. It went out a couple
of times and then about halfway through the flight
it didn't work at all. Now Gogo in general is pretty bad although I've been on Gogo flights on Delta's newer planes
internationally where I can actually stream things,
not on this flight. I couldn't even upload a simple video. So I don't know if it
was because they gave it to everyone for free on
the flight and it crashed, but not impressed. The second thing is food, I did not like the food on the plane. They unfortunately ran
out of Japanese meals by the time they go to
me, so here's a tip, if you want a Japanese meal
you can order in advance. At no point in the booking
process was I aware of this, so FYI you can do that apparently. The seats overall are pretty chic looking, but functionally there's no
storage and on either side of your seat there's a big hole. So my Bose headphones fell
into the abyss below the seat. So I was fishing things
out the entire time, my phone, I actually put
my phone in to see what was down there and it got
sucked in, so be careful. And then the lavatory situation,
there's two very small lavatories in the front, they
were also a little wonky, the one light wouldn't go
on in the one lavatory. And they were tight so
definitely in the galley and the lavatories they
made as small as possible which kind of creates for
tight situations, alright. Now the things that I like,
I think the overall design of the cabin's really sleek, you know, in the middle of the night
waking up and it's all the mood lighting and I do
like the cathedral ceilings, as they call it, where
there's no overhead bins in the middle so it's a big open cabin, which I really did like,
no issues with storage. The wine menu was decent
and they had La Croix, and as a millennial I was freaking out. I didn't realize they had
La Croix until we were an hour out and I had three cans. I, for some reason watched
Marley and Me on the plane and was sobbing like a
lunatic and I felt very safe to cry my eyes out in my suite. Speaking of in flight entertainment, the screen's really
big, really really big, although it's a little
weird how you recline, you're very close to the screen, unlike other seats where you're kind of far away from the in flight screen, you're very up close and
personal with that screen, I enjoyed that but some people
may not like just how close, it's much closer than on other planes. So I think Delta should
be proud of this product, some service things that you know they could improve upon, the food, getting better champagne, but overall it's a winning product and I slept for three and a half hours
and now I'm ready to go out in Tokyo so overall TPG approved. 
After Hanoi's delicious food and crazy
night life and the serene waters of Ha Long Bay, it was time to explore Vietnam's modern
metropolis Ho Chi Minh City This is TPGtv. Centrally located across
from the famous opera house, The Park Hyatt Saigon is one of the
city's best hotels My Park suite king had a generous full-size living room and I was treated to a welcome amenity of fruit and wine. The bedroom held the king size bed and a
large bathroom stocked with products by Vietnamese luxury
brand, Cochine. I booked three standard Park King rooms
for myself and my travel companions through Amex fine hotels and resorts for
Platinum cardholders. I paid 5.6 million Vietnamese Dong or
about $250 per room per night However I used one of my Diamond Hyatt 
suite upgrades for the Park Suite King which would have cost $290 more per night Along with a a 30% diamond bonus and a 1000 point diamond welcome amenity, I ended up earning 13,744 points for all three rooms My first stop in Saigon was the Cong Nhan theater for an exclusive chance to perform in Vietnamese style of folk
opera called Cai Luong Ho Quang At times it felt more like acrobat school than theatre. My character was an old King whose granddaughter betrayed him but I would have my revenge in the end, well after a lot more rehearsal at least. And after a last round of touchups, we were ready for the performance My Vietnamese theatre debut seemed to be a critical success To celebrate, I stopped at one of the city's most famous bazaars, Binh Tay Market for some bargain hunting. In the heart of Saigon's
Chinatown Bin Tay Market is an institution, anything and everything is on sale here
and the only prices are the ones you negotiate. I knew I'd be leaving Vietnam with the suitcase full of souvenirs it was the memories of my trip the
thrilling night life in Hanoi, the tranquil inlets of Ha Long Bay, and my turn on the stage in Ho Chi Minh City that I'd be carrying home with me 
got a great platinum welcome amenities some below than Suites big comfortable king-size bed blackout so why would you want to block out a beautiful view of Osaka - sings - thumbs up I love these wet rooms one of the reasons why I love staying at savory juses is for the butler service and all you got to do is click this red button put in QRS can you unpack for me excellent

While it might seem like I'm all about points and
miles, I travel to experience new cultures and try new things especially
when that includes interesting foods so when I discovered a delicious new
dish in Hanoi, I wanted to learn how to make it myself. This is TPGtv. After a few days in Hanoi I was
quickly falling in love with Vietnam. Though the city can be hectic, with nonstop traffic and 
crowds and lots of life and noise, there were also little moments of quiet delight and fun as well. One of the best ways to gain insight into the Vietnamese way of life was through the country's cuisine, not only its dishes, but how people there eat. To the outside eye, it might appear that eating is a hurried afterthought. Many people here take their meals on the go or at curbside stalls, but just because the setting isn't fancy, does't mean that the food isn't delicious Bun cha is a Hanoi specialty. A juicy pork patty barbecued over an open
grill and served with cold rice noodles fresh greens and a sweet chili sauce, one
bite and I was hooked. I loved it so much, that I wanted to learn how to make it myself, so I booked a private class at You have to pay cash but because I'm a
Chase private client the bank waves all ATM cash withdrawal fees. This is chef Nee Young and he's got decades of experience in the kitchen, and I'm hoping just a little bit rubs off on me. Once I was decked out I was ready to try
making Bun cha. While that was a delicious way to spend an afternoon, I don't think I'll be quitting my day job anytime soon and that's good because... On the next TPGtv, we sail the waters of Ha Long Bay and explore its mystical islands. 
so welcome everyone we've got an exciting Facebook live today instead of me you know in an airport terminal holding a phone in front of my face and rambling on about the musings of the travel world we actually have somewhat of a set and two esteemed guests with us today and we're talking all things Starwood and Marriott merger you guys right on the site it is official Marriott now owned Starwood Starwood is a part of Marriott however you want to say it and today we have the heads of both so Marriott loyalty globally Thom Kozik right and David flicked the new senior VP of Starwood Preferred Guest so welcome guys thank you for thanks brent via congratulations I know it's been a a long and wild ride but it is official as of today star would no longer trades on the market you want you guys are one big happy company how does that feel Oh fantastic it has been a journey but what's really been exciting is you know finding the places where we connect on you know our philosophies around taking care of the guests taking care of the members it's been you know more more in common than other people outside might have otherwise guessed but it's been just a phenomenal phenomenal what's been the biggest challenge you know and this is the the largest hotel chain in the world now right right is that by rooms and properties or divided by every account by loyalty members by rooms by properties everything so on the loyalty side what's been the biggest challenge kind of getting this all together I actually frankly was amazed at today you can actually link your Starwood and Marriott accounts get a status match like transfer your points at a reasonable ratio every Starwood point is three Marriott points and every three Marriott points is one Starwood points we're actually becoming out with the post later today on the when you would want to transfer back because obviously where the points guy would like to maximize both sides but I like the fact that it's not a one-way transfer and there's options I think the changes today are additive instead of taking things away although we will get into questions about that but back to my question what has been the biggest challenge taking these two programs these two companies with different cultures and making them one yeah I mean the challenge was just being able to get ready for day one and be able to allow all of our members to link their accounts and we're really excited to have done the hard work to allow that today and and it is you know it's instant it is and so it's I mean it's it really is the first time that companies of our size have managed to have linking on the day the transaction closed so as you said today is when the merger is official and our members can already go on then go to the website WWE era Commons Inc their accounts and they'll get status matched across the program and they will also be able to transfer points between that's pretty lazy so if you don't know Marriott Platinum is 75 nights no stays Starwood Platinum is 50 nights or 25 stays of even one night each and you can instantly get Marriott said it's not right I think I as a star would platinum and by means of for those of you out there I mean there are a few more people with skin in the game I'm a hundred night Starwood Platinum closing in on lifetime platinum status I've got both Starwood Amex personal in business I've got the Ritz Card Ritz platinum from spend there I've been coming more and more familiar with the Marriott family so do you worry about a sudden influx can the program can star would handle all these new Marriott Platinum's do you worry about the change in experience in the program with the scale on day one kind of increased dramatically yeah on the Starwood site I mean I think your point about scale is really the right one so you know we are incredibly excited to welcome a lot of new members into our programs they can come and experience all of our hotels you know granted we will have more Platinum's but when you think about the greater volume of hotels you know Starwood we had around 1300 hotels now there's over 5700 hotels around the world and so even though they'll certainly be more Platinum's there are so many more places for people to go and stay where we think in in total it's gonna be a tremendous positive for all of our members right now the marriott side you know the the same holds true really in both directions it's not only having this broader distribution footprint that our members gonna go enjoy but even the partnerships as well right so now we've got an entirely new swath of partners on the Starwood side or on the Marriott side that because of the linkage members go enjoy so I'm a I'm a loyal SPG but obviously married as well so what would you say Tom to start with Platinum's out there that haven't dabbled in marriott now they've got this big brave new world in front of them what is the experience how would you set expectations for those Starwood Platinum's that may start trickling or flooding into two Marriott hotels and the differences they might expect and stay well I think that you know going back to something we're just talking about a moment ago Brian is that there was a lot of skepticism around was there you know how we were going to treat the respective programs and we wanted to send a really strong signal from day one of the respect we have for the members in each program and the value we want to be able to show them so for us you know those new Starwood members who have started linking as of a couple hours ago we had thousands and thousands of members already linked their accounts we had dire have you seen a flow more one way than the other in terms of the transfer points it's it's in the early hours well we're gonna watch the data closely but it was fun in the first three minutes of the site going live at about 12:15 a.m. a Starwood Preferred Goldmember jumped on link their accounts transferred 36,000 points and booked to stay at the Osaka Marriott so the song is a fun town if you're in Osaka try fugu the the Blowfish right we just did a tpgtv episode so that's cool I mean that that really does encapsulate to the on the urn and Burnside there's so many more options which isn't net positive for for consumers now I do have let a lot of readers tons of questions so I promised to answer them in readers if you're watching at home please we have people monitoring Facebook live and we're gonna be funneling up some of the better questions so I have to say this week's been big David Congrats on your new role Avianca was added as Starwood even the SPG Amex now has new offers if you ask me it seems like Starwood Preferred guest is here to stay I think that's been the biggest worry that this beloved program is going away it seems like every major move is that it's gonna stay will we see Marriott Rewards Ritz and Starwood Preferred Guest for the long haul so good well I'm so for now certainly so the great news is that all the programs are going to continue to exist as they have the only difference is that now for our members and for Marriott Rewards members they now so more benefits they earned earned when they travel across the portfolio so many more redemption options in terms of star for guests I think you're right I think a lot of the DNA a lot of the innovation a lot of things that our members love about SPG are things that you know we will continue to provide long term will be think about how you bring the the programs together but you know as you know you and I have met years ago I've been part of the SPG leadership team for a long time I most recently ran global revenue management for Starr but I'm thrilled to come back to the program and work with Tom on bringing these two programs together and I think that's really not only symbolic but but really indicative of how much we're gonna bring what SPG created that was so unique into the combined program so have there I mean obviously some of the ways that SPG is has been innovative so that sweet Knight upgrades the Ambassador Program can you scale those programs to a larger pool to the Marriott side as well the way we'll scale is what we the hard work that starts today right you saw us earlier this year launch our new concierge service for our elite members akin to the Ambassador Program and now we can actually get under the covers and start doing the real work that's necessary to get to a unified program that has the right benefits as we've said from the very beginning the best of both programs are there and so so it's at the end of September 2016 now I know timeline what do you think is a rough timeline with the harmonization of benefits in your eyes or what wouldn't ideal one be well it's it's really too early to tell right that work starts today so we'll start to harmonize different pieces the program as we go and if something's ready we'll bring it to the members as soon as we can you know but we've we're not so much worried about the date as much as we are worried about what is the right set of benefits in the right way the program needs to be structured right so can you can you speak it all about the co brand so that's the beloved Starwood the beloved chase premier and the wrist any any insight into whether they'll stay as separate products or we're gonna try to to stick with one bank going forward look and the good news is that for the foreseeable future we're gonna still have our existing portfolio of co-brand cards and you know I as you mentioned you know the start for a guest card from American Express is loved by many the same with the chase card for Marriott Rewards I think over time not only for the credit cards but for all of our partners we're gonna have to figure out how do you bring the best of both worlds together and I think your earlier point on scale is really what we're incredibly excited about which is when you think about unlocking the partnerships that we have today the amazing thing is on day one now our members can take advantage of partnerships on both sides of the loyalty program so if you're an elite SPG member when you link your accounts you're now going to get the benefits that Marriott Rewards elite members have with United and vice versa with Delta so you already start to see how the power the partnerships are benefiting our members and I think that that scale is gonna help us going forward because we're gonna be probably the most valuable partner for all of the incredible travel partners out there they don't want to be a partner with our new portfolio given the scale of members and I think that's gonna end up benefiting all of our members down the road numerically you look at that Brian we're at 85 million plus members combined between both programs two convertible and that puts us at the scale of many of the large airline programs so it affords us an ability to to establish those kind of benefits in those partnerships that neither one of us could have done individually speaking of Airlines so I think one of the best parts of the Starwood program and reason why it's our number one most valuable currency in our monthly evaluations is the ability to transfer to those airlines and we just added Avianca right I know people are angsty about that going away or the ratio changing can you calm any nerves for those who love to transfer their Starwood points to Airlines its that program changing it all or once again foreseeable future yeah I mean I would I would definitely calm everyone there's and I think that I think members are already taking a lot of solace in the fact that when they look at the all the benefits that we've announced they really are all net benefits to them they're all you know in just increasing the rewards options the partnership options and you know what I think we've been very proud of is that we spent a lot of time listening to influential leaders in the industry and also our members and designing a program that really works for them and and that that principle is going to continue to guide how we bring the programs together over time and so lifetime status really valuable Marriott had a different approach than store what can you just talk about what so like a Marriott the platinum status matches today will that platinum count towards the ten years of platinum for lifetime or how does this new merged world work great question status the lifetime status earning should continue within each respective program the way it does today as we come together to merge the program's eventually to a unified program in the future we'll treat the lifetime status very carefully as we always have I mean if you look historically at the acquisitions SPG has done over the years you look at the acquisitions Mary it's done after over the years we've always encompassed new programs or an existing program whether it be it from Delta or protea or any other brand and there was always people with a lifetime status at some level within those programs so we'll take that same care of how do we preserve your status and recognition because recognition is the number one pillar on our strategy for merit awards so how do we preserve that recognition and take that forward what that formula will look like it's way too early to tell but it's important what I think you know just on behalf of the approach you've taken today with being I think extra generous an additive I think for those worrying about that down the line at least today I think you've shown that you do actually have the guest in mind so I like to give kudos where it's due I'm not a I'll complain when it's when it's relevant but I think there I think the approach that you guys are taking is in general very consumer friendly Kevin asked in the comments on our post yesterday well Amex platinum still offer free SPG gold once the merger is complete they will so that's right so what what's amazing is a lot of these partnerships work in both directions so we have you know we valuable members who are part of the American Express portfolio that have gold and they now can status match into Marriott which is I think really exciting news for them as well yeah can you see on our side with the chase card the the earning accelerators the stuff that we have gives the members of an ability to take those points and move them into the SPG matched program and enjoy the benefits on that side David I guess this one's for you Jessica asked on Facebook will you be able to redeem seven nights stay and flight packages for Starwood so as the head of SPG do you see adapting the similar sort of Raja's or you can allow is that well that will they stay in Marriott right or you guys adding that option so for now what's that what what we what members can take advantage of is they can transfer their points into SPG they can take advantage of all of the existing redemption programs that we have so you know fifth night free is something our members love and obviously that will be available to them we're not changing the existing benefits I think that today as Tom mentioned the hard work begins of how do we take the best of both programs and think about what the combined program would look like down the road and that's where we'll be examining things that have been so successful for Marriott to think about how does that fit in my new program building on what David said yeah we saw a lot of chatter in the last 24 hours or so people asking about the hotel and air packages which they tend to love in the Marriott program so again bring your points over go ahead and be able to take advantage of the hotel on air packages that we've been able to offer nice and Chrissy asks a question that is also from me as someone who likes Fancy Pants properties why can't you redeem points for Ritz Carlton Reserve properties is that something that you want to add in the future like the Bulgari in Bali I think is when I have my eye on right so we're always working with our owners to look at where we can incorporate them into the program in the right fit the great news I think now with the bringing together the two programs is just as much as it affords us an ability to have a new set of discussions with partners it affords us the ability to give a new value proposition to owners and bring them into the fold in a way we haven't had the power to do before so I think it'd be surprised at our ability to bring more owners along and so be it properties like algorri or Musca low or any of the other high-end properties we have across I'm surely the first in line that's right we'll bring you in no I don't take free hotels and if you're watching I pay for my own travel I wasn't asking for a freebie but I can't personally I can't wait to start trying out all the new properties that you have in the community like really so I would store would for years and I've been trying autograph hotels to a cease on tomorrow and Madrid amazing property so if you are start with member who's been focused on SPG I really would look at the the there's 30 with those 30 brands right so I'll hold down right autograph AC hotels Moxie I mean there's almost I think we need to just do a so there's no with so many brands there's no plans to cut any I remember hearing rumors you know we're gonna sell off Sheraton for the assets and this and so there's no plans right now to get rid of any of the combined brands no Arne has been very clear on this that each brand has got its own unique value propositions to the guests to the members the power of this coming together really is about that that degree of choice that we're giving everybody and again the footprint if you'd look geographically to what David was saying you know where we have strengths in the merit portfolio is countered by fantastic strings in the SBG portfolio in other geographies where is the biggest growth now for the combined company where do you see the most hotel is it still asia-pacific I think so yeah yeah I mean so the growth the growth in Asia is tremendous but not only just Asia so when you look at the growth in the Middle East you look at the growth actually in South America so in South America the growth down there is extraordinary in fact you as you can imagine we also love to travel I love to travel as you do and as a lot of your readers do so rather than being here with you in New York I was actually supposed to be on the overnight flight I'm down to Lima my wife and I were going to the tombow Dell Inc oh that's right member favorite that it's an amazing amazing resort so we're here with you the financial district I'm here I'm here with you so we were gonna go and we're gonna see Machu Picchu and there's a Luxury Collection resort which is in the Inca sacred Valley there which is incredible and I think for me what's amazing is that for all of the Marriott Rewards members who want to have the dream of sort of exploring the incredible amazing places in South America there are you know credible SPG resorts for them to experience them and same for our members so you know I my family's actually never been on a safari and so Tom and I have been talking about I'm getting to Kruger National Park where they have the the protein-protein yeah so we've got the lodge Safari yeah you can you use Marriott points to stay at it or is it yes you can use Mary points to stay at the protea at the lodge right outside Kruger yeah we're looking forward to exploring the portfolio as well and as as married employees what's your free what's your travel benefit like you get free nights or is it but I remember star hot or whatever it's right yeah but both both companies have had associate rate discounts where they're available but what why your readers and some other folks that there might be surprised to hear is that it's not automatic for us right it depends on occupancy depends on capacity so you know our hotels we rather fill them with with paying guests when we can so make sense I'm gonna ask a question of a topic I know nothing about really so rosemary asked on Facebook how will marry a vacation owners be affected Starwood vacation owners those two programs I know people who are pardoned you can buy miles I'd I really don't so high level these the vacation ownership programs are they abducted and one small wrinkle with folks who are timeshare owners in both programs is the points that you were granted for your ownership of a of a timeshare those points can't be transferred into the respective program a the points earned for your stays everything else and he earned on the credit card absolutely transferable but the points that were granted for you is a benefit or a accelerator on purchase yeah those are restricted to within your home program got it okay do you are you guys considering adding an option to confirm a suite at time of booking as hide offers to members is that in the plan I mean I so in the look considering is the way the question was here's might say which is that everything is on the table at this point so for us what is amazing we've talked about this a little bit is that when you bring the scale that we'll have together I think it unlocks a lot of opportunities that we haven't had before and so you know as we think about how do you bring the best of both programs not only is it the best of our existing programs but it's also to look further afield and say look what are the things that members care most about and how do we figure out how to bring that into the program so that hard work is to come but you know I'm I'm very optimistic that in the next whatever the right timeframe is we're gonna have some great news for our members you looked at you go back to the conversation we had done in the Grand Cayman I guess it was a February Brian you know both companies weren't standing still yeah we have our own respective roadmaps and now we start to get to mesh those a little bit and look at with this new capacity with this new set of team mates how we can start to happen to these capabilities how we can build things that we didn't have the scale or the capability to build before we now have more hands on deck do that I think the biggest concern about consolidation whether airlines or hotels now is devaluation right the points become less valuable less competition in the marketplace you know the way that hotels do values every year you reset categories right and some go up some go down right how will that process now work in the combined well now that everything is married well how is Marriott done in vs. Starwood like time I every February can you talk people through when so for now there's no point changes in free nights but when we might we see that adjustment the category changes that happen every year in the February time frame will still happen respectively within each program for 2017 okay we would hope that by 2018 we get more of a unified view of what that should look like okay but you know we were far enough along through 2016 that the data is what the data is right those are adjusted as you know every year based on average daily rate and the member uptake of redemptions in those properties and that's what drives the formulas on our side to determine what the category level should be that that date is already there so for 2017 any changes that will come and take place but I think more importantly if you look at the last three years within Marriott Rewards and risk our awards we've gotten we've done less and less increases in categories and yeah they've been very reasonable so I guess there's no major category restructure the fundamental restructuring where a Starwood changes into not ecstatic no not today not today not now good answer I think I would like to take it now so two live questions and Mele do you want to great question so we're gonna again keep the program separate for the time being but it's one of the areas these packages we know are very very valuable and very popular with our members so it's high on the list of the things we're going to harmonize as we look at bringing the two programs together in the future but here's the here's the great news the great news for for all of your readers is that if they have redemption options they love and Marriott they can take their SPG points and they can transfer into Marriott Rewards and they can then use them for that and vice versa so you know Bibles won't be able to use a forest Starwood Hotel like you can do the nights and flights a century like I did it the great W mirror I can during the film festival which was and then I use France when I got a selfless companion pass one of the most amazing weird but you won't be able to do that for Limor Rhydian you know like that's just a current Marriott property so that currently so good at least they're not going away you can still use them and you can transfer points so right we're not getting everything on our wish list but it does take a little to put all this do the way we're doing the that's a good I'll just reap in that case we can't here so Starwood the way 50 nights is platinum 75 nights you get an extra perk of an increased earn and then a 100 nights you get an ambassador so can a Marriott Platinum get to SPG ambassador board is that from scratch you know how did the night transfer in trying to look at the most fair way to treat it is a great question and it's when we're getting a lot of the easiest way for us to treat everybody fairly and to be recognizing the value that an SPG elite has been using in terms of their nights within their brands we needed to make sure that we didn't suddenly give somebody who walks in today everything that something's been earning so a Marriott Platinum who is now status match to a Starwood platinum is a base platinum within the Starwood program and any nights they earn will count towards the benefits within the Starwood row but to get to an ambassador they would have to stay a hundred nights correct it's not like they get fifty night credit correct right so it's it's like how most status matches work you can the actual status is switch to platinum but your nights to requalification to 7500 it's still you got to earn that which is frankly good as a Starwood ambassador I don't want the Ambassador Program to be bursting at the seams and see the service go down you know you have to earn 100 nights in SPG to get to that level sorry I'm sorry well no chimera we have our ambassador we have our procedures and that's the same right yeah we don't have the same earning tier but that's again not complete dilution that's which correcting it's always hard to strike that balance but I think that's a fair approach so can you use a Marriott co-branded card at the Starwood Hotel will you earn increased bonus one of the things we're still looking at one of the that you yeah you know it's it's it's one thing for us to do the work we were able to do and admittedly to a certain degree with our hands tied until we could get to regulatory approval there's a lot we could not legally do to get ready for today but you could imagine take that one step further and extend that to our Cobra partners and airline partners they've got to get caught up so you to answer the question know if you have a Marriott premier chase card and you stay 2w you will not get the bonuses if you stayed at a Marriott brand correct property good questions so yes so 15 nights in a Marriott bed plus 50 nights in a Starwood bed will you get Starwood ambassador okay will you be able to add to take it breach the highest most level for next year yeah no for 2017 the programs in terms of their earning qualifications room eat remain separate and distinct so they won't be additive and I think as we've talked about a bit you know that's the work we're gonna start on is how do we bring those programs together and it won't be 417 but you know we'll hope to have have something relatively soon that we can we can announce to members cool well you guys are busy it's a busy busy day for you I really appreciate you coming out appreciate you coming out and answering these questions so I'll give you guys a any last-minute thoughts for readers out there about the merger or how they can give feedback on these changes couldn't you guys work write that I'll give you the floor for a minute to kind of give up well first and foremost if you haven't already go to members Marriott com where you can do the linking of your accounts you can immediately be status managed you can immediately start transferring points and there's all the FAQ and the the answers to a lot of these questions and more that we've posted there for people and in terms of feedback we at various social channels we're monitoring live in real time for both programs as well as our forum the rewards insider forum where we have again the most engaged members they're giving us direct feedback that we pay a lot of attention to yeah I think that's right I mean first of all I'd love to thank all your readers for their loyalty to us you know we we love how passionate they are about the programs and we're excited to have this news for them today I think that the the one thing that that I'd encourage them to do is to start going on the Marriot side and the SPG site and look at their favorite areas to travel I think they will be amazed when they see what the combined portfolio of hotels looks like and you know where their dreams can take them yeah I end on the same note like I mentioned earlier I've becoming more and more familiar with Mariya you know there's no one best program for everyone and I think there are some incredible properties you know you can even say that lantus now the Marriott property so I think as consumers the best things we can do is educate ourselves about both programs well like I said we'll be coming out with posts on how to maximize this new age of transferring in between but I think in general from my perspective and not just because we have our esteemed guests here I could not have envisioned better news today in terms of Marriott members and Starwood guests so we're gonna be doing post later today if you have more questions for us we have access to these guys and we can get questions answered and so ask away continue on social media and on our posts and in the meantime safe travels enjoy Peru when you finally get there thank you thank you for having pictures of the resort and well coming all right yeah thanks very much for tuning in 
as the points guy I'm on the road all the time and one of the things people ask me the most about is how I pack and throughout the years I've picked up a lot of tips on how to make the process especially packing and unpacking as seamless as possible I've created my own TPG stack and fold method which I'll share with you today that really minimizes wrinkles in fact I can't even remember the last time I had to steam or iron a shirt in a hotel room the first method of stacking fold is to simply lay out your clothes starting with your sweaters and shirts and t-shirts you start with your most hefty item on the bottom and then work your way back you fold the arms in all on top of each other and fold in half again and press down next you'll take your pants put all your pants fold it in half on top of each other followed by shorts fold in half and then in half again when I start packing my suitcase I always start with shoes since they take up the most space and if you're really pressed for space you can fit a lot in these shoes I'd recommend putting them in shoe bags or using the hotel's laundry bag so that you don't spread germs or stain any of your other clothes then I go on to underwear and socks to align next to it then we go on to our neatly folded and pressed pants and shorts press down as much as you can them the more firm they are together the more they'll resist wrinkles and then on top you place your shirts and make sure there are tucked in so the edges don't get caught and voila and the last step is to make sure you don't go over weight scales are really cheap to get and they can save you a fortune I once was at London Heathrow flying first-class on British Airways and my bag was 71 pounds I had bought a lot of things on vacation that year and they wouldn't even let me check the bag because they said it would break the belt so make sure if you've got this big suitcase that you don't load it down too much and before you close your suitcase make sure you take an extra pair of socks to put on your carry-on I can't tell you how many times I see people walking through the disgusting airport security with no socks on and if you want a pretty cool pair check out my new socks that I designed with Hugh their 747 inspired socks 
People may think spring break is just for
college kid but I disagree. My birthday falls during the first week of March and I usually treat myself by traveling somewhere warm this year I was thinking
about Costa Rica so when the folks at JetBlue and Barclaycard invited me down
there to hear the details of their new new highly anticipated JetBlue co-branded credit cards I jumped at the chance. However in keeping with TPG policy I paid for my own flights and hotel After all I wanted to earn the miles and points This is TPGtv While I was excited to get to Costa Rica
as an avgeek I was really excited for a special tour that my friends at JetBlue
had arranged the airlines terminal at JFK T5 as it's known today actually
includes one of the aviation worlds landmarks. The Trans World Airlines Flight
Center TWA was once one of the largest airlines in the world but it was eventually
taken over by American Airlines in 2001 and all that's left is this magnificent
building. It was designed by FinnishAmerican architect Eero Saarinen who also designed the St. Louis Arch For travel geek like me it was like coming
to a place of worship. The terminal opened in 1962 but its futuristic design was way ahead of its time walking around I felt like I was a character in The
Jetsons I felt even luckier because this was the last tour of the facility
as it is today JetBlue has partnered with the developer
to open up a chic new hotel here in 2018 in the meantime had a flight to catch I typically fly JetBlue in the Northeast to
smaller destinations like Nantucket but the airline is much more than just a
regional carrier in addition to a top notch transcontinental service called Mint
the airline is rapidly expanding its international route network to
destinations like Colombia and the Caribbean and is even considering
service to cuba JetBlue also recently announced it would be adding its swanky Mint Business class seats to several new routes including those from New York to
Aruba, Barbados and St.Lucia Unfortunately my aircraft didn't have a
Mint section on it, but JetBlue economy seats are among the most spacious in the
sky at 17.8 inches wide and with 34 inches of pitch I booked an even more
space seats towards the front of the plane which has an extra four inches of
legroom. An even more space seat would have cost me $65 but I was able to redeem 800 points for it since
I'm a Mosaic Elite member however each time you purchase an even more space see whether with cash or points you actually earn 200 points so it really only cost
me 600 points. My ticket came to $300 in airfare plus $45 in taxes and fees and I earned 2,700 TrueBlue points on it 3 points per dollar spent on the base fare 3 more points per dollar for booking online and an additional three points per dollar thanks to my Mosaic status after my redemption for the even more space seats I netted 2,100 TrueBlue points as I learned later though the new JetBlue + MasterCard earned 6 bonus TrueBlue points per
dollar on JetBlue purchases as well as 2 points per dollar at restaurants and
grocery stores and 1 point on all other purchases so if I had had it when
I booked my ticket I would have earned 4,500 TrueBlue points on my ticket and
netted out 3,900 points after the even more space seats
redemption nearly doubling my earning the card which has a $99 annual fee also
offers a sign up bonus of 30,000 points when you spend 1K in the first 90 days if I had booked my ticket as an award It would have cost about 18,200 TrueBlue
points however the JetBlue + MasterCard also offers a 10% on award travel
redemptions which would have saved me about 1,820 points in this case even more
space seats are practically the size of domestic first-class seats on other
carriers though a bit narrower and I was so comfortable that I promptly fell
asleep when I woke up I was starving JetBlue is known for its awesome
selection of free snacks including Tara blue potato chips Snyder's pretzels and
Keebler graham crackers among others not to mention Dunkin' Donuts coffee and teas
but I was hungrier than that so I decided to taste 4 of their specialty eat up
boxes including the shake up, the pick me up, the perk up, and the vegan friendly
pump up, with things like red pepper hummus multigrain crackers and chocolate
chip cookies which was my favorite The JetBlue + mastercard get you 50% off
in flight purchases including cocktail snacks &amp; movies so each of these boxes would have cost me just $3.50 instead of $7 one of the other things I really like
about JetBlue is their staff who are so consistently friendly this is Jessica And just after finishing chatting with Jessica we made our final decent into el puerto de la beria, and a gorgeous 92 degree Costa Rican Day. On the next TPGtv I explore the Andaz Papagayo Resort in Costa Rica and get over my fear of heights... eventually 
I came to Ghana with one goal, to deliver an award and my life changed forever. This is TPGtv If there's one thing we need more of in
this world it's peace and any change in the world happens with our youth and who better to teach youth about peace the Nobel Peace Prize winners themselves like Leymah Gbowee who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 for her nonviolent
activism that helped end the civil war in Liberia standing up to notoriously
warlords like Charles Taylor and his use of child soldiers to terrorize an entire
nation. its people like Leymah who bring PeaceJam into Focus PeaceJam is an international
organization that uses the teaching of 13 Nobel Peace Prize winners like the
Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu to inspire and educate youth across the
world I got involved a few years ago when I met co-founders Dawn Engle and
Ivan Suvanjieff These could be change makers for these young people because instead of their energy going in a negative direction it can be channeled and they can be positive actors for change. They could be empowered agents of good. PeaceJam provides a curriculum to
educators around the world with a singular goal; to bring more peace into
the world. PeaceJammer: I love PeaceJam. I don't just like it, its another group on its own. It entertains us It gives us education, yes. It makes us know more about what is going on in in our counrty And how things are supposed to be done in out society. In its twenty-year existence PeaceJam has been nominated for the Nobel Peace
Prize eight times. And most recently this year with The Billion Acts of Peace campaign an initiative to get people to log acts of peace online of the four
million submitted last year the act that won PeaceJams youth award was the
Ghana Health campaign where group of kids outside Accra help clean the streets
and hold community workshops to educate on sanitation. Since sanitation is such a
critical issue in Ghana this one act of peace result in significantly reducing
the number of Cholera cases in the country's largest outbreak since 1982. there's a movement stirring positive change here, and it wasn't until I met
the man leading the charge, Wisdom Addo that I understood why. With very little
resources Wisdom has instilled hope in Ghana's youth. The day I arrived in Accra
I went with him to the average school in Ghana where he's been recruiting young
volunteers to join PeaceJam and with the idea of making their city better through
PeaceJam. The kids embodied all the energy and excitement in the world. The following day Wisdom had organized
the first ever PeaceSlam event in Ghana A one day conference a 200 youth and
educators and since travels often such a great expense for charities I use my
miles to fly to PeaceJam employees to Accra which save them thousands of
dollars that they put to good use on ground and as soon as I walked in the
door the kids had me smiling ear to ear. We
started off with shared games and dances and oh do they love singing in the rain. That activity got them ready for family groups with PeaceJam educators the hard-working
heavy lifters of PeaceJam who've dedicated their lives to disseminating the Nobel
laureates messages of peace and tools of nonviolent action to the next generation
of Ghana's youth PeaceJam is giving these kids a safe space to learn in a way that is very foreign in
Ghana. To learn by taking actions, by critical thinking, by doing activities
that our hands on. I feel like before they could tell you stuff that was wrong but they didn't feel that, hey we as a group can make our own lives better. Now they're starting to do that. We then broke into various groups to do projects surrounding sanitation, since the issue is so prevalent in Accra and with that, we clean the streets. and rallied for better sanitation. Then I learned how PeaceJammers celebrate starting with a rap Then I was asked to share my story with the
group and handed out The Billion Acts of Peace Award A group of teens in Ghana took it upon themselves to help stop the Cholera outbreak, and to educate the community. It is noted globally Everyone stand up and give them a round of applause. I knew I needed to do something great for these kids. the most selfless inspiring people I've
ever meant. so I made an announcement to return in 2016 with the full two day
PeaceJam event have been with Nobel laureate Layman Gbowee and the response was
astounding And just when I thought I couldn't love these kids anymore they prepare to familiar tune to
thank me On the next TPGtv I learned how highly how highly the afterlife is valued here in Nacra And guess what... they even have something in store for a guy six foot seven.

Hello, my name is Brian Kelly and I'm a plane geek. The future of aviation is all about next-generation aircraft made of composite materials
like Boeing 787 not only are these planes lighter and more fuel-efficient
opening up new routes around the world but they also make the passenger experience that much better advanced systems in the passenger cabin
improve airflow humidity altitude adjustment and even the mood lighting to help your
body cope with hopping multiple time zones so when I had the opportunity to fly one
of the world's newest planes on one of the world's best airlines I jumped
aboard. This is TPGtv After truly amazing trip to Africa, I had to figure out how to get home from Africa there are no nonstop flights from Cape Town to New York City The shortest route is via Johannesburg on South African Airways There are other options via Europe including British Airways through London or KLM through Amsterdam However the three major Middle East carriers Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways have all been expanding the route networks lately including to
Africa North America I always use Google Flights to price out the best fairs, and on the day I needed to travel the cheapest one-way business class ticket was on
Qatar Airways via Doha for $1,536 Qatar Airways is part of the one world alliance so I could credit my flights to American Airlines and earn invaluable elite qualifying miles. Now face a dilemma offers
employers encounter with the paper might take it or use miles I could have put
the same place as an award ticket using seventy-five thousand american which is
a lot of miles and get me about 2 cents per mile in value on the other hand if I
paid for my ticket overturned boat award and elite qualifying miles thanks to the
distance of the flights a 25% booking bonus for the class of Service Executive
Platinum 100% mileage bonus I would earn a total of twenty 5463 award I would
also earn 11317 elite qualifying miles about 11 percent of the weight which
require fighting for executive platinum status in all its perks including super
valuable systemwide upgrades bus by using my AMEX premier rewards
gold card which are three points per dollar and airfare I got additional 4608
MX Membership Rewards points on top of all those miles or points for more trips
but I did it go ahead and purchase a ticket to the final decision could have
chosen a two hour layover in Doha but I decided to go with the 10 hour layover
is dead so I can get out and actually see the city I flunked were there
several times but never left the airport this time and stay up at night one of the reasons I was excited about
careerism this particular road said its service by swanky new Boeing 787
Dreamliner jobs offers airline's newest business

against not one but two masters of 11 selections on my flight I enjoy
delicious dishes like chicken makhani was southbound rise and categorization
pain 35,000 feet thanks to my business class ticket I was able to use an
expedited immigration get through customs quickly it was late when I
arrived but thanks to the food and greets I was well rested ready to
explore the city were first stop sign up a little bit with the cocktail and
listen to some jazz this is the same we just don't have one of the nicest hotels and this is what I wasn't saying this is
an SPG category 6 help that would require 24 night the st. Regis Doha is
home to the first jazz at lincoln center club outside the United States we
stopped in to hear some world-class musician Jimmy and to grab a cocktail
since hotels are among the few places in our site to go to New York so great
cocktails amazing jazz and on top of it I'm learning a ton of SPG points even
when you're not staying at a hotel points just after bartender or waiter
and you can choose points per dollar for using the Starwood Amex which no longer
has borne transaction that was the perfect time hired out for anywhere from 40 to $200
got the one you want during the day and negotiate the price return for nighttime

I'm the points friday was a busy market of alleys and
streets childhood in North America ultimately ended up as an actor
filmmaker and most notably stand up so I am 24 product but in the USA to a
different ball game got about you know in a perverse way the more credit card
you happen unless you use more energy than I do my own stories and the time we
finished it was time to head back to the airport for my plate Qatar Airways has
dedicated check-in desks for its business and first-class passengers
making it a breeze get expedited customs and immigration as well as security
access there's more time to spend on the airlines amazing at a hundred thousand square feet and
two stories high the lounges practically a separate
terminal unto itself the main port contains tons of seating options in an
area for families showers dramatic spiral staircase leading up to
the main dining room I could have used another layover to explore it all but I
had a flight to catch city on the next day I test out one of
the most popular products 
- This person just paid $242 to fly business class from L.A. to Paris. How? To answer that, let's first reveal what Citi ThankYou
points are actually worth. Citi's currently offering a
75,000 ThankYou point bonus on the Citi Prestige Card. But much like solving the
mystery of where missing socks go it can be difficult to know what 75,000 points gets you in real life. $750 cold hard cash to
spend however you want. $925 towards buying a plane
ticket wherever you want to go. With the Citi Prestige
fourth night free benefit, if you book a room for at
least four consecutive nights at almost any hotel in the world, you're given a complimentary fourth night. So in just a few clicks online, you can book a four night get away to Rome for just 75,000 points, saving you $1,000. Better yet, about that business-class flight to Europe you're
about to score yourself, Citi has over a dozen transfer
partners to choose from like AirFrance KLM's FlyingBlue. Via one-to-one transfers, you can book a one-way business-class ticket from L.A. to Paris using
62,500 Citi ThankYou points and just $241.60 scoring you a seat that
costs more than $4,000 with 12,500 points left over for all the wine and
cheese you can handle. Bottom line? Signing up for the Citi Prestige card means you're signing up
for the trip of a lifetime. 
(upbeat music) - Okay. (upbeat music) 
[Music] stay up to date with all the hottest deals there's still amazing fair deal mistake bears that happen daily but they don't last long so read the point got out Tom Daley's follow us on Twitter and follow sites like the flight deal on Twitter for all those breaking deals and when you see one top on it they don't last long 
I look for three main things
when I add a credit card to my wallet: a strong sign up bonus, rich earning, and flexible redeeming. Which is why I'm excited to add the Bank of America Premium
Rewards Card to my wallet. It's got a 50,000 point sign-up bonus after $3,000 spent within three months, and you earn two points per dollar on all travel and dining, and 1.5
points for everything else. Now it gets really interesting
because you can earn from 25 to 75% more, even in those bonus categories, for having a banking relationship with Bank of America. $100,000 in an investment account or even in a checking and savings account can activate the 75% bonus. So that means that two points per dollar on travel and dining is really 3.5 and the 1.5 points on everything
else is 2.62 points. That beats almost any of the top cash back cards at about 2% back. Now the $95 annual fee might seem like a lot, but off the bat you get $100 every year in travel reimbursements. So whether that's paying
for checked luggage, club membership, or even a
better seat on the airplane, you're getting $100 back per year. So as long as you can maximize that, they're basically paying you $5 a year to have this card that comes
with a lot of other benefits. Now the real shining star of this card is when it comes time to redeem. So sure, you could use your points at one cent per point on flights and hotels, but it doesn't stop there. You can use your points
for pretty much anything. You know I've got a cute dog Miles, which you might've seen on my Instagram or pretty much every day
that I'm not traveling he's the star of my social media channels. But if I ever need to put him up in a luxury dog hotel or
just spoil him with treats, I can use those points
at one cent per point on all purchases to pay myself back. Now they also have a
link-up with 529 accounts, so you can use your points at the same one to one ratio to
contribute to 529 accounts to put away for your
kids, or in my case, my adorable nieces and nephews
for their college education. Beyond that, if you don't want to choose one specific category, here's the kicker. You can actually redeem
for cash back automatically at one cent per point every single month. So when it comes down to it, airline miles and hotel points can
still be very valuable, but you need to spend time to
learn how to maximize them. With Bank of America Premium Rewards, you can pay for pretty much anything at a really, really rich
earning and redemption rate. So, I'm adding the Bank of America Premium Rewards Card to my arsenal because it allows for
maximum diversification. (upbeat guitar music) 
so chicken here our guide on the ground introduced us to chica co to help teach us a little bit about manners and to even teach me the proper way to bow which is very important so typical thank you for for doing this with us so how do you properly bow personal I contact in personal space I can go Nicci wah so breathe bow one moment come up let's try that again konichiwa there's three types of vowels okay so this okay and then I'm sorry I'm sorry about I'll do this a lot with Japanese manners is there a difference between on the ground and on an airplane because I know you trained the AAA flight attendants it's the same the distance yep Oh yep this so always at the eyeline so I contact this big so that's something that I've learned here yeah this is incredible what will six work yeah the last meal always the fields not picky another piece it's very good are you out though

so welcome everyone we've got an exciting Facebook live today instead of me you know in an airport terminal holding a phone in front of my face and rambling on about the musings of the travel world we actually have somewhat of a set and two esteemed guests with us today and we're talking all things Starwood and Marriott merger you guys right on the site it is official Marriott now owned Starwood Starwood is a part of Marriott however you want to say it and today we have the heads of both so Marriott loyalty globally Thom Kozik right and David flicked the new senior VP of Starwood Preferred Guest so welcome guys thank you for thanks brent via congratulations I know it's been a a long and wild ride but it is official as of today star would no longer trades on the market you want you guys are one big happy company how does that feel Oh fantastic it has been a journey but what's really been exciting is you know finding the places where we connect on you know our philosophies around taking care of the guests taking care of the members it's been you know more more in common than other people outside might have otherwise guessed but it's been just a phenomenal phenomenal what's been the biggest challenge you know and this is the the largest hotel chain in the world now right right is that by rooms and properties or divided by every account by loyalty members by rooms by properties everything so on the loyalty side what's been the biggest challenge kind of getting this all together I actually frankly was amazed at today you can actually link your Starwood and Marriott accounts get a status match like transfer your points at a reasonable ratio every Starwood point is three Marriott points and every three Marriott points is one Starwood points we're actually becoming out with the post later today on the when you would want to transfer back because obviously where the points guy would like to maximize both sides but I like the fact that it's not a one-way transfer and there's options I think the changes today are additive instead of taking things away although we will get into questions about that but back to my question what has been the biggest challenge taking these two programs these two companies with different cultures and making them one yeah I mean the challenge was just being able to get ready for day one and be able to allow all of our members to link their accounts and we're really excited to have done the hard work to allow that today and and it is you know it's instant it is and so it's I mean it's it really is the first time that companies of our size have managed to have linking on the day the transaction closed so as you said today is when the merger is official and our members can already go on then go to the website WWE era Commons Inc their accounts and they'll get status matched across the program and they will also be able to transfer points between that's pretty lazy so if you don't know Marriott Platinum is 75 nights no stays Starwood Platinum is 50 nights or 25 stays of even one night each and you can instantly get Marriott said it's not right I think I as a star would platinum and by means of for those of you out there I mean there are a few more people with skin in the game I'm a hundred night Starwood Platinum closing in on lifetime platinum status I've got both Starwood Amex personal in business I've got the Ritz Card Ritz platinum from spend there I've been coming more and more familiar with the Marriott family so do you worry about a sudden influx can the program can star would handle all these new Marriott Platinum's do you worry about the change in experience in the program with the scale on day one kind of increased dramatically yeah on the Starwood site I mean I think your point about scale is really the right one so you know we are incredibly excited to welcome a lot of new members into our programs they can come and experience all of our hotels you know granted we will have more Platinum's but when you think about the greater volume of hotels you know Starwood we had around 1300 hotels now there's over 5700 hotels around the world and so even though they'll certainly be more Platinum's there are so many more places for people to go and stay where we think in in total it's gonna be a tremendous positive for all of our members right now the marriott side you know the the same holds true really in both directions it's not only having this broader distribution footprint that our members gonna go enjoy but even the partnerships as well right so now we've got an entirely new swath of partners on the Starwood side or on the Marriott side that because of the linkage members go enjoy so I'm a I'm a loyal SPG but obviously married as well so what would you say Tom to start with Platinum's out there that haven't dabbled in marriott now they've got this big brave new world in front of them what is the experience how would you set expectations for those Starwood Platinum's that may start trickling or flooding into two Marriott hotels and the differences they might expect and stay well I think that you know going back to something we're just talking about a moment ago Brian is that there was a lot of skepticism around was there you know how we were going to treat the respective programs and we wanted to send a really strong signal from day one of the respect we have for the members in each program and the value we want to be able to show them so for us you know those new Starwood members who have started linking as of a couple hours ago we had thousands and thousands of members already linked their accounts we had dire have you seen a flow more one way than the other in terms of the transfer points it's it's in the early hours well we're gonna watch the data closely but it was fun in the first three minutes of the site going live at about 12:15 a.m. a Starwood Preferred Goldmember jumped on link their accounts transferred 36,000 points and booked to stay at the Osaka Marriott so the song is a fun town if you're in Osaka try fugu the the Blowfish right we just did a tpgtv episode so that's cool I mean that that really does encapsulate to the on the urn and Burnside there's so many more options which isn't net positive for for consumers now I do have let a lot of readers tons of questions so I promised to answer them in readers if you're watching at home please we have people monitoring Facebook live and we're gonna be funneling up some of the better questions so I have to say this week's been big David Congrats on your new role Avianca was added as Starwood even the SPG Amex now has new offers if you ask me it seems like Starwood Preferred guest is here to stay I think that's been the biggest worry that this beloved program is going away it seems like every major move is that it's gonna stay will we see Marriott Rewards Ritz and Starwood Preferred Guest for the long haul so good well I'm so for now certainly so the great news is that all the programs are going to continue to exist as they have the only difference is that now for our members and for Marriott Rewards members they now so more benefits they earned earned when they travel across the portfolio so many more redemption options in terms of star for guests I think you're right I think a lot of the DNA a lot of the innovation a lot of things that our members love about SPG are things that you know we will continue to provide long term will be think about how you bring the the programs together but you know as you know you and I have met years ago I've been part of the SPG leadership team for a long time I most recently ran global revenue management for Starr but I'm thrilled to come back to the program and work with Tom on bringing these two programs together and I think that's really not only symbolic but but really indicative of how much we're gonna bring what SPG created that was so unique into the combined program so have there I mean obviously some of the ways that SPG is has been innovative so that sweet Knight upgrades the Ambassador Program can you scale those programs to a larger pool to the Marriott side as well the way we'll scale is what we the hard work that starts today right you saw us earlier this year launch our new concierge service for our elite members akin to the Ambassador Program and now we can actually get under the covers and start doing the real work that's necessary to get to a unified program that has the right benefits as we've said from the very beginning the best of both programs are there and so so it's at the end of September 2016 now I know timeline what do you think is a rough timeline with the harmonization of benefits in your eyes or what wouldn't ideal one be well it's it's really too early to tell right that work starts today so we'll start to harmonize different pieces the program as we go and if something's ready we'll bring it to the members as soon as we can you know but we've we're not so much worried about the date as much as we are worried about what is the right set of benefits in the right way the program needs to be structured right so can you can you speak it all about the co brand so that's the beloved Starwood the beloved chase premier and the wrist any any insight into whether they'll stay as separate products or we're gonna try to to stick with one bank going forward look and the good news is that for the foreseeable future we're gonna still have our existing portfolio of co-brand cards and you know I as you mentioned you know the start for a guest card from American Express is loved by many the same with the chase card for Marriott Rewards I think over time not only for the credit cards but for all of our partners we're gonna have to figure out how do you bring the best of both worlds together and I think your earlier point on scale is really what we're incredibly excited about which is when you think about unlocking the partnerships that we have today the amazing thing is on day one now our members can take advantage of partnerships on both sides of the loyalty program so if you're an elite SPG member when you link your accounts you're now going to get the benefits that Marriott Rewards elite members have with United and vice versa with Delta so you already start to see how the power the partnerships are benefiting our members and I think that that scale is gonna help us going forward because we're gonna be probably the most valuable partner for all of the incredible travel partners out there they don't want to be a partner with our new portfolio given the scale of members and I think that's gonna end up benefiting all of our members down the road numerically you look at that Brian we're at 85 million plus members combined between both programs two convertible and that puts us at the scale of many of the large airline programs so it affords us an ability to to establish those kind of benefits in those partnerships that neither one of us could have done individually speaking of Airlines so I think one of the best parts of the Starwood program and reason why it's our number one most valuable currency in our monthly evaluations is the ability to transfer to those airlines and we just added Avianca right I know people are angsty about that going away or the ratio changing can you calm any nerves for those who love to transfer their Starwood points to Airlines its that program changing it all or once again foreseeable future yeah I mean I would I would definitely calm everyone there's and I think that I think members are already taking a lot of solace in the fact that when they look at the all the benefits that we've announced they really are all net benefits to them they're all you know in just increasing the rewards options the partnership options and you know what I think we've been very proud of is that we spent a lot of time listening to influential leaders in the industry and also our members and designing a program that really works for them and and that that principle is going to continue to guide how we bring the programs together over time and so lifetime status really valuable Marriott had a different approach than store what can you just talk about what so like a Marriott the platinum status matches today will that platinum count towards the ten years of platinum for lifetime or how does this new merged world work great question status the lifetime status earning should continue within each respective program the way it does today as we come together to merge the program's eventually to a unified program in the future we'll treat the lifetime status very carefully as we always have I mean if you look historically at the acquisitions SPG has done over the years you look at the acquisitions Mary it's done after over the years we've always encompassed new programs or an existing program whether it be it from Delta or protea or any other brand and there was always people with a lifetime status at some level within those programs so we'll take that same care of how do we preserve your status and recognition because recognition is the number one pillar on our strategy for merit awards so how do we preserve that recognition and take that forward what that formula will look like it's way too early to tell but it's important what I think you know just on behalf of the approach you've taken today with being I think extra generous an additive I think for those worrying about that down the line at least today I think you've shown that you do actually have the guest in mind so I like to give kudos where it's due I'm not a I'll complain when it's when it's relevant but I think there I think the approach that you guys are taking is in general very consumer friendly Kevin asked in the comments on our post yesterday well Amex platinum still offer free SPG gold once the merger is complete they will so that's right so what what's amazing is a lot of these partnerships work in both directions so we have you know we valuable members who are part of the American Express portfolio that have gold and they now can status match into Marriott which is I think really exciting news for them as well yeah can you see on our side with the chase card the the earning accelerators the stuff that we have gives the members of an ability to take those points and move them into the SPG matched program and enjoy the benefits on that side David I guess this one's for you Jessica asked on Facebook will you be able to redeem seven nights stay and flight packages for Starwood so as the head of SPG do you see adapting the similar sort of Raja's or you can allow is that well that will they stay in Marriott right or you guys adding that option so for now what's that what what we what members can take advantage of is they can transfer their points into SPG they can take advantage of all of the existing redemption programs that we have so you know fifth night free is something our members love and obviously that will be available to them we're not changing the existing benefits I think that today as Tom mentioned the hard work begins of how do we take the best of both programs and think about what the combined program would look like down the road and that's where we'll be examining things that have been so successful for Marriott to think about how does that fit in my new program building on what David said yeah we saw a lot of chatter in the last 24 hours or so people asking about the hotel and air packages which they tend to love in the Marriott program so again bring your points over go ahead and be able to take advantage of the hotel on air packages that we've been able to offer nice and Chrissy asks a question that is also from me as someone who likes Fancy Pants properties why can't you redeem points for Ritz Carlton Reserve properties is that something that you want to add in the future like the Bulgari in Bali I think is when I have my eye on right so we're always working with our owners to look at where we can incorporate them into the program in the right fit the great news I think now with the bringing together the two programs is just as much as it affords us an ability to have a new set of discussions with partners it affords us the ability to give a new value proposition to owners and bring them into the fold in a way we haven't had the power to do before so I think it'd be surprised at our ability to bring more owners along and so be it properties like algorri or Musca low or any of the other high-end properties we have across I'm surely the first in line that's right we'll bring you in no I don't take free hotels and if you're watching I pay for my own travel I wasn't asking for a freebie but I can't personally I can't wait to start trying out all the new properties that you have in the community like really so I would store would for years and I've been trying autograph hotels to a cease on tomorrow and Madrid amazing property so if you are start with member who's been focused on SPG I really would look at the the there's 30 with those 30 brands right so I'll hold down right autograph AC hotels Moxie I mean there's almost I think we need to just do a so there's no with so many brands there's no plans to cut any I remember hearing rumors you know we're gonna sell off Sheraton for the assets and this and so there's no plans right now to get rid of any of the combined brands no Arne has been very clear on this that each brand has got its own unique value propositions to the guests to the members the power of this coming together really is about that that degree of choice that we're giving everybody and again the footprint if you'd look geographically to what David was saying you know where we have strengths in the merit portfolio is countered by fantastic strings in the SBG portfolio in other geographies where is the biggest growth now for the combined company where do you see the most hotel is it still asia-pacific I think so yeah yeah I mean so the growth the growth in Asia is tremendous but not only just Asia so when you look at the growth in the Middle East you look at the growth actually in South America so in South America the growth down there is extraordinary in fact you as you can imagine we also love to travel I love to travel as you do and as a lot of your readers do so rather than being here with you in New York I was actually supposed to be on the overnight flight I'm down to Lima my wife and I were going to the tombow Dell Inc oh that's right member favorite that it's an amazing amazing resort so we're here with you the financial district I'm here I'm here with you so we were gonna go and we're gonna see Machu Picchu and there's a Luxury Collection resort which is in the Inca sacred Valley there which is incredible and I think for me what's amazing is that for all of the Marriott Rewards members who want to have the dream of sort of exploring the incredible amazing places in South America there are you know credible SPG resorts for them to experience them and same for our members so you know I my family's actually never been on a safari and so Tom and I have been talking about I'm getting to Kruger National Park where they have the the protein-protein yeah so we've got the lodge Safari yeah you can you use Marriott points to stay at it or is it yes you can use Mary points to stay at the protea at the lodge right outside Kruger yeah we're looking forward to exploring the portfolio as well and as as married employees what's your free what's your travel benefit like you get free nights or is it but I remember star hot or whatever it's right yeah but both both companies have had associate rate discounts where they're available but what why your readers and some other folks that there might be surprised to hear is that it's not automatic for us right it depends on occupancy depends on capacity so you know our hotels we rather fill them with with paying guests when we can so make sense I'm gonna ask a question of a topic I know nothing about really so rosemary asked on Facebook how will marry a vacation owners be affected Starwood vacation owners those two programs I know people who are pardoned you can buy miles I'd I really don't so high level these the vacation ownership programs are they abducted and one small wrinkle with folks who are timeshare owners in both programs is the points that you were granted for your ownership of a of a timeshare those points can't be transferred into the respective program a the points earned for your stays everything else and he earned on the credit card absolutely transferable but the points that were granted for you is a benefit or a accelerator on purchase yeah those are restricted to within your home program got it okay do you are you guys considering adding an option to confirm a suite at time of booking as hide offers to members is that in the plan I mean I so in the look considering is the way the question was here's might say which is that everything is on the table at this point so for us what is amazing we've talked about this a little bit is that when you bring the scale that we'll have together I think it unlocks a lot of opportunities that we haven't had before and so you know as we think about how do you bring the best of both programs not only is it the best of our existing programs but it's also to look further afield and say look what are the things that members care most about and how do we figure out how to bring that into the program so that hard work is to come but you know I'm I'm very optimistic that in the next whatever the right timeframe is we're gonna have some great news for our members you looked at you go back to the conversation we had done in the Grand Cayman I guess it was a February Brian you know both companies weren't standing still yeah we have our own respective roadmaps and now we start to get to mesh those a little bit and look at with this new capacity with this new set of team mates how we can start to happen to these capabilities how we can build things that we didn't have the scale or the capability to build before we now have more hands on deck do that I think the biggest concern about consolidation whether airlines or hotels now is devaluation right the points become less valuable less competition in the marketplace you know the way that hotels do values every year you reset categories right and some go up some go down right how will that process now work in the combined well now that everything is married well how is Marriott done in vs. Starwood like time I every February can you talk people through when so for now there's no point changes in free nights but when we might we see that adjustment the category changes that happen every year in the February time frame will still happen respectively within each program for 2017 okay we would hope that by 2018 we get more of a unified view of what that should look like okay but you know we were far enough along through 2016 that the data is what the data is right those are adjusted as you know every year based on average daily rate and the member uptake of redemptions in those properties and that's what drives the formulas on our side to determine what the category level should be that that date is already there so for 2017 any changes that will come and take place but I think more importantly if you look at the last three years within Marriott Rewards and risk our awards we've gotten we've done less and less increases in categories and yeah they've been very reasonable so I guess there's no major category restructure the fundamental restructuring where a Starwood changes into not ecstatic no not today not today not now good answer I think I would like to take it now so two live questions and Mele do you want to great question so we're gonna again keep the program separate for the time being but it's one of the areas these packages we know are very very valuable and very popular with our members so it's high on the list of the things we're going to harmonize as we look at bringing the two programs together in the future but here's the here's the great news the great news for for all of your readers is that if they have redemption options they love and Marriott they can take their SPG points and they can transfer into Marriott Rewards and they can then use them for that and vice versa so you know Bibles won't be able to use a forest Starwood Hotel like you can do the nights and flights a century like I did it the great W mirror I can during the film festival which was and then I use France when I got a selfless companion pass one of the most amazing weird but you won't be able to do that for Limor Rhydian you know like that's just a current Marriott property so that currently so good at least they're not going away you can still use them and you can transfer points so right we're not getting everything on our wish list but it does take a little to put all this do the way we're doing the that's a good I'll just reap in that case we can't here so Starwood the way 50 nights is platinum 75 nights you get an extra perk of an increased earn and then a 100 nights you get an ambassador so can a Marriott Platinum get to SPG ambassador board is that from scratch you know how did the night transfer in trying to look at the most fair way to treat it is a great question and it's when we're getting a lot of the easiest way for us to treat everybody fairly and to be recognizing the value that an SPG elite has been using in terms of their nights within their brands we needed to make sure that we didn't suddenly give somebody who walks in today everything that something's been earning so a Marriott Platinum who is now status match to a Starwood platinum is a base platinum within the Starwood program and any nights they earn will count towards the benefits within the Starwood row but to get to an ambassador they would have to stay a hundred nights correct it's not like they get fifty night credit correct right so it's it's like how most status matches work you can the actual status is switch to platinum but your nights to requalification to 7500 it's still you got to earn that which is frankly good as a Starwood ambassador I don't want the Ambassador Program to be bursting at the seams and see the service go down you know you have to earn 100 nights in SPG to get to that level sorry I'm sorry well no chimera we have our ambassador we have our procedures and that's the same right yeah we don't have the same earning tier but that's again not complete dilution that's which correcting it's always hard to strike that balance but I think that's a fair approach so can you use a Marriott co-branded card at the Starwood Hotel will you earn increased bonus one of the things we're still looking at one of the that you yeah you know it's it's it's one thing for us to do the work we were able to do and admittedly to a certain degree with our hands tied until we could get to regulatory approval there's a lot we could not legally do to get ready for today but you could imagine take that one step further and extend that to our Cobra partners and airline partners they've got to get caught up so you to answer the question know if you have a Marriott premier chase card and you stay 2w you will not get the bonuses if you stayed at a Marriott brand correct property good questions so yes so 15 nights in a Marriott bed plus 50 nights in a Starwood bed will you get Starwood ambassador okay will you be able to add to take it breach the highest most level for next year yeah no for 2017 the programs in terms of their earning qualifications room eat remain separate and distinct so they won't be additive and I think as we've talked about a bit you know that's the work we're gonna start on is how do we bring those programs together and it won't be 417 but you know we'll hope to have have something relatively soon that we can we can announce to members cool well you guys are busy it's a busy busy day for you I really appreciate you coming out appreciate you coming out and answering these questions so I'll give you guys a any last-minute thoughts for readers out there about the merger or how they can give feedback on these changes couldn't you guys work write that I'll give you the floor for a minute to kind of give up well first and foremost if you haven't already go to members Marriott com where you can do the linking of your accounts you can immediately be status managed you can immediately start transferring points and there's all the FAQ and the the answers to a lot of these questions and more that we've posted there for people and in terms of feedback we at various social channels we're monitoring live in real time for both programs as well as our forum the rewards insider forum where we have again the most engaged members they're giving us direct feedback that we pay a lot of attention to yeah I think that's right I mean first of all I'd love to thank all your readers for their loyalty to us you know we we love how passionate they are about the programs and we're excited to have this news for them today I think that the the one thing that that I'd encourage them to do is to start going on the Marriot side and the SPG site and look at their favorite areas to travel I think they will be amazed when they see what the combined portfolio of hotels looks like and you know where their dreams can take them yeah I end on the same note like I mentioned earlier I've becoming more and more familiar with Mariya you know there's no one best program for everyone and I think there are some incredible properties you know you can even say that lantus now the Marriott property so I think as consumers the best things we can do is educate ourselves about both programs well like I said we'll be coming out with posts on how to maximize this new age of transferring in between but I think in general from my perspective and not just because we have our esteemed guests here I could not have envisioned better news today in terms of Marriott members and Starwood guests so we're gonna be doing post later today if you have more questions for us we have access to these guys and we can get questions answered and so ask away continue on social media and on our posts and in the meantime safe travels enjoy Peru when you finally get there thank you thank you for having pictures of the resort and well coming all right yeah thanks very much for tuning in 
There's a saying that God roams the world by day, but comes home to Rwanda to sleep at night and I completely understood that when I
experienced a sunrise at Virunga Lodge in Rihungeri where I Trekked with gorillas the day before. This is TPGtv Due to the complicated logistics of our three day trip across Rwanda I decided to enlist the help of
the AMEX Platinum travel where we got a Which included three nights of hotels, all
transfers, gorilla permits, and peace of mind knowing that everything was
protected by American Express. ID # 7628 where for 5,000 or more in spend you
get 25,000 American Express Membership Rewards points which I value I just under $500. The journey from Rihungeri to Kigali was in itself a highlight of my short time in Rwanda It took us much longer than expected because we couldn't help stopping whether it was a spectacular waterfall
or buzzing roadside market to try some famous Rwandan hot sauce, which I ended up bringing back in bulk; who knew? To many, Rwanda is the example of the future of Africa which is incredible considering it's unthinkable recent history in 1994
more than 800,000 people were slaughtered in a hundred day period one
of the worst genocides and world history where Rwanda turned on each other The Rwanda genocide museum in the heart of Kigali pays tribute to the genocide victims and contains mass graves of
250,000 but perhaps more importantly the museum serves as a reminder for Rwanda's past so that the country can build a brighter United Future Pierre was one of the first Rwandans to work in film after the genocide And by uncovering his country's past with folks like Alicia Keys and Christaine Amanpour He's been able to gain clarity and comfort in the power of forgiveness. Brain: Do you still harbor any resentment towards what happened The spirit of forgiveness is remarkable but that's not the only thing Rwanda is known for. Especially today. Kigali is an ever-growing hub of Africa and I wanted to understand why. This is Jean Philip, he owns a chain of six cafes called Brioche. Born to Rwandan &amp; Belgian parents Jean Philip has only lived in Kigali for six years. The United Nations estimates that Africa's population will double to 2.5 billion
by 2050. Spending time with Jean Philip really opened my mind to investment in Africa and it's clear that Rwanda stands to benefit greatly from young entrepreneurs like
Jean Philip. Since I only had one night to stay in Kigali I chose the Hotel dei Mille Collines which was the basis for the movie Hotel Rwanda The hotel has a beautiful pool and decent rooms but the real shining star is the Legacy bar downstairs where the talent is as bright as this Rwanda's future. On the next TPGtv I explore one of the
most beautiful places on earth South Africa's Cape Winelands 
*Phone ringing* At the tone please record your message. This is TPGtv 25 miles north of Cape Town lies Atlantis
a vast area of pristine powder white sand dunes which in the past ten
years have attracted more and more thrill seekers and because I hate hotel
gyms if I can explore anew side of a city and burn calories while doing it that's
a win win in my book so I arranged to meet up with dealing with Dylan LaRue founder of Cape Town Sandboarding In order for our pickup to make it up the steep sand dunes  we needed to let the air out of the tires, and Dylan paired no time putting me to work. Plus I had to look the part. and really what's the worst that could
happen? They say the taller you are the harder you fall, and unfortunately that was my experience the last time I was on a snowboard; bruised to the core for two weeks Going down regular was actually pretty easy and I remained unscathed, But the real danger was sledding down the dunes Because you had less control and sped up much faster As Kate and my producer Andrew quickly learned. Sandboarding was a blast but just like
Rwanda South Africa's beauty is everywhere you look And in our ride back to Cape Town I wanted to wash off some of the sand in the beautiful, but frigid ocean. While it is a long journey from the U.S. It's one well worth it. On the next TPGtv Who says a six hour layover in Doha
has to be spent in the airport? Not me... 
I came to Ghana with one goal to deliver an award and my life changed forever if there's one thing we need more of in this world it's peace and any change in the world happens with our youth and to better to teach youth about peace than Nobel Peace Prize winners themselves like leymah Bowie who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 2011 for her nonviolent activism that helped end the civil war in Liberia standing up to notorious warlords like charles taylor and his use of children soldiers to terrorize an entire nation it's people like leymah who bring peach jam into focus peach jam is an international organization that uses the teaching of thirteen Nobel Peace Prize winners like the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu to inspire and educate youth across the world I got involved a few years ago when I met co-founders dawn angle and Ivan sivan Jeff these can be change makers for these young people because instead of their energy going in a negative direction it can be channeled and they can be positive actors who've heard for change that can be empowered agents a good piece gem provides a curriculum to educators around the world with a singular goal to bring more peace into the world I love I don't just like it it's another group on its own it's in the things as it gives us education yes and it makes us know more about what is going on in our country and how things are supposed to be done not sides in its 20-year existence piece gem has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize eight times and most recently this year for the billion acts of peace campaign an initiative to get people to log acts of peace online of the four million submitted last year the act that one piece jams youth award was the ghana health campaign where a group of kids outside Accra helped clean the streets and hold community workshops to educate on sanitation since sanitation is such a critical issue in Ghana this one active piece resulted in seat epic introducing the number of cholera cases in the country's largest outbreak since 1982 there's a movement stirring positive change here and it wasn't until I met the man leading the charge wisdom auto that I understood why you have to educate them you need to empower they need to give them the skills then they would transform their lives and the lives of others with very little resources wisdom has instilled hope in Ghana's youth the day I arrived in Accra I went with him to visit an average school and Ghana where he's been recruiting young volunteers to join peace gym and with the idea of making their city better through peach jam the kids embodied all the energy and excitement in the world the following day wisdom had organized the first ever p slam event in Ghana a one-day conference of 200 youth and educators and since travels often such a great expense for charities I use my miles to fly to peach jam employees to Accra which save them thousands of dollars that they put to good use in the ground and as soon as I walked in the door the kids had me smiling ear to ear we started off with shared games and dances and oh do they love singing in the rain that activity got them ready for family groups with PCM educators the hard-working heavy lifters of peach jam who have dedicated their lives to disseminating the Nobel laureates messages of peace and tools of non-violent action to the next generation of Ghana's youth this gem is giving these kids a safe space to learn in a way that is very foreign in Ghana to learn by taking actions by critical thinking by doing activities that are hands-on feel like before they could tell you stuff that was wrong but they didn't feel that hey we as a group can make our own lives better now they're starting to do we then broke into various groups to do projects surrounding sanitation since the issue was so prevalent in Accra and with that clean the streets and rallied for better sanitation then I learned how peace jammers celebrate starting with a wrap and then I was asked to share my story with the group and hand it out the billion acts of Peace Award this a group of teens in Ghana took it upon themselves to help stop the cholera outbreak and to educate the community is noted globally just stand up the different moral balls I knew I needed to do something great for these kids the most selfless inspiring people I've ever met so I made an announcement then I'm going to return next year and bring a full two day peach jam event with Nobel laureate lame a Bowie and the response was astounding and just when I thought I couldn't love these kids anymore they prepared a familiar tune to thank me peace Jim is making a difference in 2016 is the year you can too let's do this

(lively music) - We're currently in
Singapore at the unveiling of the new Singapore airlines A380 cabins including a new suites product, business class, and even in economy there's
some new improvements, so I'm super excited. (lively music) Brian Kelly, The Points Guy. Are you limiting Kris Flyer redemptions on these new routes? And then when could we
expect to see the new A380 to the United States? You might be able to tell but we're not actually on an airplane right now, but that's not going to
stop us from seeing the brand new suites and
business class products. We're also going to get to play around for the first time ever, you might see me in economy, and also see all of the dining and other elements of
all these new cabins. It's the closest thing
you'll get to an A380 inside the convention
center here in Singapore. This leg room looks amazing. I don't even mind the middle seat. This is great. Sorry about my, sorry seatmates, sorry. Can you imagine sitting next to, if I was in the middle? That's actually not too bad. I could do this from
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. So there's this myth out there
that I don't fly economy, that is absolutely not true. I will fly economy when it makes sense. Like recently I flew
Havana to Fort Lauderdale, a whopping 31 minutes in the sky. But I do fly coach, especially if you count
seaplanes and Maldives, because that's technically coach right? No I'm literally just too tall. Let's go check out the actual, the seat behind me. (lively music) I could do this, I fit. Maybe not. It's just as comfortable. So short people always tell me that these are really important. I've never had an issue with my feet landing on the ground. Wake me up in Singapore. This is a nice screen though. I'd like a glass of Dom please. - That fits a small laptop or your tablet. - Ahh. A380, my favorite plane in the sky. I'm happy that companies like Singapore and Emirates have reinvested in the A380 because it is amazing for passengers. It's just a really unique experience and I guess because I'm
a super large person I have this special affinity for the A380. Thank you. My sleigh. Ahh. I like this, I mean if
this is real to size. It's much better than
the current. (laughs) I'm a side sleeper so this is. It was comfortable. Just like the 350 where it's so much more. Ooh, sorry. Alright so this is the angle here. The bulkheads are much longer. That's tighter than the 350 cubbyhole from last night for sure. It's so tight, I can't
put them straight up. Oh, so it came down, oh there we go. So it came down a little bit. - Yeah it goes down. - It drops like a half an inch. So it's tight but you know, for most people not six foot seven it requires a little bit of negotiating. But the bulkhead is by far the
much, much, much better seat. Singapore suites even make you smarter. Ahh. Alright moment of truth, I fit! Yay! All six foot seven. It's always touch or go whether I'm going to fit in a new seat and
this one I fit perfectly! It was made for TPG. (lively music) 
so chicken here our guide on the ground introduced us to chica co to help teach us a little bit about manners and to even teach me the proper way to bow which is very important so typical thank you for for doing this with us so how do you properly bow personal I contact in personal space I can go Nicci wah so breathe bow one moment come up let's try that again konichiwa there's three types of vowels okay so this okay and then I'm sorry I'm sorry about I'll do this a lot with Japanese manners is there a difference between on the ground and on an airplane because I know you trained the AAA flight attendants it's the same the distance yep Oh yep this so always at the eyeline so I contact this big so that's something that I've learned here yeah this is incredible what will six work yeah the last meal always the fields not picky another piece it's very good are you out though 
Vietnam cities are fast pace and full of
life but one of the places I was most excited to explore was scenic Ha Long Bay. This is TPGtv Ha Long Bay is one of the wonders of the
natural world and has been a UNESCO world heritage site since 1994 It's peaceful waters are dotted with
floating villages and nearly 2,000 towering limestone islands. Ha Long Bay is several hours from Hanoi, but the easiest way is via seaplane So I booked a one way ticket on Hai Au Aviation landing directly in Ha Long Bay. I booked an overnight night package that included a suite and transfers to and from the airport directly from a luxury junk company called Indochina Sails. My suite had a spacious bedroom with
floor-to-ceiling windows and a full bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub and a shower
big enough for me Well, almost. My favorite part for sure
was the private balcony After lunch we set sail for the Cua Van
Floating fishing village. Each island we passed seemed more beautiful than the last. And some had some rather colorful names like the finger, incense burner island and
fighting cock. For the afternoon excursion, I took a cruise on a small bamboo sampan rowed by one of the villagers After a long but beautiful day on the water, it was time to unwind over a quiet
dinner. My time in Ha Long Bay was short, but unforgettable, and though I had a little mishap on the makeshift doc I didn't let that slow me down because
our next stop was Saigon. On the next TPGtv I check into the Park Hyatt Saigon, bargain Binh Tay Market and even take a turn on the stage
at the Cong Nhan Theatre. 
as the points guy I've been earning and redeeming points for over 20 years starting in the 90s with my dad as a hobby I've seen some amazing deals come and go and I have over 25 credit cards but I have never been more excited about a credit card launch than the Chase Sapphire Reserve when I first heard the official details I thought it was too good to be true when I evaluate a credit card I look at three main things the signup bonus for initial value and then points and perks for ongoing value and to be honest the Chase Sapphire Reserve blows me away on all three fronts let's start with the signup bonus it's a hundred thousand valuable chase Ultimate Rewards points after spending four thousand dollars within three months I value Chase Ultimate Rewards points at about two point one cents apiece because you can transfer them to eleven different partners like United and Hyatt to get more value than the one point five cents apiece that you'll get by redeeming through the chase Ultimate Rewards portal even at one point five cents per point through the Ultimate Rewards portal that hundred thousand points signup bonus is worth fifteen hundred dollars in travel so that means with the signup bonus you could fly JetBlue min for $1,200 round-trip New York to LA and still have points left over now onto the ongoing value proposition you earn three points per dollar on all travel and dining worldwide travel doesn't just include all airlines hotels rental cars and cruises it also includes campgrounds parking tolls and even Airbnb and uber and when it comes time to redeem those points you've got 11 different valuable transfer partners like I recently used 80,000 points transferred to United instantly at a one-to-one ratio to fly from Oakland to San Francisco to Los Angeles in business class on their 787 and the fees when using United are very low I spent just $41 to pay for that award you can also use Chase Ultimate Rewards points to apply some of the best first-class products in the world and at an amazing value I recently flew Singapore Airlines from Los Angeles to Tokyo on their a380 in Suites class for seventy four thousand three hundred seventy five miles in just twenty three dollars in taxes and fees Singapore is a one-to-one transfer partners of ultimate rewards if economy or family travels your thing you can transfer instantly to Southwest Airlines or British Airways which is amazing for short-haul Awards it's just 15,000 British Airways Avios round-trip New York to Miami so with the signup bonus and spend alone you can get nearly seven round-trip flights considering New York Miami round trips can be over four hundred dollars that can get you incredible value while flying an economy and while the card has a $450 annual fee the perks alone can easily pay for that many times over off the bat you get $300 in travel rebated each year automatically off your bill so really the annual fee is $150 in my eyes you also get Priority Pass select which gives access to over 900 lounges around the world the card also comes with $100 Global Entry credit every five years and it's a visa infinite product which gives enhanced travel protections when traveling and to top it all off the card has no foreign transaction fees so you can use it globally and avoid those bogus fees that so many credit cards charge just for using your card abroad so who can get approved for the Chase Sapphire Reserve we asked Chase directly and they said simply that each application is reviewed for its own merits however since it's a Visa Infinite product the threshold is a little bit higher than Sapphire Preferred you need to be able to get approved for at least a ten thousand dollar credit line now if you already have the Sapphire Preferred or other chase cards you can be eligible for the signup bonus but you have to apply as a new cardholder if you call to upgrade your account you will forego the hundred thousand Point signup bonus so it's worth a shot to apply and see if you're eligible because that hundred thousand points on a bonus is just so valuable whether you get the Sapphire Reserve or not it's great for consumers because it ups the competition with all of the other card holders I love that Chase is coming out swinging here adding tons of valuable points and perks to this card and no matter what I think it's going to push other issuers to up their game so today's a little bit bittersweet because I'm excited to get my reserve card although the Chase Sapphire Preferred has been my trusty travel partner over the last five years the reserve is a much better option for me because I travel and spend so much on dining every year just on the points earning a loan I'll receive thousands more in value a year by getting the Chase Sapphire reserve got any questions comment below on this post or tweet snapchat or follow us on Facebook at the point sky 
my favorite airline is Delta or American I'd rather carry on but unfortunately I always overpack so check my chase debit card an American Express I don't leave home without it generally hotels put a little fruit in my room they may do it for everyone but I always kind of feel like they're doing it for me Club Ritz Carlton's everywhere i also like four seasons I like nice hotel guide rather sit in the window because I like to look outside make sure everything's okay and I like something to lean against when i'm napping I'd rather have a day flight because I always feel like hell after the red-eye

gifts, I'm giving a big one to one lucky winner of
this Prizeo campaign. I'm gonna fly you and a guest to New York and we're gonna plan the trip
of a lifetime using my points. I'm gonna be giving away 500,000 of my own Amex and Chase points. I'll book them for you and

today has been an awesome I've been looking forward to this day since I hooked it since March and to be honest I didn't do a ton of research in advance because I wanted to be surprised and the Etsy hunt residents experience it's like nothing no one else offers it's not a matter of what champagne do they sir I mean bedroom somewhere over the Atlantic right now in a bathrobe because I just took a shower in my own shower that no one else on this plane of five hundred some people will ever use and the floor was heated so I didn't have to wear flip-flops because it wasn't dirty I have my own living room my own Butler Aaron it's not like what do you want mr. Kelly it's I know what you want and I'm gonna do it for you this chef Enrico from Italy made a turkey dinner for me we had a wine tasting in our own lounge everything about this experience is like nothing else there's no other better way to fly commercial 
Amazing food, fascinating culture, and
spectacular landscapes Vietnam has been at the top of my must visit list for a
few years now to get there I wanted to fly the country's flag carrier Vietnam
Airlines and arrive in style aboard its phone new Airbus A350 from Paris to
Hanoi this is TPGtv Getting from London to Paris is a
breeze on the Eurostar train you can even redeem British Airways Avios for
tickets. If you pay with the Barclaycard arrival plus or Capital One venture
cards can also redeem your miles for the purchases. I use my Sapphire Preferred
to earn two ultimate rewards points per dollar my business premier ticket
included a fast-track check-in use of the business class lounge with free
wi-fi and gourmet three-course meal Vietnam Airlines is a member of the
SkyTeam Alliance so you can use Delta SkyMiles or Air France KLM Flying Blue
Miles to Book Awards on it both programs are transfer partners of
American Express Membership Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest and Flying Blue
is also a transfer partner of Citi ThankYou rewards unfortunately there
were no awards on the day I wanted to travel so I paid $1,756 for the one-way flight, and credited my miles to my Delta account which gave me a bonus for
booking business class. Normally I would have paid for my ticket with my American
Express Premier Rewards Gold Card which Earns 3 points per dollar on airfare
however Vietnam airlines does not accept American Express so I used my Chase Sapphire Preferred instead &amp; earned a total of 3,512 Ultimate Rewards Points as a business
class passenger I had access to a Sky Priority check-in desk. Security took quite a
while so I headed straight to the gate so I could be among the first to board
and I even snuck in a little shut-eye Though the plane itself is new Vietnam's
business class is middle of the road with 29 staggered aisle and window seats, the seats might feel a little cramped if you're tall or have broad shoulders but
overall I'd say they're fairly comfortable if nothing new. I did like
the 15 inch high definition in-flight entertainment screens and Charriol
amenity kits All I wanted was to get a good rest on my flight but I needed to sample the airlines food and
wine, after a glass of Piper Heidsieck Monopole champagne lunch service began with the terrine of foie gras with fig-apricot chutney as a starter I had creamy corn soup and smoked fish with spicy shrimp and a vegetable salad for my main I had stir fried beef and shiitake mushroom with steamed rice and
vegetables then came a cheese course with fresh fruit before a final dessert
of Petit-fours and pistachio-Praline ice cream after the meal I promptly fell asleep waking up just a short time before our descent into Hanoi for breakfast I opted for the five
flavored beef with udon noodles and Chinese cabbage along with coffee juice yogurt &amp;
pastries. By the time we began our descent into the Hanoi I was well rested, full, and ready to explore the city. On the next TPGtv I arrive in Hanoi to a symphony of honking cars and swerving scooters and infiltrate the nightlife with some new friends 
sapphire Reserve packaging and then I assume there's a card inside so we're gonna take a lock down now open it up so we got more cheese sapphires are branding up here and then here's the card so I actually brought my cheese Sapphire Preferred card so we can do a little side by side they look very very similar so far obviously the coloring is a little bit different but we'll see what the materials like in a second we lift it up with this little ribbon thing here set this down and then it looks like just pop it out so here it is this is the sapphire Reserve Card Visa Infinite logo seems like the same weight very comparable oh there we go cover ball very similar material sapphire Reserve right there and pop it back in and then let's see what else is in the box so we've got a brochure I imagine this has yet some of the benefits we saw a PDF of this so it looks like all the benefits are listed here you can see the full breakdown on the site and then we have a Q&amp;A that goes through each of the perks that the card offers quite remember agreement see what your interest rate is you can see some of the details on the perks I opened it with a ten thousand dollar credit limit by moving some credit around from different cards but you need to have at least $10,000 for a Visa Infinite card and then I don't know what this is just a little intro letter so that's about it I'm gonna use it for the very first time at a restaurant today we're at Adrienne's in Surya on stone Street in New York and I'm gonna get 9 3 X points on dining so here it is the Chase Sapphire Reserve card 
well travelers are crowding the sky this holiday season the air transportation Association is predicting 45 million customers gonna be flying during a 19 day period from just before Christmas to right after New Year's Day join us now to tell us the best and cheapest ways to get around during the holidays the points guy Brian Kelly I think is gonna need some I mean that's not fair and then they got a plate Aloha State that's and you're not the Brian Kelly of not that bright color that's money there totally if I have interviewed with him before but yeah so we've talked Anders not here Andrew is a genius with frequent flyer miles and what we finally decided you are two values proximately a plenty of my own is that about what you should get for as a baseline you should be getting at least one cent per mile now when you think about getting credit card points you should be getting actually two cents per mile because they're cash back cards it'll give you two percent back right all right so I would rather take two cash pennies and trying to get one penny in the value of airfare you know what it means so put it all depends because you can earn miles for everything these days the only thing they're valuable for going getting in the front of the plane somehow which is but other people use it to actually fly right actually get the ticket but you know a lot of airlines these days limit the upgrade space make you buy the full fare refundable economy ticket and then make you wait so if you imagine paying triple the price of a coach ticket and waiting get the upgrade and it doesn't come through and then you're sitting in coach and paying three times the price miles what's happening though with those business class upgrades airlines are selling business class seats you know airlines have invested billions into the product people are paying for it so they're not releasing as much instant upgrade space so back in the day especially during the recession it was easy to snag those cheap upgrades it's a lot harder know you've got a lot of things that people should probably do it what's this thing you can get in case you don't have like elite status or something there's something you can do so that you don't get like if you get canceled or you can you could have a right thrown out what should it you gotta have a you know having an airline credit card if you fly certain airline can easily save you you know the annual fees are usually under 100 bucks that the fees that the airlines are charging these days okay you know you use that those airline perks once it can easily pay for this to do that yeah and even the lounge access now you know airline lounges aren't all that glamorous in the US but if your flight gets well those agents at the lounge are generally the most you know seasoned agents they can rebook you you know so instead of waiting in an hour long line to get rebooked go head straight to the lounge and even if you don't have access paying fifty bucks to get in and see but so if it's a bad weather day exactly pay the 50 bucks and save hours of your time by getting read book before those you know last few seats are given other people yeah I mean you know the TSA PreCheck is a godsend for frequent travelers you can buzz through I usually get thrown under three minutes keep your shoes on but if you apply for Global Entry which is a government program that helps you also get through when you come into the country it includes TSA PreCheck and and it's a hundred bucks a ton of credit cards out there will actually rebate you like the Amex Platinum so it's all about knowing the perks a lot of credit cards have these amazing perks but you just need to know how to maximize them does anybody make this all together and make a hub of like all your affiliations and all the reward points everywhere there's a lot out there minute the points come we teach people every day how to maximize we cover all there but at the end of the day you need to be your own advocate you know you need to know what the credit card perks are and you know these are the programs are changing that all the airlines are now changing towards revenue base you know where instead of how far you fly it's about how much you say it's a mile is it a mile anymore there's there's miles that you can just generally accumulate and then the miles that matter for you to achieve it so much more control exactly and you know United in Delta and now have revenue requirements not just being a frequent flyer you have to be a frequent offender yeah American distance are not going to quite take that route but American is switching towards the revenue base in the redeemable miles so for somebody who is an incredibly frequent flyer I this is gonna sound awful but I wish they were more judicious about who gets into the TSA Express lines I've seen the elite line actually look longer than the regular everybody's amazing when it runs crack then when you put people have no idea and they're taking their shoes and your hair out and it's you know to an extent of you know elite travelers a lot of elite travelers haven't really earned it right so to kind of call the elite ranks for those actual you know tried and true travelers may not be a bad thing we spent a lot of time investing sometimes money because it can be expensive it was very expensive at first to get Global Entry and then you get there and you've built in an expectation about how much time is config to get there for LaGuardia I mean they don't even manage who goes in there chuckling but you know they're alleging that they're gonna get better with really me 
- chicky this is my third time in Tokyo but I'm not good with geography so where are we right now in terms of Tokyo are we in the center we see Mount Fuji you have to come in the morning this email shake shake it out has the artist been in yet is he here right now I don't know if it's the jet lag but I completely mesmerized by this 360-degree view of Tokyo good assortment you got here the pineapple shirt is my favorite actually this only has room for 16 credit cards is nothing what are some of the things you would look for not it should be let me guess I would say this one I'm going to eat you two amazing set menu for 40 bucks my favorite is eel this I've been waiting for all morning long that's a boy there's this one on the right have some more yeah sure CD than a that's much how many wash your left hand water like this like this Danny what about to wash that tool just a little bit just a little bit and Thank You mo 200 today the nation he's twice you know how to graph okay there is a change I want to come to Japan every April 
The three major Middle Eastern carriers
have really shaken up the airline industry lately with new routes, new planes, and
some of the most over the top premium cabins. Emirates first class has long been
the gold standard for opulence at 4k feet they set the bar high with private
suites two inflight showers, and an a la carte menu that rivals any other carrier in the world. Luckily you don't need to be a
billionaire to fly Emirates first-class you just need to be smart about your miles
and points. I've flown Emirates first class numerous times, but for this flight I'm bringing you with me. This is TPGtv Because Emirates has several
airline partners flyers have a few ways to redeem points &amp; miles for award flights on the airline to book my first class flight from Dubai to New York JFK I redeem
90,000 Alaska Airlines miles and paid just $58 in taxes and fees. However Alaska has since raised the redemption to 150,000 miles each way so it's not nearly as good of an option. You can also transfer American Express Membership Rewards points
directly to Emirates skywards program with this fight will cost $136,250 
miles, and $463 in taxes &amp; fees the best option is transferring Starwood Preferred Guest points to Japan Airlines they've got a
distance-based onboard chart that is quite frankly amazing an award from Dubai the
New York requires a 100K JAL miles which is 80K Starwood points since you get a 5K mile bonus for 20K points transferred unlike most airports Dubai is buzzing at 5AM the desert heat makes midday departures a challenge so the airport schedules early in the morning or
after midnight First class Emirates  passengers are granted access to the first class lounge. If you're not flying first class you need be a Skyward platinum elite to gain access or flying Qantas first class. A game room, an a la carte sushi
restaurant, a spa, a wine store as the saying goes I felt like a kid in a candy shop. with sixty minutes to kill I booked a spa appointment. What more could one need before enjoying fine caviar on a long flight home But first a quick stop by the game room ok, time's a' ticking and I'm hungry. good news; there's 3 options here. A sushi bar, a buffet and a sit down restaurant. 45 in the morning And after a shoe shine I was ready for my first class flight I only spent $58 out of pocket for a $7,900 flight So what exactly do you get in first class on an Emirates A380 And the meal, was next level Emirates allows you to order a la carte since so many passengers are criss crossing time zones you can eat breakfast for dinner, and dinner for breakfast ard for dinner with the airline
signature Iranian caviar course along with all the fixings and a choice of two
vodkas Grey Goose and Russian Standard from there I opted for the sweet potato
and celeriac soup and a seasonal salad with a nice glass of French sancerre.
For my main I chose the seafood, lobster prawns, and scallops in a creamy
Britain's sauce with mustard mashed potatoes paired with the delicious pino noir. Of course I couldn't skip dessert. So I chose the lemon cheesecake. one of my favorite things about Emirates
first class are their amenity kits The airline has partnered with luxury
Italian Bulgari and offers passengers beautiful leather kits. Packed with rose lotion after shave and perfume it also contains all the
essentials like shaving and dental kits basically everything you need to keep you feeling fresh on a long flight. In addition to the amenity kit the flight
attendants also hand out swanky pajamas and slippers. I mean there has to be some kind of club for taking a shower 7.5 miles in the sky After I shut the door to my private
suite I was able to enjoy a little entertainment before going back to sleep. But all good things must come to an end. Before I knew it we were back in New York On the next TPGtv I head to Costa Rica for some fun in the sun And you might be surprised that I flew coach to get there.

about five years now since ritz-carlton award launch right what are some of the key findings that you found with launching Ritz Carlton Awards there anything surprising that you saw behavior wise of the Ritz engagement or anything like that you know we're seeing here this weekend with the event the number of people who are repeat visitors that they compete to make sure they get into this event year after year like the hottest in it it is and ribbing it yeah and and they love the fact that they do feel like they're family and it's not only the recognition between our ladies and gentlemen and the staff and those guests but also between the members themselves like what are the key differences of being a member of Marriott versus ribs well there are benefits different benefits in terms and conditions of the program right there in a ritz-carlton Platinum premiere has access to benefits things like lounge access and certain properties and just some of the some of the points earnings process so promotions are also different targeted towards ribs as well right that's correct looking at the Ritz program because we're at a Ritz what is what's one aspect of the program that you think is underutilized by members ironically the credit card probably you know when you look at the footprint of our overall Vetrov Rewards membership base and those that hold the card there's a lot of people missing out on airfare deals on the club lounge access or itself I mean if you say tourists once a year it's a biggest hotel story of 2015 and will be 2016 it's the acquisition of Starwood right can you just tell us where are we in the process now both shareholders have agreed regulatory wise what are the next steps in that we're at a stage where the teams are working together to look at how we would mesh the businesses and where the where the interaction points are and as Arnie said himself in a video we posted the LinkedIn shortly following the announcement we are absolutely dedicated to bringing together the best of both programs and more so so what would you say to a nervous start with platinum that's worried they don't be nervous nothing to be nervous about as a matter of fact we're looking at having a couple of different forums one for influencing the industry such as yourself and others who are gonna help us define what the future of loyalty should look like one of the new benefits we stood up was an easier sharing process between members if we're a hyper frequent traveler sometimes I don't want to travel more and so having the outlets like this event that came and cookout you know Anthony Bourdain on a Friday night serving me a burger and being able to actually talk to him and share that I'm so right I would just say and obviously you know you see it with the happiness and engagement level is to continue expanding and exploring those programs because uh you know priceless sort of experiences are I think we prefer the term rewarding rewarding but I really appreciate it Brian it's been a pleasure thank you so much advice on that on that merge program counting on it from UUM we will you you 
Ever since I was a kid I loved animals and trekking with gorillas in Rwanda has
been high on my travel bucket list. Getting there isn't easy but once you do, it all seems worth it. This is TPGtv There are no nonstop flights from Accra
to Kigali and the quickest is Kenya Airways via Nairobi A skycam carrier which is part of the Flying Blue frequent flyer program. Flying Blue is a one-to-one transfer partner of AMX Membership Rewards and Citi thank you. You can also book Kenya awards using Delta SkyMiles but you typically have to call. Because of traffic delays leaving Accra we didn't land in Kigali until after midnight and it was here we met our local guide Pierre. So then I decided to let loose a bit which immediately led to a solid
four-hour nap in the car. Which was perfect because just as the sun rose we arrived at knows Volcanoes National Park. Arguably the best destination for
gorilla trekking, period. First off gorilla trekking is not cheap. For foreigners it's $750 per person for a permit and only 80 permits are handed out per day so book as far in advance as possible. It's an intimate experience too, since only eight people are allowed per trekking group while this is expensive the money goes
directly towards conservation and 24 hour a day guards for each gorilla family
to prevent poaching. Rwandans take pride in the gorillas so don't expect this to be a tourist spectacle. Before we started our trek we met our guide Patients at the base camp. Patience is a man who knows so much about gorillas he claims to even speak their language. for roughly two decades Patients has
spent almost every day studying mountain gorillas in their natural habitat after a quick safety course we were briefed on the rules of the treck including how to
behave around the gorillas, we drove to the base of the mountain and started our uphill trek in an epic bamboo forest. we were assigned to visit the biggest
gorilla family in the park; Sosa A which has 28 members including three
silverback males. The catch however is that they're also the hardest to get to luckily we had a big team to help us. luckily these guns are not for gorillas they're actually for other animals
like wild buffalo which you may encounter along the way. gorilla trekking is generally safe as long as you play by the rules and listen to your guides but at the end of the day these are wild animals so there is always a level of
risk involved and on my trek, it wasn't animals that attacked me. it was a nasty little plant known as stinging nettle. Even fully clothed stinging nettle knows no bounds. Brian: All for the gorillas This wasn't just a prick this was a
nauseating experience not unlike the time I was scuba diving and was engulfed
by man-of-war jellyfish oh the things us travelers will do for a good story. But the pain quickly faded once I caught my first glimpse of the Sosa A family. a mother and her irresistibly cute baby. Since you only have one hour to spend with the family we moved on to
another location and that's where I caught my first glimpse of a massive silverback
gorilla according to Patients gorillas here sleep 12 hours a day drink 17 liters of water and have fifteen times the strength of the human body builder. So after taking this all in we spent the remainder of our hour looking at as many of the Sosa A family members as we could, and while I had some nerves in the beginning it actually wasn't scary at all. And in the end this was more than just crossing something off my travel bucket list. It was about connectedness. If anything I felt like I was a part but the Sosa A family, but maybe with better teeth. On the next TPGtv I learned just how much he Kigali Rwanda
has changed since the genocide 21 years ago and it's remarkable.
