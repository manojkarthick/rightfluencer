A balanced physique won’t just happen without planning  there needs to be structure in your routine that targets every muscle group effectively. At some points some muscle groups may need more attention  your training program will need to facilitate that. 

My number 1 tip for improving the progress of your physique  is learning your anatomy  becoming well versed in which exercises target each head of every muscle you train. This will help you to restructure your routines to ensure every muscle is efficiently trained.

Have you ever been so broke and down in the dirt you cried? I have. A good few years back I found myself in a position with no job  very little to no cash  wondering where it all went wrong. It was a horrible time for me that brings back emotions every time I think back. 

This picture as funny as it may look  is just one example of me in my element  doing something that whenever I was down  made me feel alive  gave me purpose and a feeling of accomplishment. I really don’t mean to sound melodramatic  but for some of us it’s more than just lifting weights. 

You can call us what you like  ‘meatheads’ etc  you can assume we are all dumb  hyper masculine  egocentric buffoons  but honestly for some of us  in a world full of stress  lifting just keeps us happy  keeps us sane  allows us to be good at and progress with something we can control.

Visit sp-aesthetics.com. 170lbs (77kg) x 4. It won’t make sense to all of you  why I bother going for heavy weight like this all time. I’ve trained for 17yrs so far and I aim for 7 days a week  so that’s almost every day for over half my life. If you think I could keep that type of consistency  without keeping my self challenged and entertained with stuff like this  then you’d be wrong. 

If I didn’t go for weights like this and always push myself  always try to improve my strength  then training would have become very monotonous and boring a long time ago. 

It is a personal proclivity I have  to conquer ‘the last dumbbell’ of the gym I train at. It’s like a long term goal that keeps the progression flowing from one facility to the next. Whether it is attainable isn’t really relevant  I enjoy the never ending journey.. Stiff-legged deadlifts with the 150lbs dumbbells. Read below ⤵️ Don’t keep it to yourself Tag & share 🤜🏾🤛🏼

📝 With all the spotlight on quads & squats (and rightly so!)  hamstrings can often be an after thought and tend to be neglected; lets be real  you can’t exactly see them when you look in a mirror 🤷🏾‍♂️

However they are incredibly important  and  contribute to your strength in exercises like the squat or leg press. If time permits  it’s a good idea to separate your hamstrings workout from your quads workout  this allows you to put greater energy into each workout  and train the muscle group optimally.

If you’ve seen me squat  you know I like to go deep (ATG all day 🙌🏾)  the deeper you go the more hamstring muscle fibres you recruit  so for me hamstrings strength is important. 

Don’t skip hamstrings day!. Late night legs session today  ready for a new week 👊🏾. Get the new Dedicated Nutrition water bottle for FREE when you purchase supplements from SIMEONPANDA.COM. Great arms session today with Adrien Laurent at Barbell Brigade we hit some heavy 90lb hammer curls 😳

Hit those triceps with Close Grip Bench Press using the EZ bar. Don’t keep it to yourself  tag & share 🤜🏾🤛🏼 The EZ puts your wrists in a much more comfortable position for Close Grip Bench Press than a regular Barbell  Just Lift. Elbow Wraps offer support for the elbows  the compression can help with tennis elbow  tendinitis etc  making heavy pressing more comfortable. Get yours at simeonpanda.com. Jason Derulo and I on set 5 of the 8 sets we did  before moving on to some heavy leg press and lunges. 😅 I didn’t anticipate we’d be hitting legs  hence why I was wearing cargo trousers and Air Force ones  not my shorts and squat shoes as I usually would. The trousers split right open on the next set 😄. Powerful legs session today with Jason Derulo and his boys  sets on sets.

Video by @jakecotreau. CHEST DAY MOTIVATION - Those 165lbs/75kg dumbbells 😅 When the dumbbells got this heavy  I used to not only get them passed to me  but I’d get the first rep assisted too. Anyone who’s had extremely heavy dumbbells passed  knows it can be a very tricky affair and sometimes disastrous lol. I done away with all that a while ago  and decided that it would all be my effort only  from getting the dumbbells on to my knees to pressing the first rep. Sure a spot could probably help me squeeze an extra rep or two  but personally I don’t really want it. The thing is  a spot can not only vary person to person  but also set to set  I need consistency! If I pressed 5 today on my own  I can take that number without any ambiguity about my effort  no need for ‘how much did you help’ with the the typical ego stroking response ‘all you Bro 😉’ sure it was 🙄 lol..

Coming very soon to our channels  make sure you are subscribed 👆. Who’s had a great day today 🙋🏾‍♂️Gym 🏋🏾‍♂️ in the am  cycling 🚴🏾‍♂️ & basketball 🏀 in the afternoon 👌🏾. You honestly cannot expect to build a well proportioned physique  without planning  and following a structured routine. There should be no stone unturned  no omitted muscle groups because  ‘I just don’t like training them ’ every head of every muscle should have a specific exercise that works it effectively. With shoulders for example  after hitting your compounds (military press  dumbbell press etc)  I highly recommend you target all 3 heads of your deltoids (anterior  middle and posterior) with isolation exercises (lateral raises  front raises  reverse pec dec etc) you will also need an exercise to effectively work your traps (shrugs for example). If your intention is to build great balanced physique  this is the level of planning and precision you should aspire to for your routines. 

In my Mass Gain Extreme Training Guide  i have written the routines I follow that helped me to build my physique  I still have areas to improve  but that is the fun of the journey.

ℹ️ Both methods actually work both the triceps and chest  however changing the angle will determine which muscle group work harder to perform the exercise. These 170lbs (77kg) dumbbells felt like they weighed a tonne today 😳 4th rep said ‘not today mate’ 😄. If you could train me and my bro Ulisses what would we hit? (Tag your people) 
We never did find what was on the floor 😂

#simeonpanda #ulissesworld. I don’t know about you  but I left the expo on a high after meeting with you all  there was a great energy at TheFitExpo this year. Now living in LA  with just a 15-20 min commute downtown to the LA Convention Centre for the expo  as you can imagine it was a lot less stressful than previous years. 
It was the 5th time attending the LA Fit Expo and 3rd year consecutively exhibiting my brands  I can honestly say it was the best one thus far.

[Music] today I'm a fit one Magdeburg tomorrow and once again I came from LA and it was a long flight I missed two training sessions and I need to catch up but I could start where I left off I could combine everything or I could just choose rhyolite why I plan to do is I'm going to combine everything I'm gonna hit legs then I know shoulders and then under here their arms [Music] by Oh [Music] it's often getting the song I love when I get in there don't mind let's go let's go let's go you just keep going [Music] [Music] [Music] lunges always gets away so even the legs that hurt looks like your heart beating and you just feel that most in your throat just pounding [Music] okay guys so I think I'm gonna leave that four legs we've done enough when they're gonna move because like I said I've got to squeeze everything in because I miss some days so you know for me personally when whenever I can miss a muscle group from traveling and just pick up on another day but when it comes to legs and squats like I can't miss them and I have to get that in regardless you know I was in Dubai two weeks ago and I literally woke up after traveling the next morning woke up like what time was it like 6:00 a.m. got dressed and went straight to go on hit squats and for the first time ever I think I was sweating on an empty stomach surprisingly I managed to pull it off and was still quite strong you know and still pulled off some good numbers you know but yeah I can't miss her legs day you know everything else you know here is here nor there but comments and legs they so we have got the squats in we've got some lunges in I'm now gonna it's actually arms day today so I'm gonna now hit a bit of arms please [Music] after doing after doing all those squats this just seems so easy and relaxed counsel [Music] [Music] yes and that is all folks about a great session what I've done obviously as I've mixed a match between legs and arms as I said to you guys before I really can't mister legs day it's just I need to hit legs every like like if I've missed a few muscle groups and legs as a part that legs is the one I'm concerned about so I'm glad that I managed to get my leg session in through in arms as well you know just one exercise with triceps and one exercise goodbye and yeah I feel good man I didn't get to hit shoulders I told you guys I missed two days what the two days I missed was Wednesday and Thursdays so that was legs to shoulders and today's Friday sorta days arms so I didn't actually hit shoulders but like my shoulders oh this man so yeah I feel good and that was good hope you guys learn something you know I always try and fall some tips in what I'm training you know just things I've learned over the years things that work for me you know things that I think can help others so I threw a few pointers in and yeah lots more videos coming please stay tuned subscribe peace out 
[Music] so I've just got back from my Sunday leg session the big one that I always talk about and I wanted to include this video this quick one shoes in my GoPro quickly I wanted to put this video to talk about failure so failing a rep and also to discuss spine when to use one when I use one etc so today with my big spots that I did worked up worked up the week to near max [Music] when Andrew gave me a spot and I've got three reps quite Hardware spot I felt I felt comfortable now I want to own that way and for me when you own a weight it means you do it without spot you can do like you can go as many many reps as you like with the spot until you can do it on your own completely you don't really own that weight that plate is not anything new to me you know I've done five plates many times before and with no squat but you know which works sometimes you got it and then sometimes it's just not there I've even though I've squared up to sixth place before you know so the five plate is always a challenge for me yeah you know I want to come home so after doing that successful set where I don't know the three reps with the spot I wanted to own it so I wanted to do it without the spot so obviously I still have a spot there just in case I mean if he can catch me at the black point where I'm just about to fail and then who can give me give me the RIP I haven't met so um I did it so this was maybe my sip set I felt well I dunno what happened now I do at the time wasn't too sure and as I came down but like I had it felt like I had it and fell through okay did I give up no I still want on that way and the the point of this video is to just discuss how failure can teach you things so I then sat down after that set I had a pork about what what what is the reason why I didn't get that wake up and it's not because I wasn't strong enough I know I can handle that way so it's something else you know it's this it's it's a timing issue is a confidence issue what is the issue because I did that sit without actually a game plan I just went and did it III didn't have anything to take back from it why I saw while i sat there I'm trying to analyze why I think I wouldn't have anything to take back because I just went and did the same you think about second time round of trying it without spot I purposely switched on to the teacher to analyze what I was doing as I was doing it so second attempt at do it at that spot I failed again it's at this time as I came down I was registering everything I was doing registering when I was activating just to come back up how I was feeling as I was as I was lowering myself down so I was registering everything so just in case I need to attempt it again I don't know what went wrong or even if I don't attempt to that same day you know I'll take that knowledge for another day so normally I'm sure you'll think okay you've failed twice on it now time to call it a day maybe lower the way but the reality is I know that that's my way I own that wait that's that's my way it's just something's not right something's not working so I sat down and I thought about it and I thought okay maybe the issue is that I need to be more control just completely controlled you know I've got my belt on nice and tight and I work for it again and this time our successful four three reps the the the first two I completely honest what didn't get involved and the last one I signaled him to get in there because I think it doesn't matter if I win so um what can I take from that video the fact that you learn from your mistakes you really do learn from your mistakes I took information from those failed sets and I used it to my benefit for for for the next set the other thing I want to discuss is when to lose a spot now you know I used to spot for for the big lips however I do feel that you need to at some point test your own strength completely on your own are you sure that you're safe so ensure that when you're lifting you're completely safe that means setting up the barriers or you could even have a spot there but a spot that has been instructed to only help you when it's necessary as in to save your life not to help you get that way I mean don't get me wrong I'm saying use a spot when you need to and you know you can have a few sets where the spot does assist you and help you get those lips however you should always I believe try and only set and do it completely on your own just just go for it make sure you're safe and go it's a quick once I think I wanted to share only way always try to sit on your own as long as it's safe and then just test your string you know and I'm trying to learn from your mistakes no can you please try and find registar clam really feel the muscle as you're as you're doing your north-north looking the big lips you know then you can analyze and figure out what's going wrong could be just a stroke you could be use to any by Frankie what sometimes it could just be that not you're not in the right position then you know firing at the back time the leg position could be a bit off it what you can squats off something else I don't know deadlifts so you know just try and register McMahons and understanding don't just give up I've got some good videos coming out some very good videos I've got work out with realities dropping very soon that we did at the villa nesting they drop very soon

[Music] I grew up in southeast London I used to I used to play sports and the regular things that people did used to come play football you know and you know basketballs involved in all the sports I wasn't really great at any of them I was good but I never stood out any of them apart from rugby and these times I was I was skinny but shredded so I thought I was big with my brother can that constantly telling me you're skinny you're skinny I decided to you know lift some ways what triggered it for me was going to college and there's one particular guy this guy he basically out of that muscular physique and I remember asking I had to get like he said you know I trained at home that same day I went to a local department store I went there and I just got some ceramic and ceramic weights took those weights and that same day I had my first session and it will sound cliche if I say but literally it was from that first session that I knew exciting I wanted to do the pump was amazing and in funny thing was I wanted to do it as often as I could and the funny thing is you know how you want to fill that pump all the time that's what I was just chasing so and I didn't realize that you know you train and then you need it for a day you come back another day now the way I was doing it was I'll train and then maybe we'll do something else come back train that is what I did date you know date and I loved it from from back then yeah it's running spring came down and said goodbye was getting bigger but that influenced me because it you know was the first time anyone had acknowledged what I was doing and and and before that it was just about just about the feeling you know this this feels great I love doing this because it feels great and that's the thing I tried to get through to people you can train throughout anything you know so you know when people say yeah I don't have time or you know like I can't fit it in with my school life I did it all you know I went to school and studied and worked and change it got to a point where things were really taking off for me so I made that jump and I left I left work and it's funny because it almost immediately and I left it just kicked off like that [Music] there's this belief that I have that you can you can have anything if you put put the work into it and it sounds so you know basic but that that I truly believe that that's what drives me daily because of what these these goals that I want I know I'm gonna make them I know I'm going to reach them 100% and it's just it's just stepping stones stepping stones so what motivates me is just that knowledge that you can work at something and make it happen it's a secret that people don't know you can do anything you want to if you want to do something just just just give everything believe in it that belief isn't just when things are going well I think it's even most important when things are going really going bad you can't forget what you're capable on and what you believe you can achieve I was down and didn't have a job and um you know in a pretty rubbish situation you know staying and I was on my brother's sofa you know and you know didn't have a job and was trying hard to get one and you know you can you can get down you can get so down and you might feel on your own as well like you know they know everyone has a luckily I had my brother you know but some people don't have anyone you know what happened was my brother basically one day when I was really feeling feeling down and he just only didn't say much but just makes he said to me please don't think that because this is your situation now that this is all it's going to be and it just gave me a boost you know so even though things weren't going well and there's nothing really on the horizon that just said okay just stay stay stay positive just stay positive because you can turn it around I did them an Xbox now the only thing that I remember from the whole Expo that stood out was the one guy who told me he watched that video when he was in roughly I think a worse situation than I was and he said that that that helped him he said he said he just held on to that I said before that you know he didn't know what he was gonna do but that just said to him keep going and that simple thing I'll keep going can do do wonders with people you know and then the coincidentally I didn't saw him I never Expo and his story was completely different you know he'd he'd he'd me at the time he didn't have a job I think he was I think he's actually homeless I think he told me was almost and now he was like I'm working for coming to the company and things have picked up and that just like that's bigger than anything that's bigger than any endorsement any business venture or anything that they're you know imagine changing someone's life like that that fuels me more than anything more than anything you know because I think we should all you know be wanting to help others that gives me life and that I like is like is me energy that just just knowing that and it definitely feels me because I know how I feel when I hear that you know I just like honey when I hear from that I finally I get my words out that's how passionate I get you know so it's something I'm gonna like continue to try and do no matter how successful or whatever happens always try and

here so much for having this bro don't see on the video the China thousand we are going for food little weird all I know is we're going somewhere where they put olives in the Bolognese seems really excited okay because our homemade polonaise it's really nice we put like just everything all nice lovely fresh vegetables and every time we go to a restaurant it's never quite up to our standard so yeah we're going to an Italian and I'm gonna have bread I'm gonna wine I'm gonna have whatever I won yeah with the Bolognese and the olives that she's talking about no joke when we make one of these at home it's the best best ever there's so much flavors this is olives they're sweet peppers this spinach sometimes mushrooms are are our bolognaise is the best you know so when we go to friggin restaurants and they give you basic Bolognese it just never tastes the same basic blend boiling eggs just doesn't cut and this restaurant we're going to now I tweet the per tweet out and I ask you know what good Italian mushrooms and where someone tweeted one I check the menu the Bolognese look good it had olives in it that just to me says that's going to it's not going to be basic so we'll see uneven if I'm going to get one of eggs but just seeing that this when I was probably going to be a decent Italian hopefully okay so I've only just discovered these blot films from Mac they are friggin amazing hmm like literally it doesn't touch my makeup I just blot and the oil comes off all right sim ones have a go you thinking get more oil than me it's available already just éé éé shit in a bit

thinking of one for the office as well bar sample that was a bit old TT so we left it cables okay so after the longest day ever super tired managed to get in and hit a back workout had to hit it solo because I'm super tired so she stayed at home and yeah start off with lat pull-downs always like start light like I always tell you guys so I started light worked my way up get to the heavy sets what I always say about the lat pull-downs is also make sure that you've got them controlled so you want them to want to put a bar just below your chin just below your chin some people get it wrong yeah some people put it some people get it wrong let me pull it down all the way down like as far as they can and that's not how you do the exercise the exercise is about putting it right down just below your chin and controlling it back up you know and yeah that's the other thing people forget you have to control the weight as it goes back up it's not just pulling it down and let it pull you up and your buttons coming off the seat it's got to just be control so yeah work my way up hit it nice and heavy and then I moved on to some seated rows seated walls again same principle kept the weight light initially high reps you know maybe starting over 20 maybe 15 on the next and then working my way to something heavy you know working to the stack got to the stack and you know did some some you know maybe six to eight reps and on the heaviest week with this exercise again get a full stretch and also don't let it pull you in too far what you do to let your back get a full full stretch on on this exercise so you can see there it's just nice controlled movements nice controlled movements actually really like that see it well because I'm really full your back working you know you've gotta be conscious of the bar that you choose as well some of them you know the distance between your hands makes a big difference on how well you have to be your back so this is another exercise that I do quite frequently you can actually do this one sitting on a bench or on your knees you need to get a map in between cables I like to do it right on my knees because I get a full stretch obviously you guys know I've got ridiculously long arms so I need to pull stretch so that's why I added this exercise along with lat pull-downs you know because it gives me a full stretch on my back go ahead after the longest day ever didn't think I was even gonna train but you know me man I had to get it in man even though I am like the most time I've ever been in a long long time man but yeah I had to get it in and I got it in shines at home sleeping I don't blame a man because it was hard but I'm gonna go eat now probably gonna just go I hope because it's open get some food and then I'm gonna go home well yeah it's been a great first day man try and tell you guys man it's like how can I put it there's like it takes dedication it really does take Ted occasion man because I'm telling you man I really did not want to go in and train today I mean I'm jet-lagged from the flight the day we've had we've just been on our feet roaming around driving around trying to find all these places and you know getting the documents and stuff you know opening up the bank account going together socially and all that stuff it's been draining it really has been draining and the fact that all our stuff like hasn't arrived yet you know so we've got empty apartment so we're literally ordering everything from scratch because we didn't bring anything you know we didn't bring like beds sofas TVs etc we didn't bring any of that so it's like we're gonna have to order it all so it's been a stressful day and I don't blame Shan for wanting to sleep you know cuz I was fine and my eyes are stinging me right now but I've got it in though I'll put it in you know and I always say to you guys man there's a there's there's something special about people that you know really want to succeed and that is they don't they don't they don't take no we all take tired tired isn't tired isn't an option you know it's just not an option you know so when they're feeling tired that's not an excuse to not do what what you have to do you know and that's how I feel today I was knackered I wanted to just I was on the laptop and I wanted to see that's it I just wanted to see something to shut the left up and see but I finished what I was doing and then without thinking I started putting my socks on don't think about it that's the pin I try and tell you guys you guys think about it too much you start thinking oh should I go or maybe I can put it off to tomorrow etc don't think about it just put your socks on put your shorts on put your trainers on gathered or get in there get it done [Music] 
you guys I'm a retroflex I got to smash shoulders with Martin Ford we've been chatting for a while are your chair for a while and you know I'm very excited about this session because I know you're going to be stay I'm going to be stiff and seventh recession man you know I do it and it kills it just good at it we have yeah the right those are the sets I enjoy their heavy sense that's what training for the other section are the warm-ups is just to get prepared for you know getting getting the joints lubricated ready for some heavy weight but that's what it's all about that's what that's why I get my enjoyment Solar that's an and I think that's where the strip games are made so that's why I try and stay hitting those kind of sits quite quickly so what we've done we've done I'll include the set before that which was the fifties 50 kgs but we did that for set we've done these this is about 64 set and well for two sets I'm going to go back to hit the 50s again so the stay in heaven or the stay in heavy again again that was me you know and that's why enjoyment and that's why from the strength things actually happen I mean I've been doing very much in train mode so I'll hit like two or three warm-up sets and then we go into real hard to hit for five repetitions on our own then maybe one or two rich slightly water not too much and then really focus on the negatives so it's nice to switch trainer and I've seen as man knows what remember me how different different styles which is ways like to collaborate sometimes of course I mean it's nice to watch our other people train for their games I'll never look like this ready I never like me we don't want to which is why wanted especially than just you can see and showed me Paul that it doesn't matter what when you start getting the gym and just express yourself the main thing is just to freaking kill your session so you know you can kill it how he kills a clear hierarchy but it's killing a session so everyone's going to have different rep ranges different set set ranges and just completely different styles but the main thing is intensity you're only going to grow with intensity no you can't go to the German just to you know regular training you had a good session and think that you're actually really going to get good games and grow from that it's fine to do if you know throwing that massive isn't your you know your your your little goal because it's like one goal to go just you know have a quick session you know get it this will be v you know but my goal I'm sure mines goal it still is to make progress right and only progress it's the friggin joy yeah come on des an act or dispersion opposite upstairs avoid several shoulders and most exercises our chests etc pressing exercises are adequate to at least you know I'm going to chest tailed and my flap of the main track we shoulders are able to a shoulder pressure down those or a miniature press in front of the neck and then on the woman I do another press I always get two presses in you know I feel that more on you more intensity try to do that we're about to do with us to a miniature personal behind the neck and those on traditional know people are going to do it but if done correctly and you know don't do it heavy do it to awake you can manage it's a pretty exercise so that's in mice not true believe who brings that that you know that that I hated are the things that I'm trying to do now access so it's brings back military blessings barbell curls anything that I hate that I'm doing in excess that the reason being I've trained in 15 years I've got my cuisine to work to a certain sort of quite doing probably stuff I enjoy yeah it's time to see what reaction my body has been I it's not bad you know that that should give me little some growth you know language obviously if my body's built how it is doing the stuff that I enjoy now there's exercises and it was good reason why people enjoy more good and I probably want stronger we have actually you still enjoy your own strong with OC versus exactly and there's only so good see in development now working on understood you're going to it how you buddy can change there maybe even shooting in back before exactly I mean obviously you know before we train for years years like you got to go spice up mmm you got smashed up I'm saying only like I feel so much different is that for 15-20 minutes and follow your routine and learning this wildlife guys the train don't like follow a little bit intuitive because you know your career of employees whose bit and and this can be seen by properly at least 10 people so I know they're really going to smash people in front of people at the same time if you're not challenging to push yourself how you lookin because I've been a better person whose issues that are below respect that's why I've grown our fights three hours down after filming the last three sheets notes oohing I want to do it not just for for people who are watching for myself to learn how the best teams you do it and you can you can appreciate that this is why you do it because he does things that people don't wanna do they all want to hurt themselves no one's pushing yourself hard and especially when you could do day in day out and then the pressure we hear it as follows why don't you go anymore when you look at this that's always in the back of here especially even especially with you I for me much more films now so I can have different shapes but wasn't at all I've always gonna have tattoos to invest to me yeah I can come in bigger smaller it doesn't matter touch but when you're such an icon like yourself always got to carry a certain shape but if a certain look and that's question stuff so it is about luckily for me I always say something um keeping the shape and stuff it's rocks I'm an arrogant that's the East Park yeah quite yeah diet is something I enjoyed so I'm never native Prairie of course I checked on that's like last night raining I was a skinny look dude yeah now I'm still a trip dude just a bit more myself so it's not a lot of saying earlier but these ways he's like that big and I think a lot of people don't understand people see that he photos a rig just don't comprehend how she warned you are in some heritage then enhancement have big shoulders look at any Oh those are like I keep saying no to sex I enjoy it also says that you know the globe happens so what we're going to do is I've done that now it's a hard set I'm Julia but couple of web sorry you can do it again do again have to do again when you just have to you have to push yourself man you know I'm going to get rid of the break and also finish have outbreaks people say how long to give yourself a million minutes that's all the weight of it I'm going to give myself as much great as I need to perform the set effectively that means whether it's a mineral two minutes I'm in servitude to the set there's no point in rushing back in without my recovery and not be enough to do it just a waste of my time and learning from it yourself aluminium get myself ready he's starting to have that little you know a little bit of a challenge where you know then you're not fully linked so like you know it's intense but I am I saw for cover for you know few if you want happening go and give it don't yet see if I can get you know a couple more reps on that way and then after that said then I take it way down and just work out bring the form back to to pretty near perfect and just get a few whips yeah we dad my son okay we're just coming upstairs now and he laterals done probably seven eight hardware he sets the tail so I chose a real full so I'd imagine we're going to get at least five sets here so start warming super confident and then probably the diversity are heavy again form is always important important and lectures a lot of people cheer way too much way and then to set the negatives drop if you're going to do heavy heavy reps you've got to make sure you take it down nice and slow and get a spot to help you don't just start swinging and wouldn't leave you'll get hurt and you're not gonna get much growth out anyway so I'm gonna watch sit back and see how a man does it and then I will probably copy and follow is these technique and routines as a few options where you can do my like to go heavy as I can for three or four reps and really floating a negative and then get the last couple assisted I'm not sure what we're going to do though is today we're doing 20 reps 10 sets so I look forward to this now the troopers are you know dude but we're doing them that raises but we're going to do a superset so when you smack 160 standing just a plate for behind guillotine range nice the temple that was mom hey Jess word before six fine yeah God come on squeeze squeeze up what what what Russian rifle now because then because that was a superset that's it you know Norman taking the high road in the Highborne was in the superset so we're not going to do that in six that was just reset back to that you saw the intent Simon saw you know this was a little work it's that done for there so I'm all going to do next no well that's murashova video I love you guys said I how comes you into anywhere else in that got me or happens literally fuck-ups the two possessions are not ways to send you know so if I don't do a specific front front Nick and anterior delt exercises today it doesn't mean I don't usually it's just what you can fit in the time you have allocated to train you know so today we did I hope you questions we get our lack reasons like that's our Delta breeze and kilt and we're here we hit two pressing movements show you know member two questions now's infidelity the middle which

flocks the difference phone antennas book is letting you go and fifteen years and the right to appreciate ways let's go and that's that's why we've got the resources dedication cumin and and that's that still was the amount of dedication you can this that has it knows where is that these ways keeps growing again trainer trainer means the most important thing that's expiry this is it's where I get my enjoyment and so that always comes first I'm sure you know you see me heavily involved in all this other stuff but just remember the training him first before you guys ever heard of my name in the industry I had ten years behind me of training you know I probably had my name introduced into the industry about 2012 you know I already had more than ten years training before that you know so the training is what I focus on and it's the fundamental is just the most important sure now go hit some baseballs get those rear delts in and then get some shrugs I've seen some pictures on mines in sir I've been shrugging so I think that's one of his good good points as well so we should have some fun action gah this ow and holy as much as possible I try to avoid using the straps in fact if I can do it with chalk I do it I used to use straps on things like deadlifts I don't anymore because you know I just tested out a test and out of chalk and I'm strong with chalk you know so as much the main thing to remember though is when you're doing something like a dignity the main thing you want to train is your back you know so if you need the straps to grip the bar to get that lift do some you know but I have been Lisa trying to avoid it as much as possible where I can you know if I need it I'll use it you know with this weight and shrugs I've done it many times and liquid she seems to do me well so I'm under an order liquid short so you know if you have a trying to control try it out man because here it's not as messy as having in our bag of chalk in your bag just put it on get a

restaurant we play to to lock out so what we do we overload the repair that we range by starting with a Kimura see upper arm on the floor so cheap the starting point is that you're going to be a weak range so we concentrate on that locker by overloading that part under generally you create more stimulus and in turn you hope to get from it so you come down complete rest to complete boss removal momentum [Music] come out [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hundred kilos which is a fool too powerful for acquire that say in America for plates no one asked why place 220 meters because remember I regular bench press you come down the low range to rely on the stretch reflex on the muscle you always get like a recoil so this is a strong range generally when you come to a dead stop before it's Pimenta complete restart of the muscle so you're removing momentum very much about absolute power No [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and I took it to each barrier and yeah my knees were here this is the lesson that's why if I never caught taller than ever and I'm a quite place on the bench there's so many times don't start yet and generally it's three places or four to one bar brackets in about 12 hours dick I dare say still warming up they were warm different boom on the shoulders by a slightly different angle so just kind of going back from that we give it

you know I've worked some of the best athletes in the world and I hear generally is like the normal guy that comes to the gym you train for half an hour 45 minutes you know I don't want to over train that's something they've you tell yourself there you're gonna very easily go into that state of believing it so one morning you wake up you're a little bit fatigued so I saw Dom's you're going to start telling yourself you're overtraining it's really a mindset and you know I trained three four or five hours a day most days cycle hundred hundred miles a week the big guy on a bike you know I'm not but so I claim I do fitness and very rare I can't get out of bed they come at you either and for their you know the key point there is passion you know I love liked it and uh you know when you have passion for anything it's easy so I will say to you find your passion and that doesn't mean that you have to come into gym and do weight training it may be outdoors cardio cycling boxing find something that you love because we love it it's easy you're forcing yourself to come here you're only ever gonna go so far so find what you love quietly do this hugging a tree bullshit there's a few letters if that's a fully contracted pad what this big difference in trying to come across the body maybe you try to paint across also then when they're saying about stretch and here work that's full

so a few guys are wondering where I wrap up upset it in other videos but you're new to my channel you want know so I'm gonna explain it to you basically I wrap up to give me more support on the heavy the heavier sets so when I'm lifting heavy Joel actually started using wraps back when I start to get them a pain in my elbow and doing a certain exercise that don't do anymore and I used to are really heavy on it when I was hitting triceps so that the the belts gave me support and they alleviated that pain now I use them when going heavy because they really do keep you keep them rigid and stable you know and it's just a lot safer when lifting really happy you know that's why you see a power lifters except you use them on the knees as well I use on my knees when squatting you know any anything that when the weight gets real heavy that's when you leave the extra support you know as it went when I was younger and I used to see - using them I used to boast about not not using the Taylor I don't need them I don't need them and you may not need them it's not a case of needing them it's a case of them making your lips more stable more and comfortable and safer you know so that's why I use the mainland 
[Music] yeah I'm say about 120 okay hundred twenty nine pounds so yeah this problem with this loss I was so used to the loss of our four-day yeah three to four days yeah so let's stop show you what we've got okay we just got some essentials eggs so twelve bits here I eat about eight to ten or sometimes twelve eggs a day now I don't get out twister didn't think oh yeah I'm gonna a twelve yolks no I need twelve eggs and probably have like one yolk in each minute you know so it's mostly egg white but I do it yet about twelve eggs a day for me eggs are perfect snack I haven't breakfast so you know after having my hopes I have eggs but it also late at night I always have a middle of eggs you know and I try and get sound to have that because it's a healthy snack she's always trying to snack in it even if she's hungry I'm sure okay I don't like a however I'm partial to a fried egg every now and then and if I am gonna have eggs somewhere else like scrambled egg it has to be well done when I say well done I mean crispy like no wetness none of that okay I've got gluten-free pasta good nice for me need to put you in free as well though aren't they yeah we're back home well you know we found these these are like so convenient I don't know hey if anyone says you shouldn't microwave food I don't care these are the most immediate thing you have on you literally just put them in the microwave and that settings are done you know hoping guys you can have a tuna can have it with what a meal that we've cooked you know it was so easy so yeah we have our meals are pretty cool we had our protein source whether that turkey chicken fish tuna whatever let me have our vegetables and then we'll have either like whole grain rice if we're having carbs or the whole grain pasta so we do get quite a few fresh vegetables I'll get that in asparagus and you guys have seen my other video five my five top healthy greens you know I love asparagus the other ones were a baccardo broccoli olives and spinach well my favorite greens check out that video if you want to know why and if you want to know the good stuff about them by the asparagus is just a great great vegetable does like so many good things about it but check my video 5 try to talk traffic leaves the gains if you want to see it the links there I did make some of these peppers that the green one could mean it's flavorless I just don't even if I see a pack of 3 and it has the green one the yellow the yellow one has a more subtle flavor but he still has a flavor the green ones just stick and I want to ask anyone that home or watching do you use facial tissues because she doesn't understand and he didn't understand I was looking for specific facial tissues and not once to blow my nose I thought maybe it because if first time as a makeup artist and when I'm working with people's skin and maybe I'm cleansing it or whatever and you need to dry it off I'm not going to get a big old towel and stop chopping over someone's face so these facial tissues what can I say that hasn't already been said this is my staple even if I'm out at a hotel where I'll just give you some alts I don't care just got water or just having water or milk it takes a great and then also have it with bananas and cashews or if you guys watch my user stories will see that I have it with Eva bananas cashews almonds macadamia nuts hazelnuts it just adds to the flavor but sometimes I've always ins in there as well or to dried fruit well yeah office is just so great Amanda breakfast it sustains you for ages got it all glycemic index so get burned slow and it will just give you energy throughout the morning I actually make a real tasty homemade granola using oats and and the same ingredients that seem kind of mentioned like flicked coconut raisins cashews so check that out guys if you haven't already it's really quick really simple and the whole family will love it you saw the friggin episodes we had trying to find decent baked beans now what rich people are going to be friggin shocked I tell you that they did not have Heinz baked beans they didn't even have a baked beans ting that looks similar to Heinz beans in tomato sauce this was the closest we got and this vegetarian tank his sauce with brown sugar and spices like in at night what is gonna taste I suppose also have a lot of sugar yeah regular beans doesn't really have black beans I think if I get this correct beans is one of the things foods singular foods that you can actually probably live on it actually has everything everything Union you know well yeah this this would not be I don't think this would be today I'll do a story or something and told you how this gets how this tastes you know Matt cool I always tell you guys we love different fish tilapia Cod salmon good fats a lot make Omega 46 and so this was the all that we could find it's the only to the map but at they had hopefully it tastes nice know about showing you guys the protein though now this chicken is natural no antibiotics and no added hormones that is a label we have in the UK we don't have labels that tell us that there was no antibiotics or no added hormones we just have chicken and it doesn't even have to tell you it's not ridiculous just chicken just to show you it's chicken you know so this is quite interesting to actually have all these labels that we see in bruises run it in fact I've actually lived in my research I'm going to marry such a plan on why the chicken over here and other meat has to have labels that explains whether its support home owns in the antibiotics etc and why doesn't raised without and chaotic well I should know like it's crazy the two types of quad hair Alaskan cod and true codfish honestly speaking I've done a lot of difference is I just saw court and I know the white fish is tasty and low in fat and I'm Hank all talk and I'm a white fish like I said also like tilapia back home buy more sea bream I mentioned earlier but happy burgers which we had it yesterday with a whole grain like well it like a fun flat bread whole grain flat breads normally rely on use a purebred well I couldn't meet again do you have here Brits have a circular well as you squeeze my you know my regular pit they may be compared to beef so instead of beef burger that's tacky burgers instead of beef mince we would have turkey mince instead of beef jerky we have turkey jerky so always makes up a fry up and adds these really taste nice you know so had to get those we cook with red onions more than we use honestly isn't like a health benefit that we're aware of that would buy it for ya although I'm probably sure there might be we buy it a little taste myself [Music] okay I'll show you the goodies man Boren we have oh yeah some real treat okay hold on hold on we need a vote guys which is better yes vote in the comments here cheery pop tarts or whatever they're oh yeah s'mores no I'm gonna show you something that's gonna make you like just just laugh sure what does that taste like I am visioning what does it taste like do I have any choice no have you tried Terra Cotta yes I have you haven't had these okay another to argue about what I've heard Terry Brooks outs that come on man but she's never tasted this ante in the place well yeah these are treats you guys we are normal lady lots of flavors of ice cream I mean we did go a bit extra with the healthy stuff and walk but lo was it it's very low fat low everything notions up 200 food calories etc so we haven't tried it yet ninety-four percent

hey guys another Q&amp;A as promised set in lots of questions on instagram has about 500 comments so there's loads of questions there loads of questions sent to questions and Senor pendel comm so I'm going to be going through those also I love these opportunities to interact with you guys and give you direct answers to the questions that you send in so I'm going to do is I'm going to speed through some of the most commonly asked questions when did you begin your bodybuilding journey I started training in 2002 I was about 15 16 years old so that's that one quick how often do you benchpress um every week I choose between eve our flat bench with a barbell or dumbbell press at the moment I'm currently working on building up my strength for my barbell sorry my dumbbells so I'm hitting that week in week out numbers are going up so you know that's working for me but I tried to hit flat bench every other week or if I'm trying to you know get stronger on it I'll do it consecutively the week by moment I'm working my dumbbells what music do you listen to was to create a song and I listen to also use it with what I'm training I like hip-hop you know I like on tracks that get me motivated that get me in the zone little cunt so vapor song is too many so concretely give you an answer there what exercises do you do to keep your waist trim my waist was small when I started training and that's not going to change from training doesn't you know the training I have is an avid impact on my waist and my diet keeps my waist small um some people have a wider waist some people have a smaller waist that's not something you can affect using training unless we're talking about body fat you know because your body your body fat will determine how big your waist is to a certain degree and once you've cut that down - your measurement so me personally my waist is small I'm always a boy I always have low body fat so you know my waist size remains the same it doesn't change how do you get big chaps I do heavy shrubs of a barbell and I have done for a very long time and it works for me and people have different strategies when they shrug some people do it very slow squeeze at the top some people do it fast and me personally I do it a relatively fast pace and I go very heavy and that's work for me my traps I've grown considerably and they continue to grow so for me it's some heavy barbell shrugs and I did start with dumbbells but as the weight got heavier and heavier I ran out of dumbbell weight and then to lose the barbell so you can start with dumbbells and as you work up the weight and then switch the bar mil so that's how I get my big trips is it better to hit arms on a separate day or depends on what your goal is um means specifically I chain individual body parts day so I'm a day for chest I'm a day for back every day for shoulders etc so yes I have a separate day for arms as well I feel that they deserve a whole day so I might give them a day's weather chain and I hit my triceps and biceps on the same day and gone back-to-back so yeah I definitely think I'm deserve a separate day but that's that's in relation to my goals you know so I'm in relation to the time I have available to train so then if you're not if you don't have as much time you might want to squeeze it in with one of the rubber sessions some people for example will do a chest and triceps back and biceps you know that that works for people I personally do them on one day you how often do you do legs and you and how do you chain them I do legs twice a week I have a strategy that on the on one of the days I trained very heavy and do the big compound lifts my squats my leg press and all the big lifts on one specific day and then I have another day where I do more shaping so you know I'm making sure I hit each individual muscle from as many angles as I can and I do that with feet positioning so for example if I'm doing leg extensions and I have am straight I am from the sides I stopped hitting with my feet turned out even with it turned inwards I also do my hamstrings on that day so and it's mainly a heavy and a light day although the lack day isn't really that way if you want to grow a specific body part how would you how would you do it like for example legs like I said um I've said before I trade legs twice a week and I do that because it was an area that I wanted to work on I wanted to build out and that works for me you know training them twice a week as opposed to what I was doing once I can see the growth a lot quicker so I have a specific plan and hit them hard and often you know so and that goes for any other body part back and I'm seeing another question here about calf's which I always get asked about know I thought recast how do I go on my calves and weigh them often and that's going to kick him off the knee tomorrow I hit my calves a minimum of five times a week I train seven days a week so every day but and I take them as much as I can and it works for me they've grown so that's working for me especially here about definition asking what do I do for definition and like how do you train the definition you don't train for definition you train to build muscle and whether you're defined a lot will depend on your diet and how much spend on how much back and got in your body and you can affect that with your diet by cleaning up your diet and cut in fact you can obviously train to burn fat so I'm in that respect you can but there's no specific exercise that you do for defining muscles your definition is to do with your body fat so know your body fat you shoulder muscles that's underneath especially how about stretch marks I've gained so many stretch marks since I started lifting weights if you have the same experience how did you get rid of them I've still got stretch marks and they never have never been a little concerned for me you know when I was then first starting out I was really hitting it hard and I first got stretch marks I was actually quite proud of him because it let me know that I was growing so and I kind of had them as like a badge of honor kind of thing but now um yeah I've still got stretch marks and you know I don't pay them in magnet means nothing too much if you do have stretch marks um and you're not happy with them I can't advise on you know best ways to get to get rid of them because it's not something I've ever researched or got or investing age no it's not something's not been my stretch marks haven't been of any importance to me and I don't really on my mind on what am I so it's not something kind of know about in terms of getting rid of what was your source of income during your 12 years of lifting and getting huge I went to school college studied went to had a 9 to 5 job and you know trend route throughout throughout school throughout college I've always trained you know I've always found the time to Train training training is like a an hour hour and a half of each day so I've always managed to fit in regardless I've said many times over first five to six years I've trained at home so you know training a lot like a train one of my legs and always did and I never missed the session and the same went for when I was working my nine-to-five I'm finished my nine-to-five go straight to the gym finished general it was just a part my normal day so then when people asked or should I say when people wonder you know and say you know how did have the time I don't have time to Train like you do I don't have hours in the day I mean I'm doing my look you guys have like two fires right now and I had a 9:00 to 5:00 so and I trained for it so it's up to you you know this is what you want to do you can find time to do all these it's just whether you want to do an I love training so I fit in like my day structured so that I can train each day and I always make sure that I get name so and it's all that priorities and one of mine has and always will be training because I enjoy so much that's how I get in Italian there's a question here that says why don't you have an 8 pack I don't have an 8 pack because I've got a 6 pack some people have it back some people have ten packs it's something that's just genetics that's how you're worried um is made up you can't choose how many packs are gonna show I have six something were they in something like ten you know um don't forget he was about twelve but you can't choose how many packs you've got so I'm simple and something there I'm gonna make cuz I have six what is your main motive to keep training week after week month after month yeah yeah um I've said upset enough you malaise winning when discussing my passion for training I love training so it's some kind joy like I want to train I enjoy a training I look forward to every name I train every day because I enjoy is the highlight of my day and has been for the last 13 years this is everyday all in train um I get excited about my sessions so it's it's not sure like training for some people they're looking at the goal and I've never looked at the goal I always looked at the session as being my enjoyment might want my time to have have some fun I found to have a good time so every day I'm looking forward to that hour hour and a half when we're going train I'm not looking at it as oh I need to train because I need big arms so I have to do this or um I have to do this session because if I don't mean it's never never looking like that um the the the the size and the strength that comes from training is brilliant Allah and yes I do trained for that but I think my main driving force is going to the gym to have a good time you know I love lifting I get a good buzz from lifting you know so I'm in respect to being motivated for it you can't you don't know motivation to do something you enjoy you know you don't need to be motivated to play call of duty you just want to have a good time you know you're switching on your good time unit down the headset talk to you talk to your boys and you know bro something's up I get motivated to go to the gym to meet my boys and kill some weight for some weight around get some new numbers to get some new personal bests you know um I like I like seeing I like progress in I like seeing my friends progress so um ya know Jim's an enjoyable job enjoyable time for me so I don't need motivation to go and want to go I enjoy it I love it more good questions how tall are you I'm six foot one can you do a backflip no I've tried and I've ended up in my neck so no can directly can do flips and cartwheels let's not block on directly what's your favorite size I mean baby exercise is difficult cuz I love sports I love sports go what yeah I would say that a squat has to be my favorite but then at the same time and I've deadlifts that is gone I love the big exercises the powerful ones the big compound lips and those two are your biggest exercises that that use the most muscle group some winter performing them so for me you see the squats or deadlifts but I don't forget anything beats coming out of a big squat though you know when you go down and you power out that squat I don't think in convinced that so I have to same square do I have cheat lilz i do have cheat Mills I don't have cheat days I used to have cheat days which used to be like the weekends or one of them that one leg for Saturday or Sunday and I found my overindulged and I was eating cheating though just because it was a cheat day do you watch Dragon Ball Z and who's your favorite character and why don't watch it now I usually when I was a kid and my favorite character was gokhan of course it wouldn't be I'd like to know if you're able to do a one-arm pull-up yes a hand or when I put that how many I can do but I definitely do my uncle oh do you have any advice when it comes to feeling intimidated in the gym it's a very male-dominated place as a woman it's easy to be made to feel like you don't belong there question the price above minimum know as there are a lot of men out there who also put intimidating in that environment you really shouldn't feel intimidated in the gym I mean all going here to better ourselves a lot of time we might find that the things that you're worried about all people you for watching you etc they're not gems I've got to be very friendly places most of the time you know um everyone well they can look everyone can look quite scary to some people you know massive big guys my gosh let me give you an example margin my gym is full of massive big guys you know um muss muscles everywhere anyone's you know really killing it going for it but my gym is the most friendly place ever like um you as a man woman old young will be welcomed imagine by everyone you know what just were just a big community we like you imagine you can leave your phone on one side of the gym and go train on the other side come back your phone still there or you need your what it somewhere it gets handed in on the surface looking at the gym if you just popped in and you had a little peep in you might been intimidating but like I said you just need to suck it up get in there and you will find that everyone is very friendly I mean them that's what I have experienced I've experienced that at many gyms you know them it's a community spirit you know we might look a certain way because we're focused and determined but we're all very friendly you know we're all very friendly in the gym so I'd say you know give it a try you might be surprised you might be surprised get stuck in there and you'll finally it all will be very helpful were all in there for the same reasons we'll trying to better ourselves and them all trying to to progress so um you know anyone out there like you guys when you're in a gym if you see someone that might look like you know did attack to feel intimidated you know go talk to them you know like um say hello you know just be be friendly with them you know because um it's all about growth and progression and motivating others so you know if you see someone that looks like they might be the position as the person that I'm sending that email you know say hello make them feel welcome you

through that also I posted a little post for you guys to respond with questions for QA I'm going to answer as many of those questions in the Q&amp;A so what we're going to do is my boy drives our taxi we're going to go through London and I'm gonna basically talk and answer your questions while we you know see the City of London she point bread I'm in the car what simian buddy good immune I'm in the back parts of a few questions today don't get to name a bit bit off a to day things well you know me they go get to know me now man I don't meet okay yeah wicked um I think I think only a little masters in it who may your needless has my neighbor's basically and my next-door neighbor I still lives you know when you live in like an apartment where you got the house where the doors are just like side by side so my boy miles used to live next door and most of all chill with miles and yeah herbs come round it was a friend of miles and in devour and yeah we became friends as well in fact to be fair I didn't like you the first time and you like me have you took this time with the international soccer superstar soccer but now I never lose always cool before that you rip to the ground we didn't speak mark it was cool but when you came out with it you both belong you looked I thought I was in a pink emotional music but didn't but didn't well then you killed me after that man and you'll enjoy who was funny yeah well yeah that's my first moment to be fair but a year not from then this has been years and years and years of just you know were we not that we grew up in and obviously I grew up in South East but then I don't know what age I was when I first came down obviously I before I came to live I came up just visiting my dad yeah I couldn't visit my dad so yeah it was about 94 yeah 94 95 and used to come up for weekends and then it escalated to you eventually yeah moving in so yeah man we're talking night music we're talking over 20 years yeah the long time ago Mary - 23 years ago exactly but ya know we all used to chill together those lots of mothers many more of us to be fair like them and then everyone would come shit up until it mine you know like we're all chill until Emmanuel chill at mouses and then obviously I'll see you and then you know we became good friends and I've come to yours ways basically we lived like walking distance what - three minutes there - three minute walk from each others exactly that man so yeah funny music like I'm using there's no I gotta talk about a music I'm gonna talk about music you know that I'll talk about the gym because it's all ties in to be fair um obviously you know that I used to train train at home do it man oh well there's a dumbbell I don't know man when I when I upgraded to go and gym I must have given it away or something you know actually I think I keep giving away to some about number who that drastic number Manning auction and shit right now I know haha but yeah now what we're talking about basically is the dumbbell I've got one heavy dumbbell and that's our start man choose to forget incur lit shoulder press it and it was just the same routine shoulder press curls and press ups like you know the same routine but then the reason why urge knows about it was even though I used to train at home on my own is I would then go to like if anyone came to my house or I was going to tell at my friend's house I'll take that number with me so I'll take my I don't know with the next door and while we're all chilling everyone's you know playing games I was a big game of that then now I haven't even touched my xbox for months but back then I was a big gamer I had you know Xbox I had the PlayStation not all of them and so yet with all chill and play games and yeah I'll be pumping I'll be pumping that everyone's chilling and understanding my dummbell and no one would pay me no man like because that's what's Indian dads let these guys is done but I'll be doing press ups and it'll just be that was my thing you know and yeah just that and it continued that after years and the way that your music ties in is back there nice to wrap know that thanks to rap you know and we we had a group and one of my boys was a producer so he'll make all the beats and we'll just go there and he'll be playing is playing us new beats and would be writing rhymes and while doing that I'll be training so like I just had this friggin love for the pump man so I just wanted to always fill the pump so it wasn't a case of it obviously back then I don't know what you know I didn't know that you're not supposed to friggin just just be training training training without any sort of structure you know but back then I just wanted to pump so literally I could be rapping one minute makes me other dumble I don't need some girls are hitting some piss-ups so you know it's just that is what I've basically I've fallen in love with the feeling of training it just I know that felt so good for me before we went Jim this is before Jim days overnight you know people were dying Jim fight anyone not now is fashionable to do more specials Oh Jim everyone goes Jim this is a real life venture of fuckers walking around with Dom yeah I just loved it man I never play in my head I think it wasn't you cold I have really nothing bad but none of them like it wasn't it wasn't a strange thing to see me standing there with a dumbbell curling but what was funny you know what's funny you know when people used to come round that didn't know us and they see me leather pink I will sit in I wish your boy doing that why is it I see why you got a dumbbell yeah he's gonna touch on one life because it was a shining off kind of thing they didn't realize that I was just me standard Johnny number one time just chilling at Mouse's and I don't know who came round but it was one of his friends and then obviously they see me doing press ups and curls and stuff and I've only think you know still see there and let you know we're just chilling now I see lousy pumping waste but again lack of it was just something I enjoyed doing you know and yeah and also we would like I trained mostly at home those times but in remembered sick Mary's take Marisa was a local youth club and that had had a little Jim in it so I did I did train there once or twice but never a set routine there you know I mean if I went there I'll get a session in there you know and even then I'm still stuck in my ways in my whole training that I would just do the same routine same routine from home I'll just do it there you know cuz I'll figure out this is what works this is where in jail just do it do the same thing poopster well I grew and I mean I grew considerably to the point where one might hammer but to a gym people were like do you compete like I'm where do you train like we're jindo trainer but that and for me I was none the wiser because not just I was oblivious to making progress why wasn't my focus it I wasn't I've never had like a an image of this is how I want to look it was just yeah yeah like this man I like the way this feels that that was it me so yeah I grew I grew up I grew nicely at home man and the training at home continued even when I left North London I moved out from North London I don't remember what what year it was like Brett remember we're talking about all 607 also so literally by o7i that that's like five years in I would even training at home for five years and then I continue to train at home for at least another year or two light and yeah like the game flower I've made a lot of focus on you have to go in Ginny yeah no well basically when I when I moved um my my groom I I made a gym basically I made a gym I fished a bit out like you remember you remember talking when I'm used to talking for six months yeah I had a little bit of equipment never when I when I miss to capture like my room was really big so I go I had the flat bench I had a wide grip chin up bar with a punch bag which I use for cardio so I should smack down for cardio I had a all the different bars Easy Bar picture calls about arms people ways I saw how you got big on cycling I was all about arms man so preacher curls or all sorts of friggin different bars I had the tricep bar I was just all of our arms back then you know so I didn't really know about anything else to be fair still the knowledge wasn't man I hadn't touched Virginia so I didn't know that you know there was really double body posture here or how to hit I was just liking what I was doing at home and I was gaining a lot of confidence in my you know what I was doing to the point of arrogance to the point I didn't want to what have anything this is working this is what I do at home I don't have anything else on what you guys do but by the time when I did my personal training course years ago and I finally enter the gym and realized you know they opened up my eyes to all sorts of other exercises and to Anatomy I mentioned before about the book I started reading which was a strength training Anatomy that book basically just opened my eyes to the body for everything like that okay so um I've got to do this exercise for this this success for this and I think that's working oh my symmetry to now because I started to structure my plan for my training to make sure everything was getting hit and yes or by the time I go to a gym you know I'd already built a good foundation but when I got in the gym yeah it was like a playground for me man I was like Jesus man all this stuff and yeah from then you know we get to hit there's a question someone think you came for Stremme powerlessness dollar or 240 billion oh that's a good one um I just other us to be fair I like I like strip slips what take you to the gym and I mean I get excited by like even today you saw man like that that that 165 I went for that made my day that's what I go for you know I mean that that's s that's what I'm looking forward to so obviously when were when I'm touching like the fifties and stuff it's like a it's after year I'm warming up making sure that I'm really getting the mat amount of grip range to say that I can go through it and then that's it is what makes me feel good you know so when I train it's like I'm going for strength you know but it's relative you know for someone might see see what I press and say yeah but that's not really that strong I can do X what you can do as absolutely no bearing on what I do you know like no one kids this is that I'm going by my own my own limits you know and my own like barriers you know so so I know the numbers in my head that I want to hit you know and if I get them feel great and that's what I'm going for so obviously I do train for size as well but mainly when I'm in the gym it's like I'll hit some heavy weight on it honor I'll hit a new PB or I want to hit a weight that I've hit before with better form or with more reps you know that's that's that's for me what keeps it enjoyable you know so yeah um it's not really strict to be fair it's not bodybuilding style or power it's definitely not powerlifting style but it's just my own little way of training that I enjoy you know like our goal and I triangle as heavy as I can in this in in the session I do obviously hit the sets where I get high reps you saw like where we started today we did high reps from you started in week and I freaking started with a fifteen and just you know getting the motions with 20 reps then like um it was a twenty with for like 20 reps again you know so there's a mix some mix yeah okay someone else in here or we should be a typical aggressor to you when you wake up what sort of things you gay that's an easy one manís easy what Mark Oates man you know this man you know you know this is Oaks Altos oats oats of semi skimmed milk and I've rolled some bananas and some cashews in that's my staple it's been my staple for years you know that's that's my go-to evening even if I'm at our hotel like something across the world and then we have a buffet I'm looking for the oats to start me off and even my oats and them some semi skim milk if there's no milk out of a water as well I'm fine to even be savage and just turn on the hot tap after the after and there's some oats and I'll go through it you know about hopes the reason and the reason why is that the low glycemic index of the clerk that the oats keeps me like energized good day you know all morning you know like it gives me enough slow slow release time I've got the energy back through so this is at the perfect breakfast now normally if I've got time I'll then have a second break for this lack of hour later or half an hour later which is just six eggs and some smoked salmon or some beans now but that when I say six eggs people ways whether it's not six eggs with the yolks it's probably one look you know so yeah but my staple results every day other so well someone's us about your absolute in what absolutely because I've noticed myself that before you want to maybe tell me you want to heavy on camera and I'm sorry I'm still not seeing a bit more definition I'm hearing them I mean them but it's a bit weird for me it's like when I go to the gym I want to concentrate on things that I feel need work ABS isn't something that I feel like I really need to work on too much they could be better but they don't I don't look in the mirror and think oh no and I need to get my abs man you know what I'm saying so I do hit them like mostly on like Saturdays which is my miscellaneous day so I'll hit a nice little ABS routine on it on a Saturday but um yeah I don't it's not for you it's not you know it's not my you know it's more part when you look at some of the people that you train with someone in guys I've got some real big like definite ABS but I yeah I'm not chasing it I'm not chasing it to be fair it's long I like abs is ABS man I mean like if your abs are very flat you need to work them to bring them up and bring them out make a more prominent but I'm satisfied with mine so it's not on my on my top of my list basically for for me to kill a man yeah okay next question here is a your receipt or what most implant walk bodybuilders that most inspired or to see and you know what look that I'm gonna try and get looking something like this I don't get my to be fair when I started it wasn't there wasn't a physique I was looking to man it was um the enjoyment you know I like I start I picked up a dumbbell and I loved how it felt man and that's that's what's you know been driving that driving me all this time but obviously I grew up watching Dragon movie I grew up watching the Hulk obviously I knew Ana Lucia never was so these are influences but I never had any like you know main Idol you know like all my rules I never had pictures of bodybuilders I had pictures of friggin super backs you know I love super bites back then you know that back in the day and then also I was loved rap as well so I pictures a two pack but there's never really a bodybuilder that I had on my wall when I look like that guy you know and it was just just just the way that I felt man which i think is good as well because people tend to compare themselves to look you know so imagine I did have someone on my war I'll be looking up and thinking why don't I look like that or maybe I need to change my plan maybe I need to find out what he does except for etc and sometimes it's just good to you know not to just try and concentrate in yourself and try and be the best you can be you know like that summers a steel washer favorite muscle mobile muscle to train on on me just I would up if I was asking it at looking at this question what is your favorite muscle and the body fat traps my my favorite is my traps man when I look at a picture or a video like my traps is what I'm varying like what's the word store where where you're like you're get very proud of you know I'm like wow yeah they're nice like the traps is like very prominent on my back and yeah I'm like you know so I've set my traps man right ham this is on the bench press what's the motion ever done in the beige book all right this is a tricky one I've done like five plates with a little bit on the end as well so that's like 2:30 but the thing about it was back then I used to have a spa now I don't know how much the how involved the spot was so I don't even claim those numbers anymore because I just don't know I used to do it I know I used to do it and I remember doing four plates for like five to six trips but I just back then I used to have a spa so I don't really claim those numbers right now on a very very good day I could get four and a half plates for one you know so yeah someone loves an interest in money right you know you've been having a few years and in one how'd you handle hate right in anything you're successful in as I know as well anything is successful you're not successful until you have haters that's it that's that's the give-and-take of it you're not successful until you have you know the negative that's when you know BAM what I put it yeah but I'm good at what I'm doing because I put the haters well to be fair among its my my my my my take on it has changed over as time is going on you know initially you think that you're supposed to react you know you think oh I've got react to butter let them know don't know you're incorrect that's not right what you said I need to put your street at this stage I'm realizing that haters wanna hate and that is it it's a sad so funny haters gonna hate but that is what they want to do that's what they get enjoyment from there's a reason people hate there's Envy involved this jealousy there's just pure spite you know and you try to convince them otherwise it's a waste of your time so what I'm doing now I've been getting a lot of good feedback form when I go to expose and I speak to people one-on-one they're basically saying to me sim I watch your videos you've motivated me I started training because of you etc etc and that's who I should concentrate on so instead of even listening to any kind of hate hate that I see I should just put out more and positive a more motivational content and just inspire more people yo I mean you got it you got the Panda fans I see a lot of people there defending you lot of people holding up your shield for you as well I understand they're for sure for sure for sure but yeah but what I'm saying is that like this is we I'm really not taking any notice no more oh I see it all I see it all force house I'm saying it's days they're there you know as long as I see the good comings I'm gonna see the bad but yeah I'm no longer taking it serious at all it's just about putting out positive content for the people that is actually working on and if only if only they is actually saw how important it can be to certain people well I'm not gonna front man I've had guys come up to me and our world upload from shit that they told me like they're telling me that other stories one about stories like is he gonna be wrong gay people don't know who I'm gonna freakin fucking clue they just thinking you know they don't know what they see yeah well I would let they hate him and then they don't see anything else past that but I've spoken to people that said you've changed my life kind of thing you know I mean and then they told me a story and I'm like wow man like you don't even know what kind of impact you're having so and the some of them have said and because of that you need to keep doing it you know and you need to ignore ignore areas and that's what I'm listening to right now so you know I'm saying about that why don't you participate in competitions as a level question that's popping up here quite a lot of people want to know you know usually the competitions you're not so much involved you know do your motivational speaking there's nothing that you're not too involved in the competition why is that um because it was never my passion man its I have to keep saying it it's like people see a bodybuilder and I know it makes sense see a bodybuilder you think he competes and you should compete or why doesn't he compete I want to see you compete but the question I have is all these people that say they want to see me compete are you going to be at the show are you going to come and watch the show you just or do you just want to know that I compete like to validate what Jeremy what I do I have competed here and I did it for the experience I wanted to you know it's a fun experience for anyone that's actually thinking about doing it it's very fun if you're do it for the right reasons you can have a great time you're amongst your peers and you know you you should show what you've got you learn how to pose you learn you pose to a routine it's fun it's good to do but it was never my passion to become you know a competitive bodybuilder well let you know when I started yeah so think back to me hitting the Dumbo in the room did you you spoke to me 10 times did I ever mention I wanted to be a competitive bodybuilder ever ever it was nothin on my radar I just love training there's not my radar so why is it I could be in the end because like I said it was something that I I thought I'd enjoy and I did enjoy but it's not it's not my passion man some people your training and your you want to be a bodybuilder to compete you want to be compatible with that is fine everyone has their own goals it was not you know and that's the reason why you know and also right now I'm just a very involved in visiting different countries and doing seminars and do motivational stuff and that's what I get a buzz form you know I don't really get a buzz for being on the stage when I went out even when I did do it and I won my competition you know some people that's the best thing in the world to them but even when I became a pro in in in Musclemania which was a great great feat and I felt good about it but for some people they think I want to be a pro I want to be a pro and that's their goal and that's fine but it's not mine and that's fine also and I'm saying so the southern asking why do you only chain your muscle once a week that particular muscle pain or gain chain must reduce twice a week yeah yeah you know what the other day I put a post up and I said this again I said are you a trained trained muscle bit once a week and someone said you are there but that's not that bad that doesn't work and I'm like if they train to the intensity that I do with the sets that I do and the volume that I do for that muscle group it should work I don't see why it shouldn't John I mean like I my sessions are intense you know we've trained no I go for it man you know and and and and then you know say say I've done my chest day I have worked my chest day to the core you know and then I need to get everything else with the same intensity but I don't feel like I need to hit it here twice a week and you know the legs I did twice a week because I wanted to bring them up you know I felt like they needed work so I'll do that twice a week but other than that everything else gets hit once and then also people that I understand secondary secondary muscle groups and well by that I mean for example if I'm hitting chest or I'm hitting shoulders I'm using my triceps they're getting a workout you know and and and and other exercises you're always using other muscles you know so that takes that comes into play also you're a lot of people talking about deadlifts here and what's the motion will be listed on that yeah yeah I'm the most of of elected is 280 which is I'm just liking that great to be fair but at the time I was working up towards it and yeah I've got it I'd love to hit 300 binding to work on to work out maybe this year I can do it you know which is like seven plates and then yeah I feel like I can do it because the 280 wasn't exactly you know a hard hard lift to get to but it's just something I've never concentrated on I feel I can get a 300 yeah but yet to eight is my highest I've actually done you know yeah oh sorry that's kilos by the way with all these Americans will do that to eight pounds you know he knows where II how many times a day what sort of things EE how often how do you space it out what's your meeting like five to six times a day yeah practicing these big new-school news medium sized meals you know what I've got I've talked at length about my diet it's basically healthy food and when I say healthy food I just mean again like I've said whole grain wax it's pasta whole grain pasta it's lots of fish lots of veg you know I feel I've done a bit video recently on all the veg I loads of edges without edge of every meal you know and it's just a balanced diet man it's a balanced diet it's not it's not a bodybuilders diet it's not a it's not a cutting diet it's not straining diet it's a balanced diet you know the kind of eases hi I think the calorie support for a half to five thousand but it I need that you know I need that train hard I'll train hard so and I've got a lot of muscle mass so um I stay hungry man I stay hungry daily you know what is it's almost 38 it what's your biggest is you know everyone's got their B's am I not even been bodybuilding it could be summer for what was your push your biggest fear I follow our fear to you one day I follow the things I start being real for one day I told you to share but one day I woke up on the floor imagine you go calm and you as a skinny as a what psyche that from that film the comedy the guy with a fake ID o GTV well that when you use skin yeah I'll be I'll be really disappointed but um you know and I don't think miss anything would you get back to this II mean we all know I work I work I work no I mean I put work hard at things so I hope I would you know but I'm how would I feel about I'll be very disappointing well I'm why should I be I worked very hard to build up my physique to what what I've done so you know as with anything that you work for if you lose it you'll be very very disappointed and you'll be very unhappy about it so yeah what's your favorite class II mean what is your favor Oh bang is this awesome man two cars my favorite car and see the thing is I've got so many and they always change because there's always you know I don't know either somebody supercars I love but my favorite car that always stays in that list right next near the top is the Shelby Cobra the 1965 Shelby Cobra is just beautiful man it's just I love it I love it to bits oh I don't even know when I first first fell in love with it I've got a model of it at home on my on my on the table and yeah I love it in with with in blue with the two straps that's that's you know that's my favorite flipping car man I love that car to bits and I remember when I was in LA and I was driving on I pulled up near one you should have seen my face man i couldnt get the window down quick enough man and i was asking was it real because the thing about them is because they're so like rear they're ridiculously expensive during the millions of pounds you know they're not they're not like super car passes their their antique passes you know that couple million so when I saw this one I have to ask the guys that real is that man and that's a replica you know but yes still amazing cards my favorite you know so I can't really name the supercar that's my favorite I mean I love cars like the Lamborghini Aventador I think that's a beautiful car I like the McLaren p1 which is amazing my lovin letters I love a lot of supercars but none I feel as tied to as that I just love that one you know so that's that's my favorite car man Shelby Cobra now you travel quite a few places in the world you know you've uh you've been doing working on parts of the world really every color I don't think they're in a continent Ewing it is humanity is or Asia yeah yeah ages probably the only one in Yemen here but as far as anywhere else you've probably covered it now experience-wise what one of you gain the most where would you say no one that place I've come back and I've changed me a bit I've seen this and I've done this here I've met me sort of people's and related and he sort of people's embody good what place would you say you know as as I didn't be one of the one not like that this is basically when I went to India it was the only place that I went to got from Egypt about India more so that I felt I was really somewhere else if that makes sense so basically what I mean by that is I've been to New York I've been to LA Vegas I've been to Australia Poland Warsaw these are cities yeah and when I mean it's just another sitting for me so it's just like London I'm going to see you know like visibly busy city people going to work etc you know cosmopolitan yeah but when I when I when I went to India I I was like wow I'm different I'm definitely somewhere halfway across the world right now somewhere different didn't I mean that I really felt I was somewhere different and that's that that stayed with myself like of all these places I've traveled to that's the one that I really remember thinking wow man I'm really getting to places that that you know I'm really getting out of London you know because obviously being in the other places are obviously about London I was New York etc back again it was just the cities just another busy city with busy people you know but when I was in India you know there was cows in the world man for me that was just that and they had right away yeah look out the right of way like so I was learning so much over there the culture you know and so it was it was an experience for me India you know you

[Music] [Music] what's good guys so we're here with cars and Kronos here with Mike drove down great so so far man first car show right where Scott shows and I love it I mean there's certain times I want to see that I didn't see today I wanna see some cool execs I want to see some piggy knees I'd love to see a Saleen s7 told some don't see everyday you know we see we see this cars all the time Oh obviously for the first time I've seen the laferrari haven't seen no I haven't seen too many of them exactly yeah not as something that I want to see so I'm gonna go into these frequently I think the best part is driving out driving back point I think you even saw it like I was driving it enough to see crews battle nice come soon I'm down [Music] just nice to forget and see all the cars man like if your client is yes its place is like heaven for you if you know what you want to see that you don't see often it's the piggy knees so I wanna see a Pagani Zonda honestly a bikini how'd you say this adventure H how you were or something like that yeah honestly obviously those you don't see those every day you know I've seen I've never seen a lot Ferrari before so that's the first time I've seen one of those but yeah I'm never you don't see bikinis you know so and maybe a Bugatti is well I mean he's I've seen a few bar be nice to see her we got a super sport that was a cool where that's one of that's all free work are Cobra that's what I would [Laughter] always behind the barriers and that's the one everyone wants to see havock scourge of smile [Music] you know you know what I went to get my car they had one of these in the carpark and I was out all my days that I made the wrong decision it's just too though [Music] I like him I like coming my favorite yeah four five eight not sort of four five eight sorry the laferrari I actually considered getting the four five eight or the for a eight but you know for me I don't know this Ferraris are nice but it's how can I put it there's nothing unique about it with the current competition you know so yeah yeah yeah yeah you know so we've with the competition obviously you're the Lamborghinis you go to McClaren's etc it's just not that like there's another four five be like the damn a dozen are so many everywhere same thing with a Lambo so like right now when I Drive the McLaren when people see that they write always that you know I said people people don't still even know what it is and some people only know one McLaren the p1 so they assume is our p1 you know well you know for me McLaren is doing it for me I know that's what standard that's cool see how I Drive my car everyday you know driving I don't think you could drive an Aventador everyday I just it's not practical man yeah yeah yeah so just yes a regular driving like everything would be a chore just going to the store to get something you know for me hoping in the 570 it's a breeze it's just you know other than open the only issues I have is opening the doors or something beside me you know but other than that it's a breeze but I don't forgot to track this every day you know by a stoker I'm fine everything okay I told my only issue with the backing up the camera has a delay so we're I'm I'm pretty nimble I'm quite fast so I will you know want to reverse into a space quite quickly I'll keep reverse and you have to wait for the camera for like a second or two and that is kind of jarring you know because you want that you want it on straight away you know other than that it's um visibility is fine I don't really have any issues parking you know and it's quite small man so it's easy that I fit in most places even the compact spaces I can just squeeze in you know and you could definitely come even in a normal space you're probably going to be stick it out [Music] I was gonna be bored I was you know honestly speaking I'm probably get what Mike Scott so the green and black green black so we'll show them on camera but yeah the green and black army color I love that you know so oh I might get mad gray matte gray yeah I don't know I don't like loud colors although that looks amazing it would it be cool for me Wow - look at this beautiful you know but yeah I couldn't I couldn't drive a car this yellow bright green not every day you know just to be one of my favorite cars there so 65 yeah exhaust is a must exhaust is a must Mike's car like he's gone exhaustion is and if you hear it like it's violent like just what he was just talking about when we arrived it's like a mad crackle you know and I first I thought that there wasn't a big difference there really is man they really is you know so that's one thing I'm definitely gonna do I thought if I'm going to tune it well but you know I'm definitely gonna get the exhaust 100% like that sound that's what I love the sound man you know and that's why you know when people say to you why don't you get like a Tesla or something like that because it's faster it's not about just speed it's about the sound it sound of the engine the sound of the exhaust you know that those things are important they're just as important [Music] it's pretty cool to be the only person here over 570 GT that's how unique the garbage there's Lamborghini ESPYs there's Americans four five eight sport eight eight f12 Ferraris etcetera but only one 570 GT that's what I mean when I say that unique and you don't see it off them I mean war economy and there's only one that shows you how unique it is and that's why people don't know what it is [Music] get about three far like that's gonna be like like a Rolls Royce or like a Bentley okay you had a driver almost like what type of car would you want to like exceeding it all the time I'm just gonna sound funny well I don't think it would be if I was about to drive I wouldn't want to be in a Rolls I don't think I don't know if I feel comfortable getting out of a walls everywhere yeah it'd probably be a Mercedes I mean I've been up as a passenger in like a 750 BMW 750 and a out of the a8 which would just clean clean that like so much space in the back technology and just just just comfortable you know I mean obviously in a Rolls it'll probably be better but I just a normal oh yes a bit too flashy to be stepping out of that yeah I probably have probably driven around like a a like one of these for our resort just one of these supercars you could get out go about your business and people would admire the car stepping out of lack of roles as a passenger they notice the roles they're gonna now look who are you know they want to know are you a celebrity what you're famous and that for me would be frustrating [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

ah hey guys so those of you checked out my vlog I hope you enjoyed it I've got a lot more footage similar to that and you know the regular hardcore workouts and you know the how-to videos come in two loads of it the next how-to video I'm considering doing will be either back or chest and I've put a poll out so you guys let me know which one you want next today we are going to be discussing greens vegetables and fruits green fruits um I'm wearing my green SBS fix camouflage top oh why not what I'm going to share with you guys is the greens both fruit and veg that I use every day the first screening we're going to start with is the vegetable asparagus now asparagus tastes great I'm sure those of you who've tried it know that it's great with Salmons great mistakes you can lightly fry it in olive oil what I tend to do is I tend to lightly fry in olive oil with a little bit of black pepper and a little bit of lemon and it tastes taste amazing if you're feeling naughty can add some honey and make it you know that were panning it just comes out real nice glazed and swill but this is a great source of fiber it's full of health benefits it's called bitumen a bit see but you evening case has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant health benefits which can help to neutralize free radicals which are known to be a cause of cancer so it's a great in that respect so it's definitely something I would add to your meal I Fergus is a herbaceous plant and that leads me on to our next herbaceous plant which is avocados avocados tastes great a great addition to most meals so easy to prepare you just cut it and throw it in I have it with tuna I find I can you know add texture to the tuna and increase the flavor tuna can be quite dry I'm also chicken chicken breast can be quite drag no I didn't have a card or just you know gives it another dynamic avocado is high in monounsaturated fats which are the good fats so I'm going to do is I'm going to give you a breakdown of the four fats so that you know which fats to go for which pets to avoid moneyline saturated fats are good for you they can be found in plant sources are liquid at room temperature and help reduce your LDL which your bad cholesterol and they just a good fat that you should try and try and add to your diet polyunsaturated fats are also good for you your Omega 6 and Omega fries are polyunsaturated fats they can be found in the popular fish you know some like salmon and tuna so should try and get much of that in your diet as well what I try to do is I try to have a lot of more fish I have mackerel I have salmon quite frequently and that's why I get my you know my omega threes and six you could actually supplement Omega threes and six as well saturated fat saturated fat you should try and have less of saturated fat as normally from animal sources and it's solid at room temperature if you've ever seen Donna kebab and seen it when it's cold it looks gruesome you see that layer on top of it that greasy stuff a saturated fat increases cholesterol drugs up the arteries lead to heart disease something you should try and have lesser that leads me on to the four oh the poor and final fact that you should just has no health benefits whatsoever and you should try and avoid as much as you can and that's trans fats also known as hydrogenated fats or partially hydrogenated fats you'll normally see you know on a product when you pick it up you'll see contains no hydrogenated fat they're trying to point that out to you because it's just not good for you look out for that and try and avoid it try and get the healthy bit of good fats you know Betty acids that I mentioned in your your fish things like avocados and olive oil and nuts contain you know good fats monounsaturated fats so go for those up to you one with avocados avocados are packed with essential vitamins and minerals they are high in billings aid and receive in paid and eat not contain cholesterol or sodium low carb food has about nine grams of carbs about seven of those are fiber so it's net two grams of carbs avocados have a high potassium content actually more than bananas and bananas my favorite fruit as you know if you saw my last video definitely something you should add to your diet we now move on to my favorite green food at the undisputed king of the green food items for me olives olives are just there my favorite such a great addition to a meal and just boost the flavor just like that but I'm a gentleman I go out with my girl and we go to a restaurant I pulled the chair out I opened the car door I sit down after she is sat when the star comes take my time it's myself just so she can get her equal share of the star not when it's our lips when it's olives you Betty as quick as you can because I'm going to eat them all and very fast making a stir fry a handful of olives in it having some tuna that's a handful of olives in it although this can help reduce cholesterol in the blood great source of bitumen eat help lower your cholesterol essential vitamins and amino acids olives are just great add our loops to your diet man throw it in a salad or an omelet just make a meal and - a few olives in there and if you don't like olives I described that have been that but you know the fourth green on our list is broccoli this one's looking like a mini tree I normally boil it to be free I know people say oh you lose all the health benefits if you boil it and boil it to an inch of its life I just boil it to soften it a little bit you can steam it and can lightly fry as well I mean my girl makes this amazing cashew chicken which has broccoli in it and it tastes great in respect to the aforementioned greens it's not as quick to cook with the asparagus you know you can lightly fry it in minutes I have a card of you literally just chalk it up and - it in on it's literally fallen straight in or you can cook them real quick vocally does need some some cooking you know so you will have to steam it you will have to boil it for a while to soften it up depending on how you like it if you like a crunchy you won't have to cook it as long what we can help you lower your cholesterol the soluble fiber in broccoli - the cholesterol makes it easier to excrete Oakley is a great anti-inflammatory and may slow down damage to joint caused by osteoporosis which is good for us lifters as we kill our joint in our squats and all sorts of stuff where possible Adam Berkeley you will have to cook it up you know soften it to add it to your mail unless you like a crunchy it's all preference to be fair the fifth and final green on my list spinach spinach is amazing about a four reason then full of nutrients actually means Abe and BCE EK i mean you can go through the alphabet as iron has calcium it's a great source of flavonoids which act as antioxidants again helping remove free radicals which can lead to cancer i had spinach as much as i can saute it boil it a bit war I'll have it Mabel just 12 some for some spinach only have an omelet and put some spinach on or a big bag as finish and just add it to a meal you know actually had a meal today which was that consumer stir-fry I have my olives had some green peppers in there and I had spinach and it just tasted amazing you know it's just a great great food that you should have in your diet sum up the top five greens I have in my diet are asparagus avocados olives broccoli and spinach I think you should add them to your nose where possible if there's anything I haven't mentioned I'll put on screen and check them out you should research on them taste them if you haven't tried them and all there's certain people out there that haven't tried certain foods me I like to try everything so yeah probably isn't

hey guys I had someone say something to me yesterday that really like you know stuck in my mind I don't need to share with you so basically he in a passing comment we were reminiscing about where I used to Train where my still train electric leg and we're just reminiscing about being the old days in the atmosphere that it was like that when you know when I was busted still wasn't now but we just never listened and he said in a passing comment he said something like back when you was a nobody and I pulled him up quickly when you said that and I said I was waving somebody we always somebody you know and you know I I left at that and I don't think she meant any anything by it those are my listen he's coming but it was something that stuck with me because we are always and we will always be somebody we always somebody the amount of followers you have or your fame or you know the the accolade that you get for things that you do in life don't make you somebody you're always somebody you know things people need to realize that from the get-go and that could also be a stumbling block come from people that stops them from achieving because they feel that they are not where we are they're not somebody you know and that the people that do achieve things are somebody there is there is there to be admired there to be desired you know and there to be applauded people are to be applauded when they do good things you know but to assume that if you're not on the guest list or your names nothing like so you're not you're not on the movie screens you're not performing in front of thousands as an entertainer that you're not somebody is just like that's never been my channel for it's never been something it's never been in my mind that I am NOT somebody I'm always somebody I always was always will be I want everyone to know that I believe that in themselves you're somebody these Instagram people that we follow yes we admire some they do and they inspire us but you are still somebody we're all in this together we're here to inspire each other I can be inspired by anyone it really stuck with me when he said that of deception next we aren't somebody until we're famous I've never believed that it's the same message of always been trying to convey in my videos but a lot of videos we're trying to explain to you guys that self belief has to be from the beginning it's not when you've achieved your goal you know you have to believe that you're able to achieve your goal from the beginning you have to believe that you're somebody from the beginning you don't become somebody because you did something unless I really wanted to get course I've tried to do in other videos what I've said to you guys you know that you know if you want to achieve something you have to believe in yourself and you have to believe that you can do it that's something on its own but just the whole thing of believing that you are important role importantly Instagram can confuse people with that because the number of followers someone has can can really influence others to feel that that makes them what I don't know you know I mean I'm not complaining about having a lot followers it means I can spread my message to a bigger pool of people perfect you know and draw more products of course as we all do and it means I've got more people to access and more people to share my message with but that doesn't put me on a pedestal of importance when I meet people expose and then sometimes they surprise always down-to-earth your humble etc etc no I'm just regular it's like I'm ready I'm like you you know I'm happy that people come to meet me it's great you know and I love compensating with people had people come to me expose and say you know I met this person and they have rampion this person did we acknowledge my presence you know and that again goes to the whole thing of being a somebody because was probably happened there is a person who thought they were nobody gained some followers thought they then became somebody and then saw themselves cut above everyone else and then all of a sudden everyone else is regular and I'm the special person that's not been how I've ever looked at things and yeah I want you guys look at things that it will somebody so such a basic thing but just make sure you not thinking now everyone else is special and you know I become someone I have to be famous you are important role important we are always somebody 
[Music] I need to be successful and like um it doesn't matter what it is I'm glad to I will study and I would be good at what I need to be good at you know I'm you know that's that's what it comes down to there's anything ability is there anything that you're aspiring to be doing it all needs to be done to gain you know study practice want to be this you know you see me training you guys some of you is not the passion you might be studying to be a doctor you might be studying to be a you might even be wanted to be a fireman and you know that the that the cost of the environment is so hard and you wanna pass it make sure you pass it do what you need to do in the gym posse [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] barring injury in training I know people I didn't enjoy in it and when you just bounce off each other this is what so much just a passionate assistance enjoy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that had the same passion and it's like I know that some of you are building and that's what it's all about so this whole kid is about [Music] I'm always the type of person to if if I could if I find something that I can delicately and I've used that is where me all you can tell someone else crying and I want and I just hope that they feel they love with it and I as opposed to just sleep [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] on the power PP achieving in evident do you know by item tonight I didn't [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] finally out of the house to the pages you know you can leave the house and then you end up doing all these little bits and bobs that just keep you and then you realize I could out respond before you even left without see my baby I'm not gonna lie to you every morning so far since I've gotta like this I can't believe that she's mine and she's there every morning look at amazing this cautious [Music] [Music] okay how many staples now for fine I'm looking for I've got a feeling I'm gonna leave here with much more than I bargained for because now I'm seeing a lot of stuff that I could have in the office so I'm definitely gonna be leaving with more stuff than I actually came to get documents trays I need these I need these so I put the paper I was gonna get on some more stuff but to be honest when you check on Amazon you realize that the price difference is crazy so instead of me picking up stuffing now might as well just go on Amazon and get collection stuff that all matches but a desk rather than picking up a bit here bit they're paying more and it not matching you know plus I think it Chanel's input as well because it is gonna be her desk as well while sharing so yeah I did a couple the other ones I picked up a paper which is what I came out for so heading back on so this is the softest arrived this is this Shannon I go up in it together but it's two-man job or two-person job so I see okay okay so I'm system pissed right now just as I was about to start with Collin they start who went outside Oh sends back why don't you actually struggling with the door struggling will she get the door and she we help her let's help her it's helped them to get into the DA anyway just as I was saying yeah just about to record and she has to be hoovering outside and she's taking flipping ages she's been there for like 10 minutes Hoover in the same spot and I can't stop until she's gone it's Jim Tanner shoulders day and when we get back we're gonna put the table together so we can finally have our office looking at it's supposed to do they're not looking like a little full of bits and bobs and wicker Braca so yeah we're gonna train come back sort that table out we're gonna save a food trip for tomorrow which I'm going to film actually it's gonna be a cool video then I'm gonna show your souls and it's film a food shot the first feature up in military so I'll see how much food we can get in there see if we can you see if it is really an everyday driver car you know okay generally I love training so it's one of the muscle groups there you can clearly outline each part of the muscle and hit it you know so I always start with presses so when I started could even be like a military press or it could be a dumbbell press or in this case it was a machine press I use the same principle that I always have you know so I work my way up pyramid up go real heavy get to a stage where I'm doing maybe can even be like four reps for six reps nice and heavy I will hit that as many times as I thought I can you feel it effectively you know I think that's the unites where the growth happens that's where you know my strength increase and gains are made and then I'll work my way back down I do like to hit two different types of the presses so hey you see me pressing behind the net so I like to press behind the neck a lot of people don't do it you know they could say that it's not good for you it's a push your neck in a precarious position for me I've always done it I keep safe I start lat and I'll make sure my turn one point and I'd do it quite safely you know it's a good exercise so here you see me inside leverage now there's a bit of a swing and that's for you know I always tell people if you're gonna go super heavy and some points it's not gonna look pretty so I'm hitting my front delts with some front raises like I said with shoulders you really can target all the muscles in the muscle group it might be a little bit of a swing but it's fine now these are the things that they own a personal trainer wouldn't teach you because they're a personal trainer as I was once before we teach you perfect form after the perfect form and you build the foundations you want to get the extra strength and that extra muscle you're gonna want to throw the way up a little bit safe that's fine I always finish off with some heavy shrugs drugs are my staple for building traps I've used them for many years for my use is quite foot tempo I'm gonna shoot baby so we just finished our session and it was a big solar session kind of took a lot a long time watch we took so long today already cuz I know we start around fossa yeah after four definitely after four finished to calculation I don't know sense sciences you know what that's because I was enjoying staying here calculation was feeling good to finish don't just feel sharp I started to get used to the sat-nav it keeps talking man for no reason whatsoever so I need to go through the the manual and try and get it to stop I've tried to go through the options earlier [Music] well done and it took about what time is it said it took about an hour all done in took about an hour another one another one complete is now 10 past 10 and this is what time Hey so we've done to two of these things so then the shelving unit in the living room and you know just done this we've got like two more but I'm only gonna do one more tonight so tell me you know [Music] another one another one this my too lazy to put his up and watch you're still in the box [Music] [Music] 
of all this several share ways Airbus a380 for our mission together thanks for getting us are probably time to say all the doors are closed up ten minutes out of schedule many of you have majority you have got connected right off with partners in spaces around our network that means I'm such a bright enough okay so I'm going to car head into the hotel which is in Ghent which is should be next to the gym and we're going to eat begin the again and in rest before do the camp which is basically going to be me training hard how are you do and ask the questions while at while I do that and then plan secure names of them takes pictures with them and sad posters exception so should be the day rift I just go when I feel I don't I can go for the next step yes Hey I am was a fire rips and then when I get to a certain pack weight I know challenge me like 50 mice I stayed there for little laughter as I've done that sick I've done the 60 twice Tom why I'm aiming for is to get those hippie since those are the ones that I feel will add to master and add to my golf the heavy six so that's the 50s and a sixty that I've done or force its level and I go up and then I cream it back down most of the time if you like to work your way up so wait let me do handles you should be fine I bring more people going to you today it's because they're trying to go hit me and they strain who watches an electrical source for me I start back and work my way up and I put if you're doing behind leg presses the movement needs to be controlled by the progress of an art investor on rubber I could pull down my dad it'll swing your finger now I hope you mess around when doing behind a new Christmas of my ass keep it light keep the default let's get the full raisin he what's wrong I don't we check my obliques is my obliques I pass him up on this prominently I need to keep my back if I can I'm fine and that's a fact that's how this new person that's how I go back and keeping everything balance back without that that's what we say that you should um this is the condition I stay in year-round and I'm able to manage that because of you know their - it's that I'm at now who said things just everything sick so like you're still trying to find you know about it or find where you want to just all you know sit on a certain goal except right then you need to make sure you hit that golf and do that the best way you can unless you know keep a track of English enough the best never swap done yeah - 75 kilos if the heaviest deadlift sticks on a hotplate so lightweight one swimmer yeah 20 coffee and then bench see now we bitch I was able to do five plates before but I never ever tried this was nine years ago I never tried it without a spot so I wouldn't claim that way I would say so then they found the duct I said by four and a half but I'm glad these days as before or four or five four plates on the fire so all soaking them one night you know like I can pull that off normally every week but yeah there was a time when I did the band I feel like if I trade towards it I could probably do 5 against I train towards it while under threat or a wanted appointment from fans here yeah but if for those kind of lips if you're really trying to see your match you have to be consistent with it now for me bench press one day could be bench went flat bed special bubble and then sometimes I'll go to to dumbbell as the first exercise if you're gonna try and increase that that and one with max you get every week various events and uses every all the other exercises that bunch of YouTube interests you know so I'm like when I did that 280 deadlift it was a while back when I was doing within and then pump up my gym and so I trained for that hello van up going up going up if I continued on a probably up to 300 you know the peanut peanuts but now I do then this on my back sessions but it's just another part of my back deck it's not you know we try to get it get way up I mean there were days when I was chasing max lips on everything and now I like to certain amount certain way says know that my powers still there but me I'm everything's more building on a hollow I suppose specific it's just them the exercises you've seen today that normally say for example if I was to start my first black alone when I talk about the compound is I start with today I did shoulder press Sydney until now it could be military sixth and you know this just happens to be yesterday although I do do most of my in my lap raises and my blood fundraisers I like to sit down just talking all heavy extra heavy when sitting down sometimes over the first few 610 number the heavy six purchase it now just a preference also when I did them when I made that change to do legs twice a week the power on the legs went down a little bit because of the less recovery time so I'm it's choosing about my bearings at the moment is Rolf not necessarily the strength wake up the legs so and you know I hit them twice a week so I'm going to look in that recovery to really lock that biggest on the summer squash I'm always shocked heavy in the same tempo with solemn just so you know people have their own ingots on waves up there idiot some people do it nice and slow use lightly on poker at the top some people though this others which I wouldn't advise it just might be enough stopping she warned shoulders cool but my way is gonna see now that tempo is temple always done back to God I said yes I can you mine are quite black so you don't really they don't stand up I have seen where just wants to be you know read war and some people not visually appealing you know but for me I don't do anything like I don't they don't they'll not make it through okay let me explain how that movie I took off for me also part of our mission I started training at the age of 16 and at that point I thought I was that college and it was at home you know so I started just a dumbbell I remember walking through college and I saw this guy that is being ripped and I was fascinated I'm proud together and they said you know I trained at home and I think using the back there during the off time I went to local shops you know dumbbells that have to submit yes I will go and then I had my first sessions and I love I have my music blaring I'll start moving upstairs battle girls and some short dresses and had the feeling I was like this was great and at that point I was just doing that bicep curl shoulder presses press up shelters at Google oh ho I did that for a short while and we're all about model understood you know seniors say your skinniest leaning daddy now and his pregnant came around one day I've been training for a little while he's like whoever's you know it has getting late and then when I had that realization that you know it wasn't just an exciting enjoyable spindles we actually had an impact on volt so literally after hearing that comment that that feedback for me and up to the mood for oconee I have both kidney heart so I played for a good few years and I did the regular things that people do I went to I went to college I went to and uni of studies and at that time I've got a degree in Boozer and but then I felt most of those summers I did when I was like to get me into that very clear start from the photos of and so that was what I was studying but I thought that I wanted to be more involved in the fitness because I was landed on Fitness which other students from the site at home so I actually left and went to come across some trainers so I'm a personal trainer for two three years but then I had a little battle I employed cluster training and enjoyed in the gym I felt like I wasn't you know using the skills that I've learned in schooling at college also I just had a complete change in career and when it's finance so studying together camel I've got a job as a training accountant in counsel firm and no job and work in finance for schools files doing that for you know two to three years but still changing see I think someone else asking something cut out can you can you Henrich ooh like a physique like this when appeals you you said that when you have lots of other stuff to do I have to do I was working my nine-to-five yeah and training it was literally out I go to work you might nine-to-five soon as I finish I'll go straight to the gym after the gym and I'm still studying accountancy so I'll go home studying my accounts and then I have my free time so you could always fit in even back when I was going to uni I was doing a 30-minute Friday and then I was working on weekends as a bouncer on door knock knock knock so literally you can imagine I'm standing - quietly working weekends and I still change because the training is something I realize I've got only so with those that say no oh some of the things ideas are you know I don't have the time like you do I don't have this my whole physique was built through doing the things everyone else the same college savings indentified if you want to do it you will do it you know what I we knew that go to the gym and then you see people change everyone from all sorts of backgrounds you've got lawyers doctors firemen you know everyone has a job you know and yes some people their whole life and business is business - now but that doesn't mean that I've suddenly woke up with muscles and kind of businesses fall into my lap know I'm black my in respect to business so I believe in doing that two years but I've been training 13 you know so that's that we ready just building my body will you thank busy it's not I've had all this you know people think you have some time in the world and they also think that you spend your whole life in the gym no you saw my session just laughs that's my session that's that's the training back I modeled after that the rest of the date Mike to do to do a work on my business or do everywhere else I mean when I was doing I mapped by this would be that hour and half and then you know the bessel it takes a day you know so in respect to building a career out of it while doing my nine-to-five I felt that I had this experience from the personal training there all the experience from the years of training I had and I felt the attack I wasn't able to share it in London in a personal training so what were he books and I launched a Facebook page and I designed and launched my website and I watch some blogs on just given information of the stuff that I knew you know so I dispel a few myths you know lack um we've got the mid-block then you know go up things wanted to wanting to build a bigger bigger button and stuff like this so much stuff thrown around they don't know and head out the truth you know I did a blog on that I did a blog on apps the fact that you get people in the gym that haven't yet dropped them did their body fat that I change absolutely which it's not necessarily a complete waste of time but it's the fact that they're never going to see them and the other side adhere so I just tried to give information on the things that I knew about and literally um I'm doing that the the the following spider well there was long you know magic or secret to it was just I put those blogs out people enjoyment in them and people started to follow and then it just grew we would grew and then I started to do these seminars you know around around well so far I literally these seminars have taken me from one side of the world run to the other Athens and the rally up under the India quake all over all over everywhere and MN a little guys it seems that the ones that coming up it's everywhere hello Logan states and it's been great in terms of being able to to motivate people here and and the feedback that I get just gives me a great buzz you know like I think one that I was wearing some answers to some interview questions for some magazines you see me in one it was what is would you get more satisfaction and what's what's been your biggest achievement and then obviously people expecting to hear are things I can run this show on it like one muscle in New York these things like this are amazing for me glove up I've been packing labs which you can treat that you know nothing else is going to beat that and actually water and those the more of these I do the more my name of following roles the more fortunately I've got to interact with people and just build passion for training you know I love that when I hear someone talk to me and they have that passion I get excited that's that's what today I hope the day by yourself I mean like I've tried to do the preparation but then I just end up people like - too soon talk to me real quick when I was doing I like to fight I did do because I had to you know because I'm at work so I need to have one little step so but now when I when I have to go into an office so I don't I just cook when I need to me but I'm yeah when I when I had to you know be at a job or something bad yeah we'll the set who said favorite muscle group legs legs and back leg sessions are just the best ever if I could have quicker recovery I will do legs three times a week to my cousins you know but they're not my sessions locations are the best assist this is where you get to put the most step with the most aggression like everyone knows leg days are just killer so yeah I love licking and with the pen back magnet of the buckle your legs it muffin I'd say it's most of it is pretty much the same I'm sort of you for the great balance to Zeke looking for mass symmetry I'm looking for definition and when you sense more what's the term use so we have intention whatever that's routine but that's really not your whole mouth like there that's because last winner wants to be more of a shot as well but where the judges are concerned you're most walk with the majority of your hearts still comes from your physique the pageantry or the shuttle you get mark on that but it's still about what physique you know you're the jockey of your marketing your physique and then you know you get back for your Emma your your post holder which can be and then muscle in your shoulder I actually think it's great they try to make it your show and it's actually enjoyable for the crowd to watch you know that I've been to several shows this keeps the one in Vegas has coming up but maybe 500 to 600 compares and it's a shop assistants Vegas it's going to be a big show of services it's good watch but you're joggin your mark is still straight down to symmetry with mass and the definition and okay thank you guys that was a great talk abou great to be here great to Train impractical you and and showing exactly what I do I mean you seen videos and stuff by doesn't you know long get to see it like that so this has been amazing and lateral you

along I will take a look it yeah to launch a company a brand in for bumps and then do it Expo is such a big feat but we did it the anticipation was crazy because this is you know pay a lot for it it's a it's your first launch you know you want everything to be perfect the things that weren't ready I got ready and made admin just make it work basically because I was I was I wanted to panic that was the refreshment on my list we need an area that is big enough to facilitate and the photos and the meet and greet you know the signing of of all graphs etc with all the ambassador's managed to open up a much bigger space where we could do that it's got rap it's fun just really not to bid rate may about that 10 turn up today yes I see tracking that phone Oh another training session we're probably now Colin Wayne into had arrived and so myself calling Wayne and Leo went to go smash shoulders he did I bump into the gym Jay Cutler it wasn't the first time I've seen him I've seen I've seen him many times in an adult gym in Venice I'd always been you know zoned in my workout he seemed to resolve in his so I'd never had a chance to introduce myself by anyone's man you know he's the most humble genuine guy he literally walked around the reception area shaking anyone's hand green and genuine green genuine green newsroom you know not just not for show he genuinely was was wanted to introduce himself to him I know we went to train at emporia which is a gym that opens itself for all the attendees of body power I really want to give a little to commend them because they let everyone train free massive has been which is which is just great like and they also provided food like divided meals for everyone I'm after your session they provided free workout the provided protein shakes or just complimentary you know work with one national website indices and in his J massive my separate expertise on men super sir let's open so you guys already ate yeah your food around the expo yeah day one of the expo I understand is now setup we have we have the space that I needed but nothing is ready with the hooks that we need to hang clothes on or non-existent the the electricity set set up for the screen didn't exist they let the screen the next screen wasn't even there um to sum it up we were at the expo it was open in time so it started and we weren't ready we really weren't ready and what's happening people are flooding in and they're understanding you know ready to go they were limited to go and we were I'm not gonna lie I brought myself because I want like at that moment um you could just have a panic and stress out but what we do we had to address the crowd and ask them to give us some time to set up as we need it the only thing I could do with be compose and try and make it work I looked around everything looks out the guys looked at me allows that yeah let's do it let's go BAM this crowd started coming in we have to formulate a orderly queue and then it was just non-stop from there after the first hour or two it was just we're in business my I took my position to take pictures of people and I didn't leave everything just kicked up I was supposed to you know I was I was I was genuinely happy to meet every person that I met and I'm going to continue to do that I'll continue to try and try and inspire people to do better you know that's what it's about success is setting a plan implementing that plan and and hitting that goal and that that means you can be successful several times like at like throughout your life every day you can be successful just by setting a plan implementing it following it through an achievement agile I've just seen the transformation food drives amazing yes my posts relate a lot to Jim I'm not talking about Jim when I'm trying to get people but I'm kind of push people in the comments people are saying you know oh yeah because you know um I hope you're saying and they relate it to Jim and I'm like I wasn't talking about Jim at that point I'm trying to get you to realize you can do this in everything there's a million other guys with great physique but the only way that you know you're gonna engage of the people is you need to give them your personality they need to know what you're about so after the chaos and the hard work of the expo day1 it was time to train and I had the pleasure of training with Kai green diamond in Bank her husband Rob Bradley Barton Ulysses and Kris Gethin what session man yeah get you that does that that doesn't happen often like that rarely happens that so many people in the industry get together and train like that it was awesome the way wet um we did kind of split it up a bit so that we weren't waiting too long or getting cold because I said obviously that's a lot of people so um you know you'll have for example Bradley lying and whap killing some fool downs on one side and myself kind of creamed and darling baby killing I see wrong the other body well it worked so well and we killed it we kill a powerful session powerful session bouncing off each others energy the training that we had the energy was intense but the gym that the vibe in that gym at that moment was crazy I mean when we when we actually went into the gym it was already done else people everywhere and everyone was working out on it was such and such I always remember that that that session not just a couple the people I got to train with but because of the energy in that gym of that day our skinny one that was there that Jim was pumping Jim was really pumping that was great session awesome this is day 3 day 3 I'm excited because the last last two days have been great yesterday was amazing you know I don't even think them and if I'm atop Friday Friday was good like yesterday she's crazy I love Jews last day at the expo we the anticipated is going to be even more crazier than the first except this time we we were ready in terms of organization in terms of structure and we've learned we've learn loads from the day before it was pictures non-stop meeting the fans non-stop I mean I didn't leave my stand I don't want to leave my stand you know um because if the position I was in I could see the queues backing round the whole stand and I couldn't I couldn't bring myself to walk out of that position where they can see me and they're waiting to take picture the organization you can tell we're up til up to level 100 percent from the day before we've got so appreciative of the patience of the crowd because when when I said patience I mean some of these people were there for four hours you know so I spoke to some people when they got to me and I said I wait two hours which you know I was thinking wow man wait two hours but I don't know what to say you know but they they took so um they were they were happy to do that they were happy to do that happen to wait that long sorry for we have to do it give away we have to do a crazy give away and you know what Joe when we when we did that give away we did it because we were so appreciative of the patients we we didn't put a limit with what we were gonna fall out we were just gonna get the stuff ready and just fall out as much as we could this guy my story last night College what do you do and he said oh I just live the home this is the guy but now would it be that now after getting back from the expo and relaxing for Laura um when the whole team met in the lobby of the hotel and started with a large chill out a bit wanted to go eat and relaxing more celebrate celebrate a successful trip a successful first export I don't know speaks to me I was wanting to get little fan hello Gotham energy to the shoe wherever the aspirations were but this time knowing that they can do it and knowing that the formula is sinking you staying focused and working on a mutation actually given that formula let them know it works by seeing I do and then taking that and using it with whatever the aspirations are way past bodyboarding way past fitness so you know like I said in work in everything and if they can I can do that very month and for happy you 
[Music] okay we are about to set off we are going into track mode let us go this would be a fun drive okay so we are doing a review I want we give you all for the McLaren 572 had it for a week now that was nice [Music] that's why I'm trying I forgot I forgot to raise the front so I don't know if you heard that scream nice factors absolutely let's get some air corny it's 14 today such 25° very kind of foreign tongue very beautiful day as with most days driving move on and drive which is a very famous drive very fingers rude that people take just a lot winding turns and quick scenery should be nice too that's great really did piss me off you know when you're heading straight for a park off and have a little bit and just hope for the best I really do hope it hasn't done any damage I really did forget raise the forum which I'm gonna get to later one you can't make some fun [Music] just need to remember to do it I'm sure you guys heard that his car is so powerful so powerful absolutely beautiful to drive the mains power on tap joke sucks my box which changes gears effortlessly [Music] it's gonna be a dream [Music] oh and the brakes in this car are fantastic it comes to be real fast and great just as fast this Huxley yesterday me the thing about this car these unlike other supercars it gives you confidence for an amateur driver like myself I'm not gonna pretend I'm not well first we've driving supercars I have driven a few just a handful I've given the Huracan which I had for a week and I will give you some notes on but this one is very easy to drive so much power naught to 60 in this guy is frequent acceptance [Music] I will test it with the launch like I said as an amateur job in his car now you should just get straight in it straightening it and go there's no faction about as you'll just notice there there's a few potholes in the road the McLaren GT handles it perfectly is likely this is the suspension on this car they've definitely made an everyday car that pretty much anyone can drive fantastic smooth from Marcis a dream to drive an absolute dream now what's right now we are trying and in this fantastic so well in and out of the turns she sticks to the world she's just like that mr. power where I'm going to give you a forward view of the car had a four week so you know I shall be able to give you a detailed description of what it's like to own this car and to drive it every day because I do drive it every day I use it to get me to the gym [Music] we've had a fantastic time driving I said we me about if I just exact driving is you know we've been going through the ins and outs of the Hollywood Hills and it's been fantastic really giving me an opportunity to test the car I mean you don't get the opportunity driving down the freeways of the traffic and LA traffic is crazy if I haven't said it already it is absolutely crazy and I've got loads of warnings about it and cuz I've traveled here a few times I didn't think anything of it but it really is bad you know when you live in here and you're having to go down the road just to grab one item and you're stuck in traffic for half an hour just to go down the road it can be a nuisance but we're here at the Hollywood Hills dave has not been any traffic it has just been winding roads and I've had a fantastic Drive it has given me the opportunity to you know really see what the car can do you know it is like I said on the the footage that you're gonna see inside the car it handles like a dream it sticks to the corners it's just just a fantastic car and for an amateur to drive you can just it is not very there's not many supercars that amateur can just get in and drive so well and you know like I said you in the video I've driven a few supercars but not that many just a handful you know I've driven in a SLS I've given a hurricane and this was by far the easiest to drive you know it's just like you it performs like crazy but his soul easily manageable for anyone you know so it's a fantastic car I've had it for over well over a week now and I'm just gonna show you the you know what I got for my money and what it can do you know and that just got so many so many features ok just on the exterior guys I got the stealth wheels the black stuff wheels I had to get black wheels you know on every car that I've had I've had that wheels you know before my Audi eight know from my Audi a3 back like one of my first cars I had a black gallows on that I then had black bellows on my TT had black delays on my s5 and I've got that hello my McLaren GT and it looks beautiful it's not actually black it's like a carbon kind of color it looks amazing the other thing that I did was aside from getting the black Pinsir I got these red details pin stripes down the side of the skirts and what I did was I do want to go all to two of it I could have actually got the whole back all you know every single bit I wanted just a little outline and I think that it adds to it perfectly just gives it an awesome look you know and also got the stuff perhaps so we've got the black pipes at the back again had the opportunity to have it along along there but you know I just wanted to keep it you know less is more sometimes you know I just had a little rim there and yeah it just gives it a unique look you know a really unique look i friggin love it so okay so firstly we have the dihedral doors so you thought Lamborghini doors and scissor doors you got the walls or the suicide doors here we have dihedral doors from McLaren which is amazing also look at its back so we've got these button here what is that open what does that you that opens the front boot or trunk as they say you know I should get with the lingo where I'm at so the trunk is absolutely huge and I mean huge and I had the Huracan for a week and you could barely fit more than your sports bag in it well I thought my sports bag unit that was it had space for one bag of shopping yeah I've got all my golf all tools you'd only see that buck hey I've got my sports bag and I've also got the McLaren cover that I got with them when I purchased the car I'm going to show you some more stuff that I got with the car later on but that is the trunk space by now you guys should have seen my shopping in a McLaren video where you can see just how much shopping and groceries you can get in there also is a trunk at the rear we have more storage fantastic how fantastic is that and we also have these these hooks you can tie your luggage down make sure it's secure doesn't fly and hit you in the face you know fantastic love there absolutely love that the funny thing is I haven't used it yet so in terms of practicality I bought this car specifically for you know well apart from the performance which is amazing I'll tell you about I bought it for the practicality you know and I wanted this second trunk at the back and I haven't actually used it in my day to day driving and I've driven it every day you know I've given it to the gym I've done shopping in it and I just haven't had to use that that is because the front trunk is so big I'll show you this while I'm here how did you get in it it's funny because when you go take the car to a valet they they go like this and they don't want to ask it's funny they don't want to ask how do I open the door so they feel around you're feeling around and you don't tell them cuz eventually they get it and then they then they see they fill the bar and then there's a button give it click window goes down and the doors just glide the doors black it's it's so such a soft mechanism it's like he just glides and it's got soft clothes as well so you know so here the finger bat MacLaren's they all work I think they've pretty much all the new ones anyway have this carbon frame you know this carbon frame this shell you feel it's it's light as hell and you just feel protected it's fantastic and then you've got these huge air intakes to cool the engine the engines in the back so you've got a shoot air intake and you know it's funny it's like sounds like a jet engine sometimes when you and you're just idling and you come out of the car and you can hear it calling down and just what's that noise and you just hear a big gust of air trying to call this at the back here we have the 3.8 liter v8 engine pumping 570 horsepower things about 562 but they round it off to 507 and it is vast it is amazing it's a great engine and that's what we've got enough in the back so if you guys come over with me now I could hide this but I'm not embarrassed to show it I bought one of these why I got one of these I mean I drove this car for a long distance and maybe it's because I did some heavy deadlifts yes I'm a body roll out I train I train hard I train my lower back hard and my lower back was killing me when I did a long drive in this so I bought one of these and ever since I've got it I've done many long drives and it's been fine so you know I'm not ashamed to say that I've got one of these in the back seat so I got the red pinstripe so I've got the red stitching on my seats just to add a little bit of detail I wanted it black but got the red detail well what can I do these sunglasses are let me show you what I can do these sunglasses I don't want to I can tuck them away in these cool compartments where I already have my glasses cases is awesome you actually have it on both doors or I have it on the driver side and also have it on the passenger side on that side over there okay you have free three USB ports three what car do you know has free USB what's super Carleen hands-free suits USB ports so we go yeah one two three I can connect to any device with the interface okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start up for you [Applause] there you can see we have a digital dashboard and there is my car it's a shame it couldn't be my actual car in the same color and everything like that is my car I'm gonna show you how we started up okay so as with any automatic foot put on the brake and we have all these dials here I'll talk you through the douse I'm just going to show you how we start our up first and it's just simply pressing this button it's a digital dashboard which I love in cars you know and when I drop the hurricane had a digital dashboard as well love it and there's some that provides so much information there's so many things you can find out about the car also I want to show you something here so when you're choosing which mode you want to be in unlike most cars most cars you just now switch it to a sport normal etcetera and in a give and a go straight way but with the McLaren you can actually set the handling and performance and then it only works once you press active see when you turn the car into track mode they dip the dashboard actually gives you a racing car dashboard song see that fantastic I'll talk you through these buttons here here we have obviously a central locking system to lock the car this is for the rear trunk this is for the front trunk as it lacks launch button which I haven't used yeah and I can't wait to use but I'm not going to do it on you no longer doing something a way to I have a track-day and now I'm gonna really see if that nought to 60 time is 3.2 seconds which you know I'm sure it is so with most cars you have you know several buttons for your your aircon for your music everything everything in this car is all digital on this mini iris system which is touchscreen is fantastic so for example if I want to put some aircon on so the Sat Nav which you can operate just by clicking this button here I'm slightly disappointing because when I took off for a test drive I asked if it had an apple carplay which is fantastic I've used it on a Mercedes GLA that I was driving and it's just amazing the fact that you can connect up your phone just makes everything seem 'less they don't have it on the 570 GT but they do have it on the 720s but that was out on my but I really do prefer the apple carplay system this one I've started to get used to it you know they any sat-nav can be quite fiddly and this one is easy to operate but just doesn't provide as much information as I would like and that can make driving on the highway quite you know tedious at times so we have the media system so as again as I said there are free USB ports so if I just plug my phone in now what happens is you press this button the media button justice button home button and then media and any device that's connected in so right now I'm connected by bluetooth but if i i've actually got a few USB cables here now we're plugged in you're gonna see it pop up just here accessing database immunes iphone detected and there we have it so you can have three devices here and you can just connect to them and play music and the sound system is amazing by the way guys sam systems will see i've driven the car for well over a week now and i have not once fought there i am lacking space or lacking in areas that i would like to put stuff you know there's two drinks holders here there's one here and another here you know so actually there's more yeah I could probably get free drinks into food places and that's not been an issue I'm gonna show you guys some of the stuff that I got ok so what I really did look afternoon I mean it was my first time buying a brand new car from a showroom and it was a great experience we had champagne they had the car veiled which you guys have really seen from when I collected it was such a great experience but I also got so many little goodies so first we have a pamphlet from Newport Beach yes I met the owner and he was a great guy and very nice to me they treated me very well along with the my actual dealer Travis who took care of everything for me we have this this is the manual the big manual the other manuals in the car the little booklet but this is the big manual and I wonder who really is gonna read them it's like a Bible you know actually should read it because every now and then I'm wondering what a button does and if I read the book I'll know wouldn't know so I might actually have some bedtime reading checking this out aside from that you actually get the though as a serf some warranty but you've got a similar booklet this size that has isn't again another menu also on this beautiful booklet that is just pictures of the car and all the information about the line the Sport Series lying to the 570 the 540 and the 570 GT McCarran has its own magazine which is called project it's a quarterly magazine and I am now a member and these are my first free copies I got this wonderful book again it's just beautiful pictures of the McLaren I'm actually gonna take some shots to myself of my own car I can use as my screensaver you know this is the documents box that I got which also has my spare key as you can see right there and all my paperwork so yeah I mean the experience of buying the brand new car from them was just it couldn't have been any better you know it could have been any better I had a great time there and they looked after me [Music] I had the car for about a week and a half now and I love it I just love it this is everything that I'd hoped for plus more you know and again that the main thing about this car is the fact it's a supercar that can be driven every day and it really can be driven every day I take it to the gym I've gotten grocery shopping with it I've done everything just normal things of it which is which I didn't expect I would be able to do but you know I really can't so I love the car performance-wise it's fantastic it's absolutely exhilarating just then the engine the sounds the speed is crazy I'm gonna go on a track day and we'll record that so you can really see what the car can do and actually honestly speaking I'm not a super regular super car driver I'm new to this so I want to know what my car can do and I want to be taught what my car can do so I'm gonna seek a professional and just be taught how to really drive my car to the best of its ability and to the best of my ability so I'm looking forward to that and that will come soon peace guys stay tuned there will be more

[Music] [Music] hey guys so next day I did something different this weekend so instead of doing my usual squats decided to do something different salad to do some lunges Apple I just Bible in my back you know we all have our chains of London every now and then if you continue to outside now normally would do this in the summer and it's warm Sun south it's easy to breathe the air was fresh yesterday was cold yesterday was about four degrees Celsius which is about four degrees Fahrenheit yesterday was tumblr same I go back to see was the third set after two sets of the first seconds remarkably the second set was we just apart [Music] [Music] now Dalton maybe like it's flat it's not it's actually a site with so I mean [Music] it's coming back down [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's right folks [Music] this muscle come I would say probably about four bodies [Applause] so the air feels a lot fresher today it's cold the F don't spin you know subscribe blocked so starting today still gonna be circles [Music] but acceptance ezekiel's top one this one poster this thing fast [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let my taking is cold a mrs. Harmon Harmon and hardly dare stop every time you stop you think that they'll help to get your breath back with something worse as your hearts just [Music] this is something I do every now and then just add some variation to the workout I enjoy the challenge of most end of workout if we don't have sign before because of the talks will take it out it's a big building outside projects on like a second course in every region filter barbell weights downstairs to do if I'm walking lunges in the gym because at the end look worked out and we do laps laps and lapsing laps back and like I said it's it does go to a form of cardio because then we probably get to the other side the Hawks racing I mean they're feeling the burn like your heart space and then it's just you know keeping that pain sleep in that place we like to do it new trend as well so that were training people do let's say poor people and follow that train get to the other side so the last person tries but it doesn't matter where it falls back in still to the other side I've stopped we've gotta keep you gotta keep going so I stopped you can do with your departments that means quite low especially because when you get to the other side and your partner is really you have to say you need to go I need to go over to need to go so on and it's business it's a really good fun way of killing your legs at the end of the workout I said funny it's very painful it's very very tiring when collapse of retirements corporate greed if you do it many laps reading for sure but it's very lonely something that I think is great to finish a leg workout from the last public was as great for groups there's this big you know fascination those exploiting for their groups what's our parent reviews with way that leads luncheons is having groups as well so for the ladies out there as much as you do in your squats really those lunches work because they're just as effective someone maybe add this to your to your LinkedIn account commands around YouTube bunch of space and something this is great way of killing groups typical fires burning those books 
[Music] guys is back day for my favorite days I'm actually gonna try unstoppable USA so I'm the first person to try this and I'm gonna see if it gives me a crazy workout which I'm after so let's have a look lovely two scoops already one enough but it tastes good let's go as of every exercise almost exercise I always say start with the bar get the movement correct before stopping [Music] [Applause] [Music] well of all used to be a staple in Miami that day exercises but you know now our deadlift at the beginning of most packing back exercises I don't like to do the two on the same day because that's a lot of them stress on the lower back so I'm leaving to deadlift I'm gonna do a bit over walks inside will necessarily do a lift into a bathroom in overwatch so it's been a while since I've done it but on a very good day could go up to four plates so I don't see how this set goes to the food plate and I work from there you guys are wondering what if it's a gumption why would you wear come short to train well if you clench your teeth like I do when it gets heavy you don't have a you don't break the t4 push your mouth so that's why I got gum shield on for the heavy sense [Music] don't you see that we did um one plate to play not only one one and a half to four the de free plate with the three and a half did the field half twice actually I'm going back down to the free play so as you guys know a new high volume and there's an offset a lot of heavy sets so I'm you know there are free play and a three and a half of the heavy set so they would constitute of about four offices you know and then I'm also work my way back down [Music] would be more effective barbell or dumbbell for for wolves yeah I always say it's a mix of different roles different pull downs for back for that day that they normally start with deadlifts nice big compound exercise today decided to start a bit over worlds cuz I haven't done them for a while so you know it's nice to start with them but yeah then you want to do a combination of pull downs and whirls your lat pulldown the basic lat pulldown is a staple in a back there exercise we're gonna get onto that after this you know barbell rows single arm walls I wouldn't say one is better than the other I would say to mix and match and you know do one one day do another the other you know yeah it's not really about better it's about just getting different angles you know so I I do I do simple are most I love single are most I always do see no nose but I would mix between do an event overall or single at work hold a necessarily do both from the same day you know cuz I'm gonna hit our angle a cool-down wide on the hill a cool-down close or I might even hear like pull down reverse you know so yeah I guess it's important always watch out well there yeah sure sure I mean I always say that your there are a few staple exercises like you deadlift in your your barbell bench press in them your regular barbell squats etc they estate them they should be in your routine regardless but then there's loads of our exercises to mix and match I said to finish 20 you know so people ask our what rep range should I be doing for me I get a mix I'll do a light light weight to start off with as I always say I like to warm up so you know that was our start I have to start with a barber he had one plate for 20 reps second set was a out of the ten allows for 15 then with your two plates four to twelve and then just went up and up and up sometimes not even go to like a freeway for for it even with this exercise but today I wasn't feeling it so I just did the three-and-a-half place for six reps you know yeah that's that's pretty much my strategy with no strings okay so we're done here gonna move on to that pool there a typical thing that mistake that people make with this exercise is when they start like because there's like not that much weight on it they just fall around so they'll put all the way down there that's not where the exercise that's not how you do the exercise this exercise we're supposed to pull it just below your chin there and then come back up even if your range can take you all the way down there you don't want to be down there you want control grips just below you to even touch the test or not you can touch your chest why the idea is just to get it below your chin [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we do eight steps and you like free sets going up to heavy and then it's not set it's not rigid it's not rigid like that it's basically warm-up sets heavy sets and I'm a few to finish off so that's just a basic principles then the number of dogs heavy set isn't specified for example if I go heavy and I'm feeling real good I might do five sets of heavy wake even going up depends how I'm feeling you know but the general rule is I'm warming up I call heavy and then I go back down but it's a lot of setting like I won't be like on to too heavy sets or three heavy set ease as far as long as I've got that energy I want to bang out there's none of them with the energy so if I can keep going and keep getting those reps and getting the from getting the sets in I'll so I'll keep doing it so even though eight says sometimes isn't as rigid it can be you can go up to ten even more you know just depending on how I'm feeling won't because of the heavy set our websites oh okay I've bought two six a four to six rep yeah would be heavy you know it also should I should say on one to six because sometimes I don't go for one right max not an exercise like this is out the city to do a pilot max on a cool down but um on some exercises like a deadlift for example we've got a bench press yeah like a vehicle one real compound [Music] [Applause] the whole history between sets good question first time I've never had a set rest time you know like a 60 seconds or one minute I basically rest for as long as I need to perform the set effectively so if I need a longer break I'll take longer because I know that I want to perform the set some of the best of my ability do you I mean so if I don't have the energy to go back in there's no point doing it because I'm not going to get the ripstop after you know so well I won't whisper too long but I rest enough that I can perform the SEC tably you know it's funny because on people always looking for the magic exercise so people will ask what's the best exercise for back for why back etc and things like that the things they don't consider is the foundations like your your lap pool down for example are there our used for reason and it's not necessary Varian factors we've a basic exercise like this because I could do this and someone else could do this and say you know I do that cool down why isn't my back like you know growing what it is it's altered with consistency it's also to do with intensity and volume so for example I could have done this to exercise and down three to four sets and I'll be finished now instead what's that my own now probably fifth or sixth you know it's this differences even in basic things like this you know the volume you know and then I could have done three or four sets of twelve and it moved on you know there'll be a difference between some one two three four to twelve and me doing eight sets of varying weight to real heavy you know that make the difference so little things can make a difference you know [Music] [Music] so would you typically get about four exercises each workout yeah for our four exercises there's some people that I just for exercise I said yeah for exercise an 8/10 extra [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] a lot of people are they a lot emails people asking them how do I get my back wider my back has no fitness excetera has no width to it and what you've Warbler say to you is especially to the younger guys I was training it will come in time I remember when I'd already been training for a few years and I just didn't have that whiffed on my on my back and you know I used to think why why why do I not have a big backpack I mean I'll train back just like everyone else James back but I think it's just time inconsistency because obviously in time I've now got you know quite formidable back you know and it's just just staying consistent making sure you're doing the right things so you know for the whiffed you're gonna go for cooldowns you know and thickness so always remember well with is prudence why cooldowns you know the exercise I'm doing right now lat pull-downs etc and then thickness remember it's all the walls and also the bent-over well see it well Dumbo evolved to give you that real fitness you know so basically I'm just saying don't worry it will come do the right things be patient and it will come slow gonna come overnight you know it's gonna take a while back you know it will come yeah so nervous this is lovely black man in industry Jay Cutler you know I admired for far from knowing about him and then having after meeting him that fantastic guy you know one of the most down-to-earth people always you know like very friendly you know always ready to have a good conversation you know genuine conversation you know people are running I think everyone looked up to money because money to set the bar in regards to absolute brute power and strength like everyone was marveled by what Ronnie did you know so yeah there's a lot of people in the industry that um you know I like Mike Rasheed is a friend of mine he's been inspirational to me in regards of his his business mind you know I saw looked up to what he's done in the industry as well you know so there's a lot of people you know but there isn't necessarily one person that'll say this is the person I've modeled myself own or you know been inspired by but there's a lot of people that I see what they're doing they don't good things and I see exactly inspirational not a few people so [Music] and that is a wrap it was great shooting we've got so much new stuff for you guys the USA launch do you want so much new apparel like this don't put it on me yeah look out for it stay tuned and watch out for my channels watch out for my channel so you see everything Medicaid Nutrition us [Music] I I'm some airport long to our driver two hours from aiming to the airport locus and we're finally gonna check our Amsterdam because I've been here a few times and never actually let's check out them to to back to three hours to three hours before I blacked out [Music] [Music] 
ah hey guys I'm here at Metro flexion K about to hit a chess session nice powerful chair session what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you what I usually do the chest you know we'll get a lot of questions about you know how old my chest and this is why do basically it's a lot of volume a lot of money and um like wait so just send quite a while to warm up with my want my elbows on a bench pushing so I'm gonna see a lot of sex I mean this is gonna be a pretty heavy set and the funny thing is I'm probably gonna do this set better later one hit people I'm fully warm got only one way to get warm enough to do this way it's always a hit-and-miss for me I mean some days I'll come in is clean and I can do it for you know one or two and then some days it doesn't go up it's on this agent go heavier and put an extra 35 I believe like usually the most recent maybe a ten yeah four and a half even buck buck I said just good days and bad days so we'll see weapons today but I'm very happy to take the rough with the smooth sometimes it's good sometimes bad ten people squats sometimes my habeas goes up sometimes it doesn't so I was quite pleased you got wet you know it went up not too much trouble you know so um what we do now is we continue hitting it that's what that's the way I feel that strength goes up to attack the heavy weight of several times I mean a lot of people don't really use one root Max's when they say that they build in muscle you know they I mean it's not really a bloody good thing is it to to to be hitting one with Max's you know going for strength games like that it's not obviously the quickest ways to blow muscle but for me I'm very very much more interested in the strength then than than than the physique that made sense like for me like the physique is a bonus you know when I first started training I never had a desire to xik that was going for I just basically picked up a dumbbell and start training and fell in love with the actual without training pills you know I enjoy training I enjoy when I'm doing my set you know I'm not just looking in the mirror a physique that I'm trying to build you know for me it's the actual training I enjoy so I'm yeah I stayed I like to stay heavy and if I can get another rep on this and then again and again they're not going and I'm gonna work my way down Shanda back couple years ago I was a stronger and chest you know um I think the reason why this trip has gone down on it is because of like you know tendinitis in the elbow now I have to wrap up back into that English to wrap up at all as a kid you know you just meet your superhuman and you just you know have all disturbed games just going up at this and then you don't really take into consideration the joints you know so I'm you know back on I dare used to toss with four plates and I can't even imagine doing that right now but um what happened was there were certain exercises like overhead tricep extension your dumbbells that I used it all ridiculously heavy on and it just just pulled a bad strain on my elbow and also the close grip feels bad strain on my elbow and then eventually I had to take I took actually a year off mention that whole year off mention just to channel it my elbows recover you know obviously I still have to work my chest so I still did like flat bench with our dumbbells and but yeah I had to leave that bench press alone just to let my elbows recover I mean so far the strip was gone gone up again you know I'm managing to hit before played for four ones sometimes twos very really you know but um you know as long as my chest ease you know just come present run completely I'm fine no I would like to do track clicks again there was a time when I did five plates I couldn't imagine doing it right now although I have pretty after I've become quite close recently it is four and a half so it's not that far what you know what yeah so kind Oh I've said a few times about William and will you go I understand is 91 things the same not everyone has to train the same is this when I tell you about the bullying this is something I believe in so ever you agree with it or not is irrelevant it's worked for me and that's what I've been doing then it's working what I find is you know I do my warm-up sets I've mentioned this before doing on warm-up sets which are higher reps you know I think my first set today was 20 reps um I think my second was 15 then we got to like the third set was supposed to be a ten but I finished up on the eighth just because you know I just wanted to save a little bit and I've just been hitting the ones one-one reps I mean I didn't get that last way I had to get a touch from John but um now what we're going to do is we're going to go down a little and still get those one and two reps and then once I think I'd you know consumes all my energy then I'm gonna start wrecking again you know take the weight down and get those you know ten but overall a lot it's all about women you know I think I get the benefit of the high reps you know so I'll get my growth there but then I also get descriptions from hitting not one with Max's you know and that's why I enjoy and what is it about it's about what you enjoy it's about what you enjoy doing and honestly I enjoyed it in this way and then I like something intense one about finish robbing shoppers now it's um whispers you know so I will arrest the mr. the bottom press up especially the bottom Carol up I mean just a nice little finish up to her to a good bench place so I'm job you give me two seconds hell yeah so I'm gonna hit a cabin and against oppressive Chris so we finished them finished flat bench now hitting incline what I'm going to in this long and when we spent a considerable amount of time getting flat bench in Camelot in spin as long maybe six sets and done remember how many six we did on Blackledge now normally with the flat Mitch it's not always that that long but riggles almost the hours just on flapping so it's not normally like that it is normally around eight six no all right yeah around that thing about you know every now and then I just go with the flow you know if I'm feeling it the strip's still there I'm going to use it you know and that means I'm going to keep going for those heavy this so you notice when I was hitting down the flat bench I went up plate by plate until we got a little heavier than LSI doing half in the 5 etc we've in Fang being not a strong running plan as a viable flatland I go up in harvest you know from the heart one Lexington plate and so forth got to wrap my elbows Forks give you a little bit information of why I do that my basically got my elbows to give me the extra support when I went up when I lift heavy it just gives me extra support and listens the pain that I might feel in my elbows which was caused as I said earlier form certain exercises too heavy you know so I'm also put on a belt only for heavy yet so I'm gonna put it on now some people have to take off but for heavy lips I like to UM brace my back and it does actually help no I'm both with is available on my side the way both available on my sight singing handler calm you want a copy butI study on that um I think next I'm gonna make sure on football in the right position before bringing it down please that's not miss yourself okay Oh while we're on the subject of chest let's talk about squatting it's a very important thing when it comes to your chest development if not one of the most important things now when you're benching you need to bench the weight yourself you know you along I see too often spot is getting heavily involved in your set you know and that that's not going to help your your gains it might help your ego you know because then you can say oh I bench you know three plates four plates five plates but in terms of your actual chess development and your strength it's not going to help you you know what you really need to do is choose a weight that you can handle you know now what the guideline the iPhone for splitting is I only want the spotter to touch the weight when I often when I really need you know and not before you know and normally what I do is once the spotter has helped with that rep and I say that rep has in singular then I put it back because the rest of the reps they're not going to be me are they so what I don't see your point in actually doing you know um I'm really not about that that that's that spotting where they're they're holding the buff everywhere me that's makes no sense that's what they're for safety I only want the squad to get involved if I really can't get that way I and I only like him to touch maybe that first one you know and I'm gonna um I'm probably gonna put a gamma do that because you know sniffing let me clean up that is it you know um I'll give you a quick example without wanting to kiss example this way is only for example purposes Joe can do much more okay I want to do is a struggle for that I want to bring it down and then start strong Chris Chris see now I could get involved by still moving on how many back there's times when it looks slow but it's still moving and you put in your hands - it is stealing the rep you know you're stealing their their what he needs to take that home with him that I got that whip no need to know that Lee's stealing it's not going to help him in terms of his long-term progress you know I'm going to show you again what I could have done with that exact sit ok again same thing push up yeah wicked that was awesome that was awesome yes no that was me you know I stole his rep you don't want to steal people's rep to let people train you know that's just one example he'll get us caught only when we let maximum fuel it's exactly I certainly mastered the way back in six of you doing exactly what I just said like the spot should Maxima be for two reps you know you helped him with that that heavy one and then you maybe gave in one more you see people spotting for six to eight weeks yep again missus pointless put the weight down lower it and get the reps yourself you know so normally what I'll do is press this first get the meanest best to get the most tax and exercises out the way first that's what you want your energy for that's when you know you want all your power you know so I've done bench press I've got incline piss so all the pressures are out the way what I'm gonna do next is flies you know now with the Flies you could choose should know these dumbbells or cables or even the pet let me see today I'm going to use cables and I'm sure you're a variety of different items that you can hit the Flies you know because they all hit their chest in a different way No Oh all right so what you see me do so far as a regular flies regular cable sighs I'm going to show you boxes I'm going to do a couple sets of cable crossover flies then I'm gonna do some flies where you bring them in real low and squeeze buzzer this variation starting you know mix up the workouts the advantage of crossing over is you get more the squeeze I mean you can imagine just see the technique bring the money back like that you get my scoop I imagine when you squeeze them together look what you should remember when you're doing these flies it's not about heavy weight you know it's about arm feeling the contraction and making sure each contraction is is complete you know so it's not about you know throwing up you know tons of weight it's just about control and um fluid you was quite frankly we've done the heavy head nurses we've done the heavy way - something funny about my chest there's some pictures you see on my chest looks deflated it's sold it's so weird for me but when I have a one I wanna hit chest my chest just blows up I get a massive pump and it becomes at your side but you know there's certain pictures where you know I'm flat and it's literally like a pancake you know but as you can see with a pump is some quite full sorry let's not worry man listen yes you go man I'm always watching I will do it I'm always caring ah thank you very much all right a vision yeah so and it was a typical chess session you know I'm set like I said sometimes we would exchange bench press for dumbbell bench press you know but that that was it really it's a lot of sex pyramid is very integral in my chest issues I mean all my sessions you know I build up to a heavy weight I stay at their heavy weight and not come back now so as I said a few people things to remember don't let the spot still you're still reps when you're bench pressing it's the only way you're going to get stronger get your presses out first game pushes out first like you know that that's what your skin is XP just fired decision always strip get your presses out first you know I say that with most exercises always do the heavy the heaviest stuff first you know so yep maokai hit the presses and then I hit the flies and a variation of flesh you know you want to hear to the chest for different angles and then high-low I mean showed you a few but this is a several wallet I'm so surprised that you could actually do so as you would have seen I hit my one rep max and I carried on hitting my one with maximum so I couldn't do it why because I want to get better a no I'm not just gonna get it once and then you know uh that's it for the day I want I want that one with max to become a to it and that's you it's become a prove it so the only way that's going to happen is if I keep messing with the key here and put in you know so um that's that's one of the metal job illusion that's one of the principles I believe you're getting stronger and also add to the broad you know but like I said to you guys for me it's not just about building mass no I'm not one of those guys that wants to be as big as possible I watching I want my physique to reflect the efforts I put in but I'm not out there to be a mass monster you know I'm training hard and heavy because I want to to be strong and fit and healthy that's why I do it

[Music] 
[Music] first first car I ever ever was an Audi a3 a black Audi h3 and it's finally happening rims on that's right ya know that was the first time I had you know it's my first car enjoy driving it yeah that was my that was the start of my affiliation with Aldi's because I willing to have a few hours after that I think my next car after that was a BMW e28 which I had briefly and then a my my next car that was a TT le TT black again sorry I actually stuck with this black June at Audi TT black put some rims on that as well black rims which and that was a 3.2 Patrol turbo I think was quite fast and it was a there was a manual all my cars will mind you at that time and then it's funny because after I had the TT I then went to the US that's when I started I went to the US for the first time and in the u.s. they pretty much only drive all makes you know that every car that will make so when I was in the u.s. I was renting automatics and then I came back I just cook we bother to switch gears anymore man as a sport why am i switching gears it's just long I don't like I'll tell you this I do enjoy switching gears there's nothing like you know accelerating uh switching gears but the convenience everyday driving I just fought I don't want I don't switch gears no more so when I came back I want him brought car and I went and bought an Audi s5 automatic you know and yeah I had that for a while I love that it's finally funny thing is I remember going to test drive a Range Rover Sport the same day that I went to test drive the Audi and I did like the Range Rover Sport it was like matte matte green like army color matte green look real nice comfort everything just did have the speed man and I like speed man I just need I need that acceleration you know to enjoy driving I need that acceleration it didn't have it at all so when I test drove the best five it was there was no question I knew I was getting you know even more boy that was in the car with me was like yeah let's get this let's get this so yeah I had the s54 that was black again with black rims so I kept that whole frame you know of just black Audi black black windows was just black you know I even before getting this I had it in my head that I was gonna go black again you know but I tell you what it is it's it's it's the weather now you're talking about okay out here in LA they're the cut the choice of card I would buy to have out here would be different to the UK the UK is gloomy it's you know it is rain you know it's just it's not just doesn't look fun so for you to have a bright car in that environment for me personally I just would've wanted you know it just doesn't fit in you know out here the sunshine and every day you know you could pretty much have a an orange Lamborghini and you won't look out of place you know about not out ever drive that's ever been this excited for a freaking car and for exponent everyone that ever be grinning all day that's it the same smile I had when I picked up my car that's it okay this car I saw just yesterday on a message and it basically said that you know get you and me it's nowhere near like whether it's performance is close or not is Punky exactly alright so let me let me give you a actual analysis of it about just saying it's ugly because it actually is a beautiful car from the side looking at the side whether they're wing mirrors the spoiler the side skirts even alloys everyone looks really on the side as soon as you see the front front I don't know what that is I don't know what they were thinking it's cool [Music] this sl's looking real nice I've driven a few like one of the first cars that I rented in LA was in their cell there's SL 550 then I really in a number SL factory didn't I mean the SL 63 and I actually was almost going to get one you know I was almost going to get one but you know I just wanted to step above and get actual super Caillou loved s else man this was the car that me and Shannon had when we first came to LA in the first day first few days to swim sauce dragon I liked it was comfortable as fast as well he was there 63 version so you know I had to see speed on it and it sounded had a good grumble to it be lovely the only thing the backseat for me I I tried to convince Shan for us to get this for her car but she wasn't everything she wanted the range don't like it well the basic model is a hundred grand so I'm sorta sure is gonna be a bit more yeah that's 100 grand in pounds before you guys start saying very well it's a hundred pounds probably about one hundred and thirty thousand dollars for the basement you know we will leave the the shark tail shark fin right and I'm not like in the paint as a designer as well as a designer I can see the drop shadow with technically pulling it and it just looks yeah the camera it looks almost nicer on the camera composition but aspires to P one on the Left Oh lolli the Porsche nominate who else there's another there's another I think Apollo of coming out with another and Chaka Khan and I don't think this cost stunning but the others and I say the laferrari for exactly is freaking beauty yeah the p1 you know normally I don't think it looks wise I don't think it has anything on the others that's my personal opinion anyway and that's hopefully they've got their head as to Martin Vulcan I need to see that because that looks of all the ones I mentioned that looks the best that just looks like in the future [Music] couldn't mainly one I've ever driven no one of my friends used to have a is 200 I think I'm lovely until we sewed it and inside buying Superbikes yeah no I've never I don't really know much about Lexus and shapes a little odd to me yeah but it's also like yeah big alloys and the almost looks like the g63 yeah exactly similar huh but BMW always working in the interiors man yeah he leaves it's like it's so basic [Music] until is still lacking money this is a concept of storage so I'm always looking for the practical things but I don't know where every time we'll look at like a car of this you know stature I'm trying to find storage and little practicality the most dated and the most dated like so see if you see the muscle right GT that interior hasn't changed I mean I don't know if they've changed it now but it's literally the most dated interior of that car in that class so this is the brand-new then to his mom and it looks exactly the same again again is that when are they gonna change the shape Aston Martin just changed the shape of their Aston Martin Vantage and the new shape looks grim and it was about time when are they gonna change the shape with the beauty mode slowly press me at all looking at a car like what I was trying to choose obviously I looked at them as why GT and yeah the specs I haven't looked six is that for something yeah that's not really I need under free man would be three seconds at least you know same really I mean it's not that it's never been nice because it's nice it's a nice car but it just hasn't changed the shape co1 I like it yeah really looks it and sounds sick as well let's go ahead up this down I think that's what this is as well they held up as please listen yeah but the interior feel like um pretty bare-bones quite bare bones run exactly this burger plasticky but bashed it together too much like cosmetic when you're in LA you had this loads if you wanted I mean before much wise like speed wise they are fast but handling handling is not great they're like don't put your foot down and go around around a second one of the first cars I ever drove in the US was a Ford f-150 Ford f-150 and I was actually saying to Shannon we might get a truck out here as well I just like um I don't know it's maybe movies I've watched or something but I had this urge to drive a truck so that was that was it lovely lovely but it was like what's that back to that turn back to them on fire because imagine you're driving in the lap of coffee for the first time and you jump in a big-ass truck you know so come back to some fire got straight in yeah son wanted this so bad she really wanted this I think she's happy with the below Wow literally there weren't any in the country and they weren't selling anymore welcome sir when you press the brake rings one Midori and apparently spots the car as well which is crazy could a camera in my old TT I completely forgot that labels actually backseats I've just seen the vectors on that fat 6 so I'm actually gonna I think I remember I actually managed to fit two of my friends in the back seats so you know like you have them somebody's two two plus two cars where it's just ridiculous where you know you wanna keep it in the back this actually actually did work you know I remember we actually drove quite a distance as well they were comfortable yeah yeah funny thing is Chanel's family love alleys now so now his dad had an s5 same as mine and just recently got TT RL is it TT RS or TTS younger Brahma has an s3 her cousin has a rs6 pink but yeah her whole family loves Audi's man yeah exactly [Music] one of my favorite cars used to be the BMW e36 m5 like just a shake yeah but think about street when you see me back home bm's well um good for loads of ports pull focus is called fiestas we don't really have a lot of your American cars back Chevrolet Cadillac you it's all those kind of cars do not have that's it that is it it was good I enjoyed it saw a lot cars I'm actually looking forward to supercars that's what I'm

then I always like to go back to the foundations of just a complete isolation of explosion without the momentum so you can listen if you can box squat vibe it's you want to stop which is what with momentum now it's back to 1700 but if you're always going faster faster faster you take somebody's a power lifter when they train with me their weights drop dramatically dramatically because of the fact that it's momentum not raw power and I love the idea that you're going to gym every day and just use that raw power it's plastic just so you guys know this is kind of stuff you want to go plug these guys you'll see this would I love see the taper here look these guys look at this they've got this tapered and then these wide shoulders that's beautiful that's that's winning every day on stage

party's just getting started come on we do that look at that yeah [Music] No [Music] nope bro but yeah nope [Music] the big notes on this what you see we're doing here relative to what our maxes is

people have dog session so the Army's need way [Music] shoulders most important thing there is man beautiful got that superhero look gotta have the shoulders she can hide them on stage or walk in the red carpet [Music] so much how many years now 40 years 40 years heavy can I ask have you had any injuries no leave over and why do you think that is uh I trained smarter not harder I trained too everybody goes to the gym to do what they'll muscle and get strong never did I went in to be an athlete muscle connection is the key point for longevity and strength and health everybody goes in for a different reason than going I just want to get jacked but jack goes how fast you lose that muscle or your connective tissue you can always get better you could always 40 years of getting better and that's that's the key why I've never been injured because the connective tissue in the bone density on is the speakin like it's the longevity without injury I've like the same attorney like 17 years now my had one into you're never told I said no the toilet slept or anything most I've had is like a you know a little injury in the elbow and such is gonna ask from her about how about you know giggles and something your elbows or any different had that uh-huh okay yeah so yeah rather than that I've never had like an injury that stopped me training I've had no way so I don't want to say I've never been a wheeze but I've done gladiators by the time I was 20 till I was 39 there's battle she's gone where I kicked the out of people Phillips and them gladiators again and now we're coming back again so the concept is and I've had always but I worked through the hours yeah sure I'd never stop training no no take time up yeah no you can't take time up because then you're weakened and everything else around it sure and the whole concept of do squats and deadlifts make your thick hips waist and thick no it doesn't no no does looking heavy hurts you in longevity together lifting heavy is the only thing that allows you to continue longevity skip everything else if you're going in the gym and just going for a pump a pump does not mean you had a good workout I could superset you guys right now to where you could not lift your shoulders in 20 minutes 20 minutes and so yeah and we walk out and the majority society goes wow that was awesome I want to walk out where there's a deep tear sure feeling I understand now having for me that's why I do husbands and all these blows assist because I really want to like destroy them watching them and I want to make sure that I bought

mecca the legends and we're just killing this but it's fun you guys asked me man why do I train every day this is fun sorry it's fun let go wait without him yesterday's fantastic vamanos even if it goes slow stay in a strong position [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so mad pom pom adults good and good I like about Mike straining it's his strength race and I love strength waist training you know it's just that's what gets me excited that's what I like also doing a lot of new techniques like what you see tab you doing here that might show us I've never done that to me now we get a whole bunch of crazy heavy stuff great you get full range of motion now we pick it up the bed do some isolation work nice that you build you know you know i have a concept of a foundation something to build a big foundation then we sculpt then we destroy it nice look at that you can see it growing [Music] beautiful beautiful nice I posted last night about making sure that your routines have everything covered no stone unturned and what that me Spacek you means is as you saw when we start it's finally because we just hit exact same concept that I was talking about we started with a compound lift so we hit all the muscles that this basalt muscles at the same time what are we doing now isolating with any part of your body you need to do the same thing if you want a balanced physique you need to hit the compound and then you need to isolate and make sure that every head of the muscle is [Music] have you ever been like skinny nine years old I was silly said put up a picture before yeah nine years old because by 13 I was to 170 and by 13 to 15 I went through puberty and I get to 70 so 15 years old I'm already 270 pound kid I was an all-american football player now as a monster I saw the kitchen yeah yeah so when people go ah here's something the time will make either everybody come true or show that they're liars you can't maintain anything that's not yours yeah you can't maintain anything that's substance everybody's if you really look at guys muscle finishes talk about those easy guys hit 10:15 some guys 20 years of greatness but there isn't a long life there's like Robbie Robertson's one of the few guys so it's one of those things that build what you can rather go slow then fast sure yeah fast I've met the next armor every year that I've been here since 1990 it's been here 28 years now I've met the next Arnold every year problem is the kid comes out has everything in the world the looks the charm the body and everything and then they want it now and they're out in five years if that so slow down take your time and there's one thing I was okay not rushing at 15 I was already 270 at 17 and 18 I was already feeding men in powerlifting and I said 19 a good second in the world so I didn't need to rush I was already somewhat there the body just didn't develop to the point I'm 27 so I'm the baby right now so if you were to give yourself advice what you know now we lowdown is that take it here and always go back to foundation always go back to foundation so and what I mean by that is this I don't need you at 100 and I know people look at me but you're always at 100 I'm not if you really watch me I'm not always at 100 I'll go to 100 I'll come back to 60 go 70 80 90 100 what I mean by that is my lips my training my nutrition I always go back to a foundation work that I have to have the squats the banks of the Dead Sea the the proper high calorie intake the problem is most people cut calories and cut calories in each year you cut calories what are you gonna do you 27 you know how much good you know I got a long time on you so what's you're gonna be doing when you get my age if you're already at a hundred every single year so I know it's kind of confusing but but I just mean not everybody has an off season the biggest athletes in the world have an off season puh puh players they played before months then they get three months off take your offseason by cutting back on the weights don't go a hundred percent go sixty he let the nutrition do the trick I'm gonna make sure your nutrition is always on relative either you're putting on sighs are you tightening up putting on but there's no offseason with your first [Music] [Music] [Music] work out the soul brutal Oh like I know I can work with narcan well if I know what I can risk as well I know where my risk is so as you saw when we were doing the behind the neck military Chris Mike wound up to four put it for four plates up there 25 normally I would never do that but I reckon I could have had one so I went for it so that's that so I know my limits I know I can test my body with and yeah by that man I know my range you know so even like was the 120s that we did on the standing shoulder press normally see it have to do more so okay with some balance because we're standing it's a bit lighter I should be able to do it so yeah I wouldn't push myself past what I know I can do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] answer why'd they back fall forward I don't want this I want this leave with the elbows that's all you're moving [Music] ready behind you make it hard on don't make it easy come on come on oh yeah hell yeah we can always get better you can always get better come on [Music] nice clean movements you see that just take your time man take your time - feel each rep that's what he's doing - Danny Tripp no rush please [Music] [Music] so these are a little different these are old-school big Lee Haney you guys that'll be too young remember Lee Haney one of the Great's was the original and I like these because it's not just a trap it's bringing all that shape in from the trap to the rear delt to the side and really making a nice isolation out of all three of them I wanted to ask so looking into physique everything just looks a bit different son what is your weakness or what is what has been over the years things that you've worked hard on to improve and how have you done there I was not a huge farm guy when I first started because I was a much bigger power [Music] reversing the hand to picking out the middle delts put an even more snow on the rear gelatin in the track so it's also finding it was an ego thing because I was squatters I love to squash I keep that in for foundation work bone density and longevity but it's stepping away from Justin Newswatch seven women rest of our camps that was my biggest fight against myself Ceausescu the right hey Ramesh guys have lower chest consists of upper chest I have never seen a guy with the trophy developed upper chest in my life he chose last summer never in our life nothing [Music] as we were so many and sports that's the exercise how much you bet what do you got there now you're a man your outlook is your bench but it took me a long time to go I don't need to finish I got a queue lower chest that's only getting over exaggerated check that much more for years I just believed for a couple of what is an upwards jeff's makes it Jeff I don't care who you are man I don't care if you're Michael Jai White movies this is upper chest it makes that body look Van Damme all those kind of guys are unfortunate is upper chest get a full chest but it's an upper chest was just ridiculous and for me you guys not so much about stage as it is about the pictures this is not the project about the day-to-day thing our business doesn't help us in in grappling and athletics it's an incline at dusk most of our stuff athletically is here that's never here and if you notice a bench press really separately here because everything doesn't deep fine almost off of it so people ask me so it's a full circle to me trying to tell you what was my weakness and stepping away from the norm stepping away from what I was taught as a kid that you're supposed to do I'll do squats and then the rest of workout his hamstrings and hamstrings because trust me a horse's leg is probably the most impressive leg to me when it walks up but it's all hamstring and glute and it's just power and that's an athlete and so it's stepping away from the norm you got a bench press mic inside smile huge in size doing this exercise be smart go light share good long arms keeping them out pulling up there is a bend in the arm because we're really trying to contract everything back there and focus on it love it okay first things first let me just say I haven't taken time before shuttle spinning it's been like I'm not talking for five years yeah you guys won't even know that you don't see us together too often what we always talk like we always bump into each other in different countries you know and it's freaking fantastic to have this session with him I haven't wanted to train with this guy for years you know and we just never managed to meet up in the right time so when tabi told me that he was training with Liam isn't it you know ynr only enjoyed this session and 100% I wanted to do it again of course all right 100% taking so many pointers that you guys should also take when you watch this video you know that there's loads of things I've learned today you know I mean I'm gonna take Jose who he is in that's what I look look up to because I've been trained 17 years and I plan to do this board very long time so for someone who's done it for years you know I'm taking as much as I can to make sure that you know I do make it to that stage and stay at hand never that is premium you know I don't just keep it up premium you know I love that you say that because I know your fans and I want to say you are smart to follow this man because of the fact that I can teach nobody that's not willing to learn and and he's a great kid you're still a kid though they're kids and you guys are willing to learn though and that's why you guys are gonna keep growing and keep getting better and so it was fun for me to hang with you guys and it was as fun as I hoped it would be I'm coming up to stay at your house and then you're here Jessop early wicked man peace out 
If you haven't got a preacher curl bench in your gym and you still want to hit preacher curls Preacher Curls basically isolate the bicep stop your elbow from moving There's another way to do it Set up an incline bench quite high about that angle Rest your tricep on the bench then curl up You can use the bench for support the whole point of doing preacher curls is isolating the bicep so you avoid swinging you avoid any bad form Try it out It's great for biceps

so a few guys are wondering where I wrap up upset it in other videos but you're new to my channel you want know so I'm gonna explain it to you basically I wrap up to give me more support on the heavy the heavier sets so when I'm lifting heavy Joel actually started using wraps back when I start to get them a pain in my elbow and doing a certain exercise that don't do anymore and I used to are really heavy on it when I was hitting triceps so that the the belts gave me support and they alleviated that pain now I use them when going heavy because they really do keep you keep them rigid and stable you know and it's just a lot safer when lifting really happy you know that's why you see a power lifters except you use them on the knees as well I use on my knees when squatting you know any anything that when the weight gets real heavy that's when you leave the extra support you know as it went when I was younger and I used to see - using them I used to boast about not not using the Taylor I don't need them I don't need them and you may not need them it's not a case of needing them it's a case of them making your lips more stable more and comfortable and safer you know so that's why I use the mainland 
I once had a conversation with this this this lady and she said you know if you couldn't train what would you do and scared the hell out of me because I love training and I rely on training it's just something I need so regardless of if I'm going on holiday a guy on a business trip if I'm traveling I need to train it's what I need to make me feel good just like you need to eat I need to train if I couldn't train you know I don't know I don't know how I feel I don't know how it would affect me it's been something I've done for so long 13 years of training almost every single day yeah so I'm this

utensils but I'm not home so just making do so basically I bought this and I'd be like wait is I just know that it's low in soup which is good because I don't really cook you there's a little kick my friends told me making a good steak you don't put the oil in the pan and put the oil on the state that's what you told me and I've done it like that ever since and it works good for me normally what we do for good tasty steak is you leave the steak in a plate to get to room temperature we follow up on starve them and it's cooked and eaten out I like my student here so I'm gonna move on too long how could I do like that it will start really I mean to my knowledge of bacterias on the outside so which is why you could have a state where once you cook the outside everything else is fine so no

too yesterday was amazing I'm meeting everyone at the expo absolutely crazy so I'm today's more the same head to do it to train first when I hip Gold's Gym here national shoulder session and we're going to head to UM the expo same Josh first can't see him he always talked about me driving real slow and stuff but guess what I made it to the gym before him so who's the slow motherfucker now huh what happened then I'm the slow drive so just got to go Jim beautiful drive and their me a solo session and then I'm head to the expo hopefully you don't take too long because I know that I'm people probably start leaving the expo you know pretty early so I wanna get there make sure that hit a chance to tiptoe incisions you you my own homes like when I go heavy I always got my elbows to keep you laughing bitches and give me support I'm trying to get strength as I can so I always test the heavier weight now if I need my squat to help me test in that heavier weight I'm gonna use it you know because in the long run after 10 to 30 years and in the long run that's always helped no sort of so so the spot will help me get through on that big way and then later on down the line I should be able to handle it myself yeah we're not can I get a picture brothers Cory Mac I know I think are you feeling brother I'd meet you from the adventure Thank You Confucius pass on the bear work I want a fun picture dogs I always I always think that second day will be less busy it's always the opposite always without here like the reaction second day rivaled the first thing you know I mean from the entrances I know I have something to offer at least is still coming I mean you guys are seeing this and I'm very happy to be motivating people are motivating and then happily impact I'm having out is even more but that attitude where it's going to happen has to pass them everything everything our plan has to happen because I'm going to make happen just believe it you can believe that you can you know like I never plan for all of this but I always had the spirit you know and I'll never lose that spirit man you know and that spirit is basically just believing that you can do anything you put your mind to if you work you you 
[Music] I grew up in southeast London I used to I used to play sports and the regular things that people did used to come play football you know and you know basketballs involved in all the sports I wasn't really great at any of them I was good but I never stood out any of them apart from rugby and these times I was I was skinny but shredded so I thought I was big with my brother can that constantly telling me you're skinny you're skinny I decided to you know lift some ways what triggered it for me was going to college and there's one particular guy this guy he basically out of that muscular physique and I remember asking I had to get like he said you know I trained at home that same day I went to a local department store I went there and I just got some ceramic and ceramic weights took those weights and that same day I had my first session and it will sound cliche if I say but literally it was from that first session that I knew exciting I wanted to do the pump was amazing and in funny thing was I wanted to do it as often as I could and the funny thing is you know how you want to fill that pump all the time that's what I was just chasing so and I didn't realize that you know you train and then you need it for a day you come back another day now the way I was doing it was I'll train and then maybe we'll do something else come back train that is what I did date you know date and I loved it from from back then yeah it's running spring came down and said goodbye was getting bigger but that influenced me because it you know was the first time anyone had acknowledged what I was doing and and and before that it was just about just about the feeling you know this this feels great I love doing this because it feels great and that's the thing I tried to get through to people you can train throughout anything you know so you know when people say yeah I don't have time or you know like I can't fit it in with my school life I did it all you know I went to school and studied and worked and change it got to a point where things were really taking off for me so I made that jump and I left I left work and it's funny because it almost immediately and I left it just kicked off like that [Music] there's this belief that I have that you can you can have anything if you put put the work into it and it sounds so you know basic but that that I truly believe that that's what drives me daily because of what these these goals that I want I know I'm gonna make them I know I'm going to reach them 100% and it's just it's just stepping stones stepping stones so what motivates me is just that knowledge that you can work at something and make it happen it's a secret that people don't know you can do anything you want to if you want to do something just just just give everything believe in it that belief isn't just when things are going well I think it's even most important when things are going really going bad you can't forget what you're capable on and what you believe you can achieve I was down and didn't have a job and um you know in a pretty rubbish situation you know staying and I was on my brother's sofa you know and you know didn't have a job and was trying hard to get one and you know you can you can get down you can get so down and you might feel on your own as well like you know they know everyone has a luckily I had my brother you know but some people don't have anyone you know what happened was my brother basically one day when I was really feeling feeling down and he just only didn't say much but just makes he said to me please don't think that because this is your situation now that this is all it's going to be and it just gave me a boost you know so even though things weren't going well and there's nothing really on the horizon that just said okay just stay stay stay positive just stay positive because you can turn it around I did them an Xbox now the only thing that I remember from the whole Expo that stood out was the one guy who told me he watched that video when he was in roughly I think a worse situation than I was and he said that that that helped him he said he said he just held on to that I said before that you know he didn't know what he was gonna do but that just said to him keep going and that simple thing I'll keep going can do do wonders with people you know and then the coincidentally I didn't saw him I never Expo and his story was completely different you know he'd he'd he'd me at the time he didn't have a job I think he was I think he's actually homeless I think he told me was almost and now he was like I'm working for coming to the company and things have picked up and that just like that's bigger than anything that's bigger than any endorsement any business venture or anything that they're you know imagine changing someone's life like that that fuels me more than anything more than anything you know because I think we should all you know be wanting to help others that gives me life and that I like is like is me energy that just just knowing that and it definitely feels me because I know how I feel when I hear that you know I just like honey when I hear from that I finally I get my words out that's how passionate I get you know so it's something I'm gonna like continue to try and do no matter how successful or whatever happens always try and bring other people up you know because I think that's what it's all about you know [Music] [Music] i'm simeon panda i am dedicated 
[Music] [Music] hey guys this video is coming to you straight from Australia and arrived in Brisbane at 6:25 yesterday which was a Thursday today's Friday is a 2210 I've just come back from doing cardio I've done some cardio this morning first thing in the morning went straight downstairs well no upstairs to go gym on the rooftop so I did my cardio came back and I made breakfast which was oats with banana that was my first breakfast telling you this because I'm going to show you what I have my second breakfast and the whole point of this video is to basically give you a quick insight into why I'm in Brisbane and I'm staying in an apartment instead of stayin like it's an apartment hotel so it's like a whole suite with kitchen dishwasher washing machine Oh should have like an apartment basically I like to stay in apartments when I travel places because then it means I can cook my own food it means I don't have to rely on the restaurant in the hotel to call my food you know I did a big food shop yesterday what I'm gonna do in this video is basically just show you what I've bought and what I'll do is I'll put the information on the screen as to why I choose these items for for and my diet yeah let me show you what I bought [Music] [Music] actionable to those two cons oh no thanks lots of X ie about eight to ten eggs a day I do separate the yolks so I only have around two yolks sweet the tail be part my diet I'm just hoping that they both good potato peeler because if you tell Peter that I've got homies whack I need to get a new one so I'm gonna go with potato peeler now this isn't something I would normally get but I'm in Australia Australia yonder so why not try some kangaroo I might actually give a little verdict on my taste like I have had it before a restaurant in North London Camden who check a zoo and it's a fucker die ostrich think I had kangaroo D and I think I liked it I'm cooking some kangaroo Leah how many of you guys saw my video on the top five greens for gains asparagus was one of them wasn't it the first green we're going to start with is the vegetable asparagus now asparagus yeah I love my asparagus great flavor I'm gonna put all the information on why you should have asparagus in your diet seen the other video you know but um yeah so got my asparagus two big fluffy Lockleys and I want a cooling heads of broccoli stubs of broccoli I don't know about two big chunky ones anyway I love working there but please very hard pulling and loads of other stuff that folic acid etc so I'm salmon fish I have with my okay pretty much mix up in the fridge top of the fridge we have red onions then we'll health reasons for why I use red onion such that flavor tastes good now how am I going to cook everything about olive oil I've got all involved sprayed as much as I can I would use the spray over using the regular oil I know that not unless a ton of Sheila perfect tune is so easy to cook man fry up some red onions some olives which I'm gonna show you net and shut it with some rice really as I just said olives again a number one of my top five greens begins olives olives are just they're my favorite pretty much women they're just all the stuff that you saw on my last video you know but these are the things ie restrain in the apartment of would you think that certain things will be there there aren't too light seasoning so I might picked up a few quick ones like I said before I hate shopping so I just wanted to be in and out quite quickly so I picked up some black pepper some time I love time which have morbid literally Rosemarie a loved one's really beautiful flavor with balls me so I can add that to certain foods and I got some all-purpose got me careful all-purpose lot but sometimes they are quite and high in salt use it sparingly as I said breakfast side with both oh shit I've just bought all the oats on the floor came out hopefully that's a brute oh that's staple man stay all oh every morning without fail and never get bored hops I love ups I can be savage I can be savage with my hopes if I'm lazy I will put oats in a bowl and run it under hot tap and I'm good to go on days where there might be no milk bananas that's why I forgot to show you picked up some bananas now this red stuff at the bottom I think is a branding thing from wherever it was grown it doesn't catch me off-guard a bit when I pick them up the a bananas love bananas what else did I buy what else did i buy water not subsample we know I love sparkling water man and last I can move and no more I found quite boring I drink it but I find it boring but contrary to what you might think I don't like fizzy drinks and I don't drink fizzy drinks at all ever ever detest them I love sparkling water because it just tastes a crisp cleaning just nice but I don't drink any other physical eats at all Liberia no hey flavors I start drinking PC geeks a long time ago long time ago might even be up to ten years ago yes since then I just don't like the flavor just like this they just taste too artificial you know I love the vigilance that I last watching war Oh Wes last quick and easy I just walk though the whole way in bed nothing less that I can throw in a microwave and rustle up practically get us home unless the main carbs that I have are hoping we're sweet potato homemade pasta yeah pretty much it so that is why I bought yesterday and I'm hoping they last me till I leave I'll be here for another three to four full days um actually in hindsight up another the last until but yes I'll probably go back out to get more but you can get an idea what I've shown you of what you know what my dad consists so you know so um in regards to things like cheat meals and you know fast food and all these other things I do have it of course I have it but it's not often at all what I've shown you is my regular diet these are the things I you know day cheat meals and things like that yeah I eat them as I'm when I feel that to be honest but it's few and far between it's not frequent what you've seen is my regular diet what I'll do is when I get back to London I'll film another video similar to this showing you everything that I buy this one like I said I don't like shopping so I was just grabbing things really quickly let me know if you like this style video it's just a quick one you know I just switched on

content you know in them stuff that can help you you know and then the stuff like this can help you see why I actually buy why I actually use you know so yeah we're trying to go subscribe guys subscribe let's do this these two York's [Music] 
[Music] the guys saw we are in Eman well anyway yeah I named it which I thought was like completely forgot is not hamster now you know so I'm landed it was like our full five minutes drive to Eman and yes countryside anyway that's nice well nice anyway right the gym about to shoot trying to load a new dedicate clothing which you guys are going to love and yeah let's get started what's up guys so we add the dedicated gym in Emin in the Netherlands and today Simmons gonna be shooting the new apparel for dedicated and I'm hoping we're gonna hit a session later that we're gonna get and also I might be able to get some toning curve all right for you guys we'll be out and yeah it's such an amazing gym so I just want to get [Music] [Music] so just warming up go for the motions you know always start like and get a joints lubricated you know it's always waited if you check my videos you know it's always well hoodie for the first few sets and that's just like I like to get warm before I take Mahoney off and obviously but he keeps you warm and once I've got one less one more he comes off you know but yeah every day every every every gym session I keep my my jacket on my hoodie on and get one first before taking off okay so now we're out pretty much the mid-range or just above the mid range now Nass getting heavy so I strap up and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get a few reps on if I'm hoping at the try and push it too much because I still want to go heavier so a few Rosen's are taking the wake up [Music] now we're election so up to 70 kg now the last set was in the drinks name still this is all really wacky well quick 20 reps indicate your passion that's good [Music] baby coming oh well I want to press the way to put it back Noorie weapons birthday I don't have to help but you know at least go back down for minimum or one sip after after up the weight so I can rip out again because for me I'm chasing strength so that's why I got as heavy as I do but I still need to do the sets where I get free our high reps so you'll see that on the warmups and you also see that when I come down back I'm chasing the strip so you'll see me get to like the sixth set and really push something heavy for maybe three reps or two sometimes even a one rep max and some people I see always question that they're like what's the point the point is you get stronger and it's funny because the people that are normally saying what's the point aren't the ones that can lift that kind of weight and the reason why is because we've never trained in that sort of style where you're pushing your body to see what you can do you know if you don't do that you're never gonna get that next level of strength no so for example if you're only working up to your your your last set which is around I don't know 10 reps overweight how do you expect to really push past that and get that the real heavy weight you know for me I get the best of both worlds so I'm doing that I'm doing the sets where I'm doing 10 reps two sets or I'm doing eight we have six one do 12 reps etc but then I'm also done lists where I get free reps or to us you know and that's how you get stronger once you do all those heavy heavy weights when you come back down to a way that's supposed to be heavy it doesn't feel as heavy this 50 doesn't feel like 50 anymore after fits in the 70 it was more like a fake and then you can play with it there used to be a time I could never press 50 now I can talk impressive and it rips we're saying 50 up to 50 sorry 50 reps deep maximum over 150 was 22 reps thank you well like I said it's when you're pressing the heavier weights when you come back down the weight doesn't feel the same you know that's getting stronger so some orbs use water you say is the most effective chest exercise um they're all effective but the staple chest exercise obviously is your bench press you know that's a staple you know that should be in everybody's workout but everything's everything has its purpose you know so today I did dumbbells well I mostly do bench with a barbell but um they're both just as effective you know you mix and match with them all so um yeah is there a way of like logged in like lower chest oh of course yeah yeah so I'm you know here it's essential that with any workout anybody about your head that you want to get make sure you hit each angle to make sure you get each muscle each part of the muscle for example I've done flat bench just now with the dumbbells which is hittin the whole chest but now I want to hit certain areas more than others so I'm going to Inc like if you wanted to work on your lower chest more you'd hit decline you know and then you're going to finish off the flight so you know really get the separation etc so yes you see it's a combination of everything but a staple is your bench race so and eight sets is key however I never say that my way is the only way I do exist or 10 sets except your back that's because that's what I'm come to enjoy and what works for me is the volume I love volume you know so as much as I can hit the heavy weight I'll keep doing it and that's why it goes up to 8 to 10 sets sometimes but you know for a regular lift that is trying to just you know build muscle other faucets would be sufficient but for me high volume is what works you know since the McGuiness shot the way you drain like if you're cutting or bulking or they always keep it the same style of framing pretty much stays the same you know I've not I'm not done like a bulking star etc you know when I was trained for competition I've even trained the same heavy right through I can definitely feel this man a nice feeling real good man like basically my endurance like must-read of staying with me throughout says you know definitely feeling good yeah the free play for one or two now my incline isn't as strong as my flat bench just dramatically different actually incline normally yet I've actually I've got four plays mainly like about a year ago but recently oblate it's like a free free place without one or two [Music] always finish off food or flies or I always get the presses out the way first so for me it's always the the exercises that require the most amount of energy I get I do first the ones that I want improve on most I do first because that's when you know when you're starting uh something gonna have the most energy so I always start with like a bench press and then do my incline and I finished off of the flight you know with flies I will do various different angles you know so regular cable crossovers and then yeah sometimes it from the top it from the bomb change you reverse flyes you know anything to just if hit hit different angles of their of the chest you know I'm reading off their separation in the middle to change the angle now we've lowered the pulley and we're here in to the top before we will come in under so it's just like I said about in different angles coming from the top now squeezing it get that inner cleavage [Music] and that is a wrap for that chess session the unbeatable saw me through energy lack through to the end so yeah that was chest so as you saw you know the presses and flies nice and simple a lot of people do all this crazy stuff you know all these crazy techniques the basics work the basics work you know your flat bench you're inclined and the variation of flies it's not much more not much more to it than that so I'm about to try something new this is the dedicated talking walk it's a sample so I'm gonna see how it tastes see what the textures lack see what flavors lack now see if I like it well it's one of my favorite flavors so that's a that's a plus that's really nice you're something soft soft texture [Music] you're 15 grams of protein 24 grams of carbs sugar is quite low only 4 4 grams it's never that protein bars ii would you say i would you eat them with in moderation because then a lot of people with it everything should be moderation understand everything if it's a snack or even a foodie food item that's a part of your regular diced motivation is still p4 some of the mistake people make is they think that these things are meal replacements they're not they're just an alternative snap a high-volume alternative snack you know [Music] 
we should have a little bit to digest Radley should be here now and we're gonna go Matt's back session back session smash it up get warm then go ahead recession right start up a bent-over rows the exercise I warm up with high reps high reps on a low weight and basically we got black one plate at time I always use a underhand grip it's just something that I've I've done over the years like I I used to do the overhand I changed to underhand one time and I found that underhand was more comfortable for me and hits the part of the back that I want I want to target so I always use an underhand grip trying to practice this is always enjoyable these are powerhouses strong as hell and um you know he's on the same wavelength with the heavy lifting which which I love you the four plates sometimes can be an issue and sometimes I can do it quite comfortably I mean those of you who've seen my Instagram videos see you know I posted once or twice hitting the four plate on the vent overall and yeah it's normally a comfortable way just depends on how the week's been in regards to erm squats or deadlifts you know now in our lap Adele's side applies and clean some high reps in them clean form and we'll see if we can maintain that as it gets heavy heavy for pharmacy I want to shit the lap pull down to keep it light for the first few sets you know we want to just um get the blood in there get get comfortable with the movement so that um as we increase the weight we can try and keep the form as as good as we can you know I'm starting to feel it now second second I'm second exercise in time to get pump side to get my ball now it's gonna get nice and heavy and then you know all of the time most of my most of my exercises the first few sets are nice and comfortable and clean you know and then I'm as it gets heavy you know you may lose fun but um as long as you bank those first few sets you're fine lots of volume man like training for me I need volume I need a lot of sets man I need to I need to repeat the movement and I need to do it heavy this this exercise here um it's a absolutely brilliant exercise if you've never done it before I recommend you try it you can literally feel the lats working so well in on the movement like every pull down you feel the lats tuck in you just basically you set up the setup your flat bench and incline in front of them a cable machine and you reach you pull the bar and you pull the bar down just below your chin it's perfect perfect move you the session was filmed our lva see um in Las Vegas one of the biggest ones so great Jim because they have so much equipment so much space I think they've got like two floors it's a great place to Train I mean it's a bit further out than um the average in display mediums are closer to me closer to our staying but um I travel out to that gym because it's just just a great place to Train so I'm just gonna slice it the best bit back workout feel good that's real and solid so it's been about near passing here enjoyable I'm hoping to hit some more before the end of this Olympic week you know so you know good our way yeah good stuff like it's because I didn't pull off and every time seen he's getting bigger what is going on slowly slowly but still high yeah I gotta get am better you know I said I got picture light is right I gotta get the right angle this guy is killer man so hope you guys liked the video like he said so much more coming soon yeah that's all I got that's all we got got hungry you

best you know and I'm showing you that you really can achieve great things if you believe in yourself I smile and try so I'm standing by and that's what I'm going to continue to do so I want to say a big thank you to everyone who supports me okay um this video is it's a long time coming and I I really could have done it sooner but I didn't I just didn't think it was that big a deal um but uh seeing the way the industry is going and seeing the level of abuse that's come my way for them like you know a small section of people um it's got to a point that I need to do this I I have to do this basically I had to UM I had to take steps and do this I've kind of almost 14 years and I've been in the industry for about three years now and before getting into the industry I didn't have a clue how much negativity there would be to natural bodybuilding or natural body butters - - to be fair um is it this it's absolutely despicable so we fair assist this local boy sir it's pathetic um I mean there is so much doubt on who is actually natural or not but it's something that when I was when I was younger starting out started 16 never crossed my mind I couldn't I never even considered who was natural who wasn't I trained and did my thing I drained I I grew and concentrated on me concentrated on my gains I've done two very big things this weekend that I don't think any other natural bodybuilder has ever done not willingly you know um there are Federation's that make people do this this this this wasn't for a competition this was me doing something for my true followers so I did two things this weekend I did a polygraph test also known as a lie-detector test same test that you see on the Maury show same test and you see on Jeremy car so I checked online looking for the best polygraph testers in the UK the highest you know most accredited and I found a company called bio clinics by our clinics I book to them about the test and the test was with a company called n a DAC which is actually the largest privately owned polygraph company in the UK the test was done by a gentleman called Don Cargill head examiner he is the current chairman of the British European polygraph Association he's a full member of the American polygraph Association and the World Association of private investigators he's fully accredited um I think he's been doing it for well over ten years when he showed us his credentials he off the back of his polygraph tests people have been released from prison people have been imprisoned you know we used to do the poly box for the trishul got out show those in the UK will know that and so he's high up there in in polygraph testing I mean you couldn't get better in the UK and so how accurate is a polygraph test according to the American polygraph Association over 250 studies were conducted over the past 25 years and accuracy of polygraph tests in was estimated to be around 95% however more recently computerized testing has a an accuracy of 98% my test was a computerized test so um the test cost me six run well over six hundred pounds which is about thousand dollars I'm telling you the price of the test because I want you guys to know the the the levels I've gone to help you guys basically tututututu give you some encouragement to to give you someone to to look to to say yes I not for certain he's natural just reached it some 115 today's 224 or October Sally just rips a polygraph clinic and I'm about to go in to do the test I have the poor hair it's also on my website you can read the full examination and get all the deals from it but I'm going to read you the most important parts okay so arrangement arrangements were made by bio clinics to test simeon panda and he was examined at the above address the issues on the examination were covered in the relevant questions listed below simeon panda was given a pretest interview in which he was explained the nature of the tests in detail as well as the operation of the polygraph instrument during the interview examinee was read the questions that he the questions that would be used during the test in the examine are consented to the polygraph examination and it's questions and did sign a consent form the technique used in this detection of deception procedure involves the scientific identification of emotional reactions to control relevant and comparison questions with these reactions being represented by measured physiological changes in the blood pressure respiration and electrodermal activity the examiner was given a detailed presentation of the polygraph instruments and a number of comparison questions we'll discuss in detail the examinee was checked to ensure that there was no use of countermeasures to affect the results of the polygraph test the examinee clearly understood every question asked of him and was given numerous rehearsals of the questions to be asked of him before the actual test itself this is keeping in line with polygraph testing procedures and protocol ok relevant questions and agreed definitions before I tell you what the questions are that were asked I wanted them to be as as extensive as possible I wanted them to clear up from the beginning because I'm a lifetime natural body builder lifetime that means at no point ever in my entire life have I used anything people use the term natural and I'm going to be very honest with you after being in the industry now for over 3 years there are some liars and I and I had to test them I really do the testing because they are the reason why I have Dowers because they're lying you won't see me work of anyone that I know to be lying and that's that's effect you know um if I know someone to be lying and then actually you're not going to see me train with them you're not going to see me do anything with them because it really does piss me off because they're the reason why I have dollars so um I made sure that these questions were thamma completely Farah question one have you ever used any form of steroids in your entire life no that was the answer I gave question two have you ever used any form of growth hormone in your entire life no that was the answer I gave the polygraph charts were scored using the very latest computerized polygraph software as well as being manually checked by the examiner opinion and conclusion based on the test and during the examination at interviews it is the examiner's opinion that simeon panda should be classified as showing no deception indicated in relation to the questions numbered one and two listed above okay so I'm going to say that again so I say again for all you people that doubted me all you people have said ly abuse um you know I read the the comments that I I've had daily or under some videos you know lying this lying that fuck you you lying cunt and I even had someone say I hope you die next under a train obviously referring to Greg Plitt and it's been crazy the the amount of abuse and it all stems from jealousy you know it's jealousy um yeah it's jealousy but then it's also lack of knowledge you know because you guys really don't know what's evil a lot of you haven't put put your mind to it and and and remove that barrier yet so I'm hopefully gonna try and make sure you know what can be achieved but makes Bernie lie happening I'm actually the chairman of the British in European politics Association I'm also a full member of the American Progress Association in the UK I'm the only poly gutter to watch it on my own pocket training school which should probably read Association and the British creation council to our foreign students are coming to a training school though in the UK they prob about 35 photographic that one is a qualifying paramah practice there are simply two polygraphers and other polygraphers but in private practice about thirty-five and we're all members are clear about Association as well I've been running down them for ten years qualified will need ten years ago I qualified in the Fort Lauderdale International Academy I've also performed Trisha product show that many murder cases so have you completed your test and obviously you've improved turn the truth on growth hormones and steroids the interviews and never use them in you try laughs - congratulations of no one but it's not very nice texture now okay not South we're passing time vomit christened beauty wasn't being you to realize that their bishops are completely different to receptive reactions officer here so we're using a stimulation tested one two three four which the test with it before the big test as well so it took about an hour two hours today Bonzo abductor when I saw that intends to well I'm really didn't understand how there are no obviously some sort of preparation and then the test but I can understand what smells like here any Dimitra could reassure people who you are need to actually explain how the collegial herbs and get the right questions honestly and then surely pivot now that works as well so you did well but now you realize you could not beat a polygraph test budgets now is it absolutely not my balance but like the batter will appear three times the fact that there's a gap between each question business the trims great art similar absolutely picked up that sedative and obviously we computerized scoring as well as a product manuals for it so and I think in terms of bodybuilding and also weight wrestling and also in cycling where there's doubts of in drugs and take the old sport it I think should be used to clean these Federation job yeah that means the Libyan government happy with or sex offenders we should be happy with or athletics so yeah I'm gonna be the questions I'm gonna be the questions that was asked again and I'm going to read you the examiners assessment okay relevant questions and agreed definition question one have you ever used any form of steroids in your entire life no question two have you ever used any form of growth hormone in your entire life no the polygraph charts were scored using the very latest computerized polygraph software as being and being manually checked by the examiner opinion and conclusion based on the test and during the examination and interviews it is the examiner's opinion that simeon panda should be classified as showing no deception indicated in relation to the questions number one and two listed above this isn't a I told you some moment this isn't an opportunity for me to glow I'm not interested in that I never had been um all I want is to be able to do what I do and help others motivate the youth that are coming up who who who are 16 and 15 and started when who are starting the same age I started why on earth are you guys trying to put them down like why are you trying to um look I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to get anyone that uses steroids that's that's your business you know I really couldn't care less you know um do you think do whatever is you want to do but like don't don't attack me for staying natural you know like it like it let me do my thing and you do your thing I don't I don't know what else you guys want to be fair I set a polygraph test with the chief examiner of polygraph testing in the UK I mean the guy is chairman of the British and European polygraph Association and a member of the American Association you cannot get higher than this guy in the UK for polygraph testing and then the test no deception indicated it's right there so um I don't know where we got from here where where do we go from here ah are we now going to start to to realize what what can be done what can be achieved okay so a polygraph test crews that I'm telling the truth I've never taken steroids in my entire life but I wanted to go step further I found the w88 which is the world anti-doping agency I looked for a laboratory in the UK and I found the drugs Control Center King's College London which is run by Professor David Cohen I spoke to him and I asked Frank come in and get drugs test he said that they all do tests for private individuals but he did give me details of rubble of all trees so I did my research and I found the good Liberatore now I didn't want to do a simple human test I've done urine tests before they don't have enough length of detection window and I need for what I'm trying to show you guys I need it to be as extensive as possible I've told the blood tests still again like urine won't show a full length of time you know so I was advised that a hair follicle test would be the best method of detecting steroids so what is hair drug testing drug and drug metabolites are incorporated into the hairs matrix from the bloodstream following drugs use hair drug testing detects drugs that are embedded in the hair 1.5 inches of hair can detect drug use for up to 90 days prior to testing which is way more than a urine sample you know so I went on this weekend Saturday and I had my hair sample taken for the drugs test hey guys this is Monday the 26th of October it is 10:19 a.m. and I'm about to go and do the hair drug test I'm here at the drug testing center here nom know in south southeast southwest London see I think they are they told me I'm not allowed to film in I when I found I'm not allowed to film the actual drug test because obviously there's people in there you know the private asked me kept private but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna you know talking to you guys now and I will talk to you guys after the test and let you know what they do and how it went and yeah that's it really and afterwards I'm gonna die have some breakfast so sure I'll talk with you guys again so heading in now i am i booked with this company to do hair drugs tests for six months one test every month for the next six months um i chose to do that because even though i've proven that you know i'm a lifetime natural bodybuilder from taking a polygraph test I just want I just want fully clear fully clear you know so um yeah I booked the test for six months and the why I want it what I what I want to share with you guys is the price just so you know how much I believe in natural bodybuilding you know how much I want to push it how much I want the youth to really give their best the test Crossley over 3000 pounds which is about $5,000 that's a lot of money that's a lot of money for anyone and by it's an investment into the future I see as an investment into the future of natural bodybuilding you know I I cannot wait to see the the energy and the passion that will now come from from the youth and and from everyone that can see what can really be achieved if you if you decide to stay natural you know and it is a choice it isn't this it is is a choice that's open to everyone you know um you don't have to choose it but I'm I'm here to basically show that natural bodybuilding you can do you can do a lot with it you know you can do a lot with your physique you can you can really grow you can build a formidable physique staying natural if you do so choose so the drug test for here takes about a month to get back because they have to send it to a different laboratory in another country and eventually it comes back so I'm going to post that when it comes so you'll get a series of these so but I've done the test I'm going to doing the test for six months so every month and when I get the results I will post them and just talk to you guys and you know keep you motivated so um yeah now I'm I'm sure a lot of you guys are maybe expecting me to call out the people that doubted me there youtubers that made whole videos like extensive videos like using my name and the titles to get followers and to get subscribers and to make money I could call them out and because they've obviously been proven wrong now but no um you don't deserve it you know you know that's it they don't bring you in on time so yeah what can I say guys believe in yourselves believe in yourselves you know natural bodybuilding is real I'm doing it I'm very proud to be doing it and I'm gonna keep doing it and and I I want to see you guys stepping up man step up you know do do your thing man you can you can really do it don't let no one don't let no one put me down hold it no one make you shy away from it you know you're gonna see people Excel past you I'm not gonna I'm not gonna front with you you know you're gonna see people Excel past you strength wise size wise maybe um you know they're gonna die people people that use they grow faster that's that's why they use it it's a given but if you do choose to stay natural stay confident and keep at it because you will grow I'm almost 14 years in the game and look at the position 
[Music] I just told you what we're doing and Symbian sim foots for the my club yeah this is a problem because now I'm going to say it but it's not going to be how I said it before was just before recording you I was saying to Jake that I need this mic you see this neck there you go automatic literally like you turn the camera on and it starts you turn it off and it turns off so that's what I need well again I'm going to put subtitles okay alright guys so we are going to jump in basically we ordered some cinema cards and on a Friday night we've always go to the cinema like without fail so we're gonna need our movie passes because it smells quite expensive here right ridiculous now with us in tomorrow once a week minimum so back in London we had that cinema car because obviously make sense so we got to the older one here hopefully arrives today because last weekend paid was it $50 for the cinema tickets and then $90 for food but food is the food because that's the person food by particular $50 and you have some more complaint as well guys you don't do sweet popcorn in the cinema it's salted this is the major problem like popcorn is are cheap snack [Music] [Music] [Music] No so we are at whelps we're gonna record inside laughs grabbing our food shopping but the only issue is we get stopped I know that supermarkets don't like you included in them they normally say no however you know we're just filming ourselves we don't know film anyone else we'll fill myself there enough food shopping so let's see how it goes but we're not gonna use a DSLR we're gonna use the GoPros you got GoPro straps Jakes chest and he's gonna follow us around while we grab the food that we buy now we only moved here a week ago and the groceries that we have in the UK are not the same as groceries that you have in the state's at different brands and the nutritional values vary dramatically from what we buy to what you guys buy now it's things like salt content salt content in your food in America is extremely high very very high so that's something that we're gonna have to look out for on almost every brand that we pick up the other thing is you'll meats are a bit weird you mean we always see this thing contains no antibiotics you know and things like that in in the meat and that my exchange for us because in the UK we don't have any labels out that because I assume is simply just not allowed you know so it's very weird for us to see all these labels on the meat saying all natural meats etc we'll assume it was natural me that's what it is so those are the other things that were gonna look out for when we buy the shopping once we finish doing the shopping we're then gonna take the food home and I'm gonna triangle through some stuff that we or why we bought it and you know give you an insight to our diets around all of spies chinky it should just be natural as I understand Thank You baguette everyone Nonnie said Mabel listen again Murchison so recently we stopped coming so it must be since I have it more tacky reason being it's equally the percentage of size I don't know it has a higher protein what's that it smells so good how many eggs you eat in the morning everybody eight minutes so different meals or if that's one meal how about about six and one yeah I want sit like that cool cool there's not that many jokes he actually will be about two yolks so absolutely huge my head wait yeah Wow nope first asparagus no the car they feed them beauty beauty that when I was people's not gonna even ends with TV recruit red ones are the sweetest greens are pointless they have no flavor the yellows have a salt flavor Wow and how will you eat that like when you put that in our dish or is it and I'll put it in whatever I'll stuff right omelette honey

a week the last time we were in LA and that you could probably pull two bottles of water two packets of two six-packs of water that's it there was nothing space that I could one gym bag and nothing

Ok guys for concentration curls tuck your arm in here Come right down Full flex right to the top Right down Full flex right to the top Your arm should be tucked in Up against your thigh Just like that 
hey guys so I'm back for my heavy leg session Sunday and good session powerful session Google of every way while the discuss today is going to that extra length so um what I like to call apex of exertion so when I trained most of my sessions I always aim to go as heavy as possible and I aim to get to that level where I'm pushing myself to the limit come on come on dick come on hammer but I'll be on every exercise every exercise every session I will in the gym what we're trying to do obviously we're trying to go we're trying to get our body to react and the best way to do that is to shock the body of course and to break down the foam me those sets leading up to that powerful heavy set are just like a woman the whole time I'm doing that and thinking this is just a warm-up for that big wing so I will do several sets most of my sessions can have up to eight eight to ten sets and those first few sets are me just warming up warming up warming up with a big lid Oh the reason I want to discuss it with you guys is I think it makes a big difference and can really improve the rate of your progress I trained with my training of a friend not too long ago and I was surprised by the lack of effort now when I say lack of effort I mean the the person I'm talking about they trained but they never really crossed that line into the the zone or bum be smart as you call it be smoked they never they never went there in on any of the any of the exercises on any of the sets and I really feel that that person will be missing out on games because they haven't because because they will go that extra mile and it's something I do every session come on Oh this is how I trained most sessions I'm always trying to push myself I'm always trying to try to see what I've got in the tank I don't want to leave the session with anything left I don't want to UM and down the set and know that there was there was more in the tank come on that was who I had that was I gave everything in that last rib if you're not doing that I feel that you're missing out on on games and you're missing out on strength gains as well me pushing my body like that means that in time that way that I've moved a foot foot vote for that rep when we come become easier eventually now I gave that grip everything and for me that's where I have the most enjoyment taking it to the sits to the limit you know and I mean to be fair I had to be like if training didn't involve me killing it like that I wouldn't I wouldn't enjoy it because like I said most of my sessions um all the other sets aren't build up and they they all lead to that big lift the lifts that I feel are most important so the other thing I want to say about you lifting your heaviest weight it's not the actual number like forget the bigger because I see a lot of you comparing the the amount lift to someone else and you're you know I live three eight five pounds is this I love that it's irrelevant it's completely available all that's relevant is are you pushing yourself how you feel when you perform that way um so for example I like ad to do a big lip give my give my wall and someone else could come and do the same way comfortably that means nothing to me that has no effect on my progress and if I if I had to start to consider that that that that supper person managed to do you know the same way as me ease it falls me up I don't need that I just need to focus on what I'm doing and make sure that I'm I'm doing everything I can to progress steadily you know someone just followed following on purpose nope focus on what you're doing because that's all that's important okay so to summarize always live to the best of your building a or the apex of exertion remember that a Oh e apex of exertion so on every session give your best every set give your best lift as hard as you can always go for that big lid because that's the lip that's important less the lip that's gonna make your water your dad make you what you want to grow to be able to handle it better next time a lot of new videos coming so make sure you subscribe check out my website simeon panda comm for training programs SVS Dexcom my clothing get this t-shirt there make sure you join my facebook join my twitter and just keep up the with it before I'm doing lots of big stuff coming so keep an eye out peace you 
[Music] so today we'll hit in legs and basically what I'm gonna go through is I'm gonna show you how I improve my squat most what techniques changed over the years and it's improved dramatically and now laughs Wayne it's funny because everyone has a love-hate relationship with squats you know you right now I just love them and that's it you know I'm not to do that I had to switch up my technique I had to have a complete overhaul and I'm gonna go through today you know the changes that I made that make a squatting today and enjoyable ready for me one of the first things the squat shoes you know this this changed everything for me you're gonna see why when I swap obviously one of the main things that changed my squat is death now going past parallel if there's a whole debate or whether you should you shouldn't our knees going over the toes etc etc you know for me the main reason why I love us now is because I managed to make it enjoyable for me and that may I made it comfortable you know so when I squat and now find it everywhere I'm comfortable have you rep I feel you understand glad as opposed to before where every rep was stressful and just not comfortable for me so I'm gonna show you today all the things that make it better a lot of people do static stretching before exercising I've never believed in static stretching even when I used to like trained clients back in the days of PT always dynamic stretching it and then an exhibition is where you mimic the exercise you're about to do without weight so I'm about to squat I'm going to mimic a squat no way movement get the joints lubricated the synovial fluid in the joints goody for the exercise as opposed to do anesthetics proper stretch as opposed in a static stretch I'm not about to beat it you know I'm about to squats on that as well [Music] don't be afraid I just stopped at the bar I know you guys don't want to be seen just square for the bond [Music] the main thing I changed for my squad that improved it was just a general view of not chasing weight you know before it was all about powerful you could I go you know especially when you're younger if you go back to videos of me like when I'm like a 21 22 it's all about how much plates can I put on how many plating up on can I do 6 6p frankly you know even I think the heaviest s why ever did was 275 kilos you know but if you watch that video back which I'll probably show on this video there's just no control of the weight you know and if you go back to my youtube videos with all the weight squat in six basic cetera you will always find a spot behind me involved in the actual in actual rips which I don't have anymore I don't have a spot when I squat anymore I just I've taken it back to just making sure I feel every rep making sure every rep counts you know so yeah if you see those old videos you'll see someone's fighting me on every single wake you know and it's just not about that you know so yeah the main thing I did was just change change this idea that I need to do the heaviest squat no I'm still walking right now it's about techniques I can join each rep so now if you know when that's what I do squat very deep and that's not because you know I'm trying to show oh look at what the patterns wait that's what I know I find comfortable you know before I just wasn't comfortable with those with parallel squats you know and parents were talking we're doing me justice and now I feel if you ever [Music] there is kind of death I'm comfortable I'm ready to drive up those perfect immutable that everyone will have difficulty what I suggest is finding finding a depth that works for you that is below Pamela so for me I'm perfectly comfortable down here I can drive my feet are still flat on the floor my knees made all that they've cut off my toes but when you're squatting to this kind of depth that's fine so when you read that we shouldn't go over toes it depends on what style are you actually going for especially we just watch shoes on give it me that heel that allows me to assume this position okay when should you leave apps when should you use a belt I've always said use them when you feel you need them so for me anything from three plates up I wrapped my knees and I thought my belt on it's funny because when I was younger and I used to swap I used to squat up to six plates no belt no knee wraps and it wasn't a case of whether I could do it or not the older guys in the gym used to say to me you want to but you should protect your knees protect your protect your back whether you need it or not just give yourself that support so obviously this is that ten years ago I'm now pretty one and yeah I'm taking that knowledge for what it is and I have wrapped my knees for the last few years and use the belt when it gets to a certain way so for me three plates up is when I start to wrap my knees it might be different for you unlikely from two plates or my room be from four etc but always protect your knees protect your back and it also aids your lift as well [Music] I mean it's like [Music] I've been chasing everything today so now regardless of how much weights on the bar I want the same death you know so you know you some people the heavier it gets the more shadow the squat will get for me on that would be unacceptable so I'm always going for the death regardless of what weights on there so even with this weight now I'm still gonna sit down on it just like I did with them one plate and the way I've worked up to doing that is just by you know practicing with lie awake and slowly working it you know there was a point where not being able to swap I used to kind of did tick me off a bit well now I don't really care you know it might not be as heavy as it once was bah it's better squats [Music] you [Music] so as you noticed no matter what the weight was it was always to death even one who went up to the poor and a half so it's just about feeling comfortable like I remember when I used to hit the 5 and the 6 I'm so like anxious going under because I didn't really feel like I had it and back to the matter is there's always a spot behind me so technically I never really did have it did I you know for me it's just about owning the weight take that way off get the depth on it drive up you know feel every rep you know so yeah change my squat to the turtle to be more comfortable now I love squaring an angel a everywhere all right so now still swaying lots more set stick on it said we're not gonna aim to get out of way outward so we'll walk walk clock starts keep the feet together [Music] again I'm going straight back to the bottle so I want to get make sure that my technique [Music] 
[Music] Oh as you can see is next me but it is not the heavy legs otherwise obvious cottage today is a Sunday so the next sessions are due on Sundays you know hamstrings some walking lunges some extensions but I saved the big leg sessions for Wednesday's I think this was change the next balance take off these lives for us to come let one day speak yesterday is all about hamstrings [Music] so what was important thing when you're doing if like that looks like back three though many the needs slight bend in the knees year now people were freaked out you know there's no bending in these there's a slight Bend you know and the main thing is just to make sure that you're cops that we're doing the movement you shouldn't feel any sharp pains or anything like that also make sure you go low enough to till you feel the stretch something we'll just do the motion actually feeling the muscle working you should get the stretch on to get to the pool your hamstrings tight and that's what they're working yeah it's not like I got a business you just as the focus on the hamstrings over the name over then it's a dead stop on New York this will just be gone until you feel the tension and then you come back up [Music] [Music] all right what my way down as you guys know I always tell you wanna do many other work heavy and then I'll come back down you know just to get a feel for you know all the different weights you know and some of it is increasing strength that's why I go heavy and then I was working on my form working on the movement so that's on the battery now [Music] where do you focus when you're doing exercises like redhead squeeze at the end of the squeeze the end of the end of the movement man suck hamstring is similar to your passive management squeeze right the end [Music] [Music] thank you this is the end at the end of the contraction you want to squeeze there's almost like a pause at the end so you really get that muscle up [Music] [Applause] [Music] I mean white mentions reported in four spots black when you go super deep Master Hunter is coming into play if you guys see my videos you know there are those super deep down I've given its own you know mixer on Sundays concentrating as many capturing exercises as I can as opposed to just mix in it off you know sports and everything else has its own date [Music] should you try to do like for exercise of the muscle that you did the yeah free this is like a lot of people will get so many exercises on a specific on a training day for me it's all about like volume you know so I'm tryna gets much volume with each exercise it effectively for me likes doing three sets of an exercise just doesn't make any sense it doesn't compute with me it's like three sets and I'm done and I have like three sets in fact my warm up and then yeah let's get into it let's get heavy you know let's work through the range you know so for me it's like you know a lot of sets and less exercises you know I'll choose sometimes it can be upset sometimes can be five exercises but mainly it's just like it's mainly about four exercises for four muscle group you know we're suffering like shoulders I'll hit the compound lives you know I'd get a big shoulder press from the front maybe a big shoulders from the back but then there's all these tertiary muscles like so I need to hit like my deltoids doing as many angles as possible so I'll be hit in front raises side and side laterals rear delts so sometimes it can be more but I tried to keep it down and keep running high with that tool sets [Music] what about some machines is there like you working in you work it in you no preference I have a preference yeah I do prefer free weights but there's some great machines the machines are good for you have certain hitting certain muscle groups in certain ways that you can do as effectively with free weights so I mix and match I'm not one of these people that kind of says there's one in the US I really like to mix and match with different different machines and different free weights you know whatever works as long as what your goal in mind target it here as best you can so obviously here I'm working with what I've got ideally today I would have liked to do specifically thickness with barbell as well but they don't have that here that then I'll have it here so you know I just work with what I've got as always there's always a way to hit the mosque [Music] [Music] it's the best position nothing to finish off the legs name and you don't even need weight once you've done all the stuff but once you've done that workout you don't really need wait to finish off with me you know if I'm doing walking lunges and I'm starting with it that's when you see me with a barbell on my back I'm sure you guys have seen some previous videos do that if I'm finishing with it my legs already tight full of blood and yeah I just like to do a few laps building coughs consistency is the key and the tendency some sunlight intensity frequency frequency and consistency the coughs for me I hear like five times a week so I do hit it on the next days but I hit it another three days after that so you know pretty much after the end of every workout in cuffs every now and then I'll have a day off if they feel a bit too tight but it's all about the frequency and making a system with them it does take time to broadcast they do grow sob slowly you might work your ass off and on again less than an inch a it's real work you know just takes time no such luck it's like a big bass [Music] 
so at airport and though we have to rush back really rush like so kind of fine but we made it I've got a new lens I'm gonna put in a camera can't wait to put on action and it's a 24 to 70 millimeter so we should get some wicked shots of santorini where we're going yeah that's about it man so I've had some food now so I'm feeling better if I don't eat in the morning I feel a little groggy that we made it yay so never be degrees I don't really know much about Greece um I've always seen pictures of Santorini and it looks amazing with the white buildings and the great views so we're looking to have a great time and should be a good good trip yeah yeah sure looks beautiful today yeah so I'm just testing out this new lens understood customers Wiki justice finding it was very much less true of course is boiling as well I will completely over dress this is baggage claim just one one baggage care except it was tiny so we have just been in the world smallest Airport ever like it was tight fine had one baggage claim which told you guys already one security book yeah one security guy that yeah yeah it was interested but now we just going to try to come to our hotel it's about 20 minutes away just hoping I'm hoping that they take card because I don't bring any cash make that no moola I am talking about now the bar over here is someone daily from 6 o'clock in the afternoon till 11 o'clock in the evening 6 if you don't have a nice drink go to a cocktail or a glass of wine before your dinner and also you must know that from this point you can have a pretty nice view of the sunset the Sun is setting down over there yeah this island that you are seeing the big one it is called feed Arcia now--there Asiya along with the dog yo so we just checked into our room and go taking a long long long guide of the whole hotel which is worth it because I told us where everything was as them right now one second hello thank you very much luggage this is the from the hotel you should really stop coffee on myself you know welcomes again a bit you know changed into it okay guys he begged me he said it's really cute when we match hey Becky he's a great event oppa Yeah right as if he were bad she's just a copycat man so I was in bitch already people ji-won of them yeah I worry that has a get that depends on the one they got what could be automatic and we'll come back what did you just say so down there miss copycat it wasn't wearing red and now is wearing red you want to look like 20 horrible I'll look even as flower so if any of your planning to come Santorini before I travel to I read some reviews and a lot of women were saying don't wear heels wear flats no I love Lauren Hill's I'm always a wedge or Hill or something I understand why they said that these roads and lots of stairs hey Moses they're gonna do a lot walking on this me too after walking for quite a bit about half an hour that one now in the city center area the type of we're gonna find something to eat and

don't I don't I don't I don't run out when I do my cardio it's normally just on a treadmill you know steady state cardio maybe walking on a treadmill but I'm we did a run around Santorini and loved it I loved it man but you know that was to do with seeing all the beautiful sights the fresh air being up nice and high and yeah great weather so that one was that one was good man so I'm yeah it's been a great trip man yeah we've got to weigh out like a couple of training sessions out of it cluster Randy I saw we've got to keep fit at the same time as having a good time and we ate a bit a bit hello you know yeah man loved it 
[Music] okay guys so what I'm gonna take you through today is just some of the points about shoulder training a lot of you guys big delts and big traps and I'm gonna just explain to you how I built mine and some of the methods that I use for building my shoulders [Music] so whenever I start shoulders I start with a press perform at least two presses before moving on to hitting the delts from different angles so the first thing I will start with is either a military press or a dumbbell press where I'm gonna show you [Music] so I'll do military presses or for example like I said dumbbell press or even machine press but I always start up a press the idea behind it is I want to conserve my energy for the big IFS you know so I will start for something like this as opposed to starting off with doubts because once I've worked my delts I will be able to get as much strength in a big press like this so after doing a military or dumbbell press I will then do another sort of press that could be an Arnold press or it could be a military press from behind the neck a lot of people don't do that but I personally do it because I feel like it hits the shoulders from a different angle and it really does work them in a good way there's a safe way to do it and that is to start very light start with the bar get your technique back and slowly work your way up it does put your neck in a precarious position because you're behind it like that but as I said it's just one of those exercises you take it song [Music] so providing you keep the weight like it should be fine you know just take your time with it it's not one of those exercises where you throw a little weight on and try and do it just take your time get the technique and just work on the form on that exercise so after all the presses I didn't move on to working on my delts and for that we're going to start with dumbbells [Music] okay so after my presses I then need to work on my delts now the delts have three parts to the anterior and mid deltoid and the posterior so what I'm gonna do is I want to hit all those areas so what I normally start with I'm only start with side laterals to hit the side of the deltoids [Music] [Music] I always start light and worked my way up so here we only have 10 kg by sometimes I work up to maybe even 30 kg you know so I always start like get the rhythm as you build up up the hit inside that walls we need to hit the interior so for interior with energy front raises so grab the dumbbells like so and with this you can either do them at the same time or you can do them unilaterally so that's one at a time what I tend to do is I'll start doing it at the same time while it's light and then when I get to heavier dumbbells I do it unilaterally [Music] okay so we're not on our side levels and our front ways is to get our interior ducks now we need to get the posterior delts and we need to hit the traps let's move on [Music] we live in free head for the delts as you know which at the anterior we've hit the mid now we need to hit the posterior several exercises you can use to hit the posterior delts you can do face pulls you can use dumbbells and here a reverse fly but today we're going to use the PEC deck and use the reverse grip [Music] okay so we've done our presses we've done side laterals we've done our front raises for interior and we've even here our posterior delts now traps shrugs [Music] okay so one out the final exercise I always finished my shoulder sessions with shrugs heavy shrugs when we start on about five plates and finish up on six to seven you know for me shrugs has been the staple exercise for building traps so let's get started [Music] [Music] and we are done that is shoulders what you'll know is that I hit the shoulders from every angle and not volume actually is quite a bit of volume so always make sure that you get your presses in and you hit your delts from as many angles as possible and make sure you've got an exercise to hit your traps that can either be shrugs or it can be an upright roll you know there's several ways to hit your your traps and it doesn't have to be shown to the barbell or it can be with a dumbbell also these guys [Music] 
morning we are in Miami for like bananas our second day I'm a bit late with the blogging but but I'm billing the blogging but I'm sure you guys are gonna see the video from the daya I had that excited

here so much for having this bro don't see on the video the China thousand we are going for food little weird all I know is we're going somewhere where they put olives in the Bolognese seems really excited okay because our homemade polonaise it's really nice we put like just everything all nice lovely fresh vegetables and every time we go to a restaurant it's never quite up to our standard so yeah we're going to an Italian and I'm gonna have bread I'm gonna wine I'm gonna have whatever I won yeah with the Bolognese and the olives that she's talking about no joke when we make one of these at home it's the best best ever there's so much flavors this is olives they're sweet peppers this spinach sometimes mushrooms are are our bolognaise is the best you know so when we go to friggin restaurants and they give you basic Bolognese it just never tastes the same basic blend boiling eggs just doesn't cut and this restaurant we're going to now I tweet the per tweet out and I ask you know what good Italian mushrooms and where someone tweeted one I check the menu the Bolognese look good it had olives in it that just to me says that's going to it's not going to be basic so we'll see uneven if I'm going to get one of eggs but just seeing that this when I was probably going to be a decent Italian hopefully okay so I've only just discovered these blot films from Mac they are friggin amazing hmm like literally it doesn't touch my makeup I just blot and the oil comes off all right sim ones have a go you thinking get more oil than me it's available already just éé éé shit in a bit
