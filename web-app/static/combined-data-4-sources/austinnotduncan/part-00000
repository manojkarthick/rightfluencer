- Hey, guys, this is Austin. The LG Gram was one of my
favorite laptops in 2017 but now it's back for 2018
with a brand new edition. Huge shout out to LG for not
only sponsoring this video but also for hooking us
up with the very first 2018 Gram outside of LG. Yes, this is a sponsored video. However, if you guys have
been watching the channel for a while, you'll know that I
really, really like the Gram. This is my 2017 LG Gram. If you caught my video I did last year, there is a lot that I
like about this laptop. However, there were a few things that I wasn't such a huge fan of and that's pretty much what
the 2018 Gram is all about. The Gram is still available in 13, 14, as well as 15 inch varieties. This is the maxed out 15 inch version, which LG sent mostly
so I could take a look at some of the higher
end features that you actually can get with the Gram now. Pop open the box and the first thing we see is the Gram itself. (laughing) Wow. After using the 13 for about a year now, the 15 looks enormous but it's
still pretty light weight, especially considering
how big the laptop is. We're also going to get a
USBC to ethernet adapter. Like the previous Gram this is helpful, although it is only 10/100 ethernet. It's not going to be crazy fast
but nice to have in the box. Then we get the power adapter. One of the nice things is that, even though this is the
standard barrel plug, you actually can use USBC
on the Gram to charge it. Especially if you have one
of the LG USBC monitors or pretty much any other USBC charger, you can plug it in that way. For such a big laptop, it always surprises me
at how light this is. I think that's actually where
the Gram name comes from. It weighs just over a kilogram. Even though it kind of looks like plastic, it's actually a magnesium alloy. According to LG, it's actually survived a lot of different durability testing, although I'm not exactly
going to drop test my shiny new, one of
a kind laptop to test. I'll just take their word for it. I'm not drop testing the laptop, Ken. Take a closer look inside the laptop and you'll see that two
of the biggest features have their own wonderful
stickers on board. In case you're curious
about your new laptop, this guy not only has the
new 8th Gen Core processors but it also has an upgrade
to a full Thunderbolt 3 port. In addition to doubling as a USBC port, the Thunderbolt 3 port also does support power, data, as well as something like a 5K monitor or even an external GPU. You should keep in mind that not all of the new Grams will have Thunderbolt 3. Some will just have standard USBC, but this is a really nice thing to see. You're also getting the
power plug, a USB 3.0 port, as well as a full size HDMI. On the other side, at least
on the 15 inch version, you're going to be getting
two more USB 3.0 ports, a headphone jack, as well as microSD. One of the biggest upgrades for the Gram is the brand new Quad Core processors. Inside this guy, we're
getting a Core i7-8550U, 16 gigabits of RAM, as well
as one terabit of SSD storage. Don't get me wrong, the old
Gram wasn't exactly slow, but moving up to a Quad Core processor makes a big difference, even
in normal day to day use, especially when you get into heavier tasks such as light video editing or gaming. This guy also now has dual channel memory, which is going to free up
a lot of additional memory bandwidth, especially
when it comes to gaming. You probably shouldn't pick up the LG Gram as a gaming computer, but
the UHD 620 graphics are okay for some light gaming,
such as Rocket League. Here we're playing at 720 p and that was terrible
on performance settings. You know what, we'll just
call that intentional. Remove a few screws from the bottom and you get access to
everything inside the laptop. You might very well void
your warranty like this but there's actually some
interesting stuff in here, including not only access to our memory, we also have dual SSD slots. Most Grams will ship with
one of these SSD slots empty. However, because we have
the one terabit version, this is going to be populated
with a pair of 500 gig drives. It's really nice to be able to see that not only can you upgrade
your memory but you can also add an additional SSD down the road. You know what, I've got to
give LG a shout out here. This is a really easy to work on laptop. Even though they might
not necessarily want you to get inside of here,
everything is logically laid out. You can get at your memory,
you can get at your SSDs, the battery is pretty much
right front and center. They did a really good job
of making this very friendly if you do need to get in here
to, say, repair something. Battery life has been one
of the big strong suits of the Gram and that continues this year. We're going from a 60 watt
hour to a 72 watt hour battery, which brings battery
life from 18 hours up to supposedly 22 and a half according to LG. Keep in mind that that is
with the 13 inch model. The 15 does lose a little bit off the top and you also have to consider that even though that does have
that bigger battery it's going to be slightly offset by
the more powerful processor. That being said, this
guy is going to last you a very, very long time off the battery. Regardless of whether you pick up the 13, 14, or 15 inch
version of the Gram, you're going to be getting
a 1080 p IPS panel. That resolution might
not be anything crazy, but it's plenty sharp
even on the 15 inch model. Color is nice and vibrant, you're getting good viewing
angles, decent brightness, and importantly some of the best contrast I've ever tried on a laptop. One of the more annoying
things with the original Gram was the placement of the webcam. It's below the screen
and gives a great view of the inside of your nose. Thankfully, LG has addressed
this with the new Gram when they moved the webcam
up top above the screen. You know, like every other laptop ever. Another small but welcome improvement is with the fingerprint sensor. Before, it was on the touch pad. While it really wasn't that big of a deal, it could get in the way sometimes. However, thankfully for the
2018 model they've moved it back to a much more sensible
location of the power button. I've gotta give LG props. It really does feel like they were listening to the feedback
from the 2017 model and rolled a lot of that into
tweaking the new 2018 edition. If I may make one suggestion
for the 2019 LG Gram, how about a dedicated GPU option? If you guys wanna know more,
feel free to check this guy out at the link in the description. I'm curious, what do you
think about the 2018 LG Gram? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Today is the launch of the iPhone X which could be the most
hyped phone of the year, well, unless you count this of course. I recently did a video on the Pixel 2, and I came away with it
thinking that it is one of my favorite phones I've ever tried, but how does it stack up to the iPhone X? So if we pop this guy open, we see designed by Apple in California. Who cares about that? What I care about is the iPhone X. Wow, it actually is a little
bit thicker than I thought. It's probably about the same
as something like the 8, but, interesting. The black looks really nice, so that along with the metal band that's sort of this dark chrome, this is a good looking phone. But before we get too far into it, let's see what else we get. Surprise, surprise! Inside the box is the
standard power adapter, even though this iPhone supports
not only wireless charging but also fast charging. But, this works. We also get a pair of Lightning EarPods as well as the Lightning to
3.5 millimeter adapter. The same as pretty much all
of the iPhone 7s, 8s, that kind of thing. There is a Lightning to USB cable. So with the iPhone X powered up, the first thing I noticed is the notch. Now to be fair, the bezels
around the rest of the phone are really tiny, probably
smaller than pretty much anything besides maybe something
like the Galaxy S8. But the notch, it's noticeable, although I don't think it's
gonna be that big of a deal. Just using it for three seconds, I've almost forgot it's there. Put the iPhone side by
side with the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL, and you'll see it's
actually fairly similar to the size of the standard Pixel. Now that is even including
the fact that this has a 5.8 inch display which is nearly as big as the six inch display on the XL 2. All of this being said, I actually prefer the
standard size of the Pixel 2 for reasons that I'll
get into in a minute, but it is hard to argue with just how nice of a piece of hardware the iPhone X is. My only slight issue with the
hardware is the camera hump. It's a lot larger than I would expect. Now to be fair, the Pixel
XL 2 does have a little bit of a camera hump, but
compared to the iPhone X which just kind of rattles around, it's a lot bigger. On the other hand, the iPhone X does
support wireless charging where the aluminum-backed
Pixel 2 does not. Both phones are IP67 rated
which means that in theory, they should survive under one
meter of water for 30 minutes. However if you watched my
iPhone 7 Plus video last year, it died in about seven seconds
of being in a bowl of water. So, here goes nothing. Ugh! Ooh! All right, iPhone X is in. Now let's get the Pixel in. Okay, well, the water
is going over the table, but the screens are on. I'm going to leave them in for one minute because I don't wanna break my phones. Hey, I'm just being honest. (chuckles) All right, so, (chuckles) water's going everywhere. It looks like both phones are fine. Sweet! I don't have to spend a bunch of money on new phones.
(laughs) Inside the iPhone X is
the Apple A11 Bionic chip which has three high-power cores and three low-power cores, three gigabytes of RAM, and either 64 or 256 gigs of storage. On the other hand, the Pixel 2 has the Snapdragon 835 which takes four high-power cores and four low-power cores, puts them together with four gigs of RAM and either 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage. When you take a look at the performance in Geekbench, though,
it is not even close. The iPhone X is hands down
the fastest phone out there. On the graphics side with GFXBench, while it's a little bit closer, it's still really hard to
argue with the iPhone X which is really impressive considering that the iPhone has two fewer cores. At this point, not only is
it faster than pretty much any other phone out there, but it's starting to approach
a lot of high-end laptops. Of course, benchmarks are one thing, and the real world use is another. So the Pixel 2 is hands down
the fastest Android phone I've ever tried, even though, yes, on paper, it might not be quite
as fast as the iPhone. In actual practical use, it's really hard to see a difference. Something that the iPhone X dropped but the Pixel 2 still has
is the fingerprint sensor. I've gotta say this one is great. Not only is it placed on
the back of the phone, which is really simple to get at, but it's also incredibly quick. So to setup Face ID on the iPhone, it should be pretty simple. All I need to do is
look all the way around, and it should scan my face. Raise the phone, and swipe up, and it's unlocked. That's actually pretty quick. I'm curious, though,
how well Face ID works when it's laying flat on
something like a table. I'll try to unlock it here, swipe up. Oh, it got it! All right. I still have my reservations about how good Face ID is
going to be in the long run, but at first glance, it
actually does seem to be pretty well implemented. While it's not the most practical thing, I've gotta say that Animoji on
the iPhone X are kind of fun. So if I hit record here, hey guys, this is Austin. Are Animoji worth it? Well you do need to learn some
new gestures on the iPhone X. So instead of having a Home button, instead you swipe from the
bottom to leave an app, and then you swipe up and to the right to pull up your multitasking. From here, you can go
between your different apps or you can use the little
thing on the bottom to actually scroll
between which app is open. It does take a little
bit of getting used to, but it's actually not bad. In comparison, the Pixel 2
feels downright normal. So there are some cool features such as the always-on display which I like to be able to see stuff like time, date,
notifications at a glance. The Pixel also has Google Assistant which I like a lot more than Siri. To activate you just need to
squeeze the frame of the phone. The main feature of the iPhone X, though, is absolutely the display. It's rocking a 5.8 inch, 2436 by 1124 AMOLED display. Not only is this the first time
that Apple's gone with OLED, but as you can see, the
bezels are absolutely tiny. What this means is that
you're basically getting an iPhone-8 sized chassis but with a much, much larger screen. I've gotta say it works. It's right up there with the Galaxy S8 and Note8 as far as some of
the best screens out there. So it's nice and saturated, it's pretty sharp. While there is just a
little bit of color shifting when you look at it off angle, it is nowhere near as bad as the Pixels. The standard Pixel 2 has a pretty decent 1080p five inch OLED display. While it's nothing spectacular, it totally gets the job done. When you switch to the Pixel 2 XL though, that's where you take a hard
turn into garbage town. When you look at it dead on, the colors are okay, but stuff like reds look awfully brown. When you look at it off angle, it looks very blue. There've been a lot of reports of issues with screen burn-in. Now Google will be releasing an update which will supposedly
help some of this stuff, but when you compare it to the iPhone X, it is no competition. At the very least, audio is an area where
neither of these phones have major issues. They both have stereo speakers. Hey guys, this is Austin. Inside this mysterious brown
box is what I very much hope is the Xbox One X, but the question is, is it worth it? So first of all-- You know what? I think they both sound good, but I actually do have to
give the lead to the Pixel. It's a little bit louder
and a little bit clearer. Of course, that's not a big deal when you plug in a pair of headphones as both of these have headphone jacks. Oh, oh, right, it's 2017. Neither of them have a headphone jack. Cameras is where both of
these phones really excel. The Pixel 2 has a 12 megapixel camera, and the iPhone X has a pair of them. One wide-angle, one telephoto. While it might only have a single camera, some of the images that I've gotten from the Pixel 2 really are incredible. The auto HDR does a great job of bringing a ton of dynamic range into a shot. It does a really good job
of being very, very sharp. It's also optically stabilized
just like the iPhone. The low-light performance
is not bad either. There's really not a lot to
complain about with the Pixel. When it comes to the iPhone X, you're also getting solid dynamic range. Because it is the same
camera from the 8 as well as the 8 Plus, you're also getting nice saturation. A lot of the images look
a little bit punchier than on the Pixel. Both cameras also have Portrait mode. So let's start with the iPhone X. That's not bad. Some of the advantages of this phone is that both of the cameras
are optically stabilized which actually does make
a pretty big difference for the Portrait mode
compared to the 8 Plus. On the other hand, the Pixel 2's Portrait mode
is purely based on software. So, if you look closely, you'll see that it's not quite perfect. Some of the edges are a little bit soft. It doesn't fully blur the
background in this shot. But a lot of times, I
actually prefer the results from the Pixel 2, which
is really impressive considering that it doesn't
have that second camera. Where it really shines is
with selfie-Portrait mode. Yeah look at that, that's great! So not only does it do a
really good job with the hair, but the background is
very naturally blurred. We take a look at it on the iPhone X, yeah, that's just not as good. You can see that my hair
is a little bit blurry. It didn't really perfectly cut my shirt out of the background either. Video is also solid. So this is what the 4K 24 looks like from the iPhone X, and especially when you look at stuff like stabilization and color, it's nice! If you switch over to the Pixel, it is also pretty solid, although one of my big
problems with this mode is that the audio just isn't very good. Both the iPhone X and Pixel 2 are incredibly expensive phones. So the Pixel 2 pairs
one of the best cameras on a smartphone with solid audio, and a really impressive build of Android. The iPhone has my favorite
hardware of any phone ever, and the screen is right
up there with the best like the Galaxy S8 and the Note 8 which is where the Pixel falls apart. When it comes to spending
$850 on a smartphone, a bad screen is a straight
up deal breaker for me, which leaves the standard Pixel 2. When you consider that it is $350 cheaper than the iPhone X, I'm willing to put up with
the less impressive screen and the giant bezels. It really is a crazy, crazy good phone! If you have the budget, you're not gonna be
disappointed with the iPhone X, but for a lot of people, the standard Pixel 2 actually
makes a lot of sense. So which one would you guys go for? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Fairphone 2 and it is a fully-modular smartphone. What's different about this
is unlike something like the Essential or the Moto Z, which is more about adding things to your phone to get more functionality,
with the Fairphone, say something like the screen breaks or the camera is outdated. The idea is that you
can literally just pop the screen out and put a new one in without having to throw away your phone. Open this guy up and we
see the Fairphone itself, which actually looks really cool. So the idea here is that you should be able to very, very
easily swap parts out. So not only can we take out the battery, but there are actually a couple of tabs on the bottom. So if we flip these back, in theory, I've actually done this before, but we can just pop the screen right off. Seriously, I just unboxed the phone and took the screen out
in like eight seconds. With the screen gone, we can get access to several other modules. So up top here, we have the headphone jack as well as the front-facing camera. We have the main camera module here, and we also have the speaker as well as the micro USB cable on the back. So what's cool about the Fairphone is that there are seven different modules that you can buy. And so say something
breaks or you just want to upgrade it, you can pretty much buy all of them on the Fairphone site. This might be the first time that I've completely taken a phone apart before I've even finished the unboxing. So with just a couple of screws, we have the camera out of the phone. So what they're doing
here is they actually have these little pins that are
on the actual camera itself. And I assume that these are the same pins that go on all of the other different modules to connect things. So that, I believe, is the
Fairphone fully broken-down. So this is what I believe
they call the core module. So inside here is where you have stuff like the CPU, the radios,
all that kind of stuff. But when you look at it like this, it's a cool package. Once everything is put back together, you'll find that not only does it support dual SIM cards, but also a microSD up to 64GB. So the thing with the Fairphone is, it's not a flagship. It's reasonably decently-specced, but don't expect too much. The real novelty here is the fact that you can really just take the whole thing, tear it apart, put it back together, and you
have a working smartphone. And we are up and running. So, the first thing that jumps out to me about the fully-assembled Fairphone is that it's a little bit chunky. This is definitely not the most slim smartphone in the world. But of course, most smartphones are nowhere near this easy to get into, so you do have some tradeoffs. Inside, this is rocking
specs straight out of 2014. So it's rocking a quad-core
Snapdragon 801 processor with two gigabytes of RAM, as well as 32 gigabytes of storage. This isn't that bad, but when you take a look at the benchmarks,
it's definitely well behind a more modern flagship. Keep in mind though
that the Snapdragon 801 was super high-end in 2014. Yes, that might not mean a
whole lot three years later, but this is still going to perform just as well, if not better, than
a lot of budget phones today. To be fair, the screen is pretty decent. So it is a five-inch panel
with a 1920 by 1080 resolution. It definitely won't shame
any current flagships, but considering that most of the specs of this phone are from
2014, it's actually kind of similar to the HTC
One M8 in that regard. Good, but definitely a couple
of years behind the times. It also has a 2,420 milliamp hour battery. That's fairly small for
a smartphone these days. Now, I get it that the Fairphone is definitely not meant
to be a spec monster. The real benefit here is
the fact that it's modular. But, you're definitely giving up a fair few specs to get there. - [Ken] (chuckling), fair few specs. - Eeeeey! (laughing) This guy's also rocking
an eight megapixel camera. So if we line up Mr. Bolido
here, it doesn't look bad. It might not be the most punchy image in the world, but again, 2014 specs are kind of a trend with this guy. We also have 1080p video. It looks decent, but
again, the camera here is really nothing to be
that impressed about. Most importantly, we have
a super-high resolution two megapixel front-facing camera for that awesome selfie action. Okay, well that actually looks a little bit crunchy, but
you can take it apart. The real advantage of
using the Fairphone 2 though is absolutely that modularity. So it does bring it a lot
closer to something like a PC. Say if some part goes down,
you can just swap it out, or in theory, upgrade
it with something better when it comes out. And the parts themselves are
actually not that expensive. So say you break the screen
and you wanna replace it, it's only going to cost you about $100. Even something like the camera module is only going to cost you about $40 to get a replacement. So it's not exactly like you're going to break the camera very easily, but one of the big
draws of the Fairphone 2 is that in theory, as
new and better things like cameras come out, it's going to be fairly simple to just throw a new one in your phone. And that's really where the idea of the Fairphone 2 starts making a lot more sense. So what's a decent phone today, instead of throwing it away in a year or two when you're ready to upgrade to your next phone, imagine instead where you throw in a new screen when something comes out, a better processor, bigger battery. All of that kind of stuff should in theory give you a lot more life out of the phone. Unfortunately all this relies on the idea that Fairphone is going to continue making modules and continue
supporting the Fairphone 2. That's obviously their idea, but until more stuff comes out, it's a little bit of a risk. And that brings us around to one of the bigger downsides
of the Fairphone 2. Now only is it only available
in Europe right now, but it's pretty hard to get your hands on. Once you do, it's not going to come cheap. This guy runs about 530 Euros, which in American dollars is like, 600? Actually, let me do that
translation real quick, I didn't even think about. - [Siri Automated Voice]
The answer is $592.74. - I'm gonna pretend I knew that. That's pretty much in
full flagship territory. While the phone is cool and there's a lot of advantages, it's hard to justify that kind of price for it. To be fair, a lot of people on Twitter are really curious about the idea of a modular smartphone. So, let me know in the comments below. What would it take for you to buy a modular smartphone,
Fairphone or otherwise? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
Hey guys, this is Austin and today I'm trying the new Surface Pro. So, big shout to Microsoft for inviting us out here, all the way to Shanghai, and this is the ... the lineup. So this is not the Surface Pro 5. Instead they're dropping the numbers and going with a much more simple and easy to remember: new "Surface Pro" name. But what's cool is pretty much all the stuff that you expect out of the Surface Pro is still here. So you still have access to the type cover, you do have a new surface pen, but most importantly, this is sort of the most advanced tablet the size of an iPad. So, there's actually a lot new with the Surface Pro even though it actually doesn't look all that different. So, one of the big things is they've actually refined the design a fair bit. So, even though it's very, very similar on the outside, they've smooth a lot of the edges down, it's a little bit lighter, it's a little bit thinner, and it does feel nice in the hand. While the real improvements have been on the inside. So, this is now rocking an Intel Kaby Lake processors, this particular model is outfitted with the i7 7660U, there's also Core M3 and Core i5 models. What's interesting is the Core i5 model actually is completely fanless. So, you can imagine that while it looks pretty much the exact same on the outside, it is completely passively cooled. Not exactly like this is going to be a loud device to begin with, but it's really cool to have a proper Core i5 without a fan. So with those new chips come better performance, so they're claiming around 20% better performance which probably is a little bit optimistic what should be a big improvement is the battery life. So, the new surface pro 4 is rated for up to 13 hours of use. Now that's compared to nine hours on the previous generation and that is a big big bump. They've achieved this in a couple different ways. First of all it has a bigger battery which is always helpful. Those Kaby Lake chips are a little bit more efficient and Windows 10 Creator Update is a little bit more well optimized for the Surface. Now this is actually a big jump, not sure it doesn't quite match these 14 hours of the surface laptop. We're talking about a device that you can pretty confidently take with you all day without needing to charge it up. Something that hasn't really changed are the ports. So, you still have a single USB 3.0 type-A, a mini display port as well as the magnetic surface connector for charging. That's not really a huge deal but it's bizarre to see a mini display port on a brand new device in 2017. It really would be nice if it had USB type C or even Thunderbolt 3 for this price. Speaking of price the new Surface Pro starts at 799 dollars which is about the same as the last gen. However it no longer comes with the Surface pen out of the box. Now to be fair this is a upgraded version of the Surface pen, but if you want it, it's going to run you an additional $99. The new Surface pen has four times more levels of sensitivity, which is nice if you're actually talented unlike me. What I can tell is there's a lot less lag here, so it pretty much feels almost one-to-one. It's not quite perfect, but it is a big improvement over previous Surfaces. Now, what's cool is this pen is actually is going to be compatible with other Surface models, but it's going to be pretty much ready to go out of the box with the new Surface Pro. The kickstand now goes almost entirely flat, which is nice so they call this the studio mode, but of course if you want a fully flat tablet you can just, you know, not use the kickstand. And that's one of the cool things about the new Surface Pro. Well sure there aren't a lot of huge new upgrades, it's a solid update, there's a lot of small things that do add up. So if we drop it on the tight cover, you'll see this is a little bit different from the previous generation. So, it now has the new Alcantara touch that is very similar to what you'll find on the Surface laptop. The keyboard is not bad at all. Uh It's maybe not my favorite, I think a lot of laptop keyboards are a little bit better, but you have to keep in mind that this is built into a cover, which is easily detachable, it's fully magnetic and honestly it doesn't feel bad. So, one of the cool things about this new tight cover is it does have a fair bit of travel, I believe they quoted something like 1.2 millimeters, which is a little bit more than on some certain other Macbo... I mean laptops. There's like an entire meeting right here. Ok, so, I got a little loud, time to bust out the big guns. Something interesting is that Microsoft repeatedly called the Surface Pro a laptop and not a tablet, which is interesting because it's exactly as much of a tablet as it was before, as not only does it not come with the pen, it also does not come with the keyboard. So, yeah, the Pro will also be available with an LTE option in a couple months which is nice as it does help to differentiate it between the other surface products. As you can see on the table behind me there are now quite a few. So the Surface Book is a little bit of an oddball, it's definitely the most powerful laptop that Microsoft sells, it's also just quirky and it doesn't close all the way and it's very expensive, so I feel like it's a little bit more of a niche sort of thing. The Surface laptop I think is much more interesting because it really does feel like a major attack on stuff like the MacBook Air. It's around the same price and I would argue that the hardware is much much nicer, which leads the surface pro as a sort of tablet sort of laptop sort of "not sure where's that in life" thing. Honestly for the Surface line to have started with the tablets, it feels like it's kind of gotten to a point where I'm not really sure where else they can take it from here. And that isn't that necessarily a bad thing. I think a lot of people really do like the Surface Pro line, but with stuff like the Surface laptop which kind of does the laptop thing better, it's weird I'm not really totally sure who should really be picking this up. We have options like this or that or this or that. The new Surface Pro will be available on June 15th, the same day as the Surface laptop. So let me know in the comments below what you guys think about this and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Apple HomePod and at $350, I have exactly one question,
"Why does it exist?" Now no, I'm not trying to say this is some useless product or that it
is not meant for anyone. When you consider that the world is filled with Amazon Echos and Google Homes that cost 40 or $50, a $350 speaker that has Siri inside, that's a little bit of a hard sale for most people. So in classic Apple fashion,
the unboxing is super simple, no giant stabbing knife needed. So this has come out today
and it's a little bit late. I think this was originally
supposed to come out late last year. But the idea here is that
this is a very high end, a very good sounding speaker
that just happens to have Siri. You know what I'll say,
this looks really nice. So it has this fabric
mesh all the way around, it's nice and soft. It's definitely a little
bit of a different look. Although the power cable's built in, okay. We also have designed
by Apple in California with what I assume is yes,
a single Apple sticker. Not a lot of accessories
with your $350 smart speaker, but all that matters is
how does it actually sound. Alright, so, $350, a lot of money. But I will say there
actually are some nice things about the hardware. So like I was saying, this
fabric finish feels pretty nice and it even comes across
to the power cable. There's a lot of attention to detail here. What you won't find with
the HomePod is anything besides this power cable. So there's no USB, there's no Bluetooth. There's not even going to
be any kind of aux input which now that you think about it, Apple's killed the headphone
jack on everything else. It makes sense to kill it on the speakers. What you will see however
is a little tiny grid of LEDs that are below the sorted frosted panel on the top. So it's kind of cool, but
there's not a proper screen. It's more for kind of
giving you notifications and sort of a little
bit of a colorful thing when Siri's listening. Like EarPods, the setup is going to be pretty straightforward. So if you have an iPhone and yes, you're probably gonna want to have a lot of Apple products for
the HomePod to make sense, you'll see a little setup icon right here. Do that and it should
sync it with the Apple ID. One thing you probably will want with the HomePod is Apple Music. So it does support Airplay
so things like Spotify and YouTube will work. However, if you actually want it to work properly just using your voice, you're going to want to use Apple Music. They're very specific. The HomePod is for people
who have everything Apple. Before we get started, I'm going to give everyone a warning. The words Hey Siri and
Hey Google are about to be spoken many many times. You've been warned. - [Siri] Sorry, I can't
search the webpage. - The main reason to pick up
the HomePod though is for music and at least on paper,
this sounds pretty good. So you're getting seven microphones that are paired up with an Apple AA chip which not only are going
to be listening for you to call Siri but also
it's going to be able to tune the music for your specific room. Now to do that, it uses
the total of eight speakers inside this guy. So there's seven small speakers that are spread out all the way around to be able to give you a full 360 sound, but there's also going to be
a single four-inch subwoofer. So at this point, if you have Apple Music, you can just tell it to play a song. However, if you're like
me and use Spotify, you're gonna have to
airplay it from your phone. So of course you're gonna
be listening to this on YouTube so everything
is going to be compressed, but we do have a microphone
here to hopefully give you a decent idea of what this
sounds like in person. Let's give it a try. (soulful music) I will say one thing. This does a really good job of giving you that full 360 sound. No matter really where this is placed, you're pretty much going to hear the same thing around. Something else is immediately apparent. This guy, even though it's obviously a very small speaker, has a lot of bass. (heavy metal bass music) It's also really apparent
that they're doing a good job of making sure
it doesn't bottom out. So even though there is a lot of bass, it's not really overpowering
the rest of the music. And even when you crank
it up to higher volumes, it stays surprisingly well put together. And I guess for a $350 speaker, you hope it sounds pretty good, but I'm pretty impressed. Hey Siri, pause. One thing I will say is
that the microphones do a really good job even
when you're cranking it to be able to actually
hear you pretty well. However, I think the best
way of actually being able to properly test how well
this sounds is put it up against its biggest competitor. When I say biggest, I mean biggest, the Google Home Max. So if you guys are not familiar, the Google Home Max is very much the sort of Google
competitor to the HomePod. And yes, it is much
larger, but there's a lot of things that are going
to be very similar. So this has Google Assistant
whereas this has Siri. They both have multiple speakers inside that are going to be working together and they both also do have a version or the sort of room sensing technology that will tune the
sound based on what kind of environment that you're in. There are some advantages
to the Google Home though including the fact that
not only does it have a USB port, but it also supports Bluetooth as well as Aux In. So you know if you're
not living in 2018 yet, this has got you covered. However, the price it runs
is kind of surprising. Whereas the HomePod runs
a pretty expensive $350, Google will charge you $400
for the Google Home Max. Hey Google, play Hotel California. - [Assistant] Okay, Hotel
California by Eagles. ("Hotel California" by Eagles) - So at first glance, they're actually surprisingly different. So the Google Home Max is louder, kind of expected with it
being a much larger speaker. However, it completely lacks
that 360 directionality of the HomePod. So from the side, it's kind of okay, but from the front, it is very very loud. Now the HomePod, even though
it's a little less bassey, I think does a much
better job of making sure that you really hear all of
the different instruments. There's a lot of
separation between the two. But let me just do a few other songs and kind of fully actually test to see what these guys sound like. Although to be fair, Hotel
California is the only song anyone actually needs to listen to, but I guess I could play
like two or three other songs if you really want me to,
for some weird reason. Hey Google, play Like Whoa from Logic. - [Assistant] Like Whoa by Logic, sure. Playing on Spotify. - Okay, so after listening to these both for a little while, my
impressions are pretty firm. This sounds good. It's decent in the vacuum,
but there's a lot of bass and it is very directional. The HomePod, there's just
so much more separation. You hear all the different instruments. You hear the different vocals. Like everything is very sort of layered whereas this, it feels a little
bit flattened in comparison. It's a good speaker, but there's no doubt, the HomePod sounds phenomenal. However, that's just
one piece of the puzzle. So sure, if you're just going to buy one of these for pure audio quality, you can stop watching now. But I think what a lot of
people are interested in is how the actual assistants
on these guys work. Hey Google, when do the Olympics start? - [Assistant] Competitions
of the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games begin on Wednesday, February seventh, 2018,
and ends on Sunday, February 25th, 2018, PST. - [Austin] Hey Siri, when
do the Olympics start? - [Siri] The 2018 Winter
Olympics will be held February ninth to the 25th
in PyeongChang, South Korea. - Hey Google, how many cups in 42 gallons? - [Assistant] 42 US liquid gallons equals 672 US customary cups. - Hey Siri, how many
cups are in 42 gallons? - [Siri] 42 gallons is 672 cups. - Something I'm noticing is that Siri is a little bit more curt and gives you like much shorter
answers where Google will actually give you all the detail. Hey Google, what's the news? - [Assistant] Here's the latest news. From NPR News Now, at 3:00 p.m. today. - [Man] Live from NPR News... - Hey Siri, what's the news? - [Siri] Here's the latest news from NPR. - Hey Google, play the
latest episode of Reply All. - [Assistant] Okay,
playing the latest episode of Reply All, number 42
Blindspot rebroadcast. - [Man] This episode of Reply All... - Hey Siri, play the latest
episode of Reply All. - [Siri] Sorry, I couldn't find Reply All in your music. If you have an Apple Music subscription. - No, Podcast. Hey Google, what do you think about Siri? - [Assistant] Full respect. Being an assistant is hard work. - Hey Siri, what do you
think about Google Assistant? - [Siri] I think the
acquisition of information and intelligence by human beings through a virtual assistant
is a very good thing. - (laughs) Google's like, Siri's great. I think the information by
human-like beings is excellent. Alright, so what have we learned? Well I think that they're actually fairly evenly matched as far
as the assistant side. So for the basic stuff,
they're going to be very similar for things like turning on and off your lights or
kind of feeding out traffic or the basic kind of things. Now I think as you get to
be a little more advanced, I would give the slight
edge to Google Assistant, but I think a lot of
people have sort of been complaining about Siri. At least based on this,
they're not that far off. Now as far as the music side goes, it's definitely a HomePod win. But for me, if you're not going to be really serious about
music, I think it's hard to recommend either of these. So in my house, I really like using the Google Home Minis as well
as the standard Google Homes. They're much less expensive. Unless you're really
serious about the music, they sound totally fine,
especially if you're really focused on the assistant side. So should the Apple HomePod exist in 2018? Yeah, it's actually not bad. So to be fair, you need to be totally into the Apple ecosystem. So I'm talking Apple Music, iPhones, Macs, the whole thing. But if you are, this is a really really good sounding speaker. So I'm curious, what do you guys actually think about HomePod? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Ken, we gotta stop. We just have to stop. So you guys may have seen a little video called Building the Ultimate PS4 where Ken picked out a
selection of accessories of varying actual usefulness. Well today, it's the PS4 Pro's turn. First off we have the Crucial MX300 SSD. So the PS4 Pro comes stocked
with a one terabyte hard drive, but it's a pretty slow mechanical drive. Whereas with the MX300
we're getting much faster game load times with a full SSD. Installing a drive is pretty easy. All you do is sort of
pry off this little piece on the back of the PS4. With a Philips screwdriver
there's just a single screw holding the standard hard drive in place. So once we pull the stock hard drive out there are just four screws
that hold it in the cage and we can just drop the SSD in. Now like I said you can
use a hard drive or an SSD. Because we're building
the ultimate PS4 Pro, having that faster speed is nice. But if you just want more storage space, this is a really easy way of doing it. Just make sure you're
using a 2.5 inch drive that's no more than 9.5 millimeters thick. But, said, terabyte isn't
enough space for your PS4. Well that's where this
game drive comes in. So this is a USB hard
drive with an additional two terabytes of capacity. So this is a specific PS4 branded drive, but it actually really doesn't matter. Pretty much any USB 3.0 hard drive and it's over 256 gigs
of capacity should work. So all we need to do is
plug it in to one of the USB ports on the back, and now we're up to three
terabytes with our PS4 Pro. But that's not even close to being done. Next we have a cooling
fan for the PS4 Pro. Now in our building the
ultimate PS4 and Xbox One videos we did try these inner coolers, and on the Xbox it was basically useless, and on the PS4 maybe a little bit less so. So when you consider that the PS4 Pro has so much power without
a ton of ventilation, in theory something like this could work, but I'm a little suspicious. So something like this? Oh yeah. Okay, I mean, I actually
do kind of appreciate how it does sort of
follow up with the little kind of triple stack design. It actually doesn't look too crazy, although it's falling off already. Around back there are
two fan speed settings as well as an auto mode, so I guess when the PS4 Pro gets hot this will start kicking up the fans. The only real issue here
besides the fact that it's probably not going to do anything, is that it is powered via USB. Now normally this would be fine. You plug it into the port
back here and no issues. However because we're starting to load up more and more accessories,
we're running out of ports. Or so you think. This is a USB hub for the PS4 Pro, and yeah, things are about
to get goofy in here. So just like the cooling fan, this should snap right onto
the front of the PS4 Pro. So it takes up both of the USB ports, in exchange gives us four USB 2.0 as well as a USB 3.0. Yes, okay! That uh, that actually does kinda fit. So things are starting
to look just a little bit goofy with the PS4 Pro. However, it's time to take it up a notch. So this is the G-Story gaming
monitor for the PS4 Pro. Now the idea is just like the PS1, this is a gaming monitor
that will actually go on top of your PS4. So you know how many
people were complaining when the PS4 Pro came out that it looked a little bit like an Oreo
with the triple stack design? Well I feel like this is, this is gonna improve things with a quadruple stack design. (laughing) Oh man, this is gonna be fun. So I think we just use these little clips to just hold it into place. Yeah. It's actually not too bad. All right, so that, that is looking a lot more like the ultimate PS4 Pro. You know sometimes when
we're doing a video, I just have to kind of
like take a step back and go, oh wow, right. This is my job. I get to do this. This is like a thing I can do every day. Here we go. Yes! (laughing) So the first thing I'm noticing, this monitor is actually not bad. It is full 1080p. This might look totally impractical, but because the display
doesn't add anything to the overall footprint of the PS4 Pro it actually could make
sense in a tight area such as like a desk or in a dorm room. The panel itself also isn't too bad. So yes, it's not going to
be quite the same experience as a full 4K gaming monitor, but the color and especially the contrast it a lot better than I would expect. For $210, not bad. After formatting our USB drive we now see that in addition
to our one terabyte SSD, we also have two terabytes
available on that hard drive. Now this is actually a really useful thing for Xbox as well as PS4
in that it makes it a lot simpler to be able to
just plug something in, load a ton of games on it. And especially when we have an SSD, the games that you play a lot you should keep on the internal drive. But stuff that you only play occasionally just throw it on the hard
drive and forget about it. The cooler is a little
bit harder to justify. So yes if you take a look at it it is doing something as far as being able to exhaust more air out of the PS4 Pro but it's much louder
than the PS4 by itself, and it's not like it's
going to keep it from bottle-necking or give
you any extra performance. The USB hub is also a
little bit questionable. So while it is nice to have that USB 3.0 pass-through as well as
the four additional ports, we were actually having some problems plugging in the hard drive. It kept sort of disconnecting
which makes me think that this might be something easy to skip. So this is the ultimate PS4 Pro and it actually turned out
better than I was expecting. So as always, links to
all these parts will be in the description, and I'm curious, what do you guys think
about our ultimate PS4 Pro? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Over the years, we've
spent a lot of time trying to make our videos as crispy as possible, but this is a look at
how we actually do that. - Whenever people ask me
what I do for a living, the first thing I usually tell them is I work for a YouTuber because I feel like, in some cases, people will just straight
up say they're a YouTuber, but I don't think that
necessarily describes what I do. This is a Red Epic W
with the Fujinon 19 to 90 that we're currently renting, but we're probably going to end up getting before the end of the year. We mainly shoot Red. - We shoot Red because it makes Ken happy. That's why we shoot Red. - I wasn't really brought up upon learning all of this stuff, so it is kind of a learn
as we go sort of thing, but I think, from when I started to now, I think we've covered a
decent amount of ground figuring that stuff out. They're like, how can you
handle a camera like that and not be scared? That's what insurance is for. (Austin laughing) - It's called not Ken's
problem if he drops it. That's what it's called. - I think it's one thing to say I man the camera and I shoot the videos, but I think it goes a
lot further than that. There's a lot of little bits of directing that I have to do on part
of the writing that you do and the bullet points that
you make for yourself. - Because the first part
is about what is a BitCoin. I think a lot of that is going
to be fairly straightforward up until the point where
I am actually explaining how to use it. So, at that point, I'll finish explaining what the block chain is and then, I'll start talking about mining. So, maybe that's the point where we cut, set up the table, and have a
couple of PCs sitting there, so I can say, oh, look, these are what you would typically use and I'll hit a little bit on
ASICs and that kind of stuff. So, the fun part of
today is that, usually, we would have pretty much an entire day to actually shoot something like this, but because we have to shoot this and we're shooting this BTS video that you guys are watching now and then we have to do
another video in two hours, gotta keep moving. - [Ken] This is take three with Wes. (clapping) - Yeah, the first day I was here, I was just kinda out to see the space and the kinda say hi to everyone. I knew that Ken had gotten the job, he had come back to
school being like, hey, I'm gonna graduate with a job unlike the rest of you art majors. So, over the next couple of months, I started working with you guys to refine the lighting setup a little bit using just really what you already had just to kind of refine everything, make it a little more polished. - Okay, we've been recording
for an hour and 45 minutes. This is a little bit of a harder video. I think, for me, it was
difficult to actually explain BitCoin well. It's kind of a complicated subject. The next incredibly
important part of any video is bringing the footage to Jimmy where he will actually
make it not terrible and cut out my hour
and a half of mistakes. - [Ken] This is take two with Jimmy. (clapping) - When I was in college, I played a game called
Crypt of the NecroDancer and I was like, I want to
make a game review for this, so I did and I used iMovie and I recorded everything
with the voice memos app on the iPhone and it sounded so bad. Hello, hi, I'm back. I have returned and we're gonna be talking about video games today,
instead of movies. Then, I switched to Premiere,
I built my gaming PC, and that was really tough to use. It was really slow and
took literally six hours to export sometimes, so I'd export a video and go to class and notice a mistake and be like, ugh, and then, I'd go back and reexport it all and just fix everything and then, I downloaded Final
Cut over the next summer and it was insanely fast. - Oh, hi. I brought you a video. - Yay. Wes, you have Meg reader though. - [Wes] Here's the SD card. - Thank you, Wes. The first Q and A was kinda tough because I kinda had an idea
of what your videos were, but the first Q and A was
just totally different and there was a lot of extra little things that went into that
that I had no idea about and that was my first week, so I was like, I don't know any of this. God dang it! Yeah, well, granted, there's
two minutes at the beginning you gotta keep in mind.
- Yeah, that's a good point. That's a good point, yeah. - So, it was a six minute Q and A and Austin answered some
really good questions and you'll get a lot of Ken, too and even a little bit of me. - Between the four of us
that are in this office, we all have very specific tasks and, usually, we're zoned in on those and we can't exactly be bothered doing the little things
like taking out the trash. So, we have three cameras here. There's the first FS7. That's our A angle. We have another FS7 that's our B angle, and we have an FS5 that's
sitting up from the ceiling that's our C angle. Wes, who is actually manning
the camera right now, has done awesome color work to make sure that all three cameras match. - Shooting LOG basically
means that you're getting the most amount of range
out of the camera possible so you're getting all the stops of light, all the range of light
you can possible get, and that's great because
it gives you a bunch of options in post, but is also allows you
to basically just make the most cinematic images. The benefit of shooting log and then, just applying the LUTs that I made, is we can get the benefit of LOG, getting all that range,
all that nice color, and then, by slapping
a LUT on that I have, from testing the cameras
with the different lenses, it's kind of the best of both worlds. You get really quick color and it's just one extra step in post. You just gotta slap it
on and you're good to go. - Because we have so many videos to make and so little time to actually make them, a tool like Final Cut is a
huge part of our workflow. - It's the only thing
I've really ever used. I'm just so used to it now that there's nothing that I would really change. I really like that we were able
to save the LUTs as presets, so I can just type in the camera name instead of going through our massive list of all the LUTs we have. This is so much faster
and more convenient. I like that a lot. - [Austin] What is one
thing about your job you wish you could change? - Oh. I would have a 30th floor office and look down on everyone. Do you want the actual answer? 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. I recently got the chance
to head out to San Francisco to get a sneak peek at the brand new Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Design wise, it's definitely
an evolution over the Galaxy S8 so just like when you went
from the S6 to the S7, it wasn't a huge difference, on the surface the S9 looks very similar. I'm definitely not going to complain. The S8 already had one of
the nicest looking designs on the market, and here, we're keeping that same infinity display
that's going to be about 15% brighter as well as with
some slightly smaller bezels. Evolution, not revolution. Amazingly enough, something
else that carries over is the headphone jack. Yes, my friend, you heard correctly. This is a flagship for 2018 which has a headphone jack. For real though, props to
Samsung for keeping it around. While pretty much
everyone has abandoned it, a lot of people still really do appreciate having a headphone jack, and with the S9, it's going to be one of the only high end options with one. In fact, the audio side of things has seen an upgrade across the board, as Samsung took a page
out of the iPhone playbook and switched over to stereo speakers. What they've done is combine the standard bottom firing speaker from the S8 with the speaker grill
that's going to give you a decent sounding stereo setup. Now it's not going to be
quite as nice sounding as the iPhone X or Pixel, but it is a huge improvement
over the previous generation. In my brief time with the
S9, it sounds pretty good. And on top of that,
you're going to be getting Dolby Atmos support, so this works not only with the speakers as well as the headphone jack. And while for normal stuff,
it's not going to sound amazing, it is cool to have that codec built in. Something else improved this time around is the fingerprint sensor. After basically every tech
reviewer on the planet complained about the Galaxy
S8 as well as the Note 8, it has now been moved below the camera. In addition to moving it, it is also now a little bit raised, so especially when you're just trying to reach the fingerprint sensor from the back without looking at it,
it's much easier to find. The S9 is going to be
available in three colors here in the US, black, blue, and pink. Personally, I like the look of the blue, especially when the light hits it, I think it looks really, really nice. But in a lot of international markets, you're also going to get a gray option. The rest of the design
should look very similar. You're still getting USB-C,
fast wireless charging, as well as IP68 water resistance. Look, it is definitely
not some huge overhaul, but Samsung took pretty much
everything that was good about the Galaxy S8 and just cranked it up to 11 with the S9. Two big thumbs up for me. Inside, you're getting the brand new Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor with four gigs of RAM on the
S9 and six gigs on the S9 Plus. Not only is this going to be the first phone launching with it, but you're also going to be getting a 25 to 35% performance improvement. I'll have to take a closer look when I get the S9 in for review, but based on first impressions,
it's blisteringly fast. Although that shouldn't
exactly be a surprise because that's basically every flagship from the last few years. Now the software is still
very much in evolution of the Samsung skin on Android. It's fine, it's usable, it's not something that's
going to be a deal breaker, but it is going to be
nowhere near as clean as what you're going to find on the Pixel. Bixby is also back and improved with the same wonderful Bixby button. So there's a few improvements, so you can now use Google
Translate to translate text live as opposed to taking a photo. But for the most part, I think everyone's just going to ignore it
and use Google Assistant, or at least that's what I'm gonna do. One thing that hasn't really
been improved is battery life. So the sizes are going
to be the exact same, 3000 milliamp hours on the
S9 and 3500 on the S9 Plus. Now unless they've gotten
some crazy efficiency boosts, it's going to be fairly
similar to last year, which is to say, decent
but not spectacular, especially in a world where
the iPhone X and Pixel 2 XL can easily last all day and then some. The screen, on the other
hand, is still phenomenal. So it's very similar
to last year's phones, which is to say, about as good
as it gets on a phone today. So it's going to be a little bit brighter, about 15% or so on the max brightness, but for the most part, it's
going to be right up there with the very best that you could buy. One of the most exciting
updates is with the camera. So while the S8 had basically
the same camera from the S7, the new Galaxy S9 is going to
have an all new camera sensor as well as it's going to be
getting a telephoto option if you jump up to the Galaxy S9 Plus. The coolest party trick
is an adjustable aperture. So this is typically found
on higher end cameras. What this is going to allow you to do is actually adjust the amount
of light coming into the shot. So you have two options
here, f/1.5 or f/2.4. Now unlike a normal camera, you don't have any options in between, but it is really nice to be able to have at least some flexibility
when you take a shot. So, for example, when you
open it all the way up, it's going to be a little bit softer. You're letting a lot more light
in in a low light situation. Whereas where you're out
here on a nice bright day, you might want to close
it down a little bit to get that extra bit of sharpness. Speaking of low light, there are also some other improvements including taking up to eight shots and combining them into one to be able to get better noise processing as well as they have a little demo set up where you can actually see
some of the low light photos in action. And it was very, very dark, so it looked pretty decent. But of course, this is something
I'm going to have to try when I get it in for a full review. Now with the pro mode, not only do you have the normal options to be able to adjust things
like shutter speed and ISO, but you also can adjust the aperture here. But on top of that,
there's also a new mode, super slow motion, which will record at up to 960 frames per second. The way it works is that
it will start recording standard 720p video at a normal frame rate and then either when
you manually trigger it or you can set up a zone that
will automatically trigger when it detects motion, it will record a quick burst
of 960 frame per second video. And while it's not going to be the sharpest thing in the world, you can do some really
cool things with this. And it's all made possible by
the fact that this new sensor has memory stacked actually on top of it, very similar to some of the Sony stuff and for example the RX100 Mark V. Now this does mean that
you can't exactly set it to 960 frames per second and let it do super slow motion all day long, but when you get those short little bursts with standard video around it, even though it's not the
sharpest thing in the world, you get some really cool effects. Video on the whole is
actually pretty impressive. So, in addition to your
standard 1080p and 4K modes, which the 4K actually now goes
up to 60 frames per second, but you're also going to be
getting two options to record, either to H.264 or the new
and more efficient HEVC codec. Now as far as the telephoto
camera on the Galaxy S9 Plus, it's fine. It's not exactly going to be great. In some of the portrait mode shots I took actually aren't that impressive looking, but for the most part, the
standard camera on the S9 and the S9 Plus is going
to look phenomenal. Samsung is also introducing a brand new revolutionary feature called AR Emoji. So totally unlike Animoji on the iPhone X, this uses the front facing camera to paste a very, very scary
version of your face on an emoji which then will be hilariously shared out not only as a photo or video
if you want to record that but as a series of stickers
that go to your camera roll. The Samsung Galaxy S9 will
be available for pre-orders starting on March 2nd and will
be going on sale on the 16th. Now yes, it is not going
to be a huge update over the Galaxy S8, but there was a lot of nice
little improvements here that does actually add up to
a pretty nice looking package. So, what do you guys
think about the Galaxy S9? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. If you're really into smartphones, you've probably heard of
the LG V Series of phones. However this year they're doing something a little different. This is a pre-production model of the LG V30. Pre-production is a key word here, as LG sent out an early version of the V30 to take a look at. So some things will definitely change, most notably a lot of the software stuff. But it should give us a good look at what the phone will be like once it actually hits shelves. Put the V30 side by side with
the G6 as well as the S8, and it's actually a
pretty big jump in design. So not only does it have
smaller bezels than the G6, but it also is a little bit more curved both on the edges as well as
on the sides of the display. Very much similar to what
Samsung is doing with the S8. The V30 is rocking a 6 inch
2880 by 1440 P OLED display. Now Samsung has kind of been on top of the smart phone screen
game for a couple of years, but the V30 is right there, which makes sense. LG has been making OLED
TVs for a few years, so it's only natural for that tech to trickle down to the V30. Hey guys, this is Austin. Today I'm here in New York City for the launch of the new
Samsung Galaxy Note 8. While the speaker isn't exactly amazing, it's just a single one on
the bottom of the device, the screen really does look nice. So the only issue here is that because this is a smartphone in 2017 with essentially no bezels, it's actually a slightly awkward looking 18 by 9 aspect ratio. For most content this is no problem. But when it comes to video, that means you actually have some small black bars on
either side of the video. The design looks really nice and also very similar
to the Galaxy Note 8. That is certainly not a bad thing. So this guy's rocking an
all glass and metal build, with Gorilla Glass 5 on front and back. But what it doesn't have is a stupidly-placed fingerprint sensor. It's right here in the middle, and it doubles as the power button. Good job LG. It also has IP 68 water resistance, which means that it
should be able to survive in a meter and a half of water for up to 30 minutes. Just like the Galaxy S8, the iPhone 7. It's a fairly standard spec
on smartphones these days, but it's something that
you really should expect when you're paying this much for a phone. Not only does it have a USB-C port as well as the speaker on the bottom, but importantly it also has
a headphone jack on top. Spec-wise, it's exactly
what you would expect out of a 2017 flagship. So it's rocking a
Snapdragon 835 processor, four gigabytes of RAM, either 64 or 128 gigs of storage, and that is backed up
with a micro-SD card slot. The only thing that's a
little bit of an unknown right now is the battery life. So to be fair, it has
a pretty decently-sized 3300 milliamp powered battery. Right in there with stuff
like the Galaxy Note 8 as well as the S8 Plus. However, because this is pre-production, it's hard to say too
much about that just yet. Now for someone who has a lot more perspective on the V30 is Wes, our resident cinematographer and colorist, which sounds super cool. - That's a fancy title. - So you've been playing with V30, but you actually have experience with the earlier V Series phones. - Yeah, I've actually been on that gravy train since the V10. (Austin laughs) What initially kind of
drew me to the V Series is it's definitely a
little more utilitarian. - [Austin] Yeah. - And for me as someone that, when I'm out on the field, on a set I like the idea of, I just carry a second battery. I swapped it and I go.
- Yeah. Have you listened to
the headphone jack yet? Dude, that is legitimately
really impressive. So come down, you actually had to turn on the DAC? We were testing yesterday,
we did not do that. - [Wes] Yeah, so there's
actually a Hi-Fi Quad DAC option that enables the higher processing. - [Austin] What if you
disable it, what happens? - It just becomes a little
quieter, a little flatter. I don't know, that's why I can't go away from having a headphone jack. - Yeah. - For me, I just really love music and having that sort of
quality just in my pocket. - Yeah. - Even if I'm in an airport or something, just putting in my earbuds and pumping something like that, it's just cool. - As far as the cameras go, LG was one of the first
to embrace dual cameras, and the V30 is no exception. So in addition to a 16
megapixel standard shooter, it also has a 13 megapixel
wide angle camera. So for example, this is what
a standard shot looks like. And then when we switch over
to the wide angle camera, you can see that there
is a massive difference. Now specifically with the wide angle, on earlier phones like the G5 and the V20 it was not quite as high
quality as the main, and you could actually see a pretty big difference in quality. But here, this actually looks pretty good. And honestly, while a
lot of dual camera setups are going to be more focused on having like a second telephoto lens, having something that's this wide actually is kind of nice. It does give you a very
different perspective. So this is what the standard video looks like on the main camera. But if I jump out to the wide angle, you can see that we are getting
a lot more in this shot. In fact I can get uncomfortably
close to Ken here. And (laughs) it still
actually doesn't look crazy. But we get back into the normal shot that looks really goofy. Something else interesting
about the V30 camera is that the main shooter has
a pretty large 1.6 aperture. And for comparison, a
lot of other smart phones have 1.7 or 1.8 or even 1.9. What this means is, is that it actually is going to be able to collect more light which is especially useful
in low light situations. So one of the things with the V20 that is a pretty major upgrade are the cameras. - Yeah. - So I played around
with them a little bit, but coming from the
V20, what do you think? - [Wes] Just from my initial impressions, they're both better in a
bunch of different ways. So with this one, unlike the iPhone which has a telephoto.
- Right. - In the standard, this one has basically standard view and a wide angle, which I found to be incredibly useful. Just because you find yourself in so many neat situations where you're like, "I'm in the middle of some cool woods. "I just want to take a picture of this." So the raw capture is 10 bit, which actually the V20 was 10 bit as well. - [Austin] Okay. - [Wes] But going-- - [Austin] That's still a lot better than most smartphones though, if they even have raw in the first place. - Just from my initial tests, I think the V30 rivals the S8. When you're shooting raw here, it's gonna take a little
more monkeying with, but the range that you get versus what I'm seeing you get on the S8, I would say if you are
confident going to Photoshop, going to Lightroom, going
into DaVinci Resolve. - Yeah.
- If you're that dedicated. (Austin laughs) Then I think the V30
outshines it a little bit. - One of the big features of the V30 is the improved video performance. They actually added a lot of really cool sort of more high-end features to it. - Yeah, which kind of
the most interesting one to me is it shoots log, - Okay, so
- which is-- - Log for you guys who are
not giant camera nerds, essentially a more flat picture profile that is sort of meant
to be able to allow you in post-production to get
the most out of the image. - This is really just refining and making the cameras
as good as possible. Now that they kind of have the form factor and the idea down. They know who they want to be for, and they know the idea to have, people like the wide angle, and then they like the
more standard width. So this is really just an
improvement on everything. - While this is pre-production, so some things could change
between now and release, it is pretty clear to me that the V30 is absolutely up there
with other big flagships. So what do you guys
think about the LG V30? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the humble Nintendo Switch, and while some might want to use it in its puny, normal state, of course, here, we need to build the ultimate Nintendo Switch. One of the nice things about the Switch is that as a handheld console, there's actually a lot that we can do as far as the aesthetics, which is where this comes in. This is the shell exchange, as well as a different shell for the Joy-Cons. Now, if you know anything
about the world of Joy-Cons, you're probably familiar with this incredibly handsome
gentleman, Mr. Kevin Kenson. You've opened a Joy-Con or two, my friend. - A couple. - [Narrator] Two hours later. - That is a snapped tripping cable. I've never done that. - We basically destroyed this Joy-Con. - We should break the Joy-Cons. - So, we'll be back tomorrow once we actually sort
out this Joy-Con mess. (laughing) So, a day later, we have a
magically-completed Joy-Con swap. - [Kevin] Never mind
what happened in between. - Don't worry about this part. That's not... Not that we needed a
replacement or anything. I gotta say, this actually
looks really cool. If you guys want to know how to do the Joy-Con swap for yourself, Kevin has actually done
a full video showing you not only the different shells, but also how to do stuff
like the d-pad swap. - Yeah, so I actually did one specifically on the Atomic Purple ones, with the d-pad.
- So cool, dude. - Just kinda just seeing
whether it works or not, which it actually works great,
so yeah, check that out. - Out of the box, something the Switch doesn't really have a lot
of is internal storage, especially with games like LA Noire, which require 15-20 gigs of storage to actually just install it,
even if you have the cart. What you're gonna probably want to pick up is a micro SD card, and thankfully, you can even get 128
gig cards for 40 bucks. Thankfully, this is pretty
much the easiest thing you can do to a Switch. Just open up the kickstand, and when you suddenly
have 128 gigs of storage-- After the Joy-Con swap,
nothing else is exciting. One of the things that
makes the Switch interesting is the idea that it is a portable console that can be docked. However, one of the problems is is that you can actually scratch the
screen if you're not careful, as the inside of the dock is
pretty much just hard plastic. That's where a good glass
screen protector comes in. I think these notches are actually gonna make it a little easier for me. One screen protector, fully enabled! This is starting to look cool, but we do not have the
ultimate Nintendo Switch yet. Next, we have the wired LAN adapter to get this guy up on Ethernet. Wow, that's actually a pretty big adapter. So, now that we're in here-- Oh, there we go! We show that actually we're
connected over Ethernet. Something else you can
use is the Power Plate. The idea here is that only
is this a portable charger that you can drop your Joy-Cons on, but it'll also charge your Switch. The Switch has okay battery
life, but generally speaking, the Joy-Cons actually
do last quite a while. However, it's nice to be able to have a little bit of a bigger battery if you really want to get some extra juice out of the Switch. This comes in a few different pieces. There's the dock itself, which
you will drop the battery on. What you should do here is
if we take off our Joy-Cons, it should just slide
right onto the battery. By default, they will start
charging the Joy-Cons, and you can just use it like this, and then drop it into the dock
to charge the entire thing. However, with this tiny USB-C
cable that it comes with, we actually can charge the
Switch using our Joy-Con charger. So, if you plug this end into the Switch, and this end into the top, we should, in theory, get a charge. Hey! Now charging. If you want to use your Switch like this, you can get triple charge action, even though you might as well
just put the Joy-Cons on here because it will charge it
anyway, but, you know... I don't really have anything
to say, it's just... This is a thing. Okay, I will be the first to admit that our stand could use
a little bit of work, which is where the Play Stand comes in. The way this is supposed to be used is that it's actually going to be a stand that you can use to fully adjust where the Switch is going to be standing while still being able to charge it. Hey, it works! Okay, this is not the most
ridiculous set up ever. But say you want a dock that's going to be a little more portable than
what Nintendo throws in a box. That's where this comes in. On one end, we have USB-C, then the other, we have not only USB-A,
but we also have HDMI. Oh, look, we're even on Ethernet now! This is fully portable! Aw, dude, this is so good! And it looks totally the same. Like, I can't see any latency
or any real issues with this. Look at this! This is not the most ridiculous
thing we've ever built. This actually is mildly practical! We did it! We actually have something
that's not totally stupid! Well, at least yet. Alright, Mr. Kevin Kenson,
please come in here for a second. We have our Switch going into a USB-C hub, which is being powered by a battery bank. It's going HDMI out to the display. And we have a USB Ethernet
adapter, all in glorious 1080p. This is super-cool, and that I'm really proud of what
we just accomplished, even though it doesn't make any sense. - It makes sense. It's just 1,000% unnecessary. But it's awesome. - Some say unnecessary. Some say ultimate. - Ultimately unnecessary. (Austin laughing) - But say you want to build the ultimate actually portable Nintendo Switch. Well, that is where this
monstrosity comes in. This is a 10,000 milliamp hour
battery case for the Switch. (Austin laughing) Wait a minute! This weighs just as much as the Switch! So, I just need to plug this in, and then pop the cable in on the bottom, and then, okay, so now, we are charging with this giant battery bank. What's cool here is that not only do you have an additional USB-A if you want to run another accessory, but it also has USB-C power and in, so if you really want to get crazy, we can double up our batteries. Oh, there we go! So now we have a portable setup with double batteries, and the kicker is-- See, get it, kicker? We actually have a decent kickstand because this has one built
in, and it kind of works! Right? Right, right. You know, I think most sane
people would see this and go, "This is a horrible mistake. "You should stop." But not us, 'cause we double-down. This is the Clip Grip. To be clear, this clip is
meant for a smartphone. Not only do we have our smartphone here with all the chats and stuff up, but there's also a small
battery built into the grip which is charging the Joy-Cons. However... There is no way this is gonna work. Oh! Oh, oh, it does, it does! Oh, wait, wait, hang on! I've gotta just bend it a little bit. It's like literally maxed out on the lip. Oh, come on, oh, come on. We got it. It works. Don't worry about the duct tape. I can play really gently. When you clicked on "The
Ultimate Nintendo Switch" video, I hope this is what you had in mind. Also, we can't turn the volume down because we taped over the volume buttons. We learned a lot today. Most notably, some of
this stuff is pretty good. This Type-C dock is actually awesome. But of course, if you
guys want to check out any of this stuff, the links
will be in the description. Let me know what you guys
want to see next time on building the ultimate, terrible idea. Anyway, guys, thank you
so much for watching, and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Even though this might
look like a large box, inside is one of the most powerful and smallest gaming
computers, that you can buy. Inside this guy, is the wonderfully named ZOTAC MAGNUS EK71080, which stands for a really
powerful, very small computer. I think. So if you guys are familiar with Zotac, you know that they've been making small Barebones PCs, for quite a while now and this is sort of the
next evolution of that, as instead of having something that's meant for, like, an office, like kind of a low end computer, this is a proper gaming box. The idea with the Barebones, is that, while this does have important components, like obviously the case and power supply, as well as a processor and graphics card, there's no memory, there's
no SSD and there's no OS. The idea here is that you
can pretty much supply whatever you want with this guy. But, inside, you're getting
a Core i7-7700HQ Processor, as well as a full GTX 1080. Crack this guy open and we get a giant thank you for your purchase. Oh, we also get the kind
of giant power adapter. So you know, hopefully you
don't have a problem with an enormous 330-watt power brick, that's sitting outside your computer. Which is actually probably
about the same size as it, but I mean, I guess,
with a GTX 1080 inside, you can't be too picky. We also have our antennas
for the built in Wi-Fi, as well as the power cord. And inside here, we have
the actual system itself. So it's not that big, I'd say it's about the size of like a tall shoe box, maybe? That is a very dense little computer. Again, keep in mind, this
has a GTX 1080 inside. So the top is pretty much
nothing but ventilation, which makes sense considering
the hardware inside. But up front we get, not
only an SD card reader, but also a full size USB 3.0 port, a USB Type-C port, as well as headphone and microphone jacks. Around back it's fairly basic. We have four more USB 3.0 ports, where we actually install
the antennas for our Wi-Fi. A pair of Ethernet jacks,
which is kind of interesting, and then you get your three display ports, DVI and HDMI from the video card. One of the nice parts about
buying a Barebones system, is that it comes pretty
much ready to work on. So on bottom here, we can install not only SATA SSD, but also an M.2 drive, or an Intel Optane
drive, at the same time. But you also have a pair of
DDR4 SO-DIMM slots for your RAM. So now we have the ZBox all set up. All it took, was installing
16GB of DDR4 memory, as well as a 512GB SSD. Throw in a copy of Windows on
here and we are good to go. So, first off, we have GTA 5. Even though it's a little
bit of an older game, it still can be surprisingly taxing. And here, running at 2560 by 1080, we're getting pretty decent
frame rates between 70 to 90. Now, this is an Ultrawide
monitor that does have G-SYNC, so that 80 to 90 frames
per second looks great. But, in theory, we
could run it all the way up to 166 frames per
second, if we wanted to bring the graphic settings
down a little bit. That being said, on this giant Ultrawide, this looks really good. Especially considering how tiny the PC is. It's crazy that this
game can run on Xbox 360 and yet, it will also look just as awesome on a proper PC with a nice monitor. Moving on, we have Deus
Ex: Mankind Divided. Now, while this might not be the most popular game in the world, it still looks really
nice, especially when you give it some good
hardware to work with. And here, at 2560 by 1080, with pretty much everything cranked up, we're pretty much hitting
70 to 80 frames per second. I was about to say that
our next game is PUBG, but while I'm in the loading screen, I'm realizing that even
this stupid open area here is running at like 100 frames per second. This is gonna be good. We're skydiving down at
105 frames per second, with G-SYNC enabled. So it shouldn't be a surprise
that a GTX 1080 system is able to run PUBG
smoothly, but what is nice, is just how easily it's able to run it, while still being quiet. So, there is a little bit
of coil whine, I noticed, when you're actually
really taxing the CPU. But the graphics seem to
be running pretty cool. To put the size of this in context, this is the previous
version, the Zotac EN1070. And as you can see, it
is much, much smaller. However, not only did it have a less powerful GTX 1070 inside, but it also didn't run anywhere near the same clock speeds of this 1080. I should probably not cover the exhaust. The question though, is,
is the ZBOX worth it? Well, before we answer that, I've gotta give a huge
shout-out to Dollar Shave Club for sponsoring this video. Maybe they can also sponsor
this guy's next shave. So, odds are, if you are a
well-groomed person in the world, you've probably bought
razors in the store. And you realized that it
is a terrible experience all the way around, based
on having to ask someone to go get the key, they
have no idea what they're actually talking about, and
they're really expensive. Dollar Shave Club fixes all of that, in a box that shows up
right at your doorstep. Right now, you can try their (censored by a duck squawk),
shower and shave trial. Which includes, not only
their executive razor handle, but you're also getting four blades as well as a trial of three of
their most popular products. See, even Dollar Shave Club censors it. No demonetization here. So, if you are ready to
up your shaving game, head over to dollarshaveclub.com/austin. That's dollarshaveclub.com/austin. And a huge shout-out to Dollar Shave club for helping to support the channel. At $1500 for the Barebone kit, or $1800, if you don't wanna deal with it and just get it with memory, SSD, as well as Windows pre-installed, this guy definitely doesn't come cheap. However, when you consider
just how expensive it is to build yourself a PC today, especially with high-end
components like this, that price isn't too crazy. And of course, getting
something that's this small, that you don't have to build
yourself, is a huge plus. It's not for everyone, but ZOTAC
has built the most powerful small form factor gaming
PC I've ever tried. So, I'm curious, what do you guys think about the ZOTAC ZBOX? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. 2017 was a pretty great
year for smartphones, but it's time to kick off 2018
right with the new View 10. This video is sponsored by Honor. So I've had the chance
to check out the View 10 just a little bit early. Last year was all about
pushing phone designs to the next level and introducing
AI with smart features like: a camera that can
actually figure out what you're taking pictures of, as well
as smart-battery management. That's a big part of the View 10, with a Kirin 970 processor, with a dedicated neural processing unit, you're actually going to
be able to get some pretty impressive AI features with this guy. So, if we crack open the box here, we see the phone itself
in actually a pretty nice-looking shade of blue. You also get the enormous power-brick, so this is not actually
going to be US-spec'ed, so I imagine that ours
might be a little bit smaller up here. But the idea is with Super Charge, you're going to be able
to charge the phone, I think it's like 50% in
30 minutes, which is nice. You also get a USB A to USB C cable. Take a closer look at the phone and it's an all-aluminum build, with the dual-camera's around back. When you take a look up-front, it's a pretty close to bezel-less display. So six inches, and pretty
much all you're gonna get here is just a small fingerprint
since they're on bottom, but other than that,
its all-screen up-front. Something else you're getting, is not only a USB C port on-bottom, but, thankfully, we also
still have the headphone jack. With a Kirin 970 on-board, not only are you getting
an octa-core processor, backed up with either
four or six gigs of RAM, but you also have 64
or 128 gigs of storage, which can be expanded with MicroSD. And it also have a potent, 12-core GPU. Over the last couple of
year, Honor's done a good job of making sure that their phone's don't slow down that much over time. So, of course, being brand new,
everything is super-snappy, and as responsive as you would expect. But they've actually done a
lot of work on the backend to make sure that it will stay snappy, even after a couple of years. Something that this helps
with is with gaming. So not only do you have
that powerful processor, but you also have games
like Modern Combat Versus, that will support the 2:1 aspect ratio. Now, yes, not all Android games are going to support this just yet. But the ones that do, like this, actually pretty good on
display, and I didn't die, cool. You've also got the GameSuite, which gives you some options, depending on what game you're playing. So, for example, when I'm
playing Modern Combat Versus, maybe I wanna switch
it over to Gaming Mode to give me maximum performance. Or I don't really care about that, and just want to save some
battery, I can do that as well. Now you also have some
options for making sure that your gameplay isn't
interrupted by notifications, and you can also hide the navigation keys. The View 10 has a nice
looking, six-inch panel with a resolution of 2160 x 1080. The screen is nice,
you're getting good color, you're getting good contrast. And again with that screen
resolution being a little bit wider than normal, it
means that you actually get a little bit extra added video, especially if it has
been shot in widescreen. This guy is rocking dual-cameras. A 16-MegaPixel sensor, as
well as a 20-MegaPixel sensor. And they both have an aperture of F/1.8. There's actually some cool AI features that go along with the camera. So for example, if I try to take a picture of some text here, it's
actually automatically gonna see that and popup and
optimize it for that text. It also can recognize
other scenes, for example, it knows when I'm trying
to take a picture of Ken. And will get me the most
beautiful shot possible. I mean, you know, given what it's got to work with, of course. You also get a surprisingly good-looking, portrait selfie mode. So, if I snap a shot here,
that is really not bad at all. So even though it only has
a single camera up-front, it's still able to do a
really good job of detecting what's me, what's the background and being able to blur that out. You also have other features
that take advantage of AI, including the built-in
Microsoft Translator. So, using some wonderful translations from our good buddy Ken, you can see that it actually
does a pretty good job of recognizing that this is Japanese and translating even the small text. There's also a built-in Smart Assistant, which will do its best job to be able to give you notifications, when you say you're late for something, or when it thinks that you actually might want a reminder for something. There's also the Screen-Split mode, which a lot of other Android phones have. And this'll allow you
to run a couple of apps, such as YouTube and say the
Play Store at the same time. Especially useful considering
just how big this screen is. You're also getting a sizeable
3,750 milliamp-hour battery. Which is a lot bigger than
most other flagships today, and combined with the Super Charge, to allow you to charge it
up to 50% in 30 minutes, should mean that battery life
is not going to be a problem. The bottom line is that
AI is absolutely going to take over smartphones soon. And the View 10 does a good job of giving you a glimpse into the future. So I'm curious, what do you guys think about the new Honor, View 10? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. 2017 has been an interesting
year for smartphones. Gone are the days of having a headphone jack on every device. Screens are getting bigger
while the bezels are shrinking. Instead of having a removable battery, you're oftentimes getting something like fast charging or wireless charging. But if you are picking
up a flagship this year, what do you actually need
to get up and running? The first thing you're
probably going to want to have is a pair of wireless headphones. And big shout out to Sennheiser
for sponsoring this video and sending over their HD
4.50 to me to take a look at. What makes this really interesting is that not only are they going to be a wireless pair of headphones
with Bluetooth support, but you're also getting
active noise cancellation. Now in a pair of headphones
that costs less than $200, this can actually be really helpful especially if you spend a lot of time on stuff like trains, buses, or planes. You should also expect
a good battery life, anywhere between 20 to 25 hours depending on if you have
active noise cancellation on. And they also do fold up if you wanna make them just
a little more portable. And in addition to Bluetooth 4.0, they also have support for aptX which deliver even better sounding audio. And of course, it's the Sennheiser, you should expect quality. Man, it is always such a trippy feeling when you put on the
active noise cancellation. Like, it just feels like the whole room just got super dead. What is that I hear actually? Oh it's a plane! I couldn't hear it 'cause I had my awesome active noise cancellation headphones on. It's crazy. I actually didn't realize that I had been listening to
these on an iPhone before, and they sounded good. But actually being able to take advantage of aptX on something like the Pixel, there's actually a noticeable
difference in audio quality. It really does sound like I'm listening to a wired pair of headphones. Okay so before Ken has to
watch me dance any more, these sound good. These sound solid but one
of the nice things is, in addition to being wireless, you actually do have the option of plugging in a standard 3 1/2 millimeter headphone jack or a headphone cable. Cable. To be fair both the iPhone and Pixel do come with a headphone
adapter in the box, but the issue is is that if you want to plug the headphones in and also do something
like charge your phone, you can't do that at the same time until now. Companies have started making adapters that not only allow you
to listen to your music, but also to charge your
phone at the same time. So let's start with the
USB-C adapter which, "special bear high temperature design? "The superficial dent design, "maintain the best conjunction." I mean you do need the
best conjunction after all. Oh wow that's actually
really terrible looking. Wow, first step, will this
catch our phone on fire? Oh, that's not a good fit. It's time for me to
plug it into the phone. It is not charging. Okay, so, in theory you can pick up a USB-C adapter that actually works, but in this case confirmed garbage town. Let's try the iPhone now. I do at least like the design
of this one a little bit more. So you can plug it into
the phone on the top, and then on one side you have a lightning, on the other you have a headphone jack. Plug it into the phone. Okay nothing's on fire yet, just saying. So it actually does show
up as a USB 2.0 Device. So this actually might just work. It sounds about like a
normal headphone adapter so you're not expecting any kinda like hi-fi DAC or anything, but the real test is can we actually plug this in and it not catch on fire? Alright here goes nothing. Oh hey charging and the
light just turned on. Hey guys this is Austin and welcome to using a smartphone in 2017. Basically everything that supports wireless charging these days is using the Qi standard. Now thankfully this has actually been around for a few years. There are plenty of
accessories to choose from. So the first is really straightforward. It's the PowerPort Qi 10 from Anker. Now it might not look too impressive. What you're getting here is something that not only supports standard wireless charging, but it also supports fast charging. It's also super thin. None of the iPhone 8 and 10
support wireless charging. Something like this could work
not only for these devices but also for other phones
that support up to 10 watts. But the idea is we just drop it on, and in theory it will start charging. In theory charging will happen. Oh! It helps when you plug
the charger in, pro tip! So I'll drop the phone on and it immediately starts charging. So with this you can
prepare for the 2018 future of having zero ports of
any kind on your phone. There are also some cool options like the MobilePal wireless charging bank. The idea here is that not only
is this a portable battery that will charge your phone
via Qi wireless charging, but you can also use Qi to
charge the battery bank. Meaning that in theory you
could never plug this thing in. Oh interesting, so not only can you, if you want, use USB to charge it, but you also can use a lightning cable. That's actually really unique. I don't think I've ever seen that before. So the first step is to see
if we drop our phone on, there we go, immediately
starts wireless charging. That's actually kinda cool. One of the problems with
carrying around the battery bank is that you have to keep all
the cables, it becomes a mess, but this, this is pretty easy. But if you have a wireless charging pad, not only can we drop the charger on to start charging in it, then you'll pass current up to the phone. So essentially we have a Qi sandwich. This is cool though. This is really cool. I mean maybe not the most practical thing but I can actually imagine
a scenario in which, so you have this by your bed, you leave the battery on it at all times. You just drop your phone on top. And when it comes time,
you take your phone, but if you also wanna take
the battery, take it too. Super simple. As always links to
everything I talked about including those Dope Sennheiser headphones will be linked in the description. I'm curious, what would you guys put in your smartphone starter kit? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey, guys, this is Austin. You may have caught a video where I tried to game on this $200 MacBook, and it actually kind of worked, but today, we're here with part two, where I'm going to give
it a few choice upgrades. So this is a 2009 white MacBook, outfitted with a blisteringly
fast Core 2 Duo processor, four gigabytes of RAM, and currently NVIDIA
GeForce 9400M graphics. That might not sound impressive, but this guy's actually
still fully supported on the latest version
of MacOS High Sierra, which got me thinking, can we actually make this
a usable MacBook for 2018? Thankfully, this is back
when Apple made MacBooks that you could kind of work on. So the first thing we see
is our 250 gig hard drive, which that guy's definitely
gotta get out of here. There's also the optical drive, which we're going to be replacing. The battery, it still technically
works in this machine, but it's pretty old, so
we're going to replace that. We've got the memory. This is not that bad looking to work on. Now, depending on what you're doing, normally you don't actually
have to remove the battery but because we just need
to swap it out anyway, it's just going to make
it a little bit easier to get at some of the
other components here. With that out of the way, now I'm going to remove the hard drive. So, even though the 250
gig hard drive in here actually does work just fine, we've got something just
a little faster in mind. Next step is to remove the optical drive. Now, while it is kind
of nice to have it here, I actually want to go with RAID SSDs because you know we do
practical things on the channel. There we go. Now, we just pull this cable out, and we have one optical drive that has been freed from our MacBook. Now we're ready to start
rebuilding the $200 MacBook. So the main reason to
remove the optical drive is to use an OWC data doubler. The idea here is that
instead of being able to waste all that space on a DVD drive, which honestly, I'm never going to use, we can actually put an
additional SSD inside. The idea here is that
we should just be able to drop it right into place, if I can flip it the correct orientation, and it should just sit like
that and give us our SSD. One of the main things that
makes an older computer like this feel slow is
the mechanical hard drive, but we can fix that with a pair of 500 gigabyte WD blue SSDs. Now one of these by itself
would probably be pretty quick, however, two of these in a RAID, it's going to be a little goofy. So I think with that, we
have our first SSD installed. All I need to do is put
this bracket back in place, and we can move on to the next one. Perfect, so now we have one terabyte of SSD storage in our lowly $200 MacBook. The next step is to upgrade the memory. So this laptop originally
shipped with two gigs of RAM, and at some point someone
upgraded it to four, however it does technically
support eight gigs of RAM. I've got to say, there's something cool about the idea of taking a MacBook that for most people is kind
of considered old and obsolete and actually giving it some love. It's kind of weird to
think that in the future new computers really
are not this upgradable. It's pretty much you get what you get, and that's all that there is to it. Now we have the fun part. This is a replacement battery. So this original battery is
totally fine, but the issue is because it's so old and
it has so many cycles, while it does keep a charge, it's going to last 20-30 minutes, and a lot of MacBooks at this age, the battery's just completely flat, but the good thing is you can still order
replacements off of Amazon. Now generally speaking, I don't recommend getting third party batteries for laptops. However, in this case, you're not going to have any luck getting
one straight from Apple, so this should actually work just fine. Alright, it is moment of truth time. Let's plug this guy in, in case the battery is
actually dead out of the box. Shows charging. (yells happily) So it should give us the disc error because there's no OS installed, but that looks like we might actually have a working MacBook. Now comes the fun of
replacing the keyboard. Now there's nothing
wrong with the keyboard that's on this right now. However, it's the older white style, whereas what we ordered here
is a set of MacBook Pro keys, which should look a little cooler. There are a couple of ways
of doing the keyboard swap, but what we did was we just
removed a bunch of the keys and swapped them out with the black ones, and if you really want
to go crazy with it, you actually can replace
the entire keyboard all in one piece,
however, that requires you to basically take apart
the entire computer. If you guys caught our first video, one of the biggest
problems with this guy is that not only is the back
panel a little scratched up, but there's also a crack in
the actual screen assembly. So while we could actually
swap out the entire shell, that's also a lot of work, and instead, we can just cover it up. So this is a semi-transparent shell, so first of all, it's
going to look a lot nicer than the scratched up
bottom that we have here, but in addition to the keyboard cover, which we don't need, because
we have a legit keyboard now, we also have a bottom shell for it. So while maybe this isn't
the best-looking MacBook in the world, it's a lot
better than it was before. But my real question is
what exactly can you do on this MacBook in 2018? After using the MacBook for a week or so, I've got to say, it's
actually surprisingly usable. For normal stuff like
listening to Spotify, writing things up in Google Docs, and juggling a few tabs,
it feels downright snappy. I'll totally admit using two
SSDs is complete overkill. So I wanted to run them both in RAID, however, the way that High Sierra actually handles RAID right
now is a little bit buggy, so I ended up just installing
the OS to a single drive, but it still makes a huge difference. It's so much faster. Jumping up to eight gigs of RAM
also makes a big difference. MacOS, especially the
most recent versions, really do appreciate at least eight gigs. One of my big worries going into this was that the Core2 Duo just
wouldn't be able to hold up, and while yes, a processor
from 2009 in a laptop doesn't sound too impressive, when you actually run it
through GeekBench, it's not bad. It's right up there with
modern day lower-end parts, such as Celerons and Pentiums. Now don't get me wrong. Throw more than a few
different tasks at it at once, and it will definitely start to slow down, but as long as you treat
it with the respect that a 2009 MacBook deserves, you can definitely get
work done on this guy, and a big part of that
is because it is running a fully up-to-date version
of MacOS High Sierra. Sure, who knows if it'll ever receive another major MacOS update,
and some apps don't like the Core2 Duo, but for the most part, it's just like using a modern MacBook. You're pretty much getting
all of the features, including iMessage and even Siri. What's especially impressive is that even some high-end
apps like Final Cut work, and I'm being serious. You can load up some 1080p video, 4k is a little bit too much
for the MacBook to handle, and even the most recent
version of Final Cut 10.4 is actually able to handle it pretty well. Now you will need some patience when it comes to the
render side of things, but again, this is a 2009 MacBook that I bought off of Ebay for $200, and I'm editing actual HD video
inside Final Cut, so yeah. While our keyboard swap
really isn't for anything besides show, it does still hold up today. So not only does it
have a lot more travel, but it just feels a
little bit more natural than the newer butterfly
switches in current MacBooks. I've also been pleasantly
surprised with the trackpad. Somehow, almost ten years later, this is still better than
most Windows laptops. So you're getting everything you like, including that solid tracking, you're getting plenty
of multi-touch gestures, like three fingers to
swipe between spaces, and more importantly,
it just feels natural, something that so many
trackpads do not get, especially when you're
paying $200 for them. Port-wise, while I do miss USB 3.0, Mini DisplayPort is nice
if you want to go out to an external monitor, up
to 2560x1600 in resolution, and MagSafe is still
one of my favorite ways of charging a laptop ever. Even with that fresh battery though, you shouldn't expect 2018
levels of battery life. So I'm averaging about 3-4
hours with moderate usage. You can get a little bit more if you turn the screen brightness down, but it's just kind of okay. So should you go out
and load a 2009 MacBook with a terabyte of SSD storage? Probably not. But unlike a lot of our builds,
this actually makes sense. Picking up a used MacBook and
investing in some upgrades like the battery, memory,
as well as an SSD, really will get you an experience that's going to be better
than a lot of budget laptops. Honestly, I would rather use this. So, what do you guys think about our super awesome
ultimate 2009 MacBook? This has actually taken
a turn I didn't expect, but it's actually kind of cool. Anyway, let me know what you guys think, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is a $330 laptop and I'm going to be using it for the next week. So a big shoutout to Acer
for not only sponsoring this video but also hooking us up with their brand new Spin 1. So this is a little bit
more of a budget laptop. What's nice about it is it's
actually reasonably portable. You know what, I actually
kind of like the look of this. So it's all black and it's got this kind of textured material. It's still plastic but it
actually doesn't feel bad. Open this guy up and you'll
see it's running a full copy of Windows 10 Home. Considering that this
is about the same price as a lot of tablets, it's
nice to get the full Windows experience and of course you
still do have that touchscreen. Like a lot of Acer laptops these days, you get some flexibility
in how you use the Spin 1. So of course you can use it
in the standard laptop mode but if you want, you can
actually flip it upside down to get display mode, so if
you wanna be able to watch videos like this or one of
my favorites is tent mode where you flip it upside-down,
it's nice if you wanna get a little bit more of a compact form factor or if you wanna use it as a tablet, you can just close it
up and use it like that. And that display really is not bad. So it is a rocking a full
1920 by 1080 resolution and it's also an IPS panel. Now that's important as a
lot of other budget laptops definitely skimp in the screen department. So we have good color, good contrast, and especially good viewing angles. Hey guys, this is Austin. Is this all the laptop that you need? So the Spin 1 is a solid
laptop for video consumption, it's of course powerful
enough to stream stuff like 1080p video and with that nice screen and some surprisingly solid
speakers, it works well. However, spec-wise, it's not the most powerful laptop in the world. Inside, the Spin 1 has a dual
core Intel Celeron processor, four gigabytes of memory,
and 32 gigs of storage. So for what I'm going to be doing with it, mostly lighter stuff like
web browsing, video watching, and things like email, it's fine, but don't expect it to handle
demanding tasks very well. Now that 32 gigs of storage
doesn't sound like a lot but thankfully the Spin 1
does have a micro SD card slot so for about $40, you can
expand with 128-gig card, which should give you
a lot more usability. What's cool is the Spin 1
also comes with a free year of Office 365, which is
cool 'cause that like $100 on its own, so at first
glance, the Spin 1's not bad but the real test is going
to be how does it stack up when I take it on a very very long trip. So I am now on the other side of the world in Shanghai, China, and
for the last week or so, the Spin 1 has held up. So I mostly use this as a travel laptop and one of the first things
that really jumped out to me was how nice it is to use
an 11-inch laptop again. So I've been using a 15-inch
laptop for the last few years and while it's nice to
have that extra power, having something that's this small and portable was a huge help. So while I do usually
use this in laptop mode, being able to flip the screen around and set it on an airline
table was helpful. This is a nice hinge, so I
think something that I really have to kind of give them
props for is that even though this is obviously a more
budget-oriented laptop, it doesn't really feel like it. So the plastic is nice, I
like the sort of texture, and that hinge that feels really
good to flip back and forth so having that 1080p
IPS display really does make a big difference, it
really does put a lot of laptops that cost over double the price to shame. Having a free year of
Office 365 included is also a nice bonus, so I wrote up
all the notes for this video inside of Word and it's a nice experience. So the keyboard is
surprisingly good on the Spin 1 so it has nice keyboard
travel, the layout is solid with the exception of the
page up and down keys, which kind of tripped me out a little bit but there's really not
a lot to complain about and that same thing
goes for the track pad. It wasn't that long ago
that if you were buying a budget computer, you
could pretty much guarantee that it was going to
have a terrible track pad so at this point, I feel like
pretty much any Windows 10 laptop I use should have a touchscreen. It does make it a nicer experience to use and I think that kinda
goes double for the Spin 1. For something that's so
small and so portable, having the option of not only
being able to flip around the screen but obviously
be able to touch it, use the keyboard, use the
track pad, there are a lot of options on how you
actually wanna use the laptop. So I watched a lot of video
on the Spin 1 over the last few days and for the most part, it's been a solid experience. So apps like Netflix work really well, especially with the offline
mode while you're flying. However, there were a few hiccups. So that Celeron processor is
decent for more basic uses but for unoptimized apps such as iTunes, it does struggle just a little bit. Considering the price, the
main competitor to something like the Spin 1 is
going to be a Chromebook and don't get me wrong,
I do like Chrome OS, however, personally for me, I
do like having a full version of Windows 10 but you are going to have to deal with some compromises. One area where the lower specs are helpful is with battery life. So even when you're doing
fairly demanding tasks, I never saw the battery life
estimate drop below around seven hours and when you're
doing lighter stuff like web browsing and email, you
should expect over 10 hours. Long story short, the Spin
1 should easily be able to make it through a
full day without needing to hit the charger. So is the Spin 1 my new daily driver? No. I have to do stuff like 4k
video editing on a regular basis and put simply, this just is not up to it. However, if you're going to
class all day, taking notes, web browsing and that kind of stuff, then this is pretty solid. Sure, it would be nice if it
was a little bit more powerful but there's really not a lot
to complain about besides that. Anyway, what do you guys
think about the Spin 1? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Wait, how am I gonna do this? (groans) Hey guys, this is Austin. And this very well might
be the most overkill gaming monitor of all time. This is the 49 inch Samsung
QLED Gaming Monitor. Do not open here. Open opposite side. (laughs) I have to do that whole thing again now? I just saw there's a little
label on the side of the box that this is Samsung DeX compatible. Yeah, of course, what else
would you wanna connect your Galaxy S8 to, other than
a 49 inch gaming monitor. I'm gonna have to set
this down for a second. Woo! That's better. So we get what looks like
a bracket to mount it, as well as a ton of cables. Wow, all right. I think you should
really say something when the monitor stand is
bigger than most other monitors by themselves. Dude, this is so heavy. It's like everything about this monitor is what you expect to see,
except twice as big and twice as ridiculous. Oh! It's so heavy. (laughing) Did I mention that this
is a curved monitor? (laughing) What am I doing? Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. How are you supposed to do this? I don't even have enough room here. And now we've got the full 32 by nine QLED Gaming Monitor out of the packaging. This... I feel like I'm just repeating myself, but this is the most ridiculous thing ever. I mean, look at that. Oh! Oh! This is a wall bracket. You know, when you wanna mount
your 49 inch gaming monitor to the wall. Hey Jimmy. - [Jimmy] Yeah? - Can I borrow you for a second? Are we secure right now?
- Yeah. - Is this going to break
when I try to pick it up? - [Jimmy] Jimmy certified it. - All right, Jimmy certified. This is actually the first
time that a product has broken our filming area. It's literally just too big. Like, it just doesn't fit anywhere. So around back, not only
are you getting a pair of HDMI ports, but you're
also getting display port, mini display port, audio
in, audio out, as well as two more USB 3.0 ports. But the real star of the
show is well, this side. So, with everything set
up you can see that this, this is something special. So the resolution of
this guy is 3840 by 1080. So you can essentially think
of this as two 1080 monitors. So to take a couple of
windows here, I easily have enough room for say, that,
throw up a web browser over on this side. There's just so much room for activities. (laughing) Okay, well, so one of
my questions with this would be do any games actually
support this ridiculous 32 by nine aspect ratio? As you can see, CS:GO kind of does. I don't know why it's slowly
expanding out here, but we've got it for the most part. This is ridiculous. So, in a game like CS:GO
you're seeing that, especially on the edges,
it actually looks like it's almost a bit of a fish eye effect. But that is so trippy. I feel like I'm almost playing this in VR just because it completely
takes up my peripheral vision. Making things even better
is that not only does this support 144 hertz
refresh rate, which really does sort of add to the
immersion, but it also is a freesync enabled display. So right now I'm playing
on a little bit of a lower end system with
an RX480, but I'm still getting like, 140-150 frames per second. Definitely enough to
saturate the monitor and... Oh! It's so cool! Especially in CS:GO, you
can see it; some things are a little bit oddly shaped. For example, the map and
some of the HUD elements look a little bit warped
just because they are so stretched across such a giant monitor. But that's a small price
to pay for having something that looks this awesome. Next, we have PUBG. However, there's a problem. Not only is his head slightly cut off, but the settings menu doesn't
exactly work on this monitor. So let's see if this actually will work. All right, so in the game
it seems like everything is running reasonably well. I will say though, that it is very obvious that this a crop. So even though we're running
at the full resolution, you can see that like, a lot
of the bottom and the top of the screen have been cut off. So instead of getting something
that's wider we're actually just getting something
that's been sort of chopped. But I'm curious to see how that actually affects game playing. That crop is actually really serious. I'm basically only seeing
from his shoulders up. You know, for a game like
PUBG, yeah, it's probably not gonna be the end of the world. It is nice to be able to
kinda see a little bit of a wider field of view, but
it's not quite that same experience without being
able the pull out the POV. I get it, they don't wanna
give people an unfair advantage by having a super wide
monitor, but I also don't like the idea of having so
much of this cropped. Performance-wise though, it's not too bad. With this system, we did
crank it down to low settings, but because we have freesync
everything is pretty smooth, even though we're around
40 to 50 frames per second. I can't get away from the idea
that this looks really cool. Oh, oh no! Oh no! No! Don't wreck the truck! Don't wreck the truck! No! (laughing) Oh, this is fun. Oh, yeah. So now we have GTA 5 and
actually again, this is a game that does seem to support
that full aspect ratio. I'm actually kind of impressed by how well games are supported by this. So not only is it kinda cool to be able to get that wider field of view, but you also have to keep in mind
that it's not going to be that crazy to drive. Sure it is a very, very
large monitor, but it's only a 3840 by 1080 display. That's going to be wide, but
it's really not going to be that much more than something
like say, a 1440p monitor. And of course, with
freesync, if you do have an AMD graphics card
you're going to be getting those extra smooth frame rates. Next up we have DiRT 4. Now I feel like a racing
game is really perfect for something like this to get that full widescreen experience. Now the menus don't support
the full resolution, but I'm hoping the game does. If not, I'm gonna be really disappointed. Yes! This is so cool. Yeah, this is totally perfect. I mean, honestly, I keep
making the comparison with a VR headset. But it does kind of feel like that. Obviously it's not that
fully immersive experience, but you're getting something
that is pretty much taking up your whole field of view. You know what? I'm gonna
give Samsung props. This is a ridiculous monitor. Very, very few people are
probably going to buy it. But, it's just cool. I'm just glad that someone
just decided, hey, let's take a pair of super high
refresh rate monitors, glue them together and
make some giant monstrosity that actually is kind of cool. No, scratch that. It's really cool. So, does anyone actually need
a 49 inch gaming monitor? Of course not. But, I will say it's
actually not as impractical as I thought it would be. Yeah, it's gonna be a little
bit unwieldy and you do have to have a pretty
decent PC to drive it, but it's actually really pretty well done. So as always, the link
to check this guy out will be in the description. I'm curious, what do you think
about this overkill monster? Let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. 2017 has been one of the best
years for smartphones ever. So here are my top five favorites. Kicking things off, we
have the Moto E4 Plus. This is straight-up the best
deal in smartphones right now. Back in August when I first
did a video on the E4 Plus, it was $180, but if you
want to go to Amazon and buy one today, it's
only going to be 130. At that kind of price,
you shouldn't expect much, but this is a good phone, period. It has a metal build,
which while it's a little bit on the thicker side,
does feel good in the hand. The reason it's a little bit chunky is because this guy is rocking a massive 5,000 milliamp-powered battery. This is straight-up the best battery life that I've ever tried in a smartphone. Now sometimes you can
get about a day or so out of most phones with decent batteries, but with this guy, especially considering the fairly power sipping internals, getting two full days of usage
is actually not too hard. To put things in perspective, it has nearly triple the
battery size of the iPhone 8. It's not just a phone
with a giant battery, you're getting a 5.5 inch 720P display, which while a good panel, it would be nice to have a little bit of a higher resolution. But again, it's $130. The camera's also pretty good. And Motorola's software,
while not fully up-to-date on Oreo just yet, is pretty clean. The bottom line is that this really is all the smartphone
that most people need, especially when you consider that crazy battery life and great price. The Moto E4 Plus is
definitely worth a look. Next up, we have the Samsung Galaxy S8. Now this was one of the
first flagships of the year, however it is still one of the best. Use this phone for about two minutes and it's hard not to
be impressed with just how far Samsung has come with design. It's an all metal and glass build. What's impressive is just how well the glass tapers around on
both the front and back. As nice as the iPhone X design is, it's hard for me to argue with just how nice the Galaxy S8 feels in the hand. It's all the more
impressive that they did it over six months before Apple did. The Galaxy S8 really did set the bezel-less trend for 2017. Well yes, on top and bottom there are some slight bezels, but
especially on the sides, they're basically non-existent. It goes deeper than that, too. The amulet display is
still one of the absolute best that you can buy it with
rich blacks and great color. You're also getting the headphone jack, which in a year where most
phones have dropped it, is definitely a nice addition. As you would expect, performance is good. And while I'm still not a huge fan of Samsung's software scan, it doesn't really get in the way and there's no doubt that the phone is snappy. While the camera isn't quite on par with the Pixel 2, it's still terrific. One of the nice things about this is that because it is a few months old, the price has come down to $650, which I think is more than reasonable for such a great phone. However, it's not perfect. The fingerprint sensor
placement around back just doesn't make sense. The idea that it only
has a single mono speaker in 2017 is kind of annoying. And while the addition of fast charging and wireless charging is nice, it still doesn't quite make up for the fact that the battery life
isn't too great on its own. The biggest issue is that we're only a few months away from the
unveiling of the Galaxy S9. Taken as a whole, though,
it is hard to argue that the Galaxy S8 isn't one
of the best phones of 2017. Next we have the OnePlus 5T, one of my biggest surprises of the year. So at $500, this is
definitely not a budget phone. However, when you consider that a lot of the other flagships are $1000 this year, this actually starts
to look like a bargain. While on the surface it looks very similar to the also-released in 2017 OnePlus 5, the biggest difference here is that we're now getting a
basically bezel-less display. It's rocking a good, but not remarkable, six-inch amulet display,
which while not quite as sharp as the Galaxy S8, it's still fine for pretty much everyone. The hardware's also good. So it's got a seamless aluminum build, which not only looks good, but I feel like almost more importantly, feels really nice in the hand. The fingerprint sensor
is also around back now, you know in a sensible place
that you can actually reach. And OnePlus was very proud of the idea that they have still
kept the headphone jack. Continuing on the good
trend, performance is good. So with the Snapdragon
835 and eight gigs of ram, it's about as good as it
gets on Android right now. The software is pretty
clean and mostly stock. OxygenOS does add a
couple of useful features, but what really stands
out about the OnePlus 5T to me is the camera. Phones like the Pixel
really have pulled away from pretty much all other
phones out there right now, but the OnePlus 5T does a remarkably good job of keeping up. So, no, it's not quite as good, but in a lot of situations, it's close enough that it's going to be really hard to tell the difference. And that's impressive,
especially considering that usually when you step down from those thousand dollar flagships
to something that's a little bit cheaper, the camera is the first thing to be cut. It might not be the best
in any specific area, but it's good basically everywhere and at $500, the OnePlus
5T is a rock-solid phone. Speaking of incredibly
expensive flagship phones, we have the iPhone X. Yes, a thousand dollar price tag is incredibly expensive for a phone. But, if you can look past
that for just a second, it's hard not to be impressed with what Apple is able to pull off here. First of all, are the bezels, or rather lack of bezels. So as long as you can look past the notch, which for me only took a
few minutes to get used to, you're getting an absolutely
incredible screen here. It's an amulet panel
that is ever so slightly better than the one on the Galaxy S8, which is no small feat. Along with that, you're
getting HDR support and Apple's still awesome 3D Touch. The praise doesn't stop there, either. The Apple A11 bionic
chip inside the iPhone X not only shames a lot of phones, but even some computers. That, combined with iOS 11, means that the iPhone
feels incredibly snappy. Everything responds basically immediately. And especially now that we have the new gestures that have
replaced the home button, it feels even faster. You do lose Touch ID, which
would be nice to have, but honestly, Face ID feels
like some next-gen tech. Raise your phone to wake,
give it a half a second to scan your face, and
you're right into your phone. Now it's not a perfect system. While it works really well for me, it does vary from person to person. Some people have had a
lot of issues with it. For the most part though, the hardware is absolutely top-notch. Get it, notch? Glass and stainless steel give the iPhone X a heft that actually does make it feel more expensive and the battery life is a noticeable step-up from previous iPhones. Even the camera is right up there with the very best smartphones out. You now have wireless charging,
as well as waterproofing. If it sounds like I'm a fan of the X, then you would be right. Yes, the price tag is steep,
but as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't get much better than this. Before we get to the final phone, I want to give a few honorable mentions to some phones that did some really cool stuff this year, starting
with the Razr phone. This came out of nowhere with some legitimately cool features. It's rocking a 5.7 inch display with a 1440P resolution and what makes it really exciting is the
120 hertz refresh rate. This makes everything from games to animations look buttery smooth. It will be a feature in phones in 2018. You're also getting the best speakers I've ever heard on a phone period. It's not even close. The only problem is that it feels like a brick in your pocket and the camera is straight garbage-town. Something that I feel like was a little underrated this year is the iPhone 8 plus. So take all the best
parts of the iPhone X, including the camera, you're
getting the build quality, you're getting even better battery life, but you're adding Touch ID and you're shaving a couple hundred
dollars off the price. The biggest issue is that the iPhone X has a bigger screen and Face
ID and a smaller chasse. The iPhone 8 Plus is a good phone, but the X is just a better one. Then, there's the essential phone. This is a little bit of a weird one. On one hand, the hardware is incredible. It's got a ceramic build and a notch to put the iPhone X to shame. At launch, it was held back
by an expensive price tag and a mediocre camera,
but some software updates and a price cut have mostly
addressed that at this point. The only real issue is
that the essential company itself is maybe not the most
stable in the world right now. But, if you're willing to
take a little bit of a gamble, the essential phone is really solid. All of this leads me to
my favorite phone of 2017. The Google Pixel 2. Now let me be clear, I prefer the standard
Pixel 2 over the Pixel 2XL. Not only is it $200 cheaper, but the screen is not garbage-town, which you know is helpful when you pay $850 for a phone. What you're getting here is the fastest Android phone I've ever tried. Even though on paper it's not as powerful as the iPhone X, in real use it feels right up there, which
is really a testament to how well Google has
optimized this phone. In an age where phones
get bigger and bigger, I found the standard
Pixel 2 to be actually a pretty decent size. Now the design isn't quite
on par with something like the Galaxy S8 or the iPhone X, but that really isn't
a deal breaker to me. Not only does the Pixel
2 add waterproofing, which is basically a necessity these days, but you're also getting
pretty decent battery life. Where it really shines is with the camera. In my opinion, this is the best smartphone camera you can buy. Now a lot of the credit goes to Google's awesome optimization of the camera, and while yes, sometimes the iPhone X does look a little bit better, but generally speaking,
I prefer the overall results that you get from the Pixel. Where the Pixel 2 really
wins for me is price. At $650, this is nearly $400
cheaper than the iPhone X. Sure, the iPhone does some things better than the Pixel, but for most people, this is a better choice,
which is why it is my favorite phone of 2017. So you guys have seen my picks, but I'm curious, what is
your favorite phone of 2017? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Google Pixel 2
and this is the Pixel 2 XL, but the question is are they worth it? There's a lot new this
year, but one of the biggest differences is in price. So the Pixel 2 is going to cost you $650, but bump up to the Pixel
2 XL and it is $850. Want 128 gigs of storage? Then this guy's going to cost you $950. Jump inside the box and
there's actually a fair bit that comes with the Pixel 2. So the first thing we'll
find is the actual smart phone itself, but beyond that, get a little bit deeper,
we get a "Yay welcome to #TeamPixel" bit, which I'm
sure has all our paperwork, SIM tool, that kind of thing. There's also a USB-C to USB-A adapter, we get what looks to be a
whole bunch of extra cables! Oh boy. When Google announced the
original Pixel last year, something they were
really big on is the idea that it still has the headphone jack. Now fast forward to the Pixel
2 and it's nowhere to be seen. Now I get the idea that by
dropping the headphone jack, you're going to free up
more space inside the phone for sensors or batteries, or whatever, but the problem is,
unless you're fully on the Bluetooth headphone train, USB-C is a bit of a mess right now. Say what you will about Apple
dropping the headphone jack last year, but at the
very least there are some decent Lightning headphone
options available. On the Pixel, you're pretty
much limited to either using the adapter that comes in the box, or a very limited selection
of USB-C headphones. It's not all bad with
the Pixel 2 hardware, so while yes, it does look
fairly similar to the last generation, including
the pretty large bezels, but in return, we're now
getting IP67 water resistance, as well as some pretty solid
front firing stereo speakers. Move over to the Pixel 2
XL, and it is a surprisingly large change. So up front, it's rocking
a six inch AMOLED display, and while I wouldn't call it bezel-less, the bezels are a lot thinner
than on the standard Pixel 2. Even though the Pixel 2 is made by HTC and the XL is made by LG,
the hardware is very similar. So they're both still
rocking a two-tone design and while it looks nice,
I actually do definitely prefer the way that the
original Pixel looked with the very blue
color, because you know, yeah, I want all my smart
phones to look like this. Even though this is a
glass and metal phone, the metal part actually has
this sort of coating on it, which kind of feels like plastic. Now if you check out
JerryRigEverything's durability test of the Pixel 2, you'll
see that this coating is not particularly durable. I actually kind of like the
way that the Pixel 2 feels, but multiple people who've
tried it immediately thought that it was made out of plastic, so take that for what it's worth. Take a look at it in Geekbench, and while it's fast, it is
absolutely no match for the Apple A10X in the iPhone 8, however, thankfully benchmarks aren't everything. What stuff like Geekbench
doesn't get across is that this is an
incredibly snappy phone. Animations are smooth, the
responsiveness is quick, and it always feels
like it's one step ahead of what you actually wanna do. Honestly, this is one of
the fastest Android phones I've tested and it is right
up there with the iPhone 8. Part of that is thanks to
an incredibly clean build of Android 8.0 Oreo. So there are some custom features, including Google Lens,
and this is actually built inside Google Photos, it
would be nice to see it in the camera app, but what
it's allowing you to do is scan a photo and try
to figure out what it is. For some things it's not that accurate, but for others, it is surprisingly good. Although just not that useful to me. What's a little cooler is Now Playing, now once you enable this,
essentially the phone will always be listening for music and if it detects it,
it will actually give you a notification. This is kind of creepy, but
it works surprisingly well, especially if you're in
something like a restaurant, you might be able to
actually pick up the song that's being played over the stereo. The Pixel 2 also has a squeezable frame, so if you actually squeeze
it on the bottom half, it will trigger Google Assistant. So, what does the fox say? - [Assistant] Ring ding
ding ding ding a ding and wop pop pop pop pop pa pow, or so I've heard. (laughs) Roll a 20 sided die. - [Assistant] You got it. (die hits table) It's a 19. - Flip a coin. - [Assistant] Okay. (coin lands on table) You got tails. - However, not everything is perfect. Some of my biggest issues with
the Pixel 2 is the display. So on the standard size
Pixel 2, it's fine. It's a five inch AMOLED panel
with a 1080p resolution. Yes it could be a little bit sharper, and the bezels could be a lot smaller, but it's totally usable. However, when it comes to the Pixel 2 XL, that display is garbage town. I mean it. Garbage town. Garbage town. This reminds me of really
early AMOLED panels from years ago. When you're looking at it
straight on, it's okay, although honestly a lot of the colors, like especially the
reds look awfully brown, but as soon as you move it
even a little bit off axis, it goes super, super cool. This is okay on a cheap smart phone, but when you're charging
$850, it's basically a deal breaker. It really is a shame,
because the Pixel XL 2 should be able to compete
with stuff like the iPhone and the Galaxy Note 8, but right now, the screen holds it back,
which to me actually makes the normal Pixel 2 a much easier sell. Yes, it has the much larger bezels, but to my eye, is a way better screen, and it's the phone that I've been using the last few days. Thankfully the giant bezels of the Pixel 2 don't go to waste. It does have some very nice
sounding front firing speakers, those pretty much blows
away any other flagship that's out today, with
really the only exception being the iPhone 8. And to my ears, they sound very similar, way better than pretty much anything else you can get right now. One of the biggest upgrades on the Pixel 2 is that 12 megapixel camera. Now that might not sound impressive, but these are some of the
best smart phone images I've ever gotten period. Some of the stuff is really crazy. There is a ton of detail on these images, and they've actually
done a really good job of getting even more dynamic
range than most of the already great flagships
that you can buy in 2017. Color is also good, maybe
not quite as saturated as some Samsung phones, but
the low-light performance has seen a huge bump up on the Pixel. Now a part of that is
because they finally added optical image stabilization,
and that paired with their awesome image processing
means that you can get some surprisingly usable
shots in very low light. The portrait mode is also
really good on the Pixel, so while it doesn't have any
kind of dual camera setup, using software, they're
actually able to get a very similar sort of result, and the upside is this also works with the selfies. Now the Pixel 2 does shoot 4K video, and you guys can actually
look to see and hear what that sounds like right now, but as far as I'm concerned,
this is one of the best smart phone cameras that
you can buy right now. Although if you're using a Pixel 2 XL, taking a look at these pictures on screen might not give you too much confidence, but believe me, the colors
and the image quality is absolutely there. Last year's Pixel was
a very, very good phone with a couple of major compromises. This year, Google basically
nailed it, almost. You might not mind the
screen on the Pixel 2 XL, but it is just simply
not in the same league as other flagships, and
when you're paying $850, you should expect the best in everything. I really like the standard Pixel 2. Yes, the screen is a little bit small, and the bezels are big,
but the rest of the phone is so good that it's kind of worth it. It is absolutely one of
the best smart phones that you can buy. So what do you guys
think about the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you on the next one. 
This video is sponsored by RhinoShield. Hey guys, this is Austin. Here on the channel, we've built some pretty
questionable stuff, but today it's time to
give the iPhone X a shot. So, when RhinoShield
challenged us to do something a little creative with their new Mod case, I felt like it seemed
like the natural choice. So, if you guys aren't
familiar with RhinoShield, it's what I use on my phone every day. Now, the idea here is that it
is a bumper that will protect your phone while still leaving
the front and back exposed. However, with their new Mod case, you actually can do a lot more than that. I like using the black frame
with the white buttons, but you can also add a back plate. Now, not only will this
help protect your phone, but also will allow you to
add lenses to the iPhone. So, you have a few different
lenses to choose from, but my favorite is the HD wide angle. Now, the idea here is,
especially when you're using the iPhone X, not only do
you have the telephoto camera and the normal wide angle,
when you put this guy on, it gives you an even wider field of view. The lenses just screw right on and once you get them in place, you can just take off the lens cap, and if you open up the camera, boom! While a lot of lenses can be fairly soft, this actually looks really nice and sharp. Especially when you put it side by side with the normal iPhone camera,
it makes a big difference. The Mod case can also protect against some pretty serious abuse, and I found that out the hard
way, as well as on purpose. RhinoShield claims that this
will protect up to an 11 foot drop test, and uh, this looks like a little
bit more than that. So, (laughs) here goes nothing. This is my iPhone, so I
really hope it doesn't break. Okay, three, two, one... (crashing)
Ohh! Three, two, one... (slow motion whirring) (crashing)
Ohh! I don't wanna look. I don't wanna look. I'm gonna look.
(laughing) Woo! It's even still recording! Hi Ken. Okay. Oh yeah, totally fine. I wasn't worried or anything. So any good vlogger
should know that you need the Casey Neistat special. So, not only do we have a GorillaPod, but we also have a tripod
mount for a smartphone. Now, there are a ton of
different versions of these. I like this metal one,
which I've actually seen under a bunch of different brand names, but I'll make sure to link
this one into the description. Also, a little pro tip. Even though this has rubber,
it actually does make sense to use something like a RhinoShield, because it will scratch your phone. So, now this is looking a lot better. But, good video is nothing
without good audio. That's where this comes in. So, this is the Shure MV88 and
it is a Lightning microphone. So, this should, in theory,
sound a lot better than the built-in microphone on the iPhone. But, the only problem is, is that the Lightning
port on this guy is tiny, which means that we had to improvise. By improvise, I mean Ken
cut up a Lightning dock to make it actually fit on our phone, because he's talented and
dedicated and hates money. I mean, come on, you clicked on building the ultimate iPhone X, did you not think we were
going to get to this point? So, I think the wider angle camera definitely helps for vlogging, but the microphone sounds so much better than the built-in iPhone. And I mean, yes, there
are probably slightly more practical ways of
vlogging from your iPhone, but for something that if
you wanna carry this around (laughs) in your pock-- (laughs) I can't even say
it with a straight face. No one's gonna walk around with this. But, it works. Kind of. All right, so I am now
vlogging from my super cool iPhone X vlog rig. So, you guys can be the judge
for yourself with the quality, but with the wider angle camera, you're getting a little
bit more in the shot. Hopefully, the mic sounds
pretty good as well. But, say vlogging isn't your thing, but you still wanna build
the ultimate iPhone. Oh, we're not done yet. This is the Wireless
Universal Foldable Keyboard, and okay, well that's a
little bit of a dirty pouch, but whatever. Ohh... What? (laughs) Wait.
(clicking) Ohh! (laughs) Wait, wait. That's actually-- Wait, that's a full size keyboard. My Geology 101 report is Ken is a really handsome guy. Okay, that's not great.
Can we talk about how you're just using the phone sideways? (laughs) No, we don't have to
talk about that at all, Ken. Because... I have a monitor. Hey! (laughs) (laughs) All right. Let's do this. Let's start Tweeting. Hi, my name is Austin and I make bad decisions. (laughs) This is so much fun. I love doing dumb stuff with tech. It's the best. If all that wasn't enough, you can also add a
Bluetooth game controller, such as the SteelSeries Nimbus. Because you know, when
you have an HDMI display, you gotta play some games. And, I'm playing Minecraft on an iPhone using a game controller and a monitor. Also, why is nothing loading? (laughs) How'd I break Minecraft? That's not-- That shouldn't be a thing. Oh, there we go. I've actually gotta say
this does feel like playing Minecraft on anything else. The controller feels good, pretty much just something
like an Xbox controller. While for some reason
the iPhone is displaying in a smaller window, it does work. Should anyone ever actually
play games like this? Probably not. Is it fun? Absolutely. So, while some might say
that this isn't the most practical setup in the world, but I'm actually pretty
impressed with some of it, most notably the video rig. Now, no you shouldn't probably
use a Bluetooth keyboard and a controller and an HDMI
display with your iPhone, but if you're shooting video, this is actually not a bad way of going. Just add a microphone,
and something like these lenses that go with the RhinoShield Mod case can make a big difference. So, what would you guys put
in your ultimate iPhone X? And no, you can't just
say an Android phone. Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch
you in the next one. (laughs) 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Is a $650 gaming laptop worth it? So this is the new HP Envy x360. Now while it might not
look like a gaming laptop, inside it is rocking the
brand new AMD Ryzen Mobile. If you've bought a laptop
in the last few years, more than likely it was powered by Intel. However, AMD has stepped up in
a big way with Ryzen Mobile. Not only does this have
a much more powerful CPU, but the graphics should be
good enough for actual gaming. So it is definitely a larger
laptop with a 15 inch display. But, as part of their x360
line, what we're getting here is a fully convertible
design, which actually isn't too thick either. Cover wise, it feels pretty nice. So we're getting a slightly
sharp, angular design, which a lot of HP laptops have had these days. But considering the $650
price point, it looks and feels pretty premium. Open this guy up and we're
going to see the full size keyboard, as well as
number row, as well as the Bang &amp; Olufsen speakers. Something you won't find,
however, are any stupid Intel stickers all over the laptop. Actually, there are no AMD
stickers at all, are there? For ports, there's a pretty
decent selection, including HDMI, a USB 3, as well
as your headphone jack. And on the other side,
you're going to be getting one more USB 3.0, a USB-C
that supports charging, as well as a full size SD card slot. HP doesn't claim this is a
gaming PC, but with Ryzen 5 inside it should be capable
of some decent gaming. So not only are we getting
a Quad-Core Zen processor, but we're also getting
eight Vega GPU cores. Now that's not going to
be able to blow away some proper dedicated graphics,
but the idea is, is that for $650, especially
considering that this is a very battery focused,
sort of, lightweight laptop, it should give us decent
gaming performance. Ryzen has proven to be pretty
impressive on the desktop side, offering a lot of fast
cores at a reasonable price. Thankfully, that comes
across to Ryzen Mobile. So in Geekbench, while it's
not quite on par with Intel's latest 8th-gen, 15 watt
processors, it actually performs really well compared to
slightly older Core i5s. Definitely plenty of
performance for pretty much any kind of normal usage. Where things get really
interesting is with those Vega graphics. So it is a huge step up
over something like Intel Integrated Graphics, and
it's even on par with some of the lower end
dedicated graphics options. Now this might not sound
that impressive, but consider that this is all in a 15 watt chip. It nearly matches Intel's
latest and greatest on the processor side, and
completely destroys them on the graphics side. And again, this is from AMD. To put this to the test, we have CS:GO. Now here running at 1080p
medium, we're actually getting pretty decent frame rates. So we're averaging somewhere
between the high 40s to mid 50s. And that is definitely very playable. Obviously, ideally you're
running in like 300,000 frames, but considering that
we've got a $650 laptop, I'm definitely not complaining. Next up, we have Rocket League. Now this is a game that is
pretty popular, and it's also not that hard to run. And yet again, here we're
running at 1080p, this time on quality settings. Now the frame rate's actually
really impressive here. We're just pretty much staying
above 60 frames per second at all times. Wow, that was terrible. So, in theory, we actually
can bump those settings up, all the way up to the high
quality if we wanted to. Move over to GTA, and
we're actually getting pretty decent performance. So on normal settings, at
1080p, we're getting between 30 to 40 frames per second. For less demanding areas
like this, we're actually in the mid 40s or so. When you get a lot of
explosions, sometimes it dips around 30, but again, pretty playable. To really put this to
the test, we have Pubg. And well this, is not so great. So, low settings at 720p, we're
barely getting like 27, 28 frames per second. I mean, this is a little
bit more of an open area, but even after we walk inside
this building we're still barely touching 30. It's kind of usable. It's not the worst
experience I've ever tried. But, maybe not the best
Pubg machine in the world. Things aren't all perfect
in normal use either. So when I was first setting
up this laptop, I had some weird driver issues,
where the screen would go really dim and I would
have no control over it, and sleep mode just
completely disappeared. Thankfully, a few Windows
updates fixed that. But still, not the best
out of box experience. Now it's not a huge surprise
considering that this is one of the very first Ryzen
Mobile products to actually go on sale. So there might be a few
kinks to be worked out. I will say though, the AMD
x360 is nice piece of hardware. And of course, you do have
that fully flexible hinge. And while it is nicely
weighted, I don't like how much wobble there is when
you actually touch it. Although again, this is
a very common complaint with pretty much any of these
sort of convertible designs. The keyboard also isn't too bad. So not only do I like the
spacing and the layout with having the number row,
but also has a nice feel, and importantly, especially
considering the price, it is going to be backlit. With the screen issues
patched it's a good panel. So at 15.6 inches, with
a 1080p resolution, it looks pretty good. And especially with this
kind of size and price point, I feel like 1080 is a
totally reasonable sweet spot for gaming, as well as productivity. Now the actual display itself. The color is nice, and the
contrast is pretty impressive, however, it just doesn't get that bright. So when you're looking
at it dead on, it's okay. But that, combined with the fact that it's really reflective, means
that if you get this guy even slightly off axis, it is
really hard to see anything. So like a lot of other HP
laptops recently, it does have Bang &amp; Olufsen branded speakers,
and especially considering that it's a pretty big
speaker row that's directed straight at you. Not only does it sound pretty good, but it gets surprisingly loud. However, it's not all great. So the trackpad is just kind of okay. Now I really wish it did have
Windows Precision drivers. As it is, the tracking is
okay, and it does support most of the major gestures,
but the tracking could be a lot better, and
especially the trackpad size feels a little bit small
for a laptop in 2018. There's also Windows Hello
support for facial recognition, which is a nice feature, except
that for me, it only works when I get my face very,
very close to the laptop. The webcam isn't much better. So it is at least 1080p,
but as you guys can see from this quality, Team
Crispy, this is definitely not. The biggest issue though,
is the hard drive. So while the rest of the
system is pretty well specced out with the Ryzen
5, dual channel eight gigs of memory, however, having
a mechanical hard drive in a laptop in 2018 just feels slow. It would be so nice if they
had actually configured this with an SSD. On one hand, Ryzen Mobile
is seriously impressive. Look back just a few months
ago, and Intel was selling 15 watt laptop processors
with lackluster graphics and only two cores. Yeah, they've stepped
it up to Quad-Core now, but you look at AMD, who
has come out of nowhere with an impressive
Quad-Core design, and some seriously powerful graphics. And again, this is from AMD. I know I keep saying that,
but it is really impressive what AMD has been able to
pull off, especially coming out of nowhere like this. Now sure, this is not going
to be a super high end gaming machine that's
going to work for everyone, but it does have enough power to play some pretty decent games. On the other hand, the Envy
x360 is good, but not perfect. I feel like they got about 85% right. With a better trackpad,
a couple of tweaks, and especially a standard SSD,
I would like this thing a lot more. What gets me really excited
is that this has forced Intel Nvidia to price some
gaming laptops in this sort of $600 price range. So, if you guys wanna see
a video on one of those, definitely be sure to let me
know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys this is Austin. Apple has been releasing a lot
of major new products lately but something they haven't
touched is the Mac Mini which has not seen an
update in three years. Why does this still exist in 2017? I will say the Mac Mini
comes in a tiny box. So today small form factor PCs
really aren't anything all that special. But, the Mac Mini was
kind of ahead of its time. Oh, all right, I will say
one thing, even though, yes, there are a lot of
problems with the Mac Mini that I will get into the
actual sort of unibody aluminum design still feels pretty nice. You don't exactly get a
lot in the box, though. Pretty much all we get is
a little bit of paperwork with Apple stickers and a power cable. It might sound weird
to say considering that this design originally
came out in 2010 but I've actually never held the Mac
Mini and I'm kind of impressed. So, like I said it's an
all aluminum unibody design and you actually have a
fair few ports in the back. Not only is there an SD card
reader but there are also four USB 3.0 ports, as
well as even a couple of Thunderbolt 2 ports. Now, this is a far cry
from current Apple devices which have some would say fewer ports. Earlier models of the Mac Mini were actually fairly upgradable. So, on the bottom you
could actually screw off this sort of plastic piece to get at stuff like the hard drive and RAM. However, this it's a
little bit more difficult and to make things worse the
memory's actually soldered in. That is a far cry from when Marques built the ultimate Mac Mini
back in 2012 where he loaded it up with a ton of
memory as well as an SSD. At first glance though
this actually doesn't look like a bad way of getting
yourself a cheap Mac. So, this is a base Mac
Mini which runs $500 and that's exactly half
the price of the next cheapest model the Macbook Air. However, take a closer
look and the Mac Mini might not quite be such a great value. Performance might just
be the most outdated part of this system as
2014 specs will only take you so far. This is the base model Mac
Mini with Core i5-4260U four gigabytes of RAM and a 500 gigabyte mechanical hard drive. To put things in perspective
Intel is just launching their eighth generation of Core processors whereas the Mac Mini is using a fourth generation Haswell chip. Even when you spend
the extra $500 to go to the higher end model with
the Core i7 you're still limited to a dual core
processor, which is bizarre. They actually used to
ship quad core versions of the Mac Mini. Take, for example, the
leaked benchmarks for the iPhone X that is
showing a score of around 4,000 on single threaded and
about 10,000 on multi-threaded. Way, way faster than this Mac Mini is. You're also stuck with a
500 gigabyte hard drive. Now yes, you can spec up
the Mac Mini with not only a Fusion Drive but as
well as pure SSD options, but that raises the price significantly. - Hey guys, this is
Austin and today I'm back with another tech under video
this time talking a look at tech under $60. - So, to be fair the Mac
Mini is powerful enough to handle stuff like HD video
as well as web browsing, but the issue is with
only four gigabytes of RAM and you can't upgrade it
you're going to run into some serious usability issues on Mac OS. So, take for example the HP Pavilion Wave, this is a much more modern system. You're getting more memory
and almost more importantly it's gonna cost you about
$130 less than the Mac Mini. It just doesn't make sense. One of the reasons I can see
somebody being interested in the cheap Mac are for
the Mac exclusive apps such as Final Cut Pro
X, which is what we use to edit all of our videos. - Hey guys, this is Austin. - Wow, this actually, wow. So, to give you guys some
context on this this is a triple stream 4K
video being played back and edited in real time on the Mac Mini. In fact, it's actually the
intro to this video right now. So, yes this is not maybe the
most demanding thing ever. We haven't done stuff
like color correction, which would definitely slow things down. But, as far as being able
to do a sort of basic cut this is three streams
of 4K video playing back in real time on the Mac Mini. The only thing that's
not totally stock here and one of the reasons
why it's not stuttering is we are editing off a USB
based SSD, but that's what we do for all of our edits anyway. Although, I think this says more about how solid Final Cut is
optimized and less so about how powerful the Mac Mini is. There are better
alternatives if you do want a cheap Mac though starting with building yourself a Hackintosh. Now yes, building a
Hackintosh from scratch is going to be more
complicated than pulling a Mac Mini out of the box
but what you're going to get is much much better
hardware for the same price if not even less. Even used options can make a lot of sense. So, a few minutes of
searching on eBay found multiple Mac Minis that
are maybe only a generation or so behind but could be
found for as little as $200. Look, most of the time
there's at least someone who I can say that a
product will make sense for when it comes to the
Mac Mini it just isn't a good idea to buy one of these in 2017. There are just simply
better options out there. Now, before we get outta here I wanna give a shout out to a few
really good friends of mine over at Vsauce. So no, this is not a
sponsored spot, but they've been working on the
Curiosity Box for over a year now and I honesty feel like it is getting really, really good. This is a quarterly
subscription box that comes with all kinds of cool science stuff including this incredibly attractive Vsauce beanie. This box even comes with

- The iPhone X is the most
expensive iPhone ever. It has the biggest
screen, smallest bezels, and it is the first iPhone
to drop the home button. But the question is, is it worth it? It all starts with the design. From the rear it looks very
similar to the iPhone 8. You're getting an all-glass
back for the first time since the iPhone 4 days. The X comes in two colors,
silver and space gray. The silver is basically just
white with a silver chassis where the space gray
swaps out the rear glass for a very dark gray color
and a dark metal band. It really does look and feel premium. There's a solidness and heft to the design that just wasn't there
on the iPhone 6 and 7. However, there's a price to pay for that. Unlike a metal back which
might just get scratched or dented, no matter how strong
Apple claims this glass is, it can absolutely be
cracked if you drop it. One of the upsides to switching
to glass for the rear panel is the addition of wireless charging. In a very un-Apple-like move,
this supports the Qi standard that has been around on
android phones for years, meaning that you should
just be able to drop the X on a cheap wireless charging
pad and it'll work no problem. You also get the small
added benefit of being able to fast charge the X via a
USB-C to Lightning cable too. Now, the silver phone is
especially prone to scratching as they moved from aluminum
to stainless steel. This is a harder material
that gives the phone its expensive feel,
but like the old iPods, expect it to scuff easily. Thankfully, like the iPhone 7, you've got IP67 water resistance. Now, this isn't full waterproofing, but your shiny new $1,000
iPhone should have no problem getting a little wet or even
totally submerged for a minute. Like always, the design looks great but you should probably get a case. Flip the phone over though, and you'll see the biggest
change this year: the display. Put the X side by side with
the 8+ and the lack of bezels really does make the phone look like a much more modern flagship. It looks similar to the Galaxy Note 8. It lacks the curved edges but
has nearly no bezels otherwise except for the notch. After using the phone for a few days, it doesn't really bother me. When you're using the
phone in portrait mode, it basically just means
that you get a little bit of extra vertical screen
real estate with stuff like battery and time on the edges. When watching video, you
have a couple options. For standard 16:9 content, the
true blacks of the OLED panel make things look a lot
like a normal iPhone. But for example, on YouTube
you can pinch to zoom it to full screen. You crop a little of the
frame and sometimes the notch looks a bit off, but it's a good way of taking full advantage of the display. Now, not all apps support the X yet. A lot will display with
black bars on top and bottom. Thanks to OLED, the
blacks are properly black so that mostly means it
just looks like you're using an iPhone 7. That display though really is something. The change from IPS to OLED
means that you're getting far better contrast. That black is actually black here. I know I keep saying it, but it really does make a huge difference. The screen looks so much more contrasty. The color is pleasant as well. It's nicely calibrated and the screen gets impressively bright. My only real issue is that
there is a bit of color shifting when you look at it off
axis, but it's fairly minor and the rest of the advantages of OLED definitely outweigh it. The iPhone X also gives you support for HDR 10 and Dolby Vision. Watching Stranger Things: Two
on the X looks phenomenal. The brightness and contrast
really does make content pop. In fact, we're shooting this video in HDR. If you're watching on
an HDR TV with something like a Chromecast Ultra
or even some smartphones like the Galaxy S8, you should be able to see the difference. Audio is also impressive on the X. It has a pair of speakers,
one front-firing that doubles as the speakerphone,
and the other on bottom. It's not quite as loud and crisp as dedicated stereo
speakers on the Pixel 2, but it blows away basically
any other flagship out there right now. Combine that with the great
screen and you have one of the best mobile video experiences, period. Something interesting is
that the iPhone X touch layer refreshes at 120 Hertz. The screen itself is still
60 Hertz, which can't match the level of smoothness of
something like the Razer Phone or iPad Pro, but that faster
touch layer does make the phone feel a lot more responsive. With the new screen comes
arguably the biggest change to the iPhone in the last 10 years. No more home button. One on hand, it's what gives the iPhone it's most recognizable shape, but in 2017 it's looking
awfully out of date. Instead of the home button,
the X relies on a series of gestures to navigate the phone. Swiping up has replaced the
home button and the gesture area doubles as a quick swipe
to move between apps. After a couple of days, to me this feels like a
very natural evolution. iOS already uses so many
gestures to navigate that once you drop the
button and totally commit, it speeds up moving around
the entire interface. There are some trade offs though. Some button combos have changed. For example, you now hold the
power button to trigger Siri and you can screenshot by
holding power and volume up. The biggest trade off is that
there's no longer touch ID. Instead, the iPhone X introduces Face ID. This is a big reason why the
notch is as big as it is. You're essentially getting a Kinect that has been miniaturized
into the top of a phone. I will absolutely admit
that before I tried the X, I had my doubts about Face ID. But it actually works. After a quick set-up, it
works basically as advertised. Tap the screen and in
the time it takes for you to swipe up to unlock, Face ID scans your face
and unlocks the phone. It's not perfect. You do need to be looking
at the phone for it to work, but I was impressed with
just how versatile it is. Your results might vary, but I basically have no major
complaints with Face ID. It feels like I just
don't have a passcode. This take also makes Animoji possible. Look, these are just fun, okay? This works as an iMessage
app that scans your face and translates it into a talking emoji. It does a really good
job of even capturing small facial motions
and lets you do karaoke. So, you know. One area that's basically the same between the iPhone 8 and X is performance. Both phones give you the Apple A11 Bionic, which is hands-down the fastest chip you can get in a phone today. This translates into a phone that feels like you just can't trip it up. Not matter how much I multitask, it just doesn't break a sweat. Animations stay locked
at 60 frames per second, and because you have those new gestures, it feels lightning fast
to move between apps. While this isn't exclusive to the X, this power does come in handy for games. Of course, standard titles
like Minecraft run here no problem, but you also have
some pretty fun AR games. The iPhone X brings a pair
of 12 megapixel cameras, one wide angle and one telephoto. This is the same basic setup as on the 8 Plus and it works well here. Apple has cranked up
saturation in this generation and it makes images
look a lot more punchy, which while maybe not
quite technically accurate does make for a better looking photo. There's a good amount of detail
but what's really impressive is the dynamic range. HDR is on by default and
there have been a few shots where I legitimately couldn't
believe how much range the X was able to keep in one picture. The telephoto camera on
the 7 Plus came in handy for me a fair bit, but it's
a lot better on the X. It still isn't quite as
sharp as the main shooter, but it now has image stabilization which makes a big difference,
especially in low light. The A11 chip inside does quite
a bit to analyze each shot and make adjustments based on that. Now, while the days of the
iPhone having far and away the best camera on a smartphone are over, you really won't be
disappointed with what you get out of the X. Portrait mode makes a
return here and it's solid. If you look closely, you
can see where the camera doesn't perfectly cut you out
of the background sometimes but for the most part it does a good job. You can now also take portrait selfies. These rely on good light with
pretty optimal conditions, but when done right they can
really make the front-facing camera look a lot more expensive. The problem is that
while decent in a vacuum, I really prefer the way that
the Pixel 2 handles these, which you guys can check
out in my full comparison. Portrait mode is handled
well on the iPhone X, but there's room for improvement. As a guy who shoots a bit
of video, I have to say, the iPhone X is about as good as a smartphone gets right now. It shoots 4K at 24, 30,
or 60 frames per second and I have absolutely no
complaints about the quality. Stabilization is terrific,
color is nicely saturated, dynamic range is good, and
the auto-focus and exposure generally do a great job. You also get solid 1080p
240 frames per second slow motion options as well
as the still impressive built-in time lapse mode. Put it all together and it
is hard to be disappointed with the iPhone X camera. And that really is the
story of this phone. While battery life isn't
quite as good as on the 8 Plus, it's still significantly
better than previous iPhones and for me it was really no
problem to make it through a full day of use. When Apple announced a $1,000
price tag for the iPhone X, they pretty much threw down the gauntlet. If this phone wasn't incredible, there was no way that
it would be worth it. But it kind of is. (light upbeat electronic music) 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Google Pixel 2
and this is the Pixel 2 XL, but the question is are they worth it? There's a lot new this
year, but one of the biggest differences is in price. So the Pixel 2 is going to cost you $650, but bump up to the Pixel
2 XL and it is $850. Want 128 gigs of storage? Then this guy's going to cost you $950. Jump inside the box and
there's actually a fair bit that comes with the Pixel 2. So the first thing we'll
find is the actual smart phone itself, but beyond that, get a little bit deeper,
we get a "Yay welcome to #TeamPixel" bit, which I'm
sure has all our paperwork, SIM tool, that kind of thing. There's also a USB-C to USB-A adapter, we get what looks to be a
whole bunch of extra cables! Oh boy. When Google announced the
original Pixel last year, something they were
really big on is the idea that it still has the headphone jack. Now fast forward to the Pixel
2 and it's nowhere to be seen. Now I get the idea that by
dropping the headphone jack, you're going to free up
more space inside the phone for sensors or batteries, or whatever, but the problem is,
unless you're fully on the Bluetooth headphone train, USB-C is a bit of a mess right now. Say what you will about Apple
dropping the headphone jack last year, but at the
very least there are some decent Lightning headphone
options available. On the Pixel, you're pretty
much limited to either using the adapter that comes in the box, or a very limited selection
of USB-C headphones. It's not all bad with
the Pixel 2 hardware, so while yes, it does look
fairly similar to the last generation, including
the pretty large bezels, but in return, we're now
getting IP67 water resistance, as well as some pretty solid
front firing stereo speakers. Move over to the Pixel 2
XL, and it is a surprisingly large change. So up front, it's rocking
a six inch AMOLED display, and while I wouldn't call it bezel-less, the bezels are a lot thinner
than on the standard Pixel 2. Even though the Pixel 2 is made by HTC and the XL is made by LG,
the hardware is very similar. So they're both still
rocking a two-tone design and while it looks nice,
I actually do definitely prefer the way that the
original Pixel looked with the very blue
color, because you know, yeah, I want all my smart
phones to look like this. Even though this is a
glass and metal phone, the metal part actually has
this sort of coating on it, which kind of feels like plastic. Now if you check out
JerryRigEverything's durability test of the Pixel 2, you'll
see that this coating is not particularly durable. I actually kind of like the
way that the Pixel 2 feels, but multiple people who've
tried it immediately thought that it was made out of plastic, so take that for what it's worth. Take a look at it in Geekbench, and while it's fast, it is
absolutely no match for the Apple A10X in the iPhone 8, however, thankfully benchmarks aren't everything. What stuff like Geekbench
doesn't get across is that this is an
incredibly snappy phone. Animations are smooth, the
responsiveness is quick, and it always feels
like it's one step ahead of what you actually wanna do. Honestly, this is one of
the fastest Android phones I've tested and it is right
up there with the iPhone 8. Part of that is thanks to
an incredibly clean build of Android 8.0 Oreo. So there are some custom features, including Google Lens,
and this is actually built inside Google Photos, it
would be nice to see it in the camera app, but what
it's allowing you to do is scan a photo and try
to figure out what it is. For some things it's not that accurate, but for others, it is surprisingly good. Although just not that useful to me. What's a little cooler is Now Playing, now once you enable this,
essentially the phone will always be listening for music and if it detects it,
it will actually give you a notification. This is kind of creepy, but
it works surprisingly well, especially if you're in
something like a restaurant, you might be able to
actually pick up the song that's being played over the stereo. The Pixel 2 also has a squeezable frame, so if you actually squeeze
it on the bottom half, it will trigger Google Assistant. So, what does the fox say? - [Assistant] Ring ding
ding ding ding a ding and wop pop pop pop pop pa pow, or so I've heard. (laughs) Roll a 20 sided die. - [Assistant] You got it. (die hits table) It's a 19. - Flip a coin. - [Assistant] Okay. (coin lands on table) You got tails. - However, not everything is perfect. Some of my biggest issues with
the Pixel 2 is the display. So on the standard size
Pixel 2, it's fine. It's a five inch AMOLED panel
with a 1080p resolution. Yes it could be a little bit sharper, and the bezels could be a lot smaller, but it's totally usable. However, when it comes to the Pixel 2 XL, that display is garbage town. I mean it. Garbage town. Garbage town. This reminds me of really
early AMOLED panels from years ago. When you're looking at it
straight on, it's okay, although honestly a lot of the colors, like especially the
reds look awfully brown, but as soon as you move it
even a little bit off axis, it goes super, super cool. This is okay on a cheap smart phone, but when you're charging
$850, it's basically a deal breaker. It really is a shame,
because the Pixel XL 2 should be able to compete
with stuff like the iPhone and the Galaxy Note 8, but right now, the screen holds it back,
which to me actually makes the normal Pixel 2 a much easier sell. Yes, it has the much larger bezels, but to my eye, is a way better screen, and it's the phone that I've been using the last few days. Thankfully the giant bezels of the Pixel 2 don't go to waste. It does have some very nice
sounding front firing speakers, those pretty much blows
away any other flagship that's out today, with
really the only exception being the iPhone 8. And to my ears, they sound very similar, way better than pretty much anything else you can get right now. One of the biggest upgrades on the Pixel 2 is that 12 megapixel camera. Now that might not sound impressive, but these are some of the
best smart phone images I've ever gotten period. Some of the stuff is really crazy. There is a ton of detail on these images, and they've actually
done a really good job of getting even more dynamic
range than most of the already great flagships
that you can buy in 2017. Color is also good, maybe
not quite as saturated as some Samsung phones, but
the low-light performance has seen a huge bump up on the Pixel. Now a part of that is
because they finally added optical image stabilization,
and that paired with their awesome image processing
means that you can get some surprisingly usable
shots in very low light. The portrait mode is also
really good on the Pixel, so while it doesn't have any
kind of dual camera setup, using software, they're
actually able to get a very similar sort of result, and the upside is this also works with the selfies. Now the Pixel 2 does shoot 4K video, and you guys can actually
look to see and hear what that sounds like right now, but as far as I'm concerned,
this is one of the best smart phone cameras that
you can buy right now. Although if you're using a Pixel 2 XL, taking a look at these pictures on screen might not give you too much confidence, but believe me, the colors
and the image quality is absolutely there. Last year's Pixel was
a very, very good phone with a couple of major compromises. This year, Google basically
nailed it, almost. You might not mind the
screen on the Pixel 2 XL, but it is just simply
not in the same league as other flagships, and
when you're paying $850, you should expect the best in everything. I really like the standard Pixel 2. Yes, the screen is a little bit small, and the bezels are big,
but the rest of the phone is so good that it's kind of worth it. It is absolutely one of
the best smart phones that you can buy. So what do you guys
think about the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin! This might seem like a weird comparison, but there are a lot of reasons why you might wanna consider picking up an Xbox 360 or a PS3 in 2017. It might seem obvious to
pick up a PS4 or Xbox One, but not only are they both way more expensive than these guys, but they also lack true
backwards compatibility. So the Xbox One comes closest, as it does support some Xbox 360 titles, but the issue is, not only
is it not the full library, but you still have to
actually download the games, even if you do have the 360 disks. If you have a slow Internet connection, that could take a while. The PS4 is even worse. Now, technically, you
can play some PS3 games using PlayStation Now, but not
only do you have to buy that and pay for it every month,
but it's also streaming. It is really not the same as playing it on the native consoles. These are the final
editions of the consoles. One of the nice things about
having such a long lifecycle was that there were
not only three editions of both the PS3 as well as the 360, but there were also years
and years of great games, and they're actually both still supported with a lot of their online services. This is the Xbox 360 E. It came out in 2013, and while it was a pretty minor
improvement over the Slim, mostly it was just a little bit smaller and dropped a USB port, but it is still the full 360 package. The PlayStation 3 Super
Slim, on the other hand, is a noticeably cheaper
version of the original PS3. Now, to be fair, it is quite a bit smaller and was a bit cheaper, but the issue was, instead of having a
slot-loaded Blu-ray drive, instead it has this cheap feeling door. It just doesn't feel like quality or sound like quality. While by today's standards,
the hardware isn't amazing, it's easy to forget that these consoles really were the first ways that a lot of people
experienced HD gaming. If you never tried the PS3 or Xbox 360, you were missing out on
a ton of amazing games. The nice thing is these
are incredibly cheap today. So if you wanna pick up a
used 40-gigabyte fat PS3, it's only going to cost
you about 60 dollars. Sure, it's going to be
big and a little bit loud. However, when you consider
that the Super Slim with a 12-gig drive is about 100 dollars, 60 bucks looks like a great deal. The 360 is also pretty reasonable. So you can pick up a 4-gigabyte
360 E for about 80 dollars or what's a much better idea is to pick up something
like this 250-gig version which is only going to cost you about 100 and is way more usable. What's easy to forget is that you can pick up
an entire stack of games for these consoles for really cheap. So, games like Rise of the Tomb
Raider are about 20 dollars. You can pick up Red
Dead Redemption for 15, Forza Horizon for 10, and real classics like
Modern Warfare 1 for seven, and Halo 4 for five dollars. There is crazy, crazy value
in getting a last gen console. The real question here is what is it like to use an
Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2017? First off, we have the Xbox 360. This interface is a lot
better than it used to be. So, you can go through
all the different apps and music and games and
whatnot, but more importantly, it is much, much faster than
the stupid Blade interface that it launched with back in 2005. There actually have been
a lot of major revisions to the Xbox 360, but where it's at now is
actually pretty decent. One nice thing about the 360
is that it still supports most of the major video apps. So, there are a couple
missing, but for the most part, you have all the basics
like Netflix and YouTube. There's Hulu, Amazon, Twitch. Look at the crispy HD video
from Mr. Jimmy Champane who may or may not be
editing this video right now and is probably putting an
obnoxiously large call-out to his channel on the screen right now. So, here we have Gears of War 3. Now, this is a game that, well yes, it looks a little bit dated
compared to modern standards, is really impressive, considering that this is running on a console that came out in 2005. Now, look at the light effects here. This looks really good
for an Xbox 360 game. Next, we have the original Forza Horizon. This is another game that I feel like runs way better than it should,
considering the hardware. Yes, it doesn't match
up to Forza Horizon 3 running on the Xbox One or PC,
but it's still a lot of fun. I feel like these are some of the best open-world racing games ever. To be fair, a lot of these
games, including Forza Horizon, is actually going to
be backwards compatible on the Xbox One. They look fairly similar, but there's definitely something nice about playing these games
on the original hardware. Next, we have Rise of the Tomb Raider. This was one of the last major AAA games that came out for the Xbox 360, and it holds up surprisingly well. Seriously, it doesn't look quite as good as something like falling down a mountain or quick time events, but it actually holds up reasonably well compared to something like a PC or PS4. Next, we have the PS3. One of my favorite parts of
this console was always the XMB. Not only is it super fast, you can fly through admittedly
a lot of different menus, but one of the cool things
is, it's all natively 1080p. So, a lot of the Xbox 360
stuff is actually 720, that's upscale. As far as games on the PS3,
first we have Gran Turismo 6. It's weird to think that this is the most recent Gran Turismo. However, it looks decent. It might not be quite as
nice looking as Forza, but it's hard to argue with the physics and just how nice this
game feels to drive. Next, we have The Last of Us. Not only is this one of
the best games for the PS3, but it is one of my favorite games ever. It really does go to
show what they were able to pull out of the PS3. I know I keep saying this, that "Oh, look, the graphics look better "than you would expect," but this is really one of those cases where you can really see that they pulled every little
bit of power out of the PS3. A big reason for this
was the Cell processor. Now, it made the PS3 very powerful, but it also made it really difficult to actually take advantage of that power because it was so different, which is why some games
don't look so great on PS3, but exclusives like this can actually look really impressive. Thanks to the power of the Internet, both the PS3 and 360 are
surprisingly usable today, and if you missed out
on the full decade worth of amazing games for these consoles, it's pretty cheap to pick it up. You should give it a try. So, what do you guys think
about these consoles in 2017? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin and today I'm here at CES with NVIDIA about to take a look at GeForce NOW. So not only were they awesome
enough to sponsor this video, but if you guys caught my
video a couple of months ago where I took a look at
GeForce NOW for the Mac you'll know that it
actually works pretty well. So in that video I was
using a 2009 MacBook I got for 200 dollars on eBay and playing proper PC games using the internet game stream tech. Which sounds really exciting and fancy. Now, not only is that still around but today we're actually able
to also play now on the PC. One of the big advantages of GeForce NOW is that you can play games on hardware that you normally couldn't. So take for example, this. This is the HP Stream and
it's a 200 dollar laptop. I've actually done a video
on this a little while back. And while it's not a bad computer, gaming is definitely not its strong suit. Since this is cloud gaming we are relying on having a decent internet connection. So this guy is going to be hardwired in. But beyond that, the requirements
actually aren't too crazy. In addition to GeForce NOW
being available for the PC there are also now some
Uplay games available which is why I'm playing Rainbow Six. Ah, Oh, Okay that's not good. This is a lot of fun. Something I'm noticing
here is that the latency really just is not that bad. Even when I'm getting into gunfights Main thing that kills me is uh you know, my expert skills. One of the nice parts about this is that because we are
playing via the cloud we're actually able to crank
the settings up pretty high. So I'm curious where are we
actually running at right now. Running at very high settings
on a Tesla P40 because you know, that's exactly what I want to
play on my 200 dollar laptop. Since I did my last video,
GeForce NOW has seen some updates including there's now an
actual search function. So if you want to look for a
specific game, you can do that and what's even more exciting is there's now an ultra streaming mode. The idea here is that in the cloud the game is going to be running
at 120 frames per second and then you're going to still get a 60 frame per second
feed to your computer. The idea is, is that will help
to cut down on some latency. Now it's not supported on all games. One game that is supported is Fortnite. Something interesting
here is we're playing on a slightly higher end computer. So this is like a standard Ultrabook and while it has a nicer screen
which is definitely helpful, the actual experience of playing the game should be the exact same. So like five seconds in,
I can tell that this is actually a slightly smoother experience. So, while there's very
little latency on this side having the game run at 120Hz even though I don't
actually have a 120Hz panel just does cut down latency
ever that much more. Also, I deployed my
parachute way too early. (laughs) And actually what's interesting is, so we're in Las Vegas right now. The actual server we're playing
this on is in Los Angeles, which is a few hundred miles away. Next we have PUBG which is the most popular
game on GeForce NOW and well, basically everywhere else. So the demo here is we have two
identical 400 dollar laptops one running the game natively at a slightly less than optimal
two frames per second on low and the other running
the game at full 1080p 60 on well, GeForce NOW. So, what's kind of interesting and something very helpful
that Nvidia has provided is a full chart showing the
performance gains you can expect when you stop using the integrated
graphics on your laptop. As you can see, these
numbers are much higher. Look, I don't have to do this. This is something that I don't need to do, but I'm going to try to play
PUBG at two frames per second. Because I don't have a really
good reason actually. I'm just going to try it. So, really impressive
experience I got to say. The graphics are unrivaled
and the frame rate is what some would call buttery-smooth. I mean, there's less than
probably five seconds of latency between when I hit a button and when I actually see my
character move on screen. If I stop There he stops. Anyway, I'm going to
move on to GeForce NOW. I think that's... For real though, this is a great demo of what makes GeForce
NOW really interesting. The idea that with a 400 dollar laptop that has pretty low end internals, I mean, this is like a Pentium, that's able to play games like PUBG at a really nice and smooth frame rate. Obviously, you need a
good internet connection, but almost it even makes
more sense with PUBG because you need a good
internet connection to play it, anyway. Odds are if you're
going to be playing this you're going to have
an internet connection that's going to be
decent enough to actually be able to stream the game. I mean, PUBG is maybe not
the greatest looking game in the world, but especially
the last few patches really have made it look nice. And the desert map, actually,
looks pretty decent. Although I know nothing about
where anything is right now. Oh, oh, hello, hello, hello. Nope, nope you don't! Yeah, there we go. I got one kill. I feel very proud and accomplished that I caught a guy as he
was running out of a building and successfully got him. Okay. So, while the GeForce NOW beta for Mac has been out for a few months. It is now available for
PC and it is still free. At least until Nvidia
comes to their senses. Now the cool thing is
that if you were already on the Mac beta you can
get on this immediately, but if you haven't tried it at all yet you can get on the wait list and they're going to be
adding more people every week. So, if you guys have not tried this it is definitely worth a look, but what do you guys
think about GeForce NOW? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin, and today we're here for
the LG UltraWide Festival. Of course, big shoutout to LG for sponsoring this video. And you're mouthing what I'm saying the entire time aren't you? (laughing) - No. - [Austin] After hundreds of entries, Linus and I narrowed it
down to three finalists: Taylor, Zach, and John. They each have a budget of $2,000 to build a gaming PC setup to go along with the LG
34UC89G UltraWide monitor, and the winner gets a $10,000 grand prize. What's the deal with the parts, right? So you went with the Mini ITX system. - [Taylor] I went with
the Mini ITX system. This case is really beautiful. - [Austin] Actually, I've not built anything in the Manta. - [Taylor] I have not either, it's gonna be exciting. - [Austin] It looks nice. So you're also going, obviously, you've got the Z270I. You've got the Core I7, but you're able to fit a
1080ti in the $2,000 budget. - Yes. - [Austin] With that i7 7700K, paired with a GTX 1080ti, 16 gigs of RGB-fied RAM and a 250 gig SSD, Taylor's got a pretty well
rounded small form factor build. Next, we're here with Zachary. Now you picked a very
different style of computer. So what are you planning on doing with it? - Well I wanted to focus
more on immersive game play. - Immersive gameplay? - Yes. - Okay, well you definitely
went a lot higher end on the accessories. You spent probably what, like 150 bucks or so on accessories? - Yeah, 170. - 170. So you put in a decent-- - Well technically a
little bit more than that. - Technically? What do you mean technically? - Well I bought something else. - What's the something else? - It's the secret weapon. - I don't think anyone's
getting anything close to this, but I'm curious? Okay, so you have a B250 motherboard, but you have an unlocked Core i7. Is there some reasoning behind that? - Well there's a big reason for that. - Okay. - I'm just stupid. - Wrong motherboard aside, while Zach is rocking
much better accessories to go with the ultra wide monitor, he's taking a serious
hit with only a GTX 1080, as well as spending a
big chunk of his budget on a 480 gig SSD. Next where here with John,
and you actually picked out a little bit of a different system. So what's the main thing
you wanna do with this? - I want to make 3D animation videos. - Okay. - Yes, and maybe a little bit of gaming. - Okay, gotcha, so it's a little bit more on the content creation side of things? - Yes. - Here, John's also got a i7 7700K paired with a GTX 1080ti, but he also stepped it up
with matching RGB accessories, even including a headset. For $2000, you should be able to build a pretty solid gaming system, and at first glance
everyone has solid parts, but part of the challenge
is actually building them and tuning them in a single afternoon to work with that ultra wide monitor. Three.
- One, two. - What?! It's three, two, one. We just said three, two, one. - Okay, so three, two, one, go? Or three, two, one? - Three, two, one, and then you go on go. - Okay. - Alright, everybody ready? - [Both] Three, two, one, start. - Oh my god! - So is the headband giving you the power to complete the build faster? (grunts) Is it that manly power
that you don't even need to use your words to just brute force it?
- I just thought it was cool. (laughing) - It does look cool. What? - Yeah, seriously. - Wait.
Hold on, hold on. - It's really bad. - Whoa. That is crazy. Yeah, so you can see those
pins are definitely bent there. Actually, there's a
couple over here as well. What do you think? Cause I don't think there's
any easy way of fixing this, at all. Do you have another? Look at this. That's totally fair. Like this is not your fault that you got a busted motherboard. Of course not. After about an hour or so of building, the system's are coming along nicely. Hey! Dude, good job. Alright, so you're
actually the first person to get a system up and running. LOL, you suck. - Okay, try again. (laughing) - Alright, pair it up. - Alright, well one fan's not spinning. Graphics card looks like it's... - Whaap whaap. - Because he actually had
to sway out the motherboard, it's probably not POSTing,
because there's a Kaby Lake CPU in here and it's really
looking for Skylake. So, if we have a BIOS update
that will probably fix it, but it's going to set you back. This is kind of a tough one. Alright, so your system is done. Do you have anything else to do, besides overclocking right now? - No. Put it on the glass. That's about it. - Well it POSTs, so that's a big improvement
over Taylor's machine. - Besides the secret weapon,
which I'm sure will be 100% figured out by the time
that we're actually ready, you have everything installed? - Yes. - Okay, so now it's going
to basically come down to, since you can't overclock the CPU, you're gonna try to get as
much as you can outta the 1080. - Yep. - Alright, so everyone's basically buttoning up their systems now. It looks like you're just doing the final bit of cable management? - No I gotta get this RAM reseated that wasn't seated properly. - So you're actually
only at eight gigs of RAM that's showing up right now? - Yes. - Okay, got it. So you feel, like it's just
going to need to be reseated? - Yeah. - Alright, so we are almost done. Everyone has their systems setup, and now it's just the final stuff, like making sure all the
benchmarks are setup, doing the overclocking, tweaking all the last minute
little lighting stuff, cables, all that kinda thing. The first test is gonna be Cinebench. - Cinebench! Now they all have the same CPU. - Yes. But overclocking is going
to be very different. - Or. - Or is it? - Nonexistant. Gentlemen, start your, yeah okay. - Let's just do three, two, one. - Yeah, three, two, one, two. - [Man] When are you going? Go?
- Okay, go, go. Just go.
- Start. - Go.
Everyone go. - [Austin] So you're at five Gigahertz. - [Linus] Five gigahertz overclock on that little Cryorig cooler, very nice. - [Austin] That's really impressive. So the next test is going to be 3DMark, which is going to be testing
their GPU performance. So, are you guys ready? Alright, three, two, one, start. - [Linus] Alright so we've
got our Time Spy benchmarks, basically John's card is
a little more overclocked and/or margin of error of the test, but he takes this one by a hair. So for Ghost Recon, we're
running at the native resolution of these monitors; that's 2560x1080 and we're
using the ultra preset, because we figure for two grand you should be having a pretty,
ultra gaming experience. Now one of the things that
we're gonna be looking for is not just being able to run the game, but being able to run it at a frame rate where you're gonna be taking advantage of these high refresh rate monitors. - [Austin] 65.7, 65.9, and 53.4. - [Linus] Okay. - [Austin] You guys basically tied. With benchmark results in
hand, Linus and I stepped away to discuss what we though
about the competition so far. I feel like right now, Zack
is kinda not looking so great. I feel like he's got
the wrong motherboard. There are some fairly major issues. I'm not a huge fan of the idea that he spent so much on
the SSD, and with some of the other stuff where
he skimped on things like the 1080 as opposed to a 1080ti. - Him having the worst
graphics card out of everyone for a gaming setup, is... - It's a problem. - Pretty tough. - And the motherboard,
that's a huge problem, cause he got a very expensive motherboard, but it's still not
overclocking compatible. I think it looks nice. The complete system's going to look solid, but that's a big, big problem, which I guess brings us to Taylor. So Taylor had a huge disadvantage in the fact that he got a broken
motherboard out of the box. So we're not gonna dock
him points for that, I mean, I'm not. I think I like his build. I like the idea he's
going small form factor. I think it's going to match
pretty well with the monitor. - Well he had a rationale
behind everything. He's like, "Yeah I chose like
a case with curved side panels to match the curved monitor". "And I chose a black and red
case to match the monitor." And it feels a little kiss ass to me. - I mean the rules were
that you had to get a system to go along with the setup. I don't think we can penalize him for trying to make
something inside the rules. What do you think about John so far? - John? Everything's going smoothly over there. I don't disagree with any
of his hardware choices. I think his is, in a vacuum,
the best balanced machine on the table. - I tentatively agree with that. - So third place is... Zachary. You fought hard. The scores were super close actually. - It was actually, we basically
agreed on almost everything. - Yep, but I think.. - The performance hurt. - The performance hurt you. The good news is that you come out of this with a wicked awesome gaming rig. - Absolutely. - And hopefully you had fun today. - I did. - I think before we announce the winner, we agreed on basically every category. I think we were pretty
much on the same page. You guys all did really well. - It was way close. John you took it home. - Wonderful. - And Taylor, you fought hard
and you were a lot of fun to hang out with today. You were okay too. - Alright, and of course, the best piece. - Austin you get to do the check. Do the check, Austin. - Oh the check. This is, this is what it feels like. - I mean it's not a check. Doesn't even really look like a check. - You actually can't go cash this. - You can't cash that. - We're gonna try anyways. - [Man] They're gonna
laugh you outta the bank. - Is this 21x9? - So of course, huge shout out to LG for
sponsoring the video, and inviting us out to sort of
host the Ultra Wide Festival. And let us know what you guys
think about the whole thing. Actually would like to do more. And you're gonna just keep
doing that, aren't you? You know, I'm glad the video's over. I can finally go home. 
- Hey you guys, this is Austin, and this is one of the thinnest and most powerful laptops you can buy. This is the HP Spectre x360, and huge shoutout to HP for
sponsoring this video. So if we open up the second box, which I've gotta say is
actually really nicely done, we have the laptop itself! I'm actually curious,
is this real aluminum? It looks like it. Oh yeah, that's real metal. I actually like the brushed
metal finish on the side here. The entire laptop feels very sturdy considering how thin it is. Also included in the box
is the HP Active Stylus. The idea here is that not only do you have the sort of flexibility that you get with being able to flip the screen around, but also it does have
what hopefully should be a pretty decent stylus
that comes in the box. I really do like the
way this computer looks. Having an aluminum chassis
and pretty much aluminum everywhere you look and touch feels nice. Also having something like
a glass trackpad really does make it feel like a much
more premium product. In addition to the pair
of Thunderbolt 3 ports, you also have a fingerprint
sensor on the side. You've got the volume rocker, and on the flip side, not only do we have a standard full-size USB port, but you also get the headphone jack, power button, as well
as a microSD card slot. This really is thin! Something that keeps
jumping out to me is that the thickest part of the chassis
is only barely thick enough to actually support a full-size USB port. The new Spectre x360 starts at $1150, but the model I have here is $1250 and comes with a Core i7-8550U, eight gigabytes of RAM, and a 256 gig SSD. Because this guy's running
the new 8th-gen processors, it really does transform it
from being a normal Ultrabook to something that feels a lot faster. One of my big issues with
previous thin and light laptops was that while they
had great battery life, the performance was just decent. However, with these new 8th-gen processors that have a quad-core chip inside, it actually makes a huge difference to how fast these things feel, especially when you're doing
stuff like heavy multitasking, it absolutely can keep up with a desktop. But you're still
getting the great battery life that you would expect out of an Ultrabook. You can absolutely see
that in the benchmarks. In Geekbench, not only does
this completely destroy last generation Core i5s and i7s, but really it's just not that far off from higher-end gaming
laptops as well as desktops. If you need even more, this guy's available
with up to 16 gigs of RAM and a one terabyte SSD. And if you opt for the 15-inch
version of the x360, it also has dedicated
NVIDIA MX150 graphics. This version of the
Spectre x360 comes with a 13.3-inch 1080p IPS display
covered in Gorilla Glass, but there is also a 4K option. Now I'm sure the 4K looks great, but I've actually gotta say
the 1080p is not bad either. Personally, especially
on a 13-inch laptop, I kind of prefer 1080p
as a nice sweet spot between screen resolution
as well as battery life. As far as the battery goes, the x360 has a 60-watt hour battery which combined with the 8th-gen
processor and 1080p display, means that getting
through a full day of use without the charger
shouldn't be too difficult. So HP claims that you can get up to 16 hours of battery on a charge. That combined with the
fast-charging power adapter means the battery life really
isn't a problem with this guy. When it comes to a Windows 10 laptop, a touchscreen really is the way to go. A lot of the time I use
the keyboard and trackpad, but so often, it's just
helpful to be able to reach up and touch the screen. Now because this is the
x360 version of the Spectre, we also have a fully adjustable display. So we can flip it around
to use it in display mode, you also can flip it upside
down and use it in tent mode, and because this is such
a thin and light laptop, you can use it in tablet mode. Most of the time when it
comes to a 13-inch laptop, a tablet mode isn't too useful, but because this guy is so thin and light, it actually works pretty well here. That is especially helpful
when you use the HP Pen. I am by no means an artist, but I've gotta say that
doodling with the pen is actually pretty fun. Of course, you can use
it for more serious stuff than coloring... I mean sketching. Stuff like notes would
be really helpful here. It's definitely a nice thing
to have included with a laptop. The rest of the input
is pretty good as well. The keyboard has great travel, it has good spacing. I like the back-lighting. The only thing that
slightly tripped me up was the Home, Page Up, and Page Down keys on the right side of the keyboard, but once I got used to
that, it's no problem. Now the trackpad is decent. So hardware-wise, it
does have a glass surface and the tracking is pretty smooth, however the problem is it doesn't have Windows Precision drivers. Something that really jumps
out to me is the audio. Now this has a set of
Bang and Olufsen speakers. A lot of the time branding doesn't make a huge difference on a laptop, but this guy is rocking a
full-force speaker setup. ("Native Son Prequel" by Gramatik
featuring Orlando Napier) Dude! That is really good! So not only is there a fair bit of bass, but there's just a ton of volume, and it really doesn't distort either. The Spectre also has a 1080p webcam. Now you guys can judge the
quality for yourselves. I think it's fine for a video call, but you probably won't want to start a new YouTube channel with it. The Spectre has support for Windows Hello with both a fingerprint sensor as well as an IR camera
for facial recognition. I actually really do like
the fingerprint sensor, and while it is a little
bit odd to have it on the side of the device, it's much preferable to not having a fingerprint sensor at all, you know, like a certain
$1000 phone or something. With Windows 10 on board, there's also Cortana support. (Cortana powering up) What is the meaning of life? (Cortana powering up) - [Cortana] I've heard
from a reliable source that the answer is 42. - I've liked portable
laptops like the Spectre x360 for a long time, but now that you can get quad-core power while still
keeping the battery life, it makes them so, so much more attractive. Again, big shout-out to HP for
making this video possible. If you guys want to check
out this Spectre X360, the link will be in the description. You should also check out

where you can find some of the latest and greatest
unboxings this holiday season. Anyway, guys, thank you
so much for watching and I will catch you on the next one! 
- Hey guys, this is Austin, and today we're going to find out,
is the Tesla Model 3 worth it? Hey, are you famous YouTuber
Jake Roper from Vsauce3 and Beme? - No, I'm Michael Cera. - Alright let's go drive the car, let's go drive the car. - You didn't hug me back! - So it is time to drive the Model 3. So you've had this for how long? - I've had this for four days. - So we're on Angeles Crest
which is one of my favorite roads anywhere, this
feels pretty good, there's a lot of regenerative
breaking, that's always something when I get in an electric car I let off and you're basically
dragging on the brakes. - It helps you drift. How does it handle these curves? - I'm not going fast yet but
it feels pretty responsive. You're not used to being a passenger. - No I'm not. - I'm not even starting yet. So you can imagine that
there will be more models later on but this is the
long range battery with the standard rear-wheel drive, right? - Yeah. - So I'm assuming that the
all-wheel drive would be even faster, although
probably a little heavier maybe, with the motor up front. - Yeah but it will be
faster, I mean you can see that with all of Tesla's
cars, between the 85 and then the 85D, you
did get about a second of extra acceleration from
zero to 60 with the D. - Right you just have
all that extra, and also you have two motors. - You get two motors and
you also get more range. - So what brought you to the
Model 3, cause you have a Model S now, right? - So I do, well by the end
of this week I will not have a Model S anymore. - Oh so you're getting rid of it. - I'm getting rid of it,
there's a few reasons. The Model S is a wonderful
car but it's very large, it's also very expensive,
this car is about half the price of my Model S
and to me I can't notice too much of a difference
in terms of fit and finish in the feel of it, I prefer
this one more actually. - When I drove the Model
S on this road it was fun and you could tell that
electric torque is right there immediately, but the
problem was it's heavy, it weighs like 1,000
pounds more than this. - But the thing that
blows my mind is how well it turns, cause I thought
the Model S turned really well, but this one, it's
just, I keep saying the word tight, it's just so tight how it turns. - I heard that some people
have complained about the ride so we drove up from downtown
LA with this and on some of the bumps it's a little stiff. - And kind of what I was
telling you, my Model S has air suspension, this one has spring, so it definitely is more stiff and more, you feel the road more
but it's not a huge deal. - Ready? - Do it. (laughs) - Oh man. - Oh man. - Holy smokes, you went all
the way up to forty-five. - Shh, you can't say that on camera. - I'm sorry, you went all
the way up to a nice number. - So that's one of the nice
things about an electric car, it just punches you,
we're going like 40 miles and hour and you roll into
it and it puts you right back in your seat. - It's immediate. - I noticed as we got to
slightly higher speeds, it did kind of give out a
little bit, you can tell it's meant for getting on
the freeway versus blasting down the Autobahn but it
still definitely picks up. - That's why they really only give you the zero to 60 number. - Right, that's the thing
though, this is such an early build of the car, it does
feel like it's a little bit of a beta, not everything is complete, you were saying that the FM
radio was just added, right? - FM radio was just added,
auto wipers were just added as I'm filming this
yesterday, with this car you can only get the
premium model at the moment so it comes with heated rear
seats which have not been turned on yet. - Wait, wait, wait, you're
trying to say that this has heated seats that you
cannot turn on because it needs a software update? - Yes, but only in the back
seats, the front seats work. - This is a higher specced
up model, the MSRP is 55? - This was 55,000, out the
door but then it's also $1,000 document and transportation fee. - Sure, so it's 56,000 in total. - Excluding tax but
then you get the $7,500 tax credit and then in California
at least and it depends on your state, you get a
$2,500 rebate, so you save $10,000 by buying this car. - Which is a lot of money. - How does it compare to your car, 'cause you have a very sporty Audi? - I have an Audi RS 3
which is a little bit more on the sporty side,
it's faster, I will say but this feels a little
bit like, what's scary about this is the speed seems way way less because it's quiet, we were
just doing a reasonably high speed and it just
feels like I'm driving down the road so it's like,
in that car that I have, you hear everything, you
hear the motor, you hear the turbos, you hear the
exhaust, this is a much more calm and serene experience,
so this is not something that I want to go to the
track and abuse for six hours. - Besides the acceleration
and what have you, what is the handling like
compared to your Audi? - It's good, I think with
a more aggressive tire we could be pushing it a lot
more, oh here's my tunnel, we'll forward through it anyway, ready. Warp speed! Now just spending a couple
minutes with the model three, something that's
immediately jumped out to me is there're a lot of really
interesting quirks with this. Now the first thing actually
you pointed this one out, the wheels, they actually
come off or at least the arrow part. - The arrow wheel cover can pop off, so we can just do, I'm
gonna use my muscles, oh they don't exist. - I got you. - There we go. - The idea is that this
is going to help with the aerodynamics, right,
but I actually kind of like the wheel that's inside,
I actually didn't realize this was a thing. - It's not bad if you get
a Tesla center cap there, and maybe some lug nuts
that match the color, that's totally fine. - Looks good. Now like a lot of modern
Teslas, there are cameras all over the place, so just
on one side you can see that there's a little camera to look back behind I guess for
traffic over on this side, do you actually know how
many cameras there are, 'cause there's another one up here. - There's here you have
there, then you have some up front, you also
have radar and sonar, then you have the same on the other side then you have the camera on the back, all really they give you
a complete picture of what the car is seeing when it
does it's machine learning for actual automated driving. - So all model threes
come with the autopilot hardware preinstalled, so
basically the difference is you have to pay to
unlock it, so essentially it's a $5,000 upgrade? - I believe it's 5,000 for
autopilot and then they have full self driving which is another 3,000. - But that's not out yet. - That's not out yet. - But the idea is that if
you basically pay for some software updates, it has all the hardware to essentially be pretty
much fully self driving. - Oh yeah. - So as soon as I saw
this car, one of the first things that jumped out to
me were the door handles. So the model S, they actually
pop out, with this one, you actually have to press your thumb in and then grab the handle
like that, it's a little weird, it's not quite what I would expect. - I feel like you get
used to it right away. So it's like boom, boom! - There's actually a surprising
amount of room back here, look at this you have your
wonderful window sticker. - I like to show that off to people. - So this is for on the
go charging if you don't want to buy an actual EV
unit, or Tesla's chargers, this one you just plug into the wall. - You have the adapters. - 120 volt, and then this
is the 250 volt adapter, so you plug it in and
it charges with this. - So here you have your
charging port on on the X and the S it's also
hidden behind one of these guys but this wouldn't
open, you push in, ooh, comes out and then the colors
adjust depending on whether you're charging or not, so
that's pretty nice, and then you just tap it to close. - Can you actually control
that from the screen inside? - You can actually control
it from your phone. - Of course, naturally. - So it does come with these things, I actually should show
you, so this is what the key looks like. - So it looks just like
a hotel key or something. - Yeah it's like a credit
card, so you can use that to unlock the car and start it, or you can use your phone. - Most everything on
this car is controlled via Bluetooth on the app, right? - Pretty much, you can
adjust, you can do most things in the car as well. - I really like the way
the model three looks from the front although that is not big, wow. So this is still the rear
wheel drive one, so figure that there's not a lot of space in here, I wonder if they actually
go all wheel drive there's gonna be even less space. - The nice thing too is
you can have little holders for your groceries right
there, it's clever. - Pretty sure you're gonna
fit two grocery bags. - And a small child. - So the interesting
things about this car, is the screen, because
that's basically where you control literally everything. - Yep, that's all there is. - But you can do, to be fair you can do basically everything, so you have climate control,
you have heated seats on the bottom, you have
your nav screen here and you have pretty much
all the main controls from the car that you would normally see in your guage cluster. - Yup. And then you would also
have, you can go more into different apps so you
have music right there, but you can bring it
all the way up like that and they have radio,
streaming, tune in, all that stuff and then you adjust
all your settings there. - Something I'm noticing is, this is really quick and responsive. - Oh yeah, it's super fast. - One thing that I think a
lot of people are wondering about and this is something
when I first drove in it as well, was something that
was like oh not so sure, is having all of your speed
and everything all on this side but it's not actually
that annoying, I feel like you can get used to having your spedometer and your mileage and
all that kind of stuff right off to the side. - It's right in your
peripheral as you're driving, you can see it right there. - There are some weird
things with the software in the model three,
including the fact that you have to use the screen
to open the glovebox. So will you show us the wonderful process of opening our glovebox? There it is. - But the thing I like
about this is the less you have, the more you
realize what you don't need. - Right. - Which I think is a very fantastic thing, like having all these
buttons and knobs everywhere are nice but how often
do you actually use them, once they're taken away
you realize oh not that often, but this is a fun thing, which is I wonder if this one
could be considered more design over practicality,
but the fact that there is no way to
actually adjust the airflow with your hand here,
physically, you have to do it this way, which it's a little weird, I think it looks cool. - Well if you're on auto
pilot here, which we can't try 'cause we're on a little canyon road, but. - But autopilot I can say
having driven autopilot one point oh with my S and autopilot two point five with this, it's great. Let's just say we're going
to the Beverly Hills Cancer Center, which is a lovely place, but if you're going there, our navigation will pop up over here, and that's okay, but when you're driving
you then have to look all the way across this to here, and that's kind of a bummer, and if you did let's say we're driving
and it goes you know what, you're gonna get there
with negative five percent, it'll automatically route
you to a supercharger on the way, so it'll
make sure you don't die, well your battery doesn't die. And you have your charger
here so you can set your charging unit, I have it set all the way for a trip 'cause we were
driving a lot but you generally want to have it
right at the bottom of that. So you don't do it all the way. So use for roadtrip,
charging will take longer, daily driving needs. - After spending the day
with the model three, I gotta say I'm a lot more impressed than I thought I'd be, of course huge shoutout to my good buddy Jake from
Vsauce three for lending me your wonderful
vehicle to do a video on. You should definitely go to check out Vsauce three and Beam and
J Cooper and all the other wonderful projects you worked on. I feel like you have a
specific outro, my friend. - I do. - Shall we do it together? - Yes, are you ready? - Yes. - And as always, thanks for watching. - Was that cool or was that
not cool, I don't know. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. I recently checked out a $150 smartphone, but what happens when you
bring that budget down to $80? Shout out to MetroPCS for
sponsoring this video. This is the Alcatel A30 Fierce. Typically for $80, you really shouldn't expect much out of a smartphone, but at least on paper this looks decent. Take a look inside the box, and the first thing we see, is two free months of
Amazon Music Unlimited. So there are actually a couple different Amazon tie ins with this phone.. Specifically it actually
does have Alexa support, if you guys want the code, it's all yours. So we are definitely well into the budget end of the spectrum here, but it actually doesn't
feel too bad in the hand. So yes, it is a little
bit on the larger side, with a five and a half inch screen. And yes, it is made out of plastic, but it feels reasonably sturdy, it does have this kind of
interesting textured finish. Pop off the back, and the
first thing you'll see, is a giant please do
not remove this battery under any circumstances warning, but above that, not only do we have a micro sd card slot, but
also where we put our sim in. Hardware wise, this has pretty much everything you would expect. So not only do you have a headphone jack, but you also do have a micro usb port, would have been nice to see USBC, but it doesn't really
matter at this price point. And you also do have the volume rocker, as well as the slightly
textured power button. This guy is rocking a 5.5
inch, 720p IPS display. So just like with the Moto E4 Plus, it's nice to have a big display, and the resolution, even
though it's a little bit low, really isn't too bad for a budget device. So it does get reasonably bright, however, a couple areas
where you can notice the budget price come through, is with color reproduction, and the actual feel of the display. It just doesn't feel quite as premium, as something higher
end with gorilla glass. Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Moto E4 Plus, and it might just be all
the smart phone you'll need. For video, I feel like the bigger display actually is a really nice feature. And while the audio isn't amazing, it's a lot better than a
lot of other budget phones, just because it does have a
single front firing speaker. It's not stereo, but it
definitely does sound a lot better than something
coming out the bottom, or the back of a phone. It also does have that
support for Amazon Alexa. So if you double tap the power button. Who is Austin Evans? - [Alexa] Austin Evans is a tech reviewer with a self titled YouTube channel. - It also does have a fingerprint sensor, which is especially nice to
see on such a budget device. So it works just as you'd expect, put your finger on it, and
it will immediately unlock the phone and get you straight into it. Spec wise, it's pretty standard. So we have a quad core
mediatek 6738 processor, two gigabytes of ram, as
well as 32 gigs of storage, that is expandable with
that micro sd card slot. So while it might not be a huge value add, having 32 gigs of storage on an $80 phone is actually kind of nice. It's not like, you know, you can pay $600 for a 16 gig phone
somewhere else, or anything. - [Camera Man] This is
why we don't get invited. - Inside, it has a 3,000
milliamp power battery. That's about the same size
as a lot of flagships, but because of the
power seeping internals, this should easily be able to last a day. And of course, since
it's running on MetroPCS, you can get up to two
lines for $75 a month of unlimited data, without
gimmicks like speed caps. So far the A30 seems
like a completely decent budget Android phone, but I wanna put it
through a few challenges. Asking for a friend. Can it game? You definitely have to keep in mind, that this is a budget smartphone, but let's throw a few games at it, and see what happens. First off, we have Super Mario Run. This is not exactly an incredibly graphically demanding
game, and to be fair, it's not the smoothest
frame rate I've ever seen, so we are dropping a couple
frames here and there. But it's totally playable. Next we've got Mortal Kombat X. Huh, this actually works pretty well. Yeah, it's not gonna go blow
away a console or something, but this looks totally fine. Last but not least, we
have Real Racing Three. So performance isn't amazing, but again, this is an $80 phone, that's essentially able to run most of the graphically demanding games that are available on Android. Are you able to vlog? So this is what it would
be like if I was a vlogger, and it's 110 degrees outside. I would just complain a lot
for about five minutes or so, and then maybe move on to something else. Can you livestream? So, my first question is,
this is an $80 smartphone, can you guys tell the
difference on Instagram live? Not bad, not bad, looks good, looks good for 80 bucks,
yeah, I totally think so. Can you take a fast photo
as if you see a celebrity? You never know when you find
a wild Ken Baledo in the wild. Ready, and boom, got it. Not a very good picture, but I got it fast. (laughing) It's not perfect, if you have a little bit more budget to work with, I
really do like the Moto E4 Plus, but for $80 the Alcatel A30
is definitely worth a look. So, what do you guys
think about the phone? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is a $1000 Chromebook,
which begs the question, why does it even exist? This is the Google Pixelbook. Now this is actually not the
first time that Google has made a high end Chromebook. A few years ago they made the
Chromebook Pixel, which is very much an earlier version
of what they've got here. To me, spending $1000 on a
Chromebook doesn't make a ton of sense, so really the sweet
spot for these is typically in the $200-$300 price range. There, you're getting
pretty decent hardware. And while yes, it's not going
to be quite as usable as something like a Windows
computer, for a lot of people, Chrome OS is all you actually need. Pop open the box, and the
first thing we see is the Pixelbook itself. And actually I will say, this
is really unique hardware for a laptop. Unlike basically all other
high end laptops these days that are made out of aluminum
or sometimes stainless, instead you have this sort
of glass finish on the both front as well as back of the computer. Now if you look at it side
by side with something like a Pixel 2, you'll definitely
see the family resemblance. So port wise, there's
not going to be a ton. Essentially you have one
USB-C port on the side as well as a headphone jack. And on the other side
you're going to get one more USB-C port. So one of the nice things
about the Pixelbook is that it actually does share pretty
much all of this with the Pixel 2, so in theory you
can use the same charger for your phone and your laptop. Pop this guy open and we see
that yeah, that is actually rubber? This is such a weirdly designed laptop. Say what you want about Chrome
OS and whether it belongs on a $1000 laptop, but this
hardware, it is really nice. Man, I'm doing a 180 on
this computer way too fast. So when I'm here at work, a
lot of the times I will be using a Windows laptop to
plug in to a USB-C monitor, but this hardware is so nice,
I actually might give the Chromebook, or sorry, the Pixelbook a try. While this guy updates,
something else you might want to consider is picking up the Pixelbook Pen. So if a $1000 Chromebook
isn't enough, you can spend another $100 on a stylus. Sometimes it's hard for me
to justify using a stylus on a computer. I know a lot of people like
to be able to take notes and do sketching and stuff on a
computer, and especially with this guy where you can actually
flip the screen all the way around it might be helpful. But I just don't find a ton of use for it. Although, this actually does look nice. Touch pad firmware update in progress. Keep your hands off the touch pad. This will take around two minutes. I've never seen that in my life. What happens if I touch the touch pad now? - [Ken] Do it. - Oh, it crashed! (laughs) Ken is a bad influence, okay? A bad influence. Inside the Pixelbook is a
seventh generation Core i5 processor, eight gigabytes of
RAM, and a 128 gigabyte SSD. Those are the specs of the
base model that I have here. If you want to upgrade to
the model with the Core i7, 16 gigs of RAM and a 512 gig
SSD, that's going to run you $1650. And of course, if you want
the pen, don't forget to throw another $100 on that. So what are you getting with
a $1000+ Chromebook? Well, the hardware, like
I said, is pretty nice. So you do have a fully flexible
hinge, so not only can you use it in sort of a display
mode, but you can flip it over to tent, or if you want, you
can use it in tablet mode. You can tell they optimized
this for tablet mode, because the bezels are kind of huge. Now to be fair, when you're
using it like this, it does give you a little bit of
space for your thumbs to sort of rest on the screen, but
when you're spending this much money on a laptop, smaller
bezels would have been really nice. So it is a 12.3 inch panel
with a resolution of 2400x1600. As you'd expect, it has a
touch screen and it looks really nice. Today is the launch of the
iPhone X, which could be the most hyped phone of the year. Not only do the speakers
sound good, but it is a really sharp screen. This is a very high resolution
for a 12 inch panel. I had nothing but good things
to say about the typing experience either. The keyboard feels good with
solid spacing and it just has a nice sort of tactile feel. And the track pad is surprisingly good. Not only does it have a glass
surface, but it has some of the most accurate
scrolling I've ever felt. This is right up there
with a lot of MacBooks. The real question here though
is what exactly can you do on a $1000 Chromebook? Well first of all, you have Chrome. And while yes, that doesn't
sound like much of a selling point, for me I actually do
spend a lot of time in stuff like YouTube, Google Docs and Gmail. And for that, this works fine. What newer Chromebooks
like this have is the Google Play Store. Now this essentially will
give you access to a ton of different Android apps that
will run straight on Chrome OS. Oh my god, recommended for me. Love Life School Idol Festival. - Yes.
- No. - Yes.
- No. - Please?
- No. - Please? - I touched the track pad
for you, I'm not doing anything else. (laughs) of course, the first thing I
have to try is Super Mario Run. Because this is not ridiculous in any way. Oh, oh, oh! This is so huge! My hand kind of hurts from
holding the laptop like that, but I mean, that's one way
you can play games on your super cool Pixelbook. There are some slightly more
practical benefits of having Android apps, such as things
like Photoshop Sketch. So this combined with the
Pixel Pen means that you can actually do some pretty decent drawing. Having access to Android apps
like Instagram and Snapchat on a laptop can be really cool,
but the problem is is that while some of these apps are
pretty decent and do support Chrome OS, a lot of them are
either just stretched out versions of the phone, or
worse yet, they're just running in a phone sized window. The Pixelbook also has Google Assistant. So there's a few different
ways of launching this, but one of my favorites is with the pen. So when you hold the button,
you can just draw on a particular part of a
web page and it will use Google Assistant to try to figure out what you're looking at. So here it figures out that
I'm talking about the iPhone X and the Pixel 2. It gives a link to the
actual page as well as to my channel, and it will also
transcribe any text that I select. So should the Google Pixelbook exist? I'm sure there's a market out
there for someone to spend $1000 on a Chromebook, and
yes this is some of the nicest laptop hardware I've ever
tried, but it is really hard to justify buying this
when you can get a great PC or MacBook. So what do you guys think
about the Pixelbook? Let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys this is Austin and today I'm here CES 2018 with Razer's Project Linda. So what might look like an ordinary laptop this is actually being
powered by the Razer phone So essentially the
hardware's kind of similar to something like the Razer Blade Stealth. So you're still getting a 13 inch display but instead of having Windows and a standard like Core processor inside, everything is being run
off of the Razer Phone. Now the idea has been done before. What hasn't is something that well actually isn't terrible. Now to be clear this is still a concept so it's not necessarily gonna be on sale and there are some changes before this would hit production. But the idea of being
able to take your phone, spend all day using it as a standard phone and when you're ready dropping it in and turning into a laptop is really cool. So it all starts with the Razer Phone. Now say what you will about the hardware but it is beefy and actually matches the laptop pretty well. So instead of having a standard shy pad what we do is we actually
just drop the phone in and with one button it
motorizes the USB C port and the actually laptop will turn on. So it takes just a second right now, obviously this is a prototype. Once it's up and running the phone screen just
turns into a trackpad. They've actually done a lot of interesting engineering
to make this work. So we hit the button to detach the phone. There's just gonna be
a little cut out here where we could actually can grab it. What's cool is not only does this keep the power button exposed
we actually still have access to the fingerprint sensor. Now what's cool is we can actually even motorize
it without the phone in. So you can see the USB port just kinda pops in pops out. Also I just really like the noise Just sounds so cool. Not only does the phone serve as the trackpad right now but it also is going to
be using these speakers. Now if you guys caught my Best Smartphones of
2017 video you'll know that the Razer has the best speakers of any phone I've ever tried. So using this for a laptop
should work just fine. The rest of the hardware
should be very familiar if you've tried a recent Razer laptop. We have full control
over the RGB lighting. So even though the configurator is a little bit lighter than what you're gonna get Windows, we can still do things like getting full RGB wave cause like, you know, I actually don't have anything to say to that, it's very colorful. Beyond that the rest of the hardware is fairly straight forward. So there is a actual battery inside. You'll be able to charge the phone while it's docked but
beyond that you've got a USB C port for charging, a headphone jack as well
as a full size USB A. Now they said they would
like to add an HDMI port at a later date but
for a prototype this is actually pretty close. It feels fairly straight forward as far as the build quality. It feels a lot honestly like a Razer Blade Stealth which is definitely a good thing. This guy is rocking a 13.3 inch panel with a 1080P resolution at least for now. So the main issue is with
the prototype at least it is not a touchscreen so with the final version it will be nice to at least have that touchscreen that you could use along side the phone but if they could bump it up to say 120 hertz or maybe even 1440P that would be awesome. Because this is all Android some apps are gonna
look better than others. For example YouTube
actually is not too bad. I will also say it is really nice to have a proper keyboard. So while the actual touchpad is maybe not quite fully fine tuned you can just plug a mouse in and it should work just like this. - It's time drive the model three. - So you got this for how long? - Dude this sounds like
proper laptop speakers. I've listened to lots of laptops, they're nowhere near this loud but it's all just coming from the phone. While most Android apps
are gonna run fine, some are gonna be specifically optimized for a larger display such as Lightroom. Now this is maybe not gonna be the full experience but what you're getting here is something that is going
to be pretty impressive especially considering that it is after all running off a phone. This is how I edit photos. Lets just crank everything up. You know we use saturation. Yeah we just crank that and that's obviously a
beautiful, beautiful image Wes doesn't approve. I can I can feel it right now. It's a hard no. The pained look on your face as I crank up saturation. No no no. Of course as a Razer product gaming has to be on the agenda. And here we're going to play a little bit of Vainglory. Now this is a game that
will obviously run fine on the Razer phone but
with a mouse and keyboard I'm actually curious to see how it plays. I'm still really impressed with how close this feels like I'm playing on an actual laptop. The screen is nice, the speakers are solid. Especially with this keyboard it does make a big difference. The Razer Project Linda is surprisingly close to being ready however it is still a concept right now. So not only does the
hardware need some tweaks specifically by adding a touchscreen and maybe something like an HDMI ports but the software also could use some work. But my big question here is what is the price going to be. Considering that this only works with the Razer Phone if this was somewhere around $300 I think it'd be a pretty solid deal but if it gets closer to four five or six hundred dollars that's where it becomes a little
bit more questionable. But I'm curious. What do you guys think
about Razer Project Linda? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. The Galaxy Note 7 was one of the hottest phones of last year. Exploded onto the scene last year. By far the most lit phone of all time. But after less than a month
on sale, it was recalled. But now it's back. The issue with the Note 7 originally was that the battery
was slightly too large for the actual phone which
meant that in some cases, the Note 7 would literally
explode in your pocket. After recalling the nearly
two and a half million phones they had sold, Samsung
spent most of last year reminding people that
not all of their phones are fiery death machines. However, the Note 7 is
officially back with this, the Galaxy Note Fan Edition. What's interesting is,
this isn't even called the Galaxy Note 7 anymore. It is just the Galaxy Note Fan Edition. Now right now, it's only
on sale in South Korea, but with millions of these phones sitting around in a warehouse somewhere, I assume that we're probably going to see more of
these sooner than later. So even though Samsung promises that this will definitely not explode
totally for real this time, I feel like safety is
sorta the name of the game. So I'm gonna make sure that I don't die here, we're gonna unbox the
Galaxy Note Fan Edition. Ken picked this gear out,
I don't think this is gonna be protective at
all, I don't think... This is a bad idea. Careful. (tense music) (loud noise) Oof, okay. We're good, we're good, we're good. It's fine. Alright, alright, we're in. We have the phone, we
have the phone, it is it's here, so I'm just
gonna be very gentle with this right now. Just tease it out. Okay. Alright. Phone's out of the box. It's interesting to think
that the Note 7 design is nearly a year old at this point. Don't get me wrong,
it's still a very nicely put together phone with
the glass and metal build. You've got the curves on
either edges of the display. But when you look at it
compared to something like the Galaxy S8, it really does
feel a little bit behind. What this means is that
while the Galaxy S8 is a physically smaller phone, it actually has a very
slightly bigger screen than the Note 7. Now that the danger has passed, let's see what else we
get in the unboxing. It does come with this case
which is actually kind of cool. It's a little bit weird
that it covers up the screen but as Savage Kenny so
rightfully points out, no one really wants to be
seen with the Galaxy Note 7 so maybe hiding it is your best option. I'm curious whether this is
an actually new phone or not. So, Samsung does have a couple
million Notes sitting around that I'm sure they're going to do something with at some point. But if I had to take a guess, I would say that this
is a brand new phone. Not only is it super clean on the outside but it really wouldn't surprise me if Samsung still had extra
parts to build Notes, just with a couple minor internal changes. From the outside this looks
pretty much exactly the same. The big difference is instead of having a 3500mAh battery which may or may not explode, this guy has a smaller
3200mAh battery. Now this is very similar to what you're getting with the Galaxy Note 8. Not only do you have a couple of additional things that are mostly because
this is a Korean model phone but you also get the
wonderful Bixby pre-installed. I keep coming back to how
nice the Galaxy S8 feels in comparison to the Note. Don't get me wrong, like I said, this is an amazing looking
phone with glass and metal. But when you look at how big
the screen is on the Galaxy S8 with the rounded corners and everything, it really does make this feel a lot older. One thing you're not really giving up with the Note are specs. So this is going to be
the Exynos 8890 version which is the international Note 7. And not only is that going to be a fairly powerful processor, paired with 4GB of RAM
and 64GB of storage. But compared with the Galaxy S8 it is very, very similar in performance. This is also rocking a
very similar 12MP camera to what you'll find on both the Galaxy S7 as well as the S8. Well sure, it's a little
bit old at this point, it is still one of the best looking smartphone cameras you can get today. (camera snaps) The more I think about it,
the more the Note Fan Edition just doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Not only is this a phone
that is essentially the exact same as what
came out a year ago, but with a smaller battery, but it does not come cheap. In Korea, this cost
the equivalent of $610. Almost the same price as a new Galaxy S8. Don't get me wrong, the
Note 7 was a great phone, and this sort of solves
the whole exploding and not being allowed on planes thing, which is cool. But at the end of the day
I can't see a lot of people wanting to buy one of these in 2017 besides for the novelty. So, would you guys want to pick up a Galaxy Note Fan Edition? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
Oh, well it's lucky that you guys say that because this video is sponsored by Blue Apron! If you guys check out the link in the description you will get your first three meals totally for free straight from Blue Apron. Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Moto E4+ and it might just be all the smartphone you need. What makes this phone impressive is that not only does it have solid specs for less than $200, but what's really cool about it is that this guys rocking a 5000 milliamp hour battery. The Moto E has been one of my favorite budget phones for a long time, but the E4+ promises to step it up in a big way. Now part of the reason it does that is it's now rocking a full metal build. Inside the box there's not a lot. So we get a microUSB cable as well as the 10 watt power adapter which actually does support quick charge meaning that even though you have a giant battery it actually should be able to charge pretty quickly. Pull off the metal back and not only will you see the SIM card slot as well as your microSD but also that giant 5000 milliamp hour battery. Now I think it's easy to kind of hear a spec like that and not realize but this is an enormous battery for any phone but especially something like this which has such power sipping internals. What I really like about the Moto E4+ is that it doesn't really feel like you're giving up much versus a bigger and more expensive flagship. I mean this guy's rocking a 5.5 inch display, it's got that huge battery, the metal build, you've got a fingerprint sensor and this all is in a form that costs 180 dollars. The fingerprint sensor is a great example of a feature that you usually don't find on budget phones. So with the Moto E4 it's actually the standard Moto one, so if you tap and hold it will lock the phone, tap it and it'll quickly unlock and you can even use this for gestures. Now to be fair it's not all cutting edge, so this guy's rocking a micro USB port instead of USB-C, although I feel like that's not really a big deal for most people, and amazingly enough is rocking a full headphone jack, which is sadly becoming more and more rare for phones in 2017. Spec wise you're not really giving up much either. so the Moto E4 is rocking a quad-core Snapdragon 427 processor 2GB of memory and either 16 and 32 Gigs of storage and of course you can expand that with the microSD card slot. It might not be the most powerful phone in the world but it is totally fine for normal usage and when you take a look at the performance inside Geekbench it's pretty much on par with a lot of the more expensive phones such as the Moto G. It's one thing to look at benchmarks but it's another thing to actually use the phone in the real world where it feels pretty snappy. So a lot of that has to do with the fact that this is running stock Android which makes everything just a little bit better as far as the optimization side of things go. But multitasking is totally fine and what you're getting here is something that for most people is going to feel very, very similar to a much more expensive phone. It's also fully up to date on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and that's one of the nice things about Motorola phones. Typically speaking they do a pretty good job of keeping them up to date, which is definitely not something i can say about a lot of other budget phones. Now this guy does come fully unlocked, which is fairly standard for a lot of the Amazon Prime phones, but what is cool about this guy is that not only not does it support LTE but also dual band Wi-Fi. Now yes, I'm going to take a hard turn into nerd town right now, but dual band Wi-Fi is something that I find should be on a lot more devices. It makes it a lot more reliable, and if you have a fast internet connection it makes it a lot faster. Now this is one of Amazon's Prime exclusive phones and because of that you have a lot of different options. So the base Model is going to run you $180 with 16GB of storage and you can bump that up to 32GB of storage for 200. Now if you don't care about the Amazon lockscreen ads that come with it, yes you can save $40 on both models, which may or may not be worth it depending on how you feel about that stuff. The E4+ is rocking a 5.5 inch 720p screen. Now while it might not be the sharpest display in the world, I think it's going to be totally fine for most people and importantly not only is the colour fairly accurate but it also gets very bright. For the camera the Moto E4+ is rocking a 13 megapixel shooter. This doesn't look bad. So color seems reasonable, I don't think it's the sharpest thing I've seen but there actually is a fair bit of depth of field. HDR actually looks pretty good here, even though there's a lot of contrast in this picture it's actually able to keep a lot of the detail. Oh, no you can't show that I'm sorry that's uh, that's- that's showing off certain secrets. [laughter] The Moto E4 also has 1080P video as you can see from this super smooth shot of Mr. Ken Belito it's actually not too bad. I feel like this is a trend with this phone maybe it's not the greatest camera or the greatest build quality or the greatest screen, but put together for $180 it is really hard to complain. While the Moto E4 isn't totally waterproof, it is supposed to be at least somewhat water-resistant. Alright, here it goes, will the Moto E4 survive? It probably will, I think so. [water sounds, such as splish, splash, and spspshspsp] Yep. That looks like it works. One water test later, I am really impressed with the Moto E4+. Now yes you can spend a lot more to get a smartphone that's going to be a bit better in certain areas, but taken as a whole there's really not a lot to complain about. So as always I'll have a link to check this guy out in the description and I've got to give a big shout out to Blue Apron for sponsoring this video. Blue Apron provides everything you need to cook a delicious meal right at home and it's all inside this box. Blue Apron offers a large selection of recipes and is always adding new dishes to the menu every week, and they ship to most of the country. There's no commitment, you can skip or cancel the service at any time and shipping is always free. So even though this ships in a box to your house, it is nicely cooled and there is a lot in here. So the first step is what should we actually cook since we have three full meals here. You wanna do the salmon? So we have our salmon fillets, scallions, jasmine rice, bell pepper, green beans, cilantro, garlic, and lemongrass. And I actually don't think It looks too bad. Ken would you like the first try? They're not bad. AUSTIN: Not bad? AUSTIN: I'll take not bad. Not bad. Yo! I think I actually cooked something! Mom will be so proud. So if you guys want to try Blue Apron for yourselves the link is in the description and the first 300 people who sign up will get 3 free meals. So what did you guys think about this first episode of 'Austin Cooks Stuff'? I actually think it went better than I was expecting. Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. I might be slightly sick
but what's also sick is the PC that we're about to build. Yes my friends, it's 2018,
which means it is time for an all new gaming PC build tutorial. So as you guys will probably be aware, building a gaming PC
is not that difficult. I like to compare it to
something like doing adult legos. Now I will be giving a full tutorial on the Photon 4.0 today, so if you guys want information about the actual parts that I'm using,
as well as the performance, you guys can go check out that video. The idea here is that pretty much anyone with an afternoon can
build yourself a computer. Before we get started, let
me give you a quick tour of the parts that we're going
to be using for the build. So any computer is going
to need a processor, in this case a Ryzen 5 2400G. Now what's cool about this, is that not only does
it handle the processor, but this also has
integrated graphics inside. So even though I will be showing you what it's like to install a graphics card, with this build you
don't actually need one. Next we have the motherboard. So the idea here is that you
put the processor in here, the memory in here, you connect the SSD, pretty much everything in the build will connect with this in some way. Next we have RAM, so you can think of this as the short term memory of your computer. Every time you open up an
application, it lives in this. This build is also using an SSD. So this is basically the
same thing as a hard drive, it's where you store files and programs and all that kind of stuff. The difference is is that SSDs, while a bit more expensive,
are much, much faster. And this one specifically is
in the smaller M2 form factor. Like I said earlier, this build doesn't actually need a graphics card, but especially if you're
building a higher end gaming PC or you're doing anything that's really heavily reliant on 3D applications, having a graphics card is
going to be a big help. The literal heart of any
computer is the power supply. So this is what takes
the power from the wall and provides it to all of the different components inside your system. Last but not least, we have the case. Now cases are actually pretty
much dependent on your style, so every computer will need
a certain size of a case depending on how many hard
drives you're putting in, what size motherboard, but a lot of this does come down to your personal preference and with this one, we're
going a little bit stylized. Now anytime you're building a computer, you do need to come prepared
with a wide variety of tools depending on what
situation comes up, or not. Actually, the only thing you really need is a Phillips screwdriver. I'm not kidding, you can
build an entire computer with just a single screwdriver. So now that we've got all
that stuff out of the way, the last thing to do
is find your workspace. So generally speaking I like
to find a decently sized table, you're gonna have parts and cables and stuff kind of all strewn out. And make sure that you don't build on carpet if you can avoid it, static electricity is the enemy of a computer part, believe me. Hey whoa, whoa, don't show
that, don't show that, Ken. I'm an expert, it's fine. Just you at home, don't build on carpet, unless you're an expert
or Ken sells you out. The first step is to get
the case out of the box. Now even though we're actually not going to be putting everything
inside the case as we go, that'll happen a little bit later, I still like getting the case out of the box and ready to go. So this is a little
bit of an unusual case, it is the Thermaltake Core P1. The idea is that because it has a giant tempered glass window, we're actually using it
to show off the build. I will say that this might not be the most beginner friendly
case in the world, considering that we actually
have to put the case together, and usually it just comes
fully assembled out of a box. But let's see how it actually is to build. (upbeat music) One quick case change later,
we have the BitFenix Phenom, a case that thankfully does not require 17 steps to put it together. So we're going to be using
this for the tutorial, even though the main build
I will eventually have to rebuild into the other case. But especially just because I've got to actually show you guys how to do it, things are going to be much,
much more common in this case, versus the other one, where
you're going to be doing a lot of weird mounting and whatnot. This is just going to make
everything a lot easier. The first step is to remove the four thumbscrews on
the back of the case, which will allow us to remove both the left as well as the right side panels. Now we mostly need to do
this to actually be able to get a little more access to the case. But with that open, we can
see that there's actually a fair bit of room inside this. Generally speaking, bigger
cases are easier to work on and as you get smaller
and more sort of custom, it gets a little bit more challenging. But the good thing is,
pretty much all of them do have a very similar layouts. Usually you'll find a
box full of hardware, so we can open this guy up later, but should have some
screws and some random bits and pieces that we'll need
a little bit later on. If you come around back, we'll see where the power
supply is installed. Now cases will put this
in different locations, sometimes it's gonna be up top, but with this one it's
going to be in the bottom. All we need to do here, is just
remove the four thumbscrews that keep this little bracket in place. So, going back to my analogy about this being the heart of the system, it really does sort of provide power to basically all of our components. Now power supplies will
come in different sizes, they will be more or less powerful, but at the end of the
day, they are very simple. There are two major
types of power supplies, modular and non-modular. So this is a standard non-modular supply, which means that all of our cables that we're going to
need come pre-attached. However, higher end power supplies typically do come modular, which will allow you to actually plug in each cable that you want. Basically making it a little
bit cleaner inside your build, so you don't have a bunch of
extra cables hanging around. Before installing this guy,
take note of where the fan is. So depending on your case,
this will either be facing up or it will be facing down. So with this guy, it's
going to be facing down because we have this little mesh here. The important thing is, always make sure there's some ventilation. You can't put this sort of
like face down on like a table or face down on like
a flat piece of metal, otherwise it will overheat
and bad things will happen. Inside the power supply box,
you should find four screws. Now this is how we're going to mount the power supply to the bracket, which will then go attach to the chassis. Now not all cases will actually do this, so sometimes you can
completely ignore the bracket and cases will have you mount
this directly onto the case. One thing to keep in mind, is that when you're
tightening things down, start on one corner and then
move to the opposite corner to make sure that you're
applying even pressure. So I'll do this screw, then
I'll do the one on this corner, and then I'll do the final two. So with the power supply installed, the next step is set
this guy off to the side and grab our motherboard. Like I was saying earlier,
the motherboard is pretty much what everything in the
computer connects to. So there are a few things
that you need to keep in mind, obviously pick a motherboard that is going to be compatible
with your processor, but the size is also important. So as you guys can see here,
this guy is pretty small, this is what's known as a mini ITX board. Now this happens to be a mini
ITX case, which all works out. You can go with a smaller
motherboard and a bigger case, but obviously not the reverse. So something like a micro ATX
or a full size ATX motherboard would not fit in your case. So you're going to go
pick one of these out, make sure it supports
the correct processor and make sure that your case will actually be able to fit it. Now anytime you see an exposed
circuit board like this, you wanna be a little bit careful, especially of static electricity. So it comes in this anti-static bag and when you grab it, try not
to grab onto the actual board, so something like one of the
metal pieces should be fine. And once you pull it out,
I like to actually set it on top of the motherboard box. So even a small motherboard like this is going to have a ton of
different sockets and cables and connectors all over the place, but you only need to pay
attention to a few of them that you're actually going
to use in the system. So one of the most important things is where you install your processor. So Intel and AMD do this
slightly differently but it's pretty much always going to be a gray socket in the middle. The next thing you'll
find are your DIMM slots. So every motherboard is going to be a little bit different here, this board has two, however
some have four, or even eight. This is where you're going
to install your memory and the only thing to
really watch out for here is to make sure that you
do have the correct RAM. So this, like most modern motherboards, are going to support DDR4. However, older systems will
use something called DDR3 or even all the way back to DDR2. It's all very similar to install, just make sure you get the right kind. Below the processor is going
to be your PCI Express slot. So since this is such a small motherboard, we only have the one. However, a lot of motherboard
will have four or even seven. Now this is going to be where you're going to install various different add-in cards. Typically speaking, it's
going to be a graphics card, but sometimes you might
install an SSD here, maybe like a video card,
maybe an ethernet adapter, I don't know, depends
on what you're doing. But that is going to be where you're going to install a lot of
different add-in cards. Move down to these small
rectangular connectors and this is what is called a SATA port. Now SATA ports can be used
for a couple different things, typically speaking it's going to be either for an SSD or for a hard drive. But if you're still old school
and rocking an optical drive, that will also plug in to the SATA port. Right beside that is our 20
plus four pin power connector. Now this is what supplies the
main power to the motherboard, as well as a lot of it to the processor, to the graphics, all that kind of stuff. This is going to be the biggest cable that you're going to plug
in from the power supply and usually it's going to be mounted on one of the sides of
the board for easy access. Now in the top corner here, you're going to find our
four plus four pin CPU power. Now motherboards can be a
little bit different here, some only have four pins,
whereas this one does have eight. It's basically the same thing, because pretty much all power supplies are gonna have a lead that
will either do four or eight, but this is what supplies
power to your processor. Something a little bit
unusual on this board is where the M2 slot is. So this is where you're going
to install higher end SSDs, like we're using for this build, and typically you're
going to find it somewhere on the actual board itself. However on this guy, it's actually going to be here on the back. Spin the whole thing around, and this is where the rear IO lives. Now these are all going
to be all the ports that are going to be sticking
out the back of your case. So once you install your IO shield, you're going to pretty much see it's something a little bit like this. Speaking of, now is as good a time as any to actually install this guy. So it's just a little piece of metal. Now the only thing you need to do is make sure that you're going to be doing it in the correct orientation. So for this guy, we're
going to be putting it in on this side, right? This guy's pretty easy to install, so all you need to do is line it up and press it pretty firmly
until it clicks into place. Now you wanna make sure this
is all the way into place, as if it's slightly not quite correct, what's going to happen is your motherboard is not going to line up correctly and that's just going to be a huge hassle. So if you ever have
any problems with that, just make sure that this guy is fully in. Also, as we'll talk about in a minute, you see all these little metal pins that are all over the place? Make sure these are pulled back
when you install the board. The next step is to install our processor. So in this case we're going
with the Ryzen 5 2400G, but generally speaking it's
going to be very similar, regardless of whether
you're using AMD or Intel. So like I was saying with the motherboard, you want to be very careful when you're handling stuff like this, and especially so when you're
talking about a processor. So on the back here, if I open it up, you'll be able to see that there are lots of little tiny gold pins. Do not touch these, if
any of them get bent, you're gonna be in serious trouble. The best way to handle this guy is just to grab it form the
sides and hold it by the edges. Actually installing the CPU
is pretty straightforward. So if you come down to the socket, what you're going to see is
there's a little metal arm here that's going to be the retention arm. So we pull that back
and all the way forward, we're good to install the processor. Now there's going to
be a little metal notch that's going to be on
every single processor, which will tell you which
side to line it up with. So once you do, just set it
gently down into the socket, pull the arm all the way down,
and that is all ready to go. The next step is to
install our CPU cooler. Now this is an area where
pretty much every single one is going to mount in a different way. So unfortunately, you will
probably have to dive into your instruction manual to see
exactly how to mount yours. Thankfully though, if you're using a stock Intel or AMD cooler, they're not too difficult to install. The main thing to keep in mind is that there's going to be
pre-applied thermal paste here. You do not want to touch this, as this is what's going
to make a solid contact between the heat sink and your processor. When it comes to the AM4 socket,
which is what Ryzen uses, you're going to wanna
remove these two brackets that hold the little
plastic pieces into place. And once we undo that, we're
free to install the heat sink. So there are going to be
four little screws here that you're going to want to line up. And when you do this, make sure that you actually set it down it smoothly. So you basically want
all of that thermal paste to make solid contact with the processor. Don't try to like, you know, put it off to one side or the other, just try to get it down as
smoothly and evenly as possible. Making sure that all of
your screws are lined up, then you just want to tighten them down. And the main thing here is
just like I was saying earlier, you want to do it in a cross pattern, so tighten that one a little bit, then come to the opposite corner, tighten that one down just a little bit. Come over here, and do this process until you get this guy
all the way locked down. Alright, so with that we should be able to pick up the entire
motherboard by the cooler, and it looks like everything
went in pretty well. Now the next step is to
actually plug in the fan. So this is going to be
using a four pin fan header. So you'll see that there are going to be two little tiny notches there, basically that just means that you can't plug it in the wrong way. So on this board, we have
our fan header right here, and it's as simple as lining it up and plugging it all the way in. Next up, it's time to install our memory. So RAM is actually very
straightforward to install, so the only thing you need to do is, like I was saying earlier, make sure that if you're
using a DDR4 system, use DDR4. If you're using DDR3, make
sure that you're using DDR3. The easiest way to make sure that you're using the correct memory, is that there's a little notch that's going to be about
2/3 of the way down. So on DDR4, that's going to line up with the correct slot on the motherboard. If it doesn't line up,
you're probably using the wrong kind of memory. All you need to do is
line it up, slide it in, and then with equal
pressure on both sides, just press it down
until you get the click. Then we just repeat
that with the other DIMM and we're gonna be good to go. And so with that, our motherboard is actually pretty much good to go. So the next step is going to be installing this entire contraption
inside of our case. Depending on your case,
the motherboard is going to be installed in a
couple different ways. So most of the time, it's going to live in this sort of vertical section here. However with this guy, we're going to place it right down here. So if we dig through the
little box of hardware that comes with our case, we
should see a bag of screws. Now we're going to need four of these to mount the motherboard inside. Now sometimes the case
will actually require you to install the standoffs. So you can see that these
are already going to be here. If so, make sure that you just screw them all the way into place. With this guy, we just need to drop the motherboard into place, screw it in, and we're going to be good to go. Because this case is so small, it's actually not that hard to
get the motherboard lined up. So we just need to get it sort of roughly in the right position right here, and then if we move it
around to this side, we're going to make sure
that all these ports are actually going to come
through the IO shield. So this is going to require
a little bit of wiggling to make sure that it's
going to line up correctly. But as long as it's on
all four of the standoffs, which it pretty much is, we're
good to screw it into place. It's a little hard to see it on camera, but there are four screw holes on each corner of the motherboard that we're going to use
to tighten it into place. Now something that you should
definitely keep in mind is that before you
tighten everything down, make sure that everything
is lined up correctly. Remember that whole thing about make sure that you line up
the motherboard correctly so you don't have to
accidentally undo everything? Well you should also make sure that if there's any weird parts on the bottom of the motherboard, that you have those installed before everything is screwed into place. So normally the next step will be to install a standard SATA SSD, however this time we're
going to go with an M2 drive. Now especially with this
specific WD Blue drive, there's really no major
difference in performance. The main difference is, this
is a much, much smaller drive, which makes it easier to install, especially because it takes
up less room in your case. Installing the drive is
pretty straightforward, you just need to line it up
with the connectors here, making sure that it rests
all the way in there and then we take that little screw that we pulled out of it and that is going to be
the retention mechanism to make sure that this SSD doesn't go flying out of your system. If you're installing
a standard hard drive, SSD, or optical drive in your system, then it's also pretty simple to install. So if you look over here, there are going to be two connectors. The smaller one is going to be for data and the bigger one is
going to be for power. So every case will do this
a little bit differently, so you can see they have
these little drive rails that you can install not only a big 3 1/2 inch desktop hard drive in, but also something smaller
like this laptop hard drive. So you're gonna want to mount it to there and then for actual cabling,
it's very straightforward. So you dig through the mess
of power supply cables, you're going to find this long flat guy. There's a little notch on one end, so it's only going to go in one way. All we need to do is just
connect this to our hard drive. Once that's into place, it
doesn't really click or anything, it just slides right
in, we're going to want to find one of these SATA data cables that come with your motherboard. Again, this guy's notched, it's
only going to go in one way. And if we line that notch
up, it will click into place, and then you just plug this
in into your motherboard and you have your fully up
and running hard drive or SSD. For this video though, no more of this, we're going with our upside down M2 drive that I totally remembered to install now. Something else that most gaming builds do, although we actually don't
need it for this system, is installing a graphics card. So this is going to be
pretty straightforward. What we're going to be doing
is using the PC Express slot that's going to be on
the bottom of the board. This one's metal, most
of them are plastic, but it doesn't really make a difference. And then what you wanna do is look around to the back of the case, and this is where we're
going to get our video outs. So essentially, just like
the IO shield protects all those little ports on the motherboard, this is going to be where you're going to get your video outs, such
as display port and HDMI. So if we remove the thumbscrews, we should get this little
bracket out of the way. We're gonna hold on to that for right now, but what we don't need are these two little metal pieces right here. So this is just a cover
to keep your PCI covers from getting dirty or anything
getting inside your system. If you're installing a graphics card, you get those out of the way. And now we install the
actual graphics card itself. Ordinarily, when you're
installing a graphics card, you measure to see will it
actually fit in your case or not. With this particular case,
it doesn't quite fit. Which is fine, because we're not using a graphics card in this system, but if we were, it would
go in, right about here. What this really means is I just need to remove these drives, so it doesn't matter because
we're not using them anyway. But that's going to free up the space to install a graphics card. Which, if we just line
it up with the slot, is going to go in a little
bit something like this. Now all you do is press it
down until it slams into place, that was a little bit more
violent than I expected. However, that is pretty much all we need to do to get it plugged in, now we actually need
to use the power cables to make sure that it has plenty of juice to run all of the crispy, crispy 4K games that we're going to throw at it. If I wasn't going to take
it out immediately after I show you guys how to do this. Some graphics cards,
especially lower end ones, don't require any additional power, it's gonna pull everything it
needs from the motherboard. But most higher end ones,
this Radeon Vega 56 included, need a couple of these six
plus two pin connectors. So all you need to do is just line up the connectors and plug them in, and then we're gonna be good
to get this guy up and running. It might look pretty bare bones, that's because it is very,
very simple and clean inside. However, this is all the components that we need to make our system work. The next step is the fun one, connecting all these
wonderful cables and wires all over the place to get
this guy actually operational. So we actually only need two
sets of cables from our system. So we need the four plus
four CPU power connector, which will go straight
into the motherboard. And we're also going to need
our 20 plus four pin connector, which also will go into the motherboard. And this is going to be the big fat guy, and usually I like to start
with it because it's sort of the most unwieldy cable
to actually connect. All you need to do is line it up and make sure that it clicks
all the way into place and that's going to be it
for the 20 plus four pin. Now the next step is the CPU power cable, which is also going to be pretty easy, if I can find where it went. This one's going to be hard to see, but all you need to do is line it up with the little four
plus four pin connector on the motherboard corner,
plug it all the way in, and you're gonna be good. Now it's time to install the fan. So this guy has a fan right back here and it uses a three pin fan header, very similar to what we
used for the CPU cooler. Again, this guy has notches, so it's going to plug in to the fan header on the motherboard only one way. Now for most cases, you're going to find a ton of different front panel connectors dangling somewhere from the front. However, on the BitFenix case, we actually have all of them
attached to the side panel. Now this makes things a little bit cleaner because you can have
the buttons on the side but it makes it a little bit more annoying when you're building the computer because that way you have to kind of hold the side panel in place while
you run all of your cables. So this might look like a lot but it's actually not too crazy. So the big guy is going
to be our USB 3.0 header. So the only thing you have watch out for is that there's a little
notch on this guy, when you plug it in, make
sure it's all the way in. I've definitely pulled these guys out and had this entire
plastic piece come with it. Now beside that, we're going to get all of our front panel connectors, I'll explain how to do these in a second, but essentially that's what
we need this manual for, a lot of little fiddly stuff. And then we have our audio. So these are going to
be our audio connectors to make sure that the headphone and the microphone jack work up front. This guy is going to be
really straightforward, we're just going to plug it in here. One of the only things
that this case doesn't have is a USB 2.0 header. So that's going to look very
similar to something like this. You can tell that how the audio and the USB headers are installed because out of all 10 pins, they're each going to
have one knocked out, so again, you can't
install it the wrong way. Last but not least, you wanna grab all of these little tiny front panel connectors. So this is where it's
going to be very important to take a look at that manual
to figure out the diagram of where each thing gets plugged in, as every motherboard does
it a little bit differently. So something important to note is if you look on the bottom here, there are little tiny arrows that denote the positive versus the negative. That is very important
as when you go to say, I don't know, plug your power button in, and you put it backwards, you're gonna hit it and
nothing is gonna happen. Just make sure that
all of these connectors are put in the correct way. Now this might not look
like a completed system but before we start doing cable management and close the case up and make sure that
everything is ready to go, first we need to do a
test boot to make sure that we didn't make a horrible, horrible mistake along the way. So once you have your monitor,
mouse, and keyboard ready, all you need to do is hit the power button and hope everything works. We have fans spinning,
the rear fan is spinning. Now, will we actually get it to post? USB is up, and yes! Alright, so that means
that we've pretty much done everything correctly. The next step is to
actually get in the BIOS and make sure that all of our memory, SSD, all of that kind of stuff
is showing up correctly. Alright, and it looks like
everything is showing up. So it shows AMD Ryzen 5 2400G, shows our 16 gigabytes of memory. We also do see that our 500
gigabyte SSD is showing up. So from this point, all that's left to do is to turn off the
computer, unplug everything, and then we just need to do a little bit more cable
management to, you know, make sure that the side
panel will go on the case. But once we've done that, we have a fully operational computer. Throw a copy of Windows on
this guy, install your drivers, and you're gonna have a
fully operational gaming PC. Now if you guys wanna see
how the Photon 4.0 performs and what the original case
was supposed to look like, feel free to go check
out the video over here. If you enjoyed, definitely be sure to subscribe to the channel. Anyway guys, thank you
so much for watching and I'm gonna go get some sleep because I've been working on this computer for a very long time and my voice is pretty
much gone, so, yeah. 
- Hey guys, this is
Austin, and today I'm here with something just a
little bit different. This is the Razer phone. So as you guys can probably tell, we're here at the Razer
HQ where we get to do an exclusive unboxing
of the new Razer phone that was just announced. So the idea here is that
this is going to be a phone that is meant for gamers. So not only does it have a
pretty interesting screen, which we'll discuss in a minute, but it has crazy speakers,
and you can also see it is kind of built like a tank, look at that! So if you guys are familiar with Nextbit, Razer purchased them a
little over a year ago, and you can see a lot of
that DNA in the Razer phone. So it's very sort of squared off, but it also has a nice
sort of metal texture, which feels exactly
like the sort of finish that they have on their laptops. So if you take a look at the phone, you'll see that it does
have fairly large bezels, although that does house the
dual front firing speakers, but what's really impressive
about this is the display. It has a 5.8 inch 2560 by 1440p panel. What's really interesting is this can run at a full 120 hertz. Before we get too far into it though, let's see what else comes in the box. So we get some paperwork
on the Razer phone, we also get the power adapter, so this phone is using USB-C, however what it doesn't
have is a headphone jack. So to be fair, they do include
a USB-C headphone adapter in the box, and supposedly
it's going to be pretty good with a 24 bit DAC, but the problem is, if you wanna actually play a game and listen to headphones,
you're going to be doing something like this. It's not a deal breaker,
but for a gaming phone, it's a little bit goofy. However, what is cool is the speakers that are built into the phone. Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Google Pixel 2
and this is the Pixel 2 XL. That's pretty loud. So yeah, I think it's
actually pretty safe to say this is probably one of the loudest phones I've ever heard. I would still like to
have a headphone jack, but that's a decent compromise. So just playing with the
phone for a few minutes, I can immediately tell that
the UltraMotion display actually does make a
pretty big difference. So the idea here is that while it is a high resolution panel,
it also can run it up to that 120 hertz refresh rate. Basically all phones that you buy today are running at 60 hertz,
which has been standard for a long time, but once
you step up to 120 hertz, it actually is a lot smoother. So for basic stuff like web browsing or scrolling through menus,
you can see that it does look a lot more fluid. Where you're really gonna see
the advantage is in games. So for example here in Riptide Renegade, we're running anywhere between
90 to 100 frames per second, and because the display
is not only going to be variable refresh rate, but it
also can run up to 120 frames, we're seeing all of the performance here. I've gotta say, it actually
does look noticeably smoother than a normal phone. It's maybe not the biggest
difference in the world, but you do notice that
little bit of extra fluidity. Any game that has an
unlocked frame rate right now will work out of the
box on the Razer phone with these higher refresh rates, but even if it is going
to be locked at 60 hertz, you're still going to get the benefits of having that variable refresh rate. So for example, if the frame
rate drops a little bit lower, the screen is going to stay with it, exactly like something like FreeSync or G-Sync works on the desktop. Inside, the Razer phone
has about as high end specs as you would imagine. So it has a Snapdragon 835 processor, a pretty impressive
eight gigabytes of RAM, as well as 64 gigs of
storage, and you can expand that via microSD. And since this is a phone
that's meant for gaming, it does have a pretty sizeable
4,000mAh battery, and that's backed up with
Qualcomm's Quick Charge 4.0+, which should recharge the battery by about 50% in 30 minutes. As far as cameras go, around
back you get a pair of 12 megapixel shooters, one wide angle, and one telephoto. So somewhat similar to the iPhone, what you're getting here,
you can get a pretty decent wide shot, but if you
zoom in a little bit, it switches automatically
to the telephoto. Just considering the world. - Hey Austin, this is Razer. - Boom. Got that Mark L. action. I can't judge the camera
too much just yet, but it seems to be pretty decent, as long as you have good light like this. Now one thing I will say
is that it would be nice to have a button to switch
between the wide angle and the telephoto. Right now you zoom in on the camera app, and it automatically switches. So it does have an eight
megapixel front facing camera, but it looks a little bit soft. The Razer phone is available
for pre-order starting today, and will be shipping on
November 17th for $700. So this guy's going to ship unlocked, and will work on GSM carriers
such at AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. Now $700 is definitely a lot,
but considering the specs, and especially considering
just how good the screen and speakers are, it might be worth a look if you're interested in gaming, which you know, if you want a
Razer phone, you probably are. Anyway, what do you guys
think about the Razer phone? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Windows Phone launched seven years ago; however, today, it's on life support. Why does it still exist in 2017? First of all, we have the Alcatel Idol 4S. You know, what's interesting
about this phone is that, not only can you get the Windows version, but there's also an Android edition, which is essentially the same hardware. Even though this is a little
bit more of a mid-range phone, when you actually take a look
at it, it looks really nice. So, what you're getting here
is a large 5.5-inch display and some nice features,
like a fingerprint reader, as well as, a glass back
and a metal chassis. And, because we've got the
Windows Phone version here, we also have a VR headset,
which comes in a box. So, it looks very much
like something like Gear VR and I'm actually curious. I've never tried a Windows Phone that actually has any kind of VR support. Oh, wow, this is actually
really nice packaging. What you're getting here,
especially for 200 bucks, is pretty solid. This should be the full
Continuum experience. What?! I will say the hardware of
this guy definitely is not on par with the Idol. It's very much plasticky and
the bezels are pretty giant. But again, 230 bucks,
including all of this stuff. One of the most promising features of Windows 10 Mobile is Continuum. So, paired with this dock,
which gives you not only USB3 and HDMI, as well as a
couple of USB2 ports, is that you can take your phone, dock it, and once you have a mouse,
keyboard, and monitor, essentially this single
device can do double duty, as your phone, as well as your desktop. At least, in theory. The last phone I took a look at that ran Continuum was the HP Elite x3 and, to be fair, that
was a very premium phone, but also came with a premium
price tag of about $700. The Acer, in theory, supports all of the same Continuum
features and there's a lot of potential here. However, it feels like it
really isn't fully baked. So, we take a look at it, once
you're actually plugged in to the dock and a monitor. This looks very much
like standard Windows. However, once you actually get into it, you realize that this is
definitely not a full copy. One of the big problems here is that everything is just really slow. Now, say we're in Edge and,
yes, we can kind of scroll, but it's very jerky. It's not particularly
smooth and that's annoying. I mean, sure, this is phone hardware, so you shouldn't expect it
to be as fast as a laptop, but this is a lot slower. On top of that, there's just not that much that you can actually do. So, to be fair, the Microsoft Edge browser
is fairly full-featured, but once you actually
open up the Windows menu, you'll see that, beyond the standard apps that come with Windows
Phone, there's not a lot of extra support. This guy does not run
full Windows applications. It's really disappointing, because Continuum feels
way ahead of its time. And phones like the Galaxy
S8 have actually supported a very similar sort of
setup and, honestly, have done it a lot
better, which just sucks. I mean, come on. This is Microsoft. If anyone is gonna pull off
running Windows on a phone and on a desktop, it's going to be them. With the Idol 4S, the big
feature is the VR headset that comes in the box and I
am actually kind of curious to see how this is going to work. I'm actually not totally
sure how this is connected, since it actually doesn't
connect via USB-C. But I do have some buttons here. I will say it is a 1080p screen, which makes it a little
bit sketchy looking, but let's just see. So, I'm in a 360 video right now and I mean, the tracking looks okay. I mean, it's VR. It works. I guess. I mean, the 360 effect looks okay, but it's nowhere near as polished
as something like Gear VR. I honestly don't think anyone would spend some serious time at this. Gimmicks aside, what I'm curious about is how usable Windows Phone is today. So, the big downsides to
basically all Windows Phones, besides this and a couple
of the more recent ones, such as the HP, is that they
are no longer supported. So, Windows Phone 7, Windows Phone 8.1, none of these are gonna
be getting any updates and, if the rumors are true, Windows 10 is actually not going to be that much farther behind. To be fair, there are some
apps that are still supported on Windows Phone, mostly
because a lot of the apps that are meant for the Windows
10 store will run here. When you look through the top category, the apps are pretty slim. Once you get past a few of the main ones, there's not a lot that's still
going to run on this phone. It is very clear that the software is what's
holding back these phones. 'Cause the hardware,
actually, isn't too bad. So, with the Acer, not only are you getting
a 1080p AMOLED display, which looks pretty nice, but
it also has a Snapdragon 808. Maybe not the newest thing in the world, but totally decent. And yet, not a lot actually works. The Idol 4S even bumps that
up to a Snapdragon 820. You're still getting the
nice glass and metal build and there are a lot of
nice little features, like having the fingerprint sensor, as well as the dual front-firing speakers. Something that does hold up
pretty well on both phones, however, are the cameras. Ah, that's actually not bad. So, the Idol 4S actually
does a lot with HDR to pull everything in here. Now, with the Acer, man,
the camera apps are not bad on these phones, but it
is really, really slow to take an HDR photo. These look pretty similar,
but I actually have to give it to the Acer here, especially
when you look really up and close, there's a little
bit less compression. You can see a lot more
detail on the tiles. To me, it's pretty obvious
that Windows Phone is on its way out. Now, yes, you can get pretty good deals on phones that are still
technically supported, but don't expect much of a future here. Unless you are a hardcore Windows fanboy, it is really difficult to
recommend picking up one of these in 2017, but
what do you guys think? Let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This plain-looking box contains
one of the most exciting laptops I've seen in quite a while. This is the Dell XPS 13. I really do like the LG Gram. So, we've already done
a full video on this. What's nice is, is that
when I'm at the office, I can plug it in via USB-C
to a monitor and use it like a desktop for stuff
like email and notes. When I'm on the go, not only
does it have some of the best battery life I've ever tested, but it's also super
lightweight and portable. That's where the XPS 13 comes in. (tapping) (thudding)
Ahhhhh. So the XPS 13 has been around
for a couple years now. But, this is the most recent version. What makes it really
special is that it is one of the very first laptops to ship with the eighth generation
Intel Core processors. Now, normally, that doesn't
sound like it would be any kind of huge difference, but in this case, it means that it's going to be a lot faster. At least, I hope so. One of the nice things about
the XPS 13 is that it actually is made out of aluminum. I can immediately tell that,
while it is definitely a little bit heavier than the Gram,
it feels really substantial. Pop this guy open, and one
of the first things you're going to see is the fairly
large 13.3-inch display and a very, very small chassis. So, when the XPS 13 first came out, this sort of bezel was really impressive. Now, it's getting a
little bit more common, but it still looks really nice. The outside of the XPS 13 is all aluminum, but on the inside it has
this carbon fiber finish. It actually feels pretty good. It almost feels a little bit more rubbery than you would expect out of carbon fiber. But, it's nice and comfortable. There's also a nice selection of ports. So, not only do we have our power in, but we also have a Thunderbolt 3 port, which you can also use
to power the laptop, a USB 3.0 port, headphone jack, as well as the battery indicator, which looks like it's dead, which is cool. If we flip it over to the other side, what you're going to find
is another USB 3.0 port as well as a full size SD card reader. Having that Thunderbolt 3 port is nice, as not only does it
double as a USB-C port, but you can also do stuff like
connect a 4K monitor to it, accept power in, and in
theory, you could connect it to an external GPU for
better gaming performance, although unfortunately, it
only uses two lanes of PCIe, which means that's probably
not going to be a great idea. It will get bottlenecked. The display is 13.3 inches
with a 1080p resolution, but it is not a touch screen. If you want that, you have to
upgrade to the 1800p model, which is a lot more expensive. Now, I actually like 1080p as I feel like it's a good sorta sweet spot between screen resolution
as well as battery life, and this panel is decent. So, the color is fine, viewing angles are solid. However, it just doesn't get quite as bright as I would like. The biggest problem with
the display is that means that the webcam has to be
put in the left corner, which means that it looks really weird. Not only are you looking up at my nose, but I'm always looking to
the side of the laptop. - Hey guys, this is Austin. This laptop might have some of the best battery life in the world. - And this laptop has
pretty decent speakers. So, one of my issues with the
Gram was that the speakers were a little bit tinny. However, here, even though
they're not front firing, they come out the sides, it sounds a lot better. I also like the keyboard and trackpad. So, the keyboard has nice
spacing, the feel is good, and it's backlit. The trackpad uses Windows
Precision drivers. So, no, it's not quite
as good as something like a glass trackpad on a MacBook,
but it is right up there. My only real issue is
that to get a touchscreen, you have to pay another $350, which to me is kind of hard to justify. What really makes this new
XPS 13 stand out though are those eighth
generation Core processors. Now, typically, when you
go from one processor to the next as far as generations go, it's usually not a huge difference. But with this guy, we're going
from dual-core processors to quad-core. And in a small, thin, and
light laptop like this, that makes a huge difference. This XPS 13 is powered by the i7-8550U. So, the base clock is 1.8 gigahertz, but it's almost always above that as you guys will see in a minute. It can turbo all the way
up to four gigahertz. Now, that's backed up by
eight gigabytes of RAM and a 256 gig NVMe SSD. Run this guy through Geekbench, I legitimately had to
triple check my results. Not only is this one of the
fastest laptops I've ever tested as far as single thread performance goes, but even with multi thread,
it is right up there with high-end Core i7s from
gaming laptops of last year. One thing to keep in mind
is that this is still a 15-watt processor, so
for longer, sustained use, such as gaming or rendering, you will see the clock speed start to dip. But, for most stuff like
video editing or web browsing, you're gonna see it be incredibly fast. Unfortunately, gaming
performance doesn't see the same kind of gains. So, here on Rocket League,
we're getting anywhere between 40 to 50 frames
per second at 720p quality, which is fine for lighter titles, but it's really not going
to see a major benefit over something like Skylake or Kaby Lake. Under normal usage, the
laptop is basically silent. However, once you fire
up something like a game or some video editing, you'll
see that the fan does get a little bit noisy. Dell claims that you can
get 13 hours of battery life streaming video, and about
22 hours of light usage, which might be a little
bit of an exaggeration, but with a 60 watt-hour battery,
it should absolutely last you all day. There is a lot to like with the XPS 13. So at $1300, I feel like this spec is a little bit expensive. However, once you can actually
get a Core i5 in this guy, and especially if they
added a more affordable touchscreen version, this
is gonna be hard to beat. I am really excited to see
these new processors roll out to more and more laptops. Having this much power in
such a thin and light laptop, honestly is a game changer for me. So, what do you guys
think about the XPS 13, as well as these new
eighth gen processors? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is
Austin, and welcome to yet another episode of Ken
Wastes Our Money on Amazon. This time, with an impressive $20 budget. You really kept yourself
kinda in-check this time. Single hand--is this a knife? What'd you get a knife for? Let me guess, when you got $20 to work with, you get a little violent. (laughs) All right, that's got some power. Um, I do have to ask though,
how is this mystery tech? This is just a really cool-looking knife. So if you're interested in the measure one-handed opening
knife, how much was this? Twenty bucks! A relative bargain. Item number two: a pillow? New cosplay. Ken, what did you do, what did you do? Oh, it's pink, I don't like pink. (laughs) Oh no. We all know what's
gonna happen now, right? So, Ken, can I ask, how much was this? Twenty dollars, yet again. A wonderful Ken Bolito purchase that I'm totally not regretting letting him use the company card for. What is our next item? Okay, you're just not even trying now. So we can see this is a customs declaration from Hong Kong post. Before we open this, Ken, can you confirm, is this actually tech yet, or no? - [Ken] Yes. (gasp) - You got me two bitcoin! How much were these? Twenty thousand dollars? (laughs) They're actual bitcoin. Hey Ken, I got you a raise. It's one whole bitcoin. Who said bitcoin wasn't real currency? I'm sure I can go and spend
this in my local bitcoin store. So we've got our bitcoin, we've got our onesie, we've got our knife. I'm afraid to ask, what's next? Why are you bringing over Cheetos? Okay, the world's smallest vacuum. Okay, this is actually kind of tech. How much is this? - [Ken] Twenty. - I think you overpaid. (laughs) So you know, when you watch
these videos, it's like, Oh, how to waste $60 on Amazon, how to waste $100 on Amazon. You're like, ha, that's kinda dumb. But literally, Ken wasted
all of our money on Amazon. Also, I just gotta say that my ankles are incredibly unhappy right now, just because like this is way too small. So just know that while
I look ridiculous up top, downstairs, whole 'nother story. (laughs) (laughter offscreen) (vacuum whirring) Well I have Cheeto all over my hands. Oh wow, that actually
kinda works, a little bit. This is my life now. (vacuum whirring) Anyway, I'd like to thank
you all for tuning in to this episode of I
don't know what happened. Ken probably has more products. I'm probably not done, but it makes me feel better thinking that I actually might be done with this video right now. A smart watch? Just when I think I'm
about to lose all hope, Ken drops the hot new tech on me. How much was this? - [Ken] Twenty. - Twenty bucks! All right, you know what,
let's just, enough of this. Let's get rid of all this crap. I like how the box just says Smart Watch as if, you know, you need to know anything more than it was a smart watch. Put this next to the Apple
Watch, though, and you can see that it's a little bit
thicker, some might say. All right, our smart
watch is up and running. Wait, what? Insert sim. Oh, oh, we're gonna
insert a sim all right. Oh, T-mobile, we are up and online. And by online, I mean, we have a sim card and a $20 smart watch because we make poor decisions I guess. Ken, hit me with your digits. Hello? - [Ken] Hello? - You were really quiet. This is the quietest phone
call I've ever been on. You can hear me. - [Ken] (mumbling) - I can't understand three words that you're saying right now. Is the $20 smart watch good? Not particularly. Is it better than the other tech that Ken got for this video? Absolutely. Next item please. Okay, a mysterious black
box that says Sound Cube. Oh, a speaker, all right. Oh, that actually looks kinda cool. So it's all metal around the outside, you gotta soft rubber foot on the inside. Curious what it actually sounds like. (rattling and buzzing) Ugh! Wha--? (warbled sound) You couldn't even plan this. It's like everything is either terrible, it's a joke from Ken, or it doesn't work. Okay, we're back up. (warbled music and static) I'm gonna try one more
thing, I'm gonna try one more thing, because
it worked for a second. It worked for like one second. - [Speaker] Hey guys, this is Austin, and today, my mission is very simple: to find the weirdest tech of CES 2018. And, uh, should be pretty easy. - Okay. - A lot of weird stuff here. So the razor booth is incredible-- - That actually does work. (warbled speech and static) It just breaks up for a few seconds. Okay, got it. Well, you almost got it, Ken. You were very close. Um, please tell me we're almost done, because this suit is incredibly warm. I've been informed that I need a laptop for this particular product. How much is this? - [Ken] Seven dollars. - Seven bucks? Okay. Seven bucks is better. (laid back music) Is that really it? Oh! (laughs) So if for some reason you've made it this far through the
video, and want even more, feel free to subscribe to the channel where Ken can torment me even more with this really, really dumb stuff. Anyway guys, thank you
so much for watching. And I'm going to go
reconsider my life decisions. (laid back music) 
- [Austin] Nearly five years later, the Xbox One has seen
some major improvements. And here are five reasons why you should buy one in 2018. Hey guys, this is Austin,
Reason number one! The Xbox One has seen
some massive improvements. Think back to 2013, at E3 that year, both the PS4 and Xbox One
was officially announced. And the Xbox had some
serious flaws to make up for. Not only was the PS4 a
more powerful console, but the Xbox was $100 more expensive. It came bundled with Kinect
which, at the end of the day, ended up being canceled a few years later. It had a bigger, uglier
design, and to top it all off, Microsoft had all kinds
of terrible misinformation on whether or not it would
actually support used games. Whereas Sony had a
slightly more elegant plan. - Thanks. - Since that moment though, Microsoft has essentially been playing catch up, and I think that's a good
thing for all gamers. So think of some of the
things that have changed since the original Xbox One launched. Not only have they seen some
major updates to the software, where you've seen three full revisions of the entire Xbox interface,
but they also did a lot to improve the hardware. So not only did they stop bundling Kinect, and eventually kill it off all together, but when they brought out the Xbox One S, the hardware pretty
much got rid of all the major problems that I had
with the original Xbox One. Namely, the giant power break, the ugly VCR styling, and they even added some features like an
ultra HD Blu-Ray player. Then came the Xbox One X last year. Not only did this completely blow away the original Xbox One, but even
the PS4 Pro and performance. But for the first time in over five years, Microsoft could confidently claim that they have the most
powerful console you could buy. Don't get me wrong, I
don't mean to say the PS4 has stood still in that
same period of time, but when you look back
at the launch Xbox One compared to what we have today, it's clear that Microsoft has
done a lot of catching up. That brings us to reason
number two: Exclusives. So Sony's early sales lead gave them a massive edge in a lot of
really cool exclusive titles for the actual PlayStation four. The idea that it was a
more powerful console definitely didn't hurt things. But over the last couple of years, and especially in 2017, the
Xbox teams stepped it up. PubG is one of the most popular games in the entire world
right now, and the only way to play on console is on the Xbox One. Now yes, it's an early access game, yes it does not quite match up to the PC as far as features and
especially performance. However the idea that this is a game that you can play on
even a $200 Xbox One S is pretty impressive, and
as an early access game, it actually has continued to
get a lot better over time. The Forza series has also been
one of my personal favorites, so I grew up playing Grand Turismo, however the yearly releases have not only mainlined Forza Motorsport games, but especially the
really fun Horizon games, have actually kept me
locked on the Xbox One ever since the beginning. Cuphead definitely took
a few years to come out, but the hand drawn art
style, and especially the incredibly tight gameplay, does a good job of making this
not only a Xbox exclusive, but something that really does
stand out on the platform. Other games are also on the way this year, including CrackDown Three, Sea of Thieves, and hopefully we get a
glimpse at the next Halo game. Now of course, the PS4 does have a huge library of exclusives, but there's still plenty of games that
are exclusive to the Xbox One, especially if you've never played it, makes now a great time to pick one up. Reason number three is performance. So for the first few years, the Xbox One, while a decent upgrade from the 360, stood no chance at all compared to the PS4 as far as performance goes. It was significantly less powerful, which meant that many games
ran at a low resolution, lower settings, or both. However all this changed
when the Xbox One X came out late last year. For $500, you are getting the most powerful console you can buy period. Not even the PS4 Pro comes close. Now sure, the PS4 Pro does do a good job of using checkerboard rendering to upscale images up to
4K, but for the most part, this does not look as
good as the Xbox One X, which will often run games at a close to, if not a full 4K resolution,
you can see the difference. This makes an interesting change. So on the base end, the PS4 games do look better than standard Xbox One, but if you jump up to
the One X and PS4 Pro, usually the One X looks better. It's especially noticeable
when it comes to big multi platform games. Now this isn't always the case. Sometimes PS4 Pro games can
actually look very close to their Xbox One X counterparts, but with more memory, and
more graphics horsepower, it's really hard to
argue that the Xbox One X is not the most powerful
console you can buy today. Reason number four has to do with price. While in the early days the Xbox One was a lot more expensive, that
is just not the case anymore. Take a quick look through
Amazon, and you'll find that the Nintendo Switch
is around $300 still, where the PS4 Slim is around $280, but the Xbox One S is
available as low as $220, and they're even some
pretty decent game bundles for $230 to $240. Now mind you, the Xbox has
a smaller 500GB hard drive, compared to one terabyte on the PS4, but it is really simple
to upgrade your storage later on down the line with an
USB based SSD or hard drive. Now things do change when you
jump up to the pro versions. So the PS4 Pro is pretty steady at $400, whereas the One X is an
additional $100, at $500. The $500 One X looks even better when you compare it to
the PC market right now. Now to be fair, gaming
PC's have had a hard year, considering how expensive
memory and graphics card are. But right now, it is just not possible for you to build a more powerful computer than the Xbox One X for less than $500. And that brings us to reason number five. Backward compatibility. Now back in the old days, pretty much all consoles would at least be able to play the last generation's games. However, the last few years,
in fact the last 10 years or so very few consoles have done it, with the exception of Xbox One. Now Sony does have
PlayStation Now for the PS4, which will allow you to
play a lot of PS3 games on your PS4, but the issue is, is that it is entirely
reliant on streaming. So what you're going to have to do is not only hope the game
you want to play is available in their catalog, but you're
going to have to pay for it. Either by purchasing the game again, or paying to rent it,
whereas on the Xbox side, you can not only just re-download games from the 360 you just already purchased, but you can just put the Xbox 360 disk in, let it take a quick download,
and you're good to play. From a technical point of view, it was really impressive what Microsoft was able to pull off here. They've essentially built
an entire Xbox 360 emulator, that runs on the Xbox One. So once you jump into a 360 game, it pretty much is like you're
playing on an actual 360. It reboots into a 360
mode, and you're gonna get pretty much all of the
features and the games to run, almost the same if not
even slightly better than they did on the original hardware. What's even cooler is that
if you have a Xbox One X, you can play some 360 games in full 4K. Now this doesn't work for all titles, when you consider that you're
getting a resolution boost pretty much nine time
the original hardware, titles like Fallout three and Halo three really do look incredible. Now not all Xbox 360 games
are supported on the One, but there's actually a
surprisingly large library, and Microsoft continues to
add games on a regular basis. What's also cool is that the Xbox One can now play original Xbox games. Admittedly, this game
library is a lot smaller than the 360 titles, but
it's a nice addition, and all of these are totally
usable with the original disc. So, unlike a lot of the
other options out there, you don't have to re-buy anything, you can just take your current disc, drop it in your Xbox,
and you're good to go. I think Microsoft deserves
some serious props for making that happen. The Xbox One is definitely not perfect, but if you never gave it a shot, now is a great time to
get into the Xbox One. Now, I'm curious. What do you guys think about the One? And what do you wanna
see me take a look at next time on five reasons? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. It is finally time for another Q and A. But, before we get into
it, this video is sponsored by Honor and their new View 10. So, I did an entire
series talking about it over on the Honor channel, with Jonathan Morrison and Sarah Detchee, and here's a sneak peek. - Here guys, Jonathan here,
back again with Austin Evans and Sarah Detchee. We just talked about AI, and I got a surprise. - A surprise? Oh boy, tell me what. - Close your eyes. - Okay.
- Don't close your eyes. - Okay.
(laughing) - Ohh, I think I know what this is. - What is it? - It is the Honor View 10. - Now, word on the street is, this is packin' some power inside. Now, what I think is cool is, if you measure it in the work environment. So, say your team all had
these in their pocket. - So, the idea that everyone has an actually smart assistant
to help them kind of not be late to work, or remember to text me when
you're coming in late to work. Not like anything specific I'm talkin' about.
- Or maybe a situation where you're out on production in
a different country, maybe? - And you'd have the actual translation. - Yeah, so I've been in
situations where you have to do interviews or meetings and, it's sometimes a little
hard to communicate when you don't know that language. - I think AI has a lot
to do with taking data and taking so much information
and really packing it into something that people can understand. So, especially, we make videos,
we collaborate with people, I think bringing that into the
workplace with collaboration saying, oh this person can't make it. Maybe your calendar updates, and depending on other
information, it makes new plans. I think that's exciting to--
- And the idea that having something smart that opens up
so many possibilities, right? Where it's like, you might
not necessarily think, oh, let me connect this dot with that dot, but the phone's like, oh, I
know this is what you're doing and this is who you're talking to. The more information it
knows and when it actually has some intelligence behind it, it can sort of connect a lot of dots and make your life easier in a lot of ways that you might not necessarily think of. What's the dumbest thing that's
completely ruined a video? We didn't quite lose the video, but there was a project that we shot, actually a few months
ago, where I deleted all the raw footage before it was finished. So, what I ended up doing
was I took the export that we had done, sort
of the temporary version, and then I just recut that and put it back together as a video. Since the house fire
happened and you moved, do you think it helped
or hindered your future compared to if it had never happened? Oh man, I think it helped. Things were going well for me before it. But, the fire was really kind
of like a wake up call to me and it was sort of a forced fresh start, which I like to think was a good thing. What is the difference
between your video editing and Ken's video editing? So, there's been some rumors going around that Ken edits all of our videos. However, that is completely false. Jimmy, care to comment? - Everyone's gonna find out what I finally do.
(Austin laughing) - So, the way we do
our edits is actually-- Jimmy does, I would say, 95% of our edits these days.
- Yep. - I'll do it a little bit here and there, but he's editing this video right now. - I am. - Make a thumbnail for
this video yourself. Don't let Ken do it. All right, so this is me. I'm very blurry. Then, this is Ken. Little known fact, I actually taught Ken how to make his thumbnails, and this is how every one of them starts. It's like this, and then,
here's a giant smile. 'Cause Ken's just a happy kind of guy. There you go. That is how to create a thumbnail. What was the transition like from being a single person rodeo to a
team, specifically with Ken? (laughs) Well, now it's great. But, I distinctly remember Ken's first day in which he forgot the lens
adapter and a microphone cable. Then, at one point, I'm
pretty sure I took the camera away from you and just shot myself. It was, uh, (laughs). How much of your Twitter
timeline is filled with Ken's anime retweets? Over 90%? All right, so for all of you
guys who are smart enough to follow Ken on Twitter, the best way of doing it
is to mute his retweets. Because Ken, he tweets some great stuff. His retweets, a little questionable. Hey Austin, when are you getting married? Just kidding, suggest some
best laptops for video editing. Generally speaking, gaming
laptops are pretty good for video editing, and I really like the Acer Predator Helios 300. So, not only does it have a GTX 1060, but it also has a core i7,
plenty of memory, an SSD. That's great. And if you're on the
final cut side of things, the MacBook Pro 15-inch has
been honestly what I've been using to do any kind of video editing for like, a year and a half now? When did you move to
LA and get the office? I actually moved to LA in August of 2015. I was literally driving from
Missouri to LA on my birthday. I originally actually
worked out of John's office. So, you guys probably know John from TLD. I worked out of his office
for almost a year actually until we got this office
that we've been in for the last year and a half or so. That's when Ken came on. That's where we just kinda really started building things up. But, yeah it's been a little
over two years at this point. What piece of tech are you
most excited to see at CES? I feel like what I'm
really, really pumped to see is more on the AI side of things. The self-driving side of things. I know that this CES
actually got to ride in a BMW that was fully self-driving. Or essentially fully self-driving. I was able to drive on the freeway, take my hands off the wheel, talk to Ken in the backseat, and it totally just handled everything. So, being able to see more
stuff like that this year would be awesome. Do you think Bitcoin is
going to fall down sometime, and have you invested in it? I don't think it's going
anywhere any time soon, to be totally honest. I think that it's going up. It's a little wild and volatile right now. But, generally speaking,
I think it is sort of trending upward, and I haven't
invested my life savings in it, but I do think
that there's potential, and I've put a little
bit of money into it. Does Ken ever get frustrated
or annoyed between takes? He just seems so chill all the time. You guys have no idea. I live a personal hell every day. I think I'm on camera and
everything's happy and great, and I'm having a great time. Then, Ken's just yelling orders at me, "Do it again! "You can do better than that. "I'm not feeding my family with this." It's honestly kind of sad. He pretends to be chill,
but honestly it's not safe. I... I need help. To Ken: how annoying is it to
work with the "Hey guys" guy? - Not as annoying to me
as it probably is to Jimmy since he has to edit every video. At least I can listen to
music while Austin's talking, so I can block it all out. - Hey Austin, what's your
favorite fast food restaurant? I used to say Taco Bell, but
since I moved to California, it's gotta be In-N-Out. How much has life changed
since the start of your YouTube channel? So, I was actually reminded
of this the other day. Someone tweeted me a screenshot
from a comment I left on a Marquez video seven years ago, talking about my 2009 was
great and I was basically totally committed to
making videos in 2010. So, a lot. When I started the channel, I was 16, living at home. Didn't have a job. Didn't have any money. Didn't have anything. I think compared to then, I feel like I'm a different person. Like, if we're being totally honest, I had not really fully grown
up when I started the channel. I didn't really understand
a lot of things in life. I feel like my life could
not have possibly turned out to be any more different if I
had not created the channel, and not made that first video. I honestly can't even
picture where I would be if I would have gotten
that job at Best Buy and sort of lived in Missouri forever. It's kind of scary to think
about it to be totally honest. Anyway, that is going to
be it for this Q and A. Of course, if you guys
have any more questions, feel free to hit me up on Twitter, and as always, Ken will
catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. And today, I'm here with a
brand new $500 gaming PC build except this one, well,
these guys built it. While I was out of the office
for a day, Ken and Jimmy took it upon themselves
to get a little creative with the next PC build. - What do we want the PC to
actually look like though? - It definitely needs a window. We could easily do like a bloody
hand print from the inside. You know, like a little
saw trap or something? - Oh yeah. - So where do you want us
to start, a case first? Okay, so that's like right in the front, so that's easy enough. So I feel like if we, these
are usually in the back corner. - Yeah, Jimmy knows like
the layouts and stuff. - This one has the exact same
layout as the one in Michigan. - Look at this guy. - Are we going for full size
like ATX or microATX or what? - I think we go for ATX and work back. - Okay, 49.99. - That's cheap, and it got
a window and look the slots. - Oh, it's got red accents. - Alright, if we wanted to do
just straight up a 500 watt card or 500 watt power supply. - That's hard to beat $18. - A cheap power supply like this might not be the craziest thing. - This looks really cheap, like
the box looks really cheap. - It feels like a fireworks box. - This looks marginally better. - Yeah okay, that one is $30. - $30, okay so we'll put this. - [Austin] Questionably
cheap power supply in hand, Ken and Jimmy moved on to
making some more mistakes. - That Penny owned G 4400. - [Jimmy] Is only 55. - Is only $55, so this
motherboard costs $60. - [Jimmy] Which is cheap. - Which is pretty cheap. - We're still, I think
we're still under budget. - I think we're doing
pretty fine right now. So if we get this, let's say right? - Yeah, is there a big difference between just a 1050 and a 1050TI? This one's only $93 bucks. - Yeah no, I think if we
wanted to go super budget, that might not be the worst move. - So we penny crunched a
little bit but we have a little bit more money to spend here. - Yeah, so we're gonna
look out for some SSDs which they're actually reasonably priced. - [Austin] So naturally,
the next place to go is the Halloween store because reasons. - I mean that looks like the best one. 'Cause glow in the dark
will probably not look good inside the area. - I think this is good, this
one's really fake looking. - This one, this is the one that we want. - If we get a little bit of fake blood and put it on that,
it'll look a lot better. $10, so we're good, this is
$4, so we have a little bit of extra money to spend here. Is there like a little
thing where we can get like some spiders or. - Oh, let's get like fake,
like fake spiders and stuff. $3 each, so how much
money do we have left? - Like $13. - So let's get two. - So we just finished the
Halloween decoration portion of this and I think we did pretty well. - Yeah, like so we walked
out of there spending $23 so if my math is right, I
think we have $4 leftover. - Yeah, so we're actually
under budget here so Austin, you should be
pretty proud of us on this one. - So we've been sitting
in about three hours worth of traffic to come back to work
but we got all of our stuff for our PC but we also
got some Halloween stuff to help design this thing
and make it our own. Like I've never actually
done any case moding before and I think this is the nine
year old arts and crafts version of what every
other PC YouTuber does but I'm excited. (Jimmy laughs) (grooving hip hop beat) Alright, so Jimmy did a
really awesome job putting all of the spider webs in here. We got some not actual spiders
but some really okay looking like classic spiders
but they'll do the job. - They'll look good in the light. - Exactly, and now Jimmy
is going to do the blood hand splatter on the glass
for the inside of the case. - So I'm gonna do a little
bit of black just to. - Yeah, add texture to it. - Make it look like a scary movie. - That's good. - Alright, so I'm gonna
get my over-sized hand just nice and, I want to make sure there's not a lot of black on there. Just gonna do a real perfect, aw. - Do like a slide, like a taper off. - I don't know if it'll ruin it. - [Ken] Oh. (laughs) - There we go. Oh my god, I'm so happy
about this. (laughs) Oh my god, that actually
looks really good. So hopefully it dries well,
I'm going to go wash this off my hands now because I
don't want it to dry on me. - We've got all the cable
management out of the way, we've got our graphics thing sorted out, we got Windows installed, - We got webbed up. - We got even more webbed up. - So now we're gonna spin it around, get it all going, we're gonna turn it on. - Get a load of this. - In its finished form. Oh my god guys, we've
been at this all day. Gotta say, I'm pretty
stocked, this is awesome. - Ready, woo, oh my god. - I gotta see this. - Whoa, that looks. (laughs) That is so sick, oh and you
can see the little spider in there, that is so good, it's so good. - We haven't played any
games yet and honestly it is 11:13, I don't think we're
gonna play games tonight but we will try to come
out tomorrow and reveal the whole thing to Austin and hopefully he'll like it. - So I was gone on Friday
and these guys took the lead on building the PC but
from the little bits that I've heard so far, they
may have gone a little bit over the top with it. - [Jimmy] There you go. - (laughs) Whoa, this
is actually really cool. I was expecting this to
be terrible, no offense. This is actually really cool. - [Ken] Yeah, don't worry, we thought it was going
to be terrible too. - The cable management
is sufficiently spooky, I'm already terrified. Alright, I gotta crack this open, let's see what you guys got here. - I also like the narrative
too, like the hand. - Yeah, so basically the
hand was trying to escape and then like punched out the front. - [Ken] Exactly, yeah. - Ah, have no idea where
my graphics card is. - [Ken] It is a 560, an RX 560. - A 560, okay? And some intel, what is this? A B250, is like a Pentium or something? - [Ken] Yeah, it's a Pentium 4400 G 44. - Okay, I'm pretty excited although what is this power supply? - [Ken] It is a not A+
and it was only $23. - That's a no, don't do that. Why would you buy a $23 power supply? - [Jimmy] Because it was 681 watts. - No it's not. (all laugh) - Our main goal was literally
just to get this game running. I wish I had an audio, what's going on? - [Jimmy] Yeah, so you would
be able to hear them coming. - Alright, I'm just
gonna die, that's fine. Oh, there it is. So if you guys want to
catch more spooky PC builds with these guys, make sure
to subscribe to the channel and if you'll excuse me, I'm
going to play some Outlast and probably die a bunch more. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the new Surface laptop. Is it worth it? A big shout out to
Microsoft for hooking us up with this Surface laptop early. Now this is not a sponsored video, but they're cool enough
to let us take a look at it before it actually goes on sale. So this is the mid-spec model. What I'm really curious to find out is what is a Surface laptop like to use? So Microsoft has been making
Surfaces for quite a while, but they've definitely never
done a laptop quite like this. There's the Surface Pro, which
is much more like a tablet. And there's the Surface Book,
which is kind of a laptop but it also is detachable
and its a little bit unwieldy whereas this is a proper,
honest-to-goodness laptop. Did I just say honest-to-goodness? Inside we get the power adaptor. So what's cool about this one, and something that actually I think that more people should do, is it actually has a
USB port on the adaptor. So not only can you charge your Surface, but you can also plug
something like your phone in. This, is the laptop itself. My first impression of the Surface laptop is that this feels like a really
high end piece of hardware. So unlike previous Surfaces, which were made out of magnesium, this is all aluminum and it feels awesome. On top of that when
you look on the inside, you'll see that instead
of having a metal cover for the keyboard, it's actually lined in this Alcantara fabric finish. What this allows Microsoft to do is offer some really cool looking colors. So this is burgundy, and I've gotta say, it looks like no other
laptop I've ever tried. So on the inside, you still
get that same Alcantara, but in the red, it really does pop. This Alcantara finish does feel nice, but I'm curious how it will hold up over a few months or years of use. I can definitely imagine
with your palms sitting on the rest all the
time that maybe it could get a little bit stained or dirty. Now that's not a huge problem with the Surface Pro 4 keyboard, which of course you can just take off and replace with something else, whereas with something like
this, it's pretty much stuck on. I don't think there's
any way of taking that... Nah, it's definitely not coming off there. For comparison, I've been
spending a lot of time with the LG gram lately. Now this is a very lightweight laptop which is nice in that
definitely not the case with the Surface laptop. Now that's not exactly a huge downside. That extra heft does make this feel like a very premium product, but also is going to weigh
a bit extra in your bag. One slight issue with the
Surface hardware are the ports. So on the right side, all
we have is the magnetic Surface connector, which
is mostly used for charging or dropping it on the dock. But on the other side, the
only other ports we have are a headphone jack, mini
DisplayPort, as well as USB3. There's no USBC, there's no thunderbolt, and there's only that single USB port. It would be nice if there
was a little bit more. Especially on a high end laptop like this. The big elephant in the
room with the Surface laptop though is Windows 10 S. Unlike the full standard
version of Windows 10 that most laptops come with, this guy is running the S edition. Now what this means is
that it cannot run any apps that are not from inside
the Windows Store. However, say you wanna
download some third party app such as Google Chrome, too bad, it's not going to be in the store. To be fair, there are a fair few apps that are available in the store, such as Netflix, Facebook and VLC, but the issue is, say
you need to install some weird piece of hardware that
needs a program to set it up. Well, that wouldn't work on Windows 10 S, unless that driver's going
to automatically install once you plug the device
in, you're out of luck. Now I get the general idea of having Windows 10 S as an option. So say you're going to
be buying a budget laptop and to save a few bucks, they decide to use the S version
instead of Windows 10. Same thing goes for
say if you're at school and you want to make sure that the kids aren't installing random malware.exe, that's fine, that's great. However, this is a $1300 laptop, and the idea that I can't
even install Google Chrome on it is a big issue. The good news is you can
upgrade the Surface laptop to full Windows 10 Pro for free. The only problem is, you can only do that until the end of the year. After that, it will cost you $50 to do. The good thing is the
upgrade from 10 S to Pro actually only took about three minutes. And now we have the full copy
of Windows on the laptop. Inside, the Surface laptop
has fairly standard specs. So this is the mid-tier version, which will run you $1299, and for that, you get a seventh generation
Core i5 processor, eight gigabytes of memory,
as well as a 256 gig SSD. I feel like I'm going to
keep making this comparison, but that's literally the exact same spec as you get with the LG gram, which coincidentally costs a
couple hundred dollars less. This guy is rocking a 13.5 inch display with a weird resolution of 2256 by 1504. What that means is, it actually
is a really nice display. Not only is it sharp, it
has really nice color, contrast, viewing angles,
all the standard stuff and to top it all off,
it's a touch screen. Hey guys, this is Austin. My voice might be gone, but
what isn't is the MacBook Air. What also isn't are the speakers. This actually sounds pretty good. The keyboard also is pretty solid. So it does feel very similar
to what you would find on the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover, but that's not really a bad thing. Now with a Windows 10 laptop, generally I wanna use the touch screen more than the trackpad, but as
far as Windows trackpads go, I don't really have a lot to
complain about at all here. Alright, so we are up and
running with Overwatch. Now this is definitely not a gaming PC, but you can play some lighter titles. And here we're running at
900p on low and it is usable. However, luckily we have a professional MLG Overwatch player, named Savage Kenny. - The frame rate is, not ideal, I mean we're
hitting frame rates that are definitely usable. But if you're especially taking
Overwatch very seriously, I find it really hard
to like what I'm getting out of this laptop. Oh my god. - Once you upgrade Windows
10 S, the Surface laptop is a solid piece of hardware. However the value is just a
little bit hard to justify. Don't get me wrong, this
is a terrific laptop, but for the price,
you're definitely paying a little bit extra for
that nice build quality and for that terrific screen. So, what do you guys think
about the Surface laptop? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey, guys, this is Austin! If you're looking for a
laptop for back to school, I have a few options you
might want to consider. Everything from $200 to over a thousand. First off, we have this 14-inch HP laptop. Now, at first glance, it looks
just a little bit old school. However, for a little bit over $200, there's a lot to like here. It has a solid selection of ports, with VGA, Ethernet, HDMI,
and three USB ports. Now, what's a little
bit weird with this guy is that it is actually cooled by fan. So a lot of the budget
Intel laptops are fanless. However, this AMD option does have a fan, but thankfully, it's not too loud. This guy is powered by a
quad-core AMD E2 processor with four gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigs of eMMC storage. Now, that processor is not going to be incredibly powerful. It's actually very
similar to what's inside the Xbox One and PS4. Although, obviously, in this
case, a little bit slower. But, the important thing is,
it's going to be totally fine for basic usage, and again, this is $200. That AMD processor is a little bit unusual in budget laptops, but it's not that bad. So when it comes to more
heavy usage, such as gaming, it's not going to be
great, but for normal stuff like watching video, it's not bad. Hey, guys, this is Austin! It has been nearly four
years since the original Nintendo 2DS came out. What's also pretty solid is the display. So, for $220, we're getting
a full 1080p IPS panel. Now, yes, it is not quite
as bright as I would like. However, for this price, this
is about as good as it gets. It might not be a powerhouse, but if you're just looking
for a budget laptop to get the job done, this is
definitely worth considering. If you've got a little bit
more budget to work with, you may want to consider picking
up the ASUS VivoBook E403. At just a little bit under
$400, while it's not a huge jump over the HP, there a lot of little things that definitely add up. So I actually did a
video on this last year, but it's still pretty
much totally up to date. And what's nice about this guy is that for only a little bit more than the HP, you're getting something
that feels a lot nicer. Now, yes, it is still plastic. But it's thinner, it's lighter, and it just feels like
a more premium laptop. This guy also has a
solid selection of ports with an HDMI, a USB 3,
USB Type-C, which is nice. And if you flip it over,
we're also going to get an additional USB Type-A as
well as an SD card reader. While this might not be
the most powerful laptop in the world, it can
definitely get the job done. So inside, it's rocking a
quad-core Intel Pentium processor, four gigabytes of memory, as well as 128 gigabytes of eMMC storage. You can do a bit of very
light gaming on this guy, but it really is meant
for more normal usage. And for that, it does a good job. So it also has a solid 1080p
panel with good speakers, solid trackpad, keyboard. There's really no one part of
this laptop that falls apart. Moving on, we have the Lenovo Z50. So this is the middle ground
between a budget laptop and something that can handle gaming. At $370, this guy's all about
cramming the maximum amount of specs into the cheapest
possible computer. Of course, you guys want more information. I did a full video on this very recently. In fact, most of these
laptops, I've already done full videos on, but there's
a lot of interesting quirks with this guy. This is the biggest laptop
here with 15.6-inch display, but that's also probably
it's biggest weakness, as it is only a 1366 by 768 resolution. On such a big screen, it
just doesn't look great. And on top of that, it's
a fairly low-end TN panel, which means the color, and
especially viewing angles and contrasts, could be a lot better. The upside is that it has an
AMD FX-7500 quad-core APU, eight gigabytes of RAM, and
Radeon R7 integrated graphics. Now, yes, it's not going
to crush Crysis at 4K, but for $400, you're
going to be hard-pressed to find a more powerful gaming laptop. With a game like Rocket
League, we're able to get pretty solid performance. So, playing at 768p, which
is the max resolution of the screen on quality settings, we're getting right between
40 to 50 frames per second. I can actually hit the ball. (laughs) I totally just missed
the ball twice on camera. That's totally gotta go in. It's definitely not perfect,
but if you're just looking for pure bang for the buck performance, you should check it out. Stepping up the budget a little bit, we have the Lenovo Y700 at $750. What I like about this is that even though it's a gaming laptop, it's
actually nicely well-rounded. With a 14-inch display, it's
still somewhat portable, but you have plenty of room for gaming, and I actually really like the look of it. A lot of gaming laptops can
be a little bit over the top, but with this, it's actually
a fairly subtle design. Inside, it has fairly powerful specs. With an Intel Core i7-6700HQ
quad-core processor, 16 gigabytes of DDR4 memory, as well as dedicated
Radeon R9 370 M graphics. Jumping into a game like Overwatch, this is totally playable. So on 1080p, on medium
settings, we're getting anywhere between 40 to 60 frames, depending on how much action's going on. But regardless, this
is very much playable. This guy also has a 256-gigabyte M2 SSD, paired with a one-terabyte hard drive. And when you put it all together, not only is this a solid
laptop for taking with you every day, but it can
definitely handle some gaming. Moving away from gaming, we
have the LG gram 13 at $1,000. So there's a lot to like with this guy. It is hands-down my favorite
Ultrabook right now. One of the main reasons for that is that while it's not only super light, but it also has very, very
small bezels on the display, making this incredibly portable. The gram comes in 13, 14,
and 15 in screen sizes, but regardless, you're
getting a really nice-looking 1080p IPS panel. Color, contrast, and
especially viewing angles are going to be on point. And most of them, this 13-inch included, also come with a touch screen. I've said it a lot of times
before, but with Windows 10, a touchscreen laptop just makes sense. Specs are fairly standard
for an Ultrabook. It has a Core i5-7200U processor, eight gigabytes of RAM,
and a 256-gigabyte SSD. This, of course, is not a gaming PC, but it's pretty snappy for normal use. Now, on top of the screen being nice, it's also updated with a nice keyboard, and especially a solid trackpad with Windows Precision drivers. And this model also comes
with a fingerprint sensor. The real star of the show
here, though, is battery life. So, LG claims that it can last
up to 15 hours on a charge, and that's not crazy. With that 60-watt-hour
battery, I have never killed it in a single day. So, if you're looking for
a laptop that not only has solid battery life, but
it's also super portable, check out the LG gram. In the same category,
we have the brand-new Microsoft Surface Pro, which
ranges anywhere from $800 to a lot, lot more. So this might seem like a
little bit of a weird choice, but I actually think the Surface
would make a lot of sense for back to school. So, yes, it is definitely a tablet, and because of that, it's
going to be nice and portable. But once you put the
actual Type Cover on it, this is not a bad laptop replacement. You are getting incredibly
nice hardware here. Everything's made out of metal. Especially once you
pull out the Type Cover and pop the kickstand,
what you're seeing here is that there's a ton of flexibility. It is really, really well-built. This guy comes in quite a
few different configurations, but the one I have here
is the mid-spec model with the Core i5, eight gigs of RAM, and 256 gigs of SSD storage. Now, what's cool is, the Core i5 here is actually going to be fanless. So not only is it going
to be nice and quiet, but on top of that, it
has crazy battery life, 13 and a half hours. It also has the best screen here with a 12.3-inch PixelSense display, which, of course, is not only touchscreen, but it also supports the new Surface pen. And it also has some cool other features, like facial log-in with Windows Hello. And of course, you get the
whole thing in a tablet package. So yes, it can be a little bit pricey, especially once you add
the actual keyboard, which is basically not even an option, but the Surface Pro is
definitely worth a look if you're going back to school. As always, I'll have links
to all of these laptops in the description, and I've
also done dedicated videos on a lot of them. So feel free to go check
those out, and I'm curious. Which one of these
laptops would you pick up? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Recently, we took a look
at a $400 gaming laptop, But this time, we're
going to see what happens When you take it up a notch. This is the Lenovo Y700. It's a 14 inch gaming laptop which, for $750, has a lot going for it. So the first thing I see is it actually looks like it
has a carbon-fiber finish. I mean, that is definitely plastic, but it actually looks pretty nice. Inside here, we have the
power cable, some paperwork, what I assume is the power adapter which is, actually pretty big. Open this guy up and
not only do we have the 14 inch display, but we also have what's actually really well-built, there's very little keyboard flex. It's a backlit keyboard, it's all metal around the palm rest. This feels like a pretty premium laptop. For ports, its pretty straightforward. We have a power adapter,
a single USB port, As well as headphone and microphone. And on this side, we have two more USB 3, HDMI and ethernet. This is definitely a gaming laptop, But I'm glad that Lenovo
went a little more subtle with the styling. For the most part, it's just a black laptop with a few red accents. Sure, maybe like the speakers look A little bit gamer-y,
but for the most part once you close it up, it's actually a fairly understated looking laptop. Compared with the Inspiron 15 that we did a video on a few months ago, the Lenovo is a lot smaller, which I like. Especially if you're
going to be taking this to something like school, its going to be a little
bit more portable. but also, it really does
look a lot more understated. While this is not a bad-looking laptop, the whole Spider-Man aesthetic is not going to be for everyone. One of the big advantages
is with the display. So this guy is rocking a
14 inch, 1080p IPS panel, which looks a lot better than
the TN panel on the Dell. Now, while this looks good as is, for right now, you can
actually get this exact same model with a 4K display on
Amazon for the same price. Now sure, it won't be able to game at 4K, but for normal use, that is going to look really, really nice at 14 inches. - [From Laptop] Hey guys, this is Austin. The Galaxy Note 7 was one of the hottest phones of last year. - Terrible puns aside, the
speakers are pretty solid here. So they're actually front-facing and from the looks of them,
they're actually reasonably big. They don't get super
loud, but no complaints. What is pretty good is the keyboard. So like I said earlier, it is going to be backlit which is nice and the travel is pretty decent. Lenovo does a good job
with keyboards usually. Now the trackpad isn't quite so amazing. So, its totally usable, but it doesn't use the Windows precision
drivers, which means that, its fine but for pretty much anything more than a quick little bit of use, you're going to want a mouse. Inside, this guy is powered
by a quad core i7-6700HQ 16 gigabytes of DDR4 memory, as well as Radeon R7 M375 graphics. It stacks up pretty well
compared to the Dell. Now while is Skylake processor compared to Kaby Lake on this guy, it's going to be an i7 versus an i5, which I would definitely prefer. It has twice as much memory. It also has a 256 gigabyte SSD on top of a 1 terabyte hard drive. This guy only has the SSD. The main thing you're giving up here is that 1050Ti on the Dell. Now the Radeon graphics should be pretty decent here and it is $100 cheaper, so let's see how it performs. First up, we have CS:GO. Now this is by no means a new game, but it still runs pretty
well on the Lenovo. We're getting somewhere between
60 to 80 frames per second, and this is with everything cranked up on high settings at 1080p,
as I get shot in the face. (laughs) Next, we have Shadow of Mordor. This is a little bit of a newer game and importantly, it looks
a lot nicer than CS:GO. Now the issue here is that we do have to turn settings down just a little bit. So right now we're running
at 900p on Medium and we're getting anywhere between
30 and 40 frames per second. It is playable, but it's not the greatest experience in the world. I think that's kind of
a trend with the Lenovo. It can definitely handle gaming, no doubt, but for a lot of newer titles,
you are going to have to turn the settings down
to around medium or so. One game the Y700 can
definitely handle is Overwatch. So again here on 1080p at medium settings, we're anywhere between 40
to 50 frames per second. It's a pretty good experience, but one of the nice things about the Lenovo is it can handle more than just gaming. Taking that same gameplay
footage that we just recorded and bring it inside
Adobe Premiere, you can see that this is also not a bad editing PC. So with stuff like a Core
i7 and 16 gigs of RAM, inside Premiere, that
actually runs pretty well. Now, to be fair, this
is only 1080p footage, but we are playing it at full resolution and even stuff like scrubbing through the timeline is nice and smooth. The Lenovo Y700 definitely isn't a perfect gaming laptop, but there's a lot to like here. The screen is great, the specs are pretty solid. The only real issue here is that the graphics could just be better. But, for the price, there's
not a lot to complain about. So, as always, I'll have a link to check this guy out in the description. I'm curious, would you
want to pick up the Y700? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
(exciting music) - Hey guys, this is Austin. Not exactly what you
were expecting, right? This is the Dyson Cyclone V10. I know what you're probably thinking. Why am I doing a video on a vacuum? However, when Dyson reached out and wanted to sponsor a
video on this brand new V10, I gotta say, there's actually
some pretty cool tech inside. What makes the Dyson V10 interesting, is that not only is today the launch but this is the first in their
next generation of vacuums. So from here on out,
while they'll still sell some of the current models, all new models are going to be cord free. Pop it open and the first thing we see is some paperwork on how to solve
your problems with Dyson. We also get the activate your warranty which is going to be for two years and there's actually a
lot of vacuum pieces. So what's interesting about this is you're actually going
to be able to use it as a bit of a convertible. So not only is it going to be a standard sort of upright vacuum,
but you can also use it in a little bit more of a handheld mode. So inside here is going
to be where you're going to find the motor, the cyclone. That actually is not too heavy. There should be a battery in here. (vacuum whirs) Oh. (vacuum whirs) (vacuum whirs) Do you hear that? (vacuum whirs) (laughs) That's actually really cool. So the batteries are already in here? That's super light weight. I feel like the Dyson engineers, they spent literally five years working on this motor design, but I feel like two or
three of those years were like, "How do I get
it to sound really cool?" And they definitely succeeded. So I feel like I've done enough unboxings that usually I'm kind of like, "Oh whatever, it's a charger,
it's this, it's that." But with this, I legitimately
have no idea what to expect, and every single time I think I'm done, there's like five more
boxes full of cool stuff. I'm gonna level with
you guys for a second, pretty much all the vacuums
I've bought in my life are the cheap, terrible ones. This, this is all much nicer. Now with that, I think we have all of the accessories for our Dyson V10. Now the next step is to charge this guy up and actually see what it can do. (vacuum whirs) Of course, it's a vacuum,
the only way to properly test it is to, well, vacuum stuff. (vacuum hums) That actually works surprisingly well. So you'd think because
this is battery powered it's not going to have the same
suction as a normal vacuum, but the motor in here
it kind of ridiculous. It spins at like 125,000 RPM. Even though this is so portable you're really not going to be losing out on any practicality either, as even though it's going
to be really lightweight, you're getting up to 60
minutes on a single charge. And when it comes time
to actually empty it out, it's super simple. Just remove your attachment,
open up your trash can and there's a little
button on the bottom here, if you just press all the way down, empty everything out, close
it up, and you're good to go. One of the nice parts
about the Dyson Cyclone V10 is the fact that it is
going to be so modular. So because you get so
many different options that all come in the box, we can switch the head over to something that's going to be a little bit better for hard floors, and we just fire it up, easily do it. (vacuum hums) I feel like I'm in an
air commercial right now. But once you're done with that,
say we can just unhook that, set it down, we can switch it
over to fully portable mode with one of these smaller little dudes. So you hook that up, and we can, you know, fix our completely realistic and normal looking scenario of
having stuff on a table but it still works. (vacuum hums) I gotta say, the Dyson Cyclone V10 is a legitimate piece of tech. When you consider just how
crazy powerful those motors are, how powerful the batteries
are to last a full hour, as well as all the different
kinds of accessories and stuff, it's pretty cool. So of course, if you guys wanna check out anything to do with the Dyson Cyclone V10 the link will be in the description. I'm curious, do you
think this video sucked? I'm sorry, I made it all
the way through the video without making that joke, so I just had to get it in here at the very end. Let me know in the comments below and I will get you in the next one. Can't believe I did that. 
- You don't think they're going to notice my super cool Band-Aid, right? Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Oculus Rift, and huge shout out to Oculus for
sponsoring this video. It is mostly thanks to the
Rift, the VR even exists today. But what is virtual reality? People have been experimenting with VR experiences dating all the way back to the 50s, where things were, let's just say, a little more
creative than they are today. Now you can fast forward to the 90s where Nintendo launched the Virtual Boy. This wonderful headset,
which spectacularly crashed and burned. But, how does VR actually work? As Core virtual reality
is all about giving you the most immersive
experience possible. So think the holodeck from Star Trek and not the TV on your wall. Now, that TV is a good
example of what VR just isn't. Sure, with both of them you can watch video and play games, but with a TV, you're limited
by the size of that panel. Where as with virtual reality,
no matter where you look, as long as you have that headset on, you are completely immersed. The Virtual Boy achieved this with some pretty basic tech. It uses a pair of single color displays, and two mirrors to flip back
and forth incredibly fast, to give you a decent 3D effect. But, being limited by
1995 technology meant that this was not a true VR experience. Back in 2011, the first prototype for the Rift was completed,
duct tape and all. Now, what made this special,
was that for the first time, a head-mounted display was paired with not only a 90 degree field of view that was wide enough to look convincing, but also motion tracking, to allow you to move your head in real life and translate it into the game. You know, like in real
life when I move my head left and right, the world stays with me. I remember back in 2013,
where I first got to try not only an early prototype of the Rift, but also of EVE: Valkyrie. I put the headset on,
and I was transported into a cockpit of a spaceship, and a giant dog fight
in the middle of space. It was seriously one of the impressive tech moments I have ever seen. Right afterwards, I walked
out of the demo room, pulled my phone out, and pre-ordered my own Oculus dev kit. Don't get me wrong though, at this point, the tech was still very early. One of the biggest issues
with the first dev kit was its fairly low
resolution of 1280 by 800. It was enough to get the idea across, but the actual level of detail was really low at this point. Fast forward to 2017, and VR as a whole has seen some huge improvements. So take the Rift, for example. Now, it has a pair of
super high resolution 1080 by 1200 displays. One per eye. We have a faster 90 hertz refresh rate, paired with being based on OLED, which eliminates a lot
of the earlier issues with smoothness and
persistence, which is important. When the goal is total immersion, even a little stutter
in a game can cause you to be totally ripped
out of the experience. There is a lot more tech inside, though. The Rift headset is filled
with infrared tracking dots, which paired with the
sensor that it comes with, is able to track your
head in full 3D space with a lot more detail
than the original dev kit. Well there are some headsets,
like PlayStation VR, which take advantage of a console, or things like Gear VR which actually use a mobile device, such as your smartphone, to be able to power them. With the Oculus Rift, you
are using a PC to power it. There are several advantages here. Most notably, you can have a ton of graphics horsepower to
push not only the graphics, but also to keep that performance stable. All of this tech is great, but the controllers are also important. Now, the Oculus does support the standard Xbox One game pad, which
is fine for some games, but what really stands out, are the Oculus touch controllers. You can think of these as an evolution of the original Wii remote. Sure, they do have motion tracking, but what's more impressive,
is the fact that these will fully positionally track your hands, which will
actually allow you to put your hands inside the games. This is important. A lot of games, such as The Climb, will use hand tracking
in combination with the buttons to simulate
actually climbing a cliff. It's a neat effect, and can do a lot to add to the immersion. And immersion really is the key to making sure the VR feels right. So, you might be okay with a little glitch or stutter when you're
playing on a PC monitor, but when it comes to
VR, you're essentially tricking your brain into thinking that the game world is real. There's essentially no margin for error. One of my favorite VR
games is Job Simulator. This is a great example of how the touch controllers work. So, you can see that my hands are completely one to one in the game. If I reach over and
pick up this cartridge, drop it in, it feels very realistic. When you pair the Rift
with the touch controllers, it really does give you
an immersive experience. So, when I look around
this office building, it feels like I'm actually here. I can walk around. I can move my head. I can pick things up.
And it just feels right. Plus, it lets you do
some cool stuff like say, copy some resumes, just
drop it on the copy machine, hit that, I can start brewing some coffee, start hitting buttons on my keyboard, answer the phone. I mean, this stuff is really cool. It really does feel so natural, so simple. I don't even have to think about it. I can just literally just reach over, hit something, done. Next, we have Superhot VR. So, I have to stand very still, because as I move, time
will actually start playing, and have to dodge it. Okay, here we go, and, nope, no. Get out of the way of that one. And, grab it. Grab it. Boom. Dude, this is so much fun. It is easy to forget, that
just over eight years ago, consumer headsets like the Rift, weren't even a thing, and this really only went on sale a year ago. So there is a long way to go. But, if you have not
experienced virtual reality, you absolutely owe it to yourself to give it a try. So, what do you guys think about VR? Let me know on the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
Hey, Ken you Know time of year it is It's Black Friday time and this video is sponsored by the WD blue SSDs. We're about to have some fun So if you're looking to get your hands on some tech This is pretty much the best time of year to do it So there are a ton of deals on game consoles phones laptops TVs You name it and while most of these are going to be only on Black Friday itself Some of them are actually going to be live right now And of course all the links to what I'm going to be talking about will be in the description while the Xbox one X might Be the shiny new toy of 2017 There are some really good deals on the standard Xbox One S So you can pick this guy up from Amazon for $200 for the 500 gigabyte console And then includes a free copy of battlefield one and if your about that coals life You can pick up u1s for one-hundred and ninety dollars with $45 a bonus Kohl's cash. You know if you want to buy your mom something for chrism-- (laughs) and around $200 the Xbox one test makes a lot of sense for most people so it plays all the same games as the Xbox one X However, it just does it in 1080p But you can still do 4k streaming with video and Ultra HD blu-ray zon. This guy for like less than $200 You don't have an Xbox one yet Now is the time to pick one up But if you are on the PlayStation side of the fence you can get some pretty good deals on the ps4 slim This is also going to be on Amazon for $200 Tovah It's going to be the one terabyte version Now if you want to visit our good buddies over at Kohl's they have that same 200 all a deal for the ps4 but with a whopping $60 of Kohl's cash So you can that's a gift for your mom now if you do want to get on that 4k life There are some deals for the ps4 pro So this guy is going to be available for $50 off at Gamestop so 300 bucks This is not a bad deal over The best deals on consoles this year are definitely on the standard Xbox and ps4 If you do have a ps4 you may want to consider updating it with a brand new WD blue SSD Who are the wonderful sponsors of this Black Friday video the WD blue SSDs start at? $90 for a 250 gig Drive on Amazon and even if you want to jump up to the 500 gig version It's only going to cost you 150 upgrading is really easy You can pick this up and either a standard two and a half inch form factor or the smaller m2 if you have a newer computer You really want to go crazy you can put a WD blue inside your ps4? So swapping out the old hard drive for superfast SSD will make a big difference to stuff like game load times they're rated for up to 400 terabytes of rights as well as 1.75 million hours of time between failure on the one terabyte model That's a lot of specs well as these have always been fast for a long time they were either too expensive Or just didn't come in a big enough capacity to really make sense However when you consider that you're getting a 500 gigabyte drive for about a hundred and fifty dollars It makes a lot more sense So if you want to check this guy out like what everything I'm talking about in this video the link will be in the description Continuing on with game console deals this one is actually kind of crazy so Game Stop is offering the original white Xbox 360 For free, and yeah, I mean that it's actually free it's normally $60 However, you get a $60 mail-in rebate, so if you don't mind spending a little bit of time going for the rebate You can pretty much get an Xbox 360 for free continuing with the game stop trains They have a Zelda 2 DS for $80 now while the price isn't all that special What is is the actual hardware itself? This is a super limited edition green color and it comes with Ocarina of Time 3d? Pre-installed and when I say super limited. I mean it. They're probably going to have a few of these per store however It should also be available at places like Target and Walmart if you want to pick up this green one Black Friday is the day to find it they will be gone really quick oh Hi, I didn't see you there I was just enjoying a wonderful virtual world with the brand-new PlayStation VR that came out last year that I already did a video on What's cool about this guy is that you can pick up the headset you can get the camera that you need to actually have it? work and a copy of Gran Turismo sport for $300 on Amazon So if you want to join the super cool virtual world with me links in the description moving on to laptops Best Buy has a really good deal on the Lenovo IdeaPad 120 s at $100 so I did a video on this guy about a year ago This is the slightly older one 10 s model, but $150 I was really impressed considering is you can get this guy for $100 though? It's hard to argue with a cheap laptop like this if you're looking for something a little bit more high-end Dell has their new XPS 13 available on the Dell store for a thousand So we also just did a video on this guy and I liked it a lot No, do you have that 8th gen core i7 processor, but you have a great build and honestly at 30 andr dollars It's not a bad deal, but at a thousand if you're looking for a higher-end laptop It is definitely worth a look And if you're in the market for a new smartphone Best spot has some good deals on the Galaxy s8 as well as the note 8 so the Galaxy s8 is going to run you 636 dollars with activation But if you want these standard Galaxy s8 it's only going to cost you four hundred and twenty dollars on Black Friday It wouldn't be a good Black Friday deal without a good old Stampede Which is where Best Buy comes in with the 50-inch sharp 4k TV They have for one hundred and eighty dollars this might be the best Black Friday deal. I've seen this year over and true good old Stomping trampling fighting fashion you want to get this guy unlike pretty much everything else here It is only available in-store so on amazon.com you can pick up the standard Kendall for $50 You can also get these Fire HD 10 for $100, and if you want to go over to Best Buy They have the HD 7 available for $30 so if you've ever wanted a 3000 tablet that isn't terrible in your life That's the one to pick up I've actually been really surprised with how much I like the Google home mini Having Google assistant in your house for 50 dollars is not bad however on Black Friday on walmart.com This guy is going to be available for $29, but if you use Google Express Checkout You're going to get a $25 one more gift card meaning that for $4 these guys are going to go fast So links to check out all this stuff will be in the description and let me know What is the best Black Friday deal that you guys have seen this year? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you on the next one 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Marques bought a Model 3, so now we're going to do a Q and A video because that makes sense.
- Let's do it. - [Austin] How long do
you think it'll be until smartphones will be
able to shoot 8K video? - When we get an 8K sensor in a phone? - It's gonna be a while.
- I feel like Sony's gonna throw it in there
in like a year or two. It's gonna happen before we actually care. - But I mean, 8K smartphone video, probably not gonna be great
at all, for any reason probably just going to
be annoying to work with and probably not look much better anyway. - Think of the crispiness, Austin. - [Austin] How many Pixel 2 XL's can you fit in your difference in height? - Let's say it's a five inch tall phone. I'm just ball parking. - OK, do we have more than one? - No.
- 'cause I think you probably got one and a half on me, right? - I guess yeah, I'd say two. - Try it, try it, try it. - This goes to here, which is one, that's way taller than me, too. So, it's between one and two. - [Austin] Austin,
you've never talked about the Tesla roadster.
- Oh yeah. - [Austin] You actually did a
whole video on the Roadster. - [Marques] I did. I mean, the hype is super real, but that car's not coming out for another at least two years
- two or three. - to 2020.
- Yeah. So, if you're the type
of person to buy a car without ever seeing it and just seeing it at an event then you'd be really
into the Roadster, or-- - Yeah, no one would ever do that. - For real though, the
Roadster is interesting. I'm curious, I think the
specs that they've announced are crazy. I mean, like actually crazy. - They seem like targets because again, we get Model 3 and we have all the numbers for it. We're kind of expecting
a refresh from Model S where the numbers will kind of put themselves somewhere
between Model 3 and Roadster, so not insane to me. I'm just excited to actually
be able to drive it. - So, when you get
yours can I have a ride? - Absolutely, oh that's gonna be a whole video for sure. - I feel like it's gonna be a series. - [Austin] Audi versus
Tesla, we need a race. - Audi versus Tesla? - I could beat you in the Model 3, but I'm pretty sure the Model S would win. - Well, which Audi is the question? - [Austin] My RS3. - Oh, well then yeah I
hoped you would beat it. - Yeah, but I couldn't beat your ass. Although I think I could
beat your ass around like a race track. Not like in a drag race, you definitely would beat
me in a straight line. Maybe this is part two of this video. - I think I would take him. - Oh really?
- I think I would take him. - You think you could beat
me on an actual road course? - Yeah because nothing closes
in a straight line on Model S. - You would definitely pull on. - So you would have to have some pretty dope turning, cornering ability to make up for that. - We'll figure something out,
we'll figure something out. - Part two, how did you
guys both first meet? Do you actually remember that? - I have an event in
mind that I think is-- - It's the Galaxy S3 launch. - OK, I was gonna say a Samsung
launch in New York City, but that sounds about right.
- it was S3. So, Samsung Galaxy S3, Samsung does this thing every year, they bring out influencers, Youtubers to their events where the phone gets announced and we get to play with it and this was the first one I'd ever went to. - Same, same. - And I think that we'd
probably coordinated and say I'll be there, I'll be there too, but we finally walk in and down at the corner
at the end of the room Austin pops over and goes "Yo, what's up". - [Austin] With my giant
stupid shirt (laughs). - Yeah, but it's always weird 'cause like people online you feel
like you know them already, you feel like you've met them and you've already had conversations, hey what's up, I'm good how are you, but then you actually meet them and it still feels like a
continuation of that. - And if you're me, I'm
like oh wow you're tall. - Well, I get that a lot, yeah. - Let's get in the car.
- Yeah. - It's too hot in the sun. - It's pretty darn hot right now. - [Marques] What's your
favorite camera for Youtube? - I would say the A6300,
or 6500 especially. I think that it is kind of expensive, but considering that you're
getting a great 4K image, you're getting the in-body stabilization, the auto focus is pretty good. - It's complete and good for the price. - Yeah, totally. - So, A6500 I've shot with and it compare well to a7R,
if you've ever used one, which I've used a lot also for video. Do you know the way? - Oh, I know the way.
(laughs) - [Cameraman] Don't put that in? - But can you do this? - [Pewdiepie] But can you do this? - And did you talk about,
you did a best of CES video, but did you have any favorites that really stood out from this year, or just CES in general? - CES in general wasn't
actually that great this year. - OK, yeah, I felt
jaded saying that, but-- - It's just, there wasn't
a lot of exciting stuff. Like I feel like most years
there's a couple things like oh wow, I can't believe this, and this year there are some good things, but there's nothing I
just like lost my mind, like oh man I can't wait to get this. It was just kind of, it was decent, there was
a lot of decent stuff. - I think what happened is companies have realized that
their biggest announcements deserve their own event in a sense, so they save those for their
own event later in the year, and as a result you don't get those massive new product announcements at CES among all the other hype and noise. Instead you get these sort of I don't wanna call them vaporware, but these sort of fluff pieces-- - Wouldn't wanna throw
a word like that around. - I mean, I don't wanna point any fingers, but you see Razer's triple-headed laptop, or you see this rollable TV and you don't really know
when it's coming to market. That's the kind of stuff you see at CES. It's just kind of a guess at the future. - It's like concepts.
- Yeah. What do you wanna see in the Pixel 3? - Ooooh. A not garbage tone screen would be pretty high up there. - That is definitely something I'd want. As far as things that are wrong with it, 'cause the rest of the question is "was the screen the only
thing that prevented "it from being the first
perfect smartphone?". There's no--
- there's no such thing. - There, there you go,
there's no perfect smartphone, but that was the biggest part of what I would say turned people away from it, otherwise excellent phone. - I would love to see a
Pixel 3 standard size, but with the almost bezel-less display 'cause I feel like for me the Pixel 2 is actually
a really nice size. - Oh true, yeah. - So, I would love to see a
sort of middle ground like that, where it's still a couple
hundred dollars cheaper than the XL 'cause I feel like--
- I have a question for you. Are you a fan of these rounded
corners every phone has now? - I don't mind them. I think it looks weird on
some, like I feel like this because it actually has, it's bezel-less, but it still
has a reasonably big bezel I think it looks a little weird. And it looks better on stuff
like the S8 or the iPhone. - I'm not a fan. I know every phone has
rounded corners now, but I'm still like pretty-- - I think you do rounded corners when you have to do rounded corners, not just as a design statement. - Razer phone is that boxy phone and it's got the boxy
corners and I think it works. - You kind of get those 15 extra pixels. - Exactly. - [Austin] What are the
Cheerio boxes all about? - What are they all about?
- Yeah. - They represent freedom ... - freedom? Oh, tell me more. - The freedom to choose your own breakfast cereal without other people judging you for it. To put it wherever you want in the background of your Youtube videos on your channel, no
matter what the subject. That's what Cheerios represents. - I think you're just a giant iOS fanboy, and the Cheerios are just your subtle way of putting it in there - Cheer iOS. What are your guys' funniest
tech flubs or disaster stories? Accidental drops, saying the
wrong thing in the video, accidentally deleting footage? I mean that's, I think
I've done all those things. - We've definitely accidentally deleted video.
- I've accidentally drop ... You've deleted an entire
video from your channel? - Well, oh no, no, not
from the channel, no, but while we were editing. So, the most recent one was I went to go edit a video, I plugged the drive in and it ejected in the middle of loading the project, completely nuked the project.
- Yeah. - We've also accidentally
left footage on another drive, and like oh wait where was that and it was already wiped and stuff. - Right, OK. - Don't think I've actually, accidentally dropped a
phone or anything though. - OK, I'm the opposite of you, I have accidentally dropped a phone. As recent as the OnePlus 5 before my review I had it before embargo. - Oh no. - Dropped it, didn't
shatter it or anything, but I had some good chunks
out of the corners of it, before I even shot any of my footage, but luckily I had
- (laughs) Hey, OnePlus, sorry about your phone.
- I had a meeting with them right after that, in
between then and the review, so I showed it to them and I was like do you mind if I get another one, and they actually did,
so that was pretty cool. - Team Crispy Live 2.0 when? I don't know. You wanna do another one? - I kinda do. I don't know about when, but I--
- It was a lot of work to put the first one together. - I would love to like take all that effort and
put it somewhere like New York, or another location. We did that L.A. one, which was awesome. - Yeah. - I think it would be
rewarding to it again. - Yeah, it was just a lot of work 'cause essentially, if
you guys aren't familiar, Team Crispy Live was a
live stage show we did probably like two years or so ago now? - Yeah, at least. - We basically rented out
like a whole amphitheater, it was like 500 seats and we proceeded to be not
entertaining for two hours and say hello to everyone, so-- - We answered questions,
we talked to people. - You premiered a video, right, or no you showed off behind
the scenes of a video. - Yeah, we did a behind the scenes, we showed some never before seen stuff. I signed a lot of peoples phones. - Dude, that was so scary. I was like are you sure? I don't wanna ruin your phone. - I defaced a lot of electronics. That was a fun time, yeah. - Alright, Team Crisp Two. Maybe. So with that, I think we have
a very successful Q and A. However, we are not done yet, oh no, because, Marques, I
think we're about to go and have some fun in a Model 3. - This is a thing that's happening today, tomorrow, the next day, this is the (mumbles) for the week, and we're gonna make a video about it, are you ready for that? Have you subscribed yet? I hope so. Stay tuned. - You heard him. 
- Hey guys this is Austin. Today I'm here in New
York City for the launch of the new Samsung Galaxy Note 8. My first thought with the Note 8 is that it actually does
feel a little bit different to the Galaxy S8 and S8+. So when you look at it up front
it looks very, very similar. Yes, it does have a 6.3 inch display instead of 6.2 on the S8+. But in hand it actually has
a little bit more of an edge. Before it was very much
sort of like a tapered thing all the way from the screen to the back. But now there's actually
something to grab onto. The Note 8 still has the Infinity Display. So this means that it
has super small bezels on top and bottom. It does have a curved
display on the edges. And it also does have the
sort of wraparound edge on both the left and right side. All this jargon means, it actually does feel
really nice in the hand. The Galaxy Note 8 is still
going to be water resistant, which is nice. And taken as a whole, the
hardware does feel very similar to the Galaxy S8 and especially the S8+. It's not going to be a huge jump, but what you're really
getting here is the S Pen and especially that new dual camera setup. This guy is rocking a pair
of 12-megapixel cameras that are very similar to the iPhone 7 Plus. So there's one wide angle
lens as well as one telephoto. It's a 2x crop, and there's
a lot of cool things that you can do with it. Not only do we have the wide angle lens, but you can also jump into the telephoto, and if we hit Live Focus, essentially what we should be able to do, so we actually just took three photos. So not only did we use
the wide angle shot, but we also do have the telephoto, and we have version with background blur. So what's interesting about the Note 8 is that you can actually adjust this. So you can basically
turn it all the way off, or go maximum blur. Looking at it closely, it looks decent, but he's a little bit soft. Now, I think that's actually an issue I've found a lot with the iPhone
7 Plus with the portrait mode, and this is a sort of similar setup, but in theory they have done a better job of implementing it by actually allowing you to take multiple photos. However this, while it did a good job of sort of isolating
him from the background it looks very similar to
what you get on the iPhone. Now beyond that, it's
a fairly similar setup. Like I said, they're both 12 megapixels. And to my eye, it looks pretty similar to the photos that you're
getting on the Galaxy S8, but thankfully there's no camera bump. What's not great about that, is that it also means that
the fingerprint sensor is still going to be around back. So it is still very, very easy to accidentally touch your camera, when you actually mean
to unlock the phone. So Jimmy, what are your
thoughts on the Galaxy Note 8? - Dude, it fits in my hand, it's crazy. It's fine, like, I like iPhone, but the screen is really
nice, and it's fast. - I think I'm gonna take
over the video again. - Yeah, take it. (laughing) - The Note 8 is rocking a 6.3
inch, super AMOLED display, and I think honestly, this
is probably one of the best smartphone displays around. But Samsung has kinda
been on top of the game for a couple years now here. I've got to admit, when
the Galaxy S8 came out, I felt like that was the
best hardware on any phone, and the Note is super similar. So it still does have not only USB-C, but also a headphone jack,
which is nice to see. But of course, being a Note,
it does have the S Pen. The S Pen has gained a few new features, like you can use it to translate text, as well as of course you can use it to doodle and sketch
and that kind of stuff. Now I know a lot of people
really do like the S Pen, but personally I don't find a ton of use for a stylus on a phone. And that actually brings
us to one of the downsides of the Note 8. It has a very small 3300 mAh battery. Now for comparison, the Galaxy S8+, with a slightly smaller screen, has a 3500 mAh battery. The Note 7 was a big part
of the presentation today. So, in case you've been
living under a rock, the Galaxy Note 7 was kind of a big deal. And by big deal, I mean it kept exploding and, yeah, did not go well. So of course, the battery is smaller here. I think they're being a
little more conservative, and I think that is a good thing, but it also means that,
with such a giant display, and pretty powerful
specs, I'm curious to see what the actual battery
life is going to be. Inside, the Note 8 is rocking
a Snapdragon 835 processor, as well as an Exynos option
in some international markets. It has six GB of RAM, 64 Gigs of storage, as well as a MicroSD card slot. So this is very similar
to what you're getting on the Galaxy S8. The biggest difference
is that you're getting that two extra gigs of RAM,
but to be totally honest, it's going to be a very
similar experience. The Note 8 also has a Bixby button, because you know, that
was a huge hit on the S8. It launches Bixby, which still exists. It's slightly better now. Moving on, what is a
little bit cooler is DeX. So this is Samsung's solution to being able to turn your phone
into somewhat of a desktop. So if you get the DeX dock, you can hook up a
monitor, mouse, keyboard, kind of like some of
the Windows phone stuff that I have taken a look at recently. Now this actually worked
pretty well on the Galaxy S8, and they've done even more improvements with more apps and more
features on the Note 8. It's still not quite there for me, as essentially you're just
running Windowed Android apps, but I feel like, as this
gets better and better it's going to become
more and more of a reason to pick up a Samsung device. Which brings me to my next
point, the rest of the software. It's exactly the same as the Galaxy S8. Kind of a trend with this video, I think. So, it's not bad, it's not
like TouchWiz back in the day, but it is nowhere near stock Android. And because of that, this guy is shipping with Android 7.1 Nougat,
as opposed to Oreo, which of course is not quite out yet. But still expect a little bit of a delay on getting updates with this, just like every other Samsung phone. One cool thing Samsung did with the Note 8 software is App Pair. So this is kind of like
Spaces on your desktop. You can have a pair of apps set to automatically open together. And they will have the correct sort of multitasking setup. And that is kind of cool. For example, you could have
YouTube launch with, say, Twitter, or whatever you want to do, and you can have that kind of custom. It's not a huge feature,
but I guess it's something. With the Note 8, Samsung have taken what is arguably one of
the best designed phones out on the market right now, and added the S Pen, as well
as the dual camera setup. Now, if you're looking for
a large-screen smartphone, honestly, it's kind of a
no-brainer over the S8+. I feel like the dual cameras alone are going to make it worth it. But, what do you guys think
about the Galaxy Note 8? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. I do videos on a lot of very
expensive gaming hardware but today I wanna find out,
can I game on this $400 laptop? This is the Lenovo Z50, and
it's currently less than $370 on Amazon right now. Based on the giant Gears
of War 4 picture they have on the product page, I think
it's pretty safe to assume that they're aiming this at gamers. Typically with budget laptops,
you're getting integrated Intel graphics which
are fine for basic use but really can't handle serious gaming. However, here we actually
have an AMD FX APU which in theory should
work a little bit better. Also that was a very meaty seal. Think I actually cut through the box. Yep, cut through the box. (laughs) So inside, first of all
we get the laptop itself and the first thing I notice
is that the battery actually doesn't come installed, it
has been a long time since I've seen a laptop with a
detachable battery like this. This is a 2800mAh battery. For reference, I feel
like a lot of smartphones have bigger batteries than that. We also have the power
cable and what I'm sure is the power adaptor. So nothing too exciting
in the box but of course, this is a budget laptop. What we're really getting
here is actual performance. At least, hopefully
that's what we're getting. This battery is taking me
back, it's been a long time since I've actually
used a laptop like this. So at first glance, it
looks very plastic-y but once you open it up,
you do see that it looks pretty decent inside, mostly thanks to the sort of fake brush metal here. This is a very interesting
selection of ports. So not only is there VGA,
which is really weird on a laptop in 2017, we
also have Ethernet, HDMI, a USB 2.0 as well as 3.0,
but the really weird part is when you actually come
around to the DVD drive. Yes, this laptop in 2017 comes
with a DVD drive standard, which actually is not really
a bad thing, just weird. A big downside is that
this does lack AC WiFi, instead opting for the
older school Wireless N. Now to be fair, you do
have an Ethernet port so it's not all bad but there
are a lot of very unusual design choices with this laptop. What makes this special are the specs. Inside, it has a quad core AMD FX 7500 APU with Radeon R7 graphics, as
well as eight gigabytes of RAM. This should give us a
fair bit of power to game. No, it's not going to shame a
laptop with dedicated graphics but the Radeon stuff really
isn't bad and this costs less than $400, you really can't
be picky at this price. However, there are some
sacrifices to get that much power at this sort of price. The biggest one is the screen. This guy is rocking a 15.6-inch panel with a resolution of 1366 by 768. It is not very good. As a low-end TN panel, this
really does bring me back to the days where budget laptop screens were kind of terrible. One of the biggest places
that you can see it are with the viewing
angles, so if you look at it straight on, it's not that
bad, but if you get off axis, it ghosts really badly. Plus, having such a low
resolution on such a big screen just makes everything a little bit weird, there's very little screen real estate. Now I have to delicately
balance the laptop so it doesn't completely
wash out on camera. Hey guys, this is Austin. This is a $330 laptop and
I'm going to be using it for the next week. The speakers are okay but this is not going to be a great
video-watching experience. Thankfully, the keyboard isn't bad so it has the sort of
classic Lenovo layout and it feels pretty good to type on. Only problem is there's a fair bit of flex on the actual keyboard itself,
but it's totally usable. And the same thing goes for the trackpad. It's maybe not the most
accurate thing in the world. However, you are probably
gonna want a mouse for gaming. Although that's true for
every track pad ever, so. Remove three screws on
the back and it's actually easy enough to open the laptop up. And one of the nice things
about being a little bit more of an old school design
is that there's a lot that you can actually upgrade yourself. Not only can you get access
to both of the memory slots, but there's also a one-terabyte
hard drive pre-installed that looks super easy to swap out. If this was my PC, I'd
spend a few extra bucks and throw an SSD in here, it
will make a big difference. The real test for this laptop, though, is to play actual games, so
to start with, we have CS:GO. So right now, we're playing at 768p which is the max resolution of the screen and we're playing with a mixture
of medium and high settings and we're getting decent frame rates. It bottoms out in the mid 30s but in some of these more open areas, we're getting in like the 40s and 50s. Next we have Rocket League. This is another game that
isn't incredibly demanding but here on quality settings,
which is roughly equivalent to medium, it's pretty smooth, we're getting in the mid 40s to low 50s. Next we have Minecraft. Now yes, this will run
on pretty much anything including a Raspberry
Pi, but on the Lenovo, we're able to crank the settings
up pretty much all the way to the max and we're still
getting really solid frame rates, even flying around here
as it loads chunks, we're still on the 60 to
70 frame per second range. Next we have Overwatch. This is a little bit harder
for the laptop to handle so even on low settings here,
it's a little bit choppy so in less action-oriented
scenes, it's fine, but once we get a lot of characters and a lot of effects on
screen, we do sometimes dip a little bit below 30. It's kind of playable
but you've gotta really wanna play Overwatch. The Lenovo Z50 is definitely
not a perfect gaming laptop but for less than $400,
it's actually not bad. As always, I will have a
link to check this guy out in the description and let me know, would you pick up a $370 gaming laptop? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey, guys, this is Austin. Recently, Ken went out and found a surprisingly good $700 gaming PC that was pre-built from a big box store. So that got me thinking, what happens when you want to spend $400? I've built a lot of custom gaming PCs, and the math is really simple. You're almost always getting
better price to performance when you build it yourself
versus buying a pre-built. However, things have been changing lately, and this $330 Lenovo is
a great example of that. One of the nice things
about a pre-built system is that you at least do get some accessories. So this looks like a
keyboard, and while I'm sure it's not going to be
particularly high quality, it's better than nothing. And especially if you don't
have any accessories right now, something like this will
get you off the ground. And now we have the computer itself. So something that's a little
bit interesting about this guy, is that it's considerably
smaller than most desktops. Because of that, as you'll
see a little bit later, it does limit some of our upgrade options. So it might not look like much, but this guy has some potential. So it's powered by a Core i3-7100, paired with four gigabytes of RAM, and a one terabyte hard drive. And that might not sound
too impressive yet, but with one major upgrade, I think it can actually handle
some pretty decent gaming. This is the NVIDIA GT 1030. Typically lower end graphics cards just don't make a lot of sense, but the 1030 is surprisingly good. And with a $70 price tag,
it puts the entire price of this build at $400. Which I think actually might
just be able to challenge Ken's $700 system. Well at least when you
consider price to performance. So open this guy up and
one of the main issues is that it only supports a
low profile graphics card. Which just so happens to fit
perfectly with our GT 1030. So I think the only thing
we're gonna have to do here, is just move the WiFi
antenna out of the way. But beside that it pretty
much should be good to go. And with that we have the
graphic card installed. So, as I'm looking inside here there actually is some upgradability. So on top of the graphics card, you can't easily put another
four gigs of RAM in here. And while it does have a
one terabyte hard drive to start with, on the bottom
there actually is a slot for an M.2 SSD. So if you wanted to spend
another, say, 30, $40 on RAM and maybe another $80 on an SSD. For less than $500 you're
getting a pretty decent system. (record scratching) So if we would've actually
got the correct GT 1030, which is about half an inch smaller, it would fit no problem. However with this one, (banging) not so much. So normally, I would try
to cut out a little bit of the metal just so it
would be able to clear. But the problem is because
this system is so small, the hard drive is literately
right here up against the lip. So if I did that, basically
I would have to pull out the hard drive. This ones like literally
a half an inch to big. So, can we just do the rest of the video with the computer case open? Can we just, can this just
be the rest of the video? Cuz it's not gonna close
anymore than that (laughs). A few Windows updates later
and the system is alive. So well yes, it might
not look ideal right now, we actually have some decent specs inside. That Core i3 is clocked at a pretty impressive 3.9 gigahertz. And while the GT 1030 might not be the most powerful graphics card around, it should definitely be able to handle some pretty decent gaming. So our first game is going to be CS:GO. Now it should be no
surprise that this system is easily able to handle it. Even on high settings
at 1080p, you're gonna get anywhere between 110
and 140 frames per second. Now sure it might not be
the most competitive thing in the world, where
some systems can run it at 300, 400 frames but I
would say this qualifies as playable. You know, if can actually find someone. I can just plant the bomb. That's also an option. Next we have Rocket League. Now this is another game that
isn't particularly demanding, but it actually looks
pretty good running here on the $400 system. So at 1080p on high settings, we're doing anywhere between
50 to 60 frames per second. Next, we have Middle-earth:
Shadow of Mordor. As I almost get killed (laughing). So this is a slightly older game, however even on low settings, I think it looks pretty decent at 1080p. And we're getting a pretty solid
55 to 60 frames per second. So if we would've gotten the
correct size graphics card for our case, I think actually
would be looking pretty good. And what's kind of impressive is what kind of price to performance
you're actually getting out of this guy. If you were going to
build this system today, it would cost you around $450. And that's not including
stuff like the optical drive or WiFi card. Now mind you, if I was
going to build this system for $400, I would probably
make a couple of adjustments. Like drop the Core i3 for a Pentium and maybe consider a slightly
faster graphics card. But considering that we're $400 in and didn't have to build anything, besides not being able to close the case, it's not bad. If you guys wanna see
how Ken was able to get an even better deal on a pre-built system, definitely be sure to go
check this video out here. But what do you guys think
about our franken monster for $400? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin, and today we're going to find out, can you actually game on a Mac? So to find out, I have two
of the most recent Macbooks in front of me. So this is
the base line 13" model, so it has a dual core Core i5 processor, 8 gigabytes of memory, and
integrated Iris graphics. Where I also have a 15" maxed out model, with the Core i7 quad core,
16 gigabytes of memory and the dedicated Radeon Pro 460 graphics. Obviously, no one should go out and buy a Mac as a gaming PC, they
just don't make sense. However, what I'm curious about is if you already do have a Mac for whatever reason, can you play games on them at all? What's kind of cool is
that over half of my Steam library will work
on macOS, no problem. Now, a couple of things
actually have changed on the gaming side of Mac
in the last couple years. Most notably, Metal. This is very similar to a lower level API, such as DirectX12 on the
PC, or something like Vulkan, and essentially, it should allow us to get better performance by abstracting all the stuff in the middle and letting the game get as close to the hardware as possible. To start with, I want to try F1 2016, which does take advantage
of Metal on the Mac. Now I'm going to start
using the 13" Macbook Pro, as I feel like this is pretty similar to the Macs that most people are using. So it looks like this works pretty well. I don't have a way of
testing the exact framerates but to my eye it looks nice and smooth. No torn frames or anything
dropping too badly. So right now I'm using the
Playstation 4 controller, which interestingly
enough, actually just works straight out of the box. You literally just pair it
via bluetooth and that's it. Oh, nope, you can't go
flat out everywhere, no, no, nope, no, no, no, no. (laughs) Okay, so maybe you actually
can't go flat out everywhere. I will say the graphics
are not the greatest, so we're running at 1280 by 800 but, I mean, I would say that
this looks roughly equivalent to something like an Xbox 360 game so it's hard to know exactly how much of a difference Metal makes since
I actually can't turn it off but considering that I'm running
on an integrated graphics this doesn't look bad at all. Next up, we have Minecraft
and because of our wonderful dongle life, I
have to use an adapter, but besides that, we should be good to go. So max framerate, 60, VSync, yep, Maximum, Fancy, this is
pretty much all turned up. Minecraft's easy. (laughs) I mean, after running
Minecraft on the Raspbery Pi, I'm really not surprised that
anything can run Minecraft, but I think the nice
thing is that we're really not losing anything with the Macbook Pro. Yeah, maybe you can do stuff
like shaders and whatnot on PC, but to be fair, a lot of mods, in fact, I think most of them actually should be just completely fine to run on Mac. (singing doo in rhythm) I was just having fun,
and then Ken started zooming the camera and pointing at my face so I feel like that just
made in in the video. Next, we have CS:GO. Now this is another game
I know will run on Mac but what I'm curious
about is what happens if we actually try to crank up
the resolution and settings. Alright, it works but it's
definitely dropping some frames. To be fair, we actually are
playing at 2560 by 1600. It's decent, but let's see if we can crank the settings down a little bit. Oh, that's way better. So cranking the resolution
down to 1280 by 800 pretty much immediately
fixes all the problems. There is a little bit of
screen tearing though, which is interesting. Almost immediately, I
could tell this is usable. It's definitely playable
but it's not as nice as it would be on a
machine running Windows. So next we have Rocket League, and again, this is another game that
natively does support the DualShock 4. So it thinks that we can run at 900p with pretty much everything cranked
up, so let's give it a try. It looks like we actually have pretty much the full Rocket League experience here. Graphic wise, on high
it looks pretty nice. We've got stuff like the
rain, and the particle effect. And, uh, no! How did that happen? I am noticing some framerate drops, it's maybe not the
smoothest thing in the world but we definitely do have a lot of room to crank the graphics down if we need to. Next, I want to see how a more
powerful Mac handles games. So we have the 15" Pro. So the first trial that I want to try is StarCraft 2; not
exactly a brand new game but it does have support for Metal. So right now we're running at 1650 by 1050 with everything set to high and again, it seems to be running nice and smooth, which is important for
a game like StarCraft. So the first thing that's
actually throwing me off a lot is actually the keyboard. The Command, Option,
Control and Function keys are not remotely in the same spot as they are in Windows so
all my muscle memory is just completely shot right now. For example, my escape
key is a software key, which seems like it
would be a big problem. Especially for a game
where I'm actually kind of canceling commands sometimes
but it actually kind of works. Can the Macbook successfully
help me win a game against an easy AI, or I guess, a hard AI? Yes. The answer is I can
actually kind of play this. Next, we have Shadow of Mordor. Even though this is a couple years old, this has been one of my favorite games to benchmark PCs for quite a while and for what I remember,
the port to Mac and Linux is actually pretty decent. I really actually do
like Shadow of Mordor. It kind of feels a little bit like playing some of the Batman games that it's kind of a bit
like a hack and slash. Like God of War or something but one thing you actually should be careful of, especially with these kind
of more high end games, is to make sure that you have a Mac that's going to be compatible. Lighter stuff, like CS:GO,
should run on basically anything, but a lot of these games specifically do need a dedicated graphics
card, or a quad core processor, or something, so don't
just expect that you could just pick up any game
and it's going to work. Yo, am I going to beat,
like, 40 guys right now by myself on a Macbook? Pretty proud of that. Of course, you could run Windows on a Mac via Bootcamp which will
open up pretty much all the games in the universe, but that doesn't get around the fact that you should not buy a Mac for gaming. However, if you already
have one and you just want to play a few games,
it's totally usable. So, what do you guys think
about gaming on a Mac in 2017? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. And this laptop might have some of the best battery life in the world. So this is the Gram 13, and big shout-out to LG
for sponsoring this video. So not only is this supposed
to have good battery life, but it's also a very lightweight laptop. So that Gram name isn't just for show. This guys weighs around a kilogram, or just over two pounds. So inside the box, we
get the laptop itself, with a very handy little g to pick it up. Ooh! That was meaty. Wow, that is actually
really weirdly light. Continuing on, we actually
have a lot of accessories. Starting with a USB-C to Ethernet adapter? Really? So even though this is a 13 inch laptop, it's actually almost closer to an 11 inch laptop in footprint. As I shall demonstrate
with this totally random, generic, no-name 11 inch laptop. Man, I feel like I'm
gonna keep saying this, but this is so lightweight. So what's cool is, even though, (tapping) it almost feels like it's plastic, this is actually magnesium. Or rather, it's a nano
carbon magnesium alloy. Ken made me put this on, by the way. He thought it would be funny. For such a thin laptop, there are actually quite a few ports. So on the left side,
you'll find that there's a charging port, USB-3,
HDMI, as well as USB-C. And if you flip it over,
you'll find there's one more USB-3 port, a headphone jack, as well as a microSD card slot. I just like doing this. It's just so lightweight. It feels like, I don't know, it just feels like
there's something missing. But it's just a really lightweight laptop. I think the build quality
is actually something that's really jumping
out to me about the Gram. So if you guys saw my friend What's Inside when they took at look at the Gram, they actually put this thing
through a lot of abuse. And LG claims they can
handle something like 400 pounds of pressure without breaking. The screen is flexible so
it doesn't actually break. It's, for something so lightweight, more durable than you would think. Inside, the Gram 13 is powered
by a dual-core i5-7200U, which is based on Kaby Lake, so it's pretty much as new as it gets, eight gigabytes of memory, as
well as a 256 gigabyte SSD. (quiet music from speakers) The speakers are interesting. So they are kind of on the bottom, but they actually project sideways. So while they're maybe not
quite as loud as I would like, they actually don't sound that bad. What's cool about having
that full USB-C port, is that with a single cable, we can attach the Gram to a 4K monitor, and not only are we going
to get that 4K video signal, we can also get charging to the laptop, as well as extra data via
the USB ports on the monitor. So first impressions of
the Gram are pretty solid. But what I really want to put to the test, is that battery life. (unzipping) (rustling) (thumping softly) See ya, Jimmy. - I'm gonna keep this for the weekend. - So the first thing that jumps out to me about using the Gram,
especially as I travel, is that weight. So after using a giant laptop for the last year and a half or so, having something that's
so light and so portable actually does make a difference. My bag feels like it weighs a lot less. But of course, the
biggest part of the Gram is that battery life. So, it has been nearly four days since I took this off the charger, and let's see what the
battery life is like. So, open it up here. Right now we're at 48%. That is not bad. Now, I have not used this thing lightly. So on top of being in
standby for four days, I watched about three hours of Netflix, some YouTube, answered some
emails, did some web browsing, and this has absolutely held up. Now I will say that you
should turn battery saver on, that definitely does give you
a fair bit extra battery life. But with a laptop like
this, it kind of makes you use it differently. So I was able to use the Gram one-handed with the touchscreen. Mind you, it's not maybe
the most comfortable way of using a laptop in the world. But having something that's so lightweight with a touchscreen actually
does work out pretty well. Performance is pretty snappy. So with that Kaby Lake Core i5 processor, it easily handles any kind of basic usage, and even more moderate stuff
like Photoshop runs no problem. Now you won't want to do a lot of heavy gaming, or especially video editing on this guy, but for pretty much 98%
of what I do every day, it's completely fine. With a laptop like this,
the inputs really do matter. And I don't really have any
complaints about the Gram. So the keyboard itself is nicely spaced, it has plenty of key
travel, and as an upgrade from the previous Gram, it's
fully backlit this time. The track pad is also pretty decent. So my only slight complaint
is that it's maybe not quite as accurate as I'd like. But for the most part
it's completely fine. And I ended up opting
for the slightly upgraded version of the Gram with the touchscreen, which definitely makes a big difference. I really do feel like Windows 10 laptops should all have
touchscreens at this point. Speaking of, that screen is on-point. So don't let that 1080p
resolution fool you. It really is more than
enough for a 13 inch display, especially when you consider
that the high-resolution screens usually do hurt battery life. More importantly, it's got
a really solid IPS panel, so color, contrast, especially
viewing angles are nice. It gets reasonably bright,
even when you're outside. And because it has such thin bezels, it makes the overall
laptop size a lot smaller than it otherwise would be. The only issue with the small bezel, is that it puts the webcam
on the bottom of the screen, which gives you a great view
of the inside of your nose. One cool part about upgrading
to the touchscreen model is that it does come with
a fingerprint reader. This is again something
that I find I'm using all the time on laptops. It's so nice to be able
to use Windows Hello to drop your finger on the touch pad, and immediately log in. It is really nice to be
able to take a laptop on a full-weekend trip and not even think about taking the power adapter. So what do you guys
think about the LG Gram? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin,
and today I'm back with another Tech Under video, this time
taking a look at tech under $60. However, the catch is, as
always, I have no idea what I'm looking at, thanks to
good ol' savage Kenny. (item clangs) The Klipsch K6i Reference Headphones. (item thuds) Oh wait, what is this? A Lightining Audio Amp? - [Kenny] It's 60. - A 60 dollar amp? Klipsch typically makes
pretty good in-ear monitors. That shouldn't be a huge surprise. You're paying $60 for a headphone amp for, essentially the iPhone 7. So, to give these a try,
first, I'm going to use the standard lightning adapter
that comes with the iPhone 7, and see how these headphones sound. Usually, I'm actually
not a big fan of these in-ear style of headphones. Typically, it's actually kind
of hard to get a comfortable fit for me, but let's
give these guys a try. They're good! They sound really good for the most part. The only thing is there's
just a little bit of a lack of bass, and, of course
that's a subjective thing. I think some people prefer
something that's a little bit more of a clearer sound with less bass. But, for me, I like that
there's just a little bit more punch to the sounds. But, of course, the headphones
are not alone in a vacuum. Now, I get to try this 60
dollar lightning adapter. So, it looks pretty much
similar to the one that comes with the iPhone, although you
can see there's definitely a lot more going on here
with having, not only an amp, but also a dedicated DAC. This... this might be interesting. I don't know. I'm not so sold that it's
going to be that great. That's kinda cool. So you can actually use
this little keychain thing (mysterious music) There might be a little
bit of a difference. I feel like there might be
just a bit more separation, but, I don't know about this one. I don't know. So, essentially the app will
actually allow you to get a little more amplification,
and it does sound better. It's mostly just a little
bit louder, but with that extra volume I can hear a
hear a little more clarity. So listening to the same
headphones hooked up to the LGB30, which has an
amazing Quad DAC inside. It's actually a fairly similar sound. I feel like this adapter will
kind of punch up the music just a little bit, which
personally I actually kind of like. But, is it worth 60 bucks? I'm not so sure. (item thuds) Pebble Time? Wait, this is 60 dollars? So, if you guys are not
familiar, Pebble actually went out of business, which
makes it a little weird that they're still selling them. So, for me, I actually really
do enjoy using a smartwatch, mostly for things like
notifications, which keeps me from keeping my phone out
of my pocket all the time. But, let's see how this
Pebble Time stacks up. I will say, even though,
yes, this is like 50 dollars, the hardware still feels kinda cheap. Like, I would not wanna rock
this rubber band every day. Once you set up the Pebble
Time, you'll see it's actually a pretty much functioning smartwatch. So, not only can we go and
control our music here, so we can start playing it
from the phone in my pocket. But you can also go through,
get your notifications, alarms. One of the main reasons
to use a Pebble though is the battery life. So, while most smartwatches
measure it in hours, this guy can last days on a single charge. And though yes, it's not going to be the most functional thing, and going forward, who
knows how well this is actually going to be supported. But, for 50 bucks, not bad. Alright, what is our fourth product? (box thuds) A mysterious cardboard box. Okay? (laughs) A USB Pet Rock. - [Austin Voiceover]
Important: Open box carefully. Do not remove rock before
reading instructions. (laughs) It's literally a rock
with a hole cut into it and a USB cable. Ken, how much did this cost? - [Ken] (laughs) - You're laughing too much;
how much did this cost? - [Ken] 40. - 40 dollars? (laughs) It's a rock! It's a rock with a hole in it! There's a USB cable. You know, just when you think
that Ken's doing a great job. He's busting out these cool
tech items left and right, and then you get a USB Pet Rock. Alright, let's just plug this
thing in and get it over with. I'm like half expecting this to be full of malware or something. Alright, what happens when
we plug our pet rock in? Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing happens. At least we can make sure
that our USB Pet Rock feels, like it's part of the 21st
century, and connected to all the other devices in our lives. Uh... Yeah. (box thuds) What is this? A 50mm 1.8 lens? Oh. Oh, actually something
that's not terrible. After the rock I was
expecting garbage town. - [Ken] 50 dollars. - 50 dollars? Alright. Wow, this is... this is identical looking to the Canon 50 1.8. So, if you guys have ever
really got into DSLRs, you'll know that usually the first
lens you get is a 50-mil lens. Not only does it give you
a kind of interesting look, but it's also really cheap. However, 50 bucks is,
uh, that's pretty cheap. This is like laughably lightweight. But, if we pop it on our camera here, let's see what we got.
(camera noise) (laughs) Did you hear that noise? (camera noise) (laughs) Okay, okay, let's do this, let's do this. (camera clicks) It's actually not that bad looking. Let's see here, let's take a picture of our super cool Pet Rock. (camera clicks) Dude, this is actually pretty decent. So, know that the Canon version, the one that they're knocking off here, is usually around $100 or
so, so to get what looks to be pretty similar for
50 bucks is not bad at all. What you're looking at right
now is actually a camera using a much more expensive 50mm lens. So, if we put the 50 dollar option on, this is what things look like. Now, I can't really tell
from all the way over here, but it actually probably
isn't that far off. Ken, what do you think? - [Ken] Pretty good. - Pretty good! Alright. So, does that mean we get to save a bunch of money on lenses now? - [Ken] No. (laughs) - We've officially got a
Pet Rock in this video, and now we've downgraded
our camera equipment. What else could you ask for? Before we get to the final
product of the video, you guys may remember that a
few weeks ago, we did a video on the LG Ultrawide Festival,
who were awesome enough to sponsor this video. After going through all the applicants, the top three finalists are: Zachary, from Hammers and Circuits; Taylor Reed; and last but not least, Physics Phil. The finalists are going to
join Lionus and I at his studio in Vancouver, where they're
going to get to build their ultimate dream setup. Stay tuned, because Lionus
and I are going to be doing videos from the event, but
you guys actually still have a chance to win a monitor. The first quest is to fill
in the blanks guessing the LG Ultrawide's key features,
and the second one is simply to guess who is the final winner. So, be sure to check out those
links in the description, and now let us see what is
the final item of the video. (item smacks) - [Austin] The Smartphone Controlled Paper Airplane Conversion Kit? Convert your paper airplane into a smartphone-controlled flying machine. I think this will be pretty cool. I actually used to really enjoy building paper airplanes when I was a kid, although I haven't done
it in like, a while. This is a good idea. This is pretty legit. How much was this? - [Ken] 35. - 35? Look at this, Ken coming
in with the budget options. So, once you download the app, I can immediately see that
this was designed by nerds. Not only do we have the signal
strength, but we have fuel, we have the actual control,
which I'm actually not going to do because we need to
build our paper airplane. I know my paper airplanes. I can make my own. I said that with way more confidence than I really should've. This is really bad, this is actually not a great paper airplane. This is like, not even
close to being even. (engine starts) Okay, the app's a little bit aggressive. (plane whirs) Oh, it's trying to take
off, ahhh, no! (laughs) (plane whirs) (laughs) Alright, full power! (gadget crashes) Ohhhh! Alright, cut it out. Cut it. Okay, so what did we learn today? We learned that when the
paper airplane comes with specific instructions on
how to build the plane, you should probably listen to these. So, what do you guys think about
Ken's picks for this video? Let us know in the comments
below, and as always, the links to all this stuff will be in the description of the video. Anyway guys, thank you
so much for watching, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin, and today my mission is very simple, to find the weirdest tech of CES 2018. And should be pretty easy, there's a lot of weird stuff here. So the Razer booth is incredibly loud, incredibly busy for one reason, they have the unbelievably
impressive giant keyboard. It sounds very solid. I'm not entirely sure
why this exists though. Why does this exist? - Because why not? Who else is out here doing this, man? Razer's out here, guys,
doing things people aren't. - You heard it here first. Razer does stuff because they can. So you might be familiar
with this little known product called the iPhone X. No well, out of the box
it's going to be waterproof up to about six feet. Catalyst was like oh no, not good enough. So not only do they have
a case for the iPhone X which is going to be
waterproof up to 33 feet, but they're even cases for the AirPods, so you wanna go take those
underwater you can do that. You can take the iPad underwater which is my personal favorite. So that's only going to
be for a few feet deep, but I mean, an iPad
underwater sounds cool. This is something you
definitely don't see everyday. So this is a fully transparent keyboard. So not only is it going to be flexible, but the idea is that you actually can connect it via Bluetooth. So hey guys. It's a little hard to type with. But it's actually kind of a cool idea, and one of the best parts is
that when you hit the button it will actually retract it inside. This is still a concept right now, so there's actually no release date. But the idea of having a keyboard that can roll up in your pocket is kind of cool even though it would be nice if it was just a little bit bigger. He's sitting down right now. Can I go say hi? Is that okay? Is that a thing I can do? I know we came back. I know you're out having lunch. Can we please take a look? Thank you Doctor Fuji, this means a lot. - You see, gets a workout? Nice you see, we did the medium for ya. Explore. Nice! This is, shook out my fat you see. Shook out, it's for real. That's why we can be your motivation. Care for your health. Care for your sexy body. Looks - a major change. It's American line, you see? - That's quite the statement. - Yeah, that's quite a
technology for health fitness. - Oh boy. - Oh wow. Wow. This is-- I'm feeling things I did not think I was going to feel. (dance music) I feel so sexy right now. Okay so after getting the
full Doctor Fuji experience, I've gotta say that CES,
it's looking pretty good. I've never felt healthier. I've never felt sexier. At CES there is wild and
crazy tech all around, but one of the most
exciting things I've seen is right behind me. So I was over here yesterday,
and something about this laptop definitely jumped out to me. And that was the .com
button on the keyboard. So can you tell me anything about this? - This is the only for IT products okay. - Revolutionary tech at CES. A .com button built in to the keyboard. It's hard to go wrong. All I know right now is Ken
pulled the camera out and said, "Hey, follow Wes." So my hopes are high. What is that? What is that? These actually look really cool. Hey guys, this is Austin at CES 2018. I finally found some style. I mean, maybe, I don't really know. This is style, right? This is an actual battery belt. - It is. - Can you give me like the 30 second pitch on what this is and why I should want it. - Sure this is padded wearable technology for belts and straps. We do belt straps or,
your know, purse straps, belts, anything that
has a strap or a belt. - A medium all right. Let me give it a try here. Let me give it a try. So I"m about to try on the battery belt. This is a really big belt. So the actual battery is from here to here it looks like or...interesting. So we've got a USB as well as a micro USB. We are three quarters charged. Okay, a little large, I will admit, but basically the idea
here is that I could just plug my phone in to my belt and to be able to charge it. So I can walk around
being incredibly stylish while charging my phone. So I'm just gonna walk
around for the rest of CES with my slightly too large belt on. Or maybe not, I might just
give it back to him 'cause it's not mine. I've seen a lot of weird stuff this day, this week, this year, my life. This is up there. That face. It doesn't make it any better. They're singing in a really creepy way. I need to go home. 
- OnePlus has always been known for delivering flagship
performance at a much lower price and that trend continues
with the brand new 5T. You're getting a lot of
features from phones like the iPhone X and Galaxy Note 8 except at about half the price. But the question is, is it worth it? Hey, guys. This is Austin. I spent the last week
playing with the OnePlus 5T and there is a lot to like. Compared to the already solid OnePlus 5, the most noticeable
change is with the screen. Gone is the old 5.5 inch
panel and in its place is a much taller six inch screen in the exact same size to chassis. Sure, its bezels might not
be as thin as something like the iPhone X, but you're
still getting a lot more screen real estate with the
two-to-one aspect ratio. It's a great panel, too. While the resolution is a
little low at 2160 by 1080, it's still plenty sharp to my eye. Unlike the Pixel 2 XL, it's
actually a nice looking OLED display. It looks nice right out of
the box, but you have several other screen modes
including sRGB and DCI-P3, which is my personal favorite. Because you've got the larger
screen, the capacitive keys are gone and the fingerprint
sensor has been moved around back. I'm totally fine with this. Just like the Pixel, this feels like a really natural spot for it. The 5T does add facial recognition
and while it's not in the same league as the iPhone
X, it's pretty quick. Although it's definitely
not perfectly accurate. Unfortunately, it's
still running Android 7, but Oxygen OS remains pretty
close to Stock Android with basically no bloatware. There's a lot of great
customization options like rearranging your onscreen
buttons and what things like a long press will do, as well
as tweaking the notification shade and status bar to
be exactly how you like. This is a great option if you really want to tweak your phone, which is why a lot of people go with OnePlus
in the first place. The rest of the design
looks almost identical to the OnePlus 5 and that's
not really a bad thing. You've got the same almost
too slippery aluminum back with the addition of
that fingerprint sensor and amazingly for a new flagship in 2017, a headphone jack. You're also getting solid
performance with a Snapdragon 835, six or eight gigs of RAM, and either 64 or 128 Gigabytes of storage. This is backed up with a
3300 milliamp hour battery. While not massive, with the
lower res screen and OnePlus' super fast Dash charging, it makes it pretty easy to
keep the phone topped off. If this feels like a classic
S-model update to you, then you'd be right. I can't fault OnePlus for not
totally overhauling the phone. The original OnePlus 5 was really solid. The issue was that it came
out only five months ago. Look, I'm all for pushing
tech forward, but it's kind of ridiculous that a five month
old phone is already obsolete. Why didn't they just make the OnePlus 5T, the OnePlus 5 in the first place? To be fair, I feel the same
about the way that Samsung updates the Galaxy S and Note lines. Six months later, it seems
like you just get a slightly updated Galaxy S8, but at least
with the Note you're getting some major upgrades like
the S Pen and dual cameras. This strategy kind of worked
last year with the OnePlus 3T, but 2017 has proven to be one
of the most competitive years for smartphones ever and nothing
shows that off better than the Google Pixel 2. I absolutely love this phone. Software updates have improved
the XL screen, but for me the standard Pixel 2 checks so many boxes that it's basically the gold standard. Put it side by side and it's
clear that the OnePlus 5T is a much larger phone. The smaller bezels absolutely
dwarf the Pixel 2's five inch display and having a
headphone jack is a real win for a lot of people. The 5T still only has a single
downward firing speaker, which actually does get
reasonably loud and has some bass, but it just can't match the
terrific stereo speakers on the Pixel. The OnePlus also lacks
any kind of waterproofing or wireless charging. Now I can live without these,
but knowing that the Pixel 2 isn't afraid of getting
wet is a big selling point. While Oxygen OS is good as far
as skins go, I can't get away from just how great Android looks and feels running on the Pixel 2. Not only has it had Android
Oreo since day one, but it is blisteringly fast. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Google has worked some
real magic with this phone. One area where OnePlus
has really stepped it up is in the camera department. The main wide angle shooter
is unchanged, but they swapped the telephoto option for a
20 megapixel secondary camera with the same focal length. On one hand, this is a downgrade as you don't get optical zoom. However, they're using the same camera to improve low light performance. It works. Side by side with the Pixel, it holds up really well with noise. Although it can't quite touch
the Pixel 2's incredible dynamic range. They've gone for a slightly
punchier, more saturated look, which I think most people
will like, but it comes at the expense of some detail, even looking a bit soft at times. You do have portrait mode on both and while the 5T does an
adequate job, I really prefer the colors and that
crazy range of the Pixel. To my eye it looks like a significantly
more expensive camera. This is what 4K video looks
like on the OnePlus 5T. So I think audio is
actually surprisingly decent and the stabilization, even
though it's not optical, does a pretty good job of keeping up. The OnePlus 5T is a great phone. When you consider the $500
price, it's easy to reconsider that Galaxy Note 8 or Pixel 2 XL. If you can look past the screen though, I think the standard Pixel
2 is worth every penny of the $150 price premium. So, what do you guys think
about the OnePlus 5T? Let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This computer is making
me money right now. While that might sound
like some scummy pop-up ad, in reality, it's all
thanks to Cryptomining. You've probably heard of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin. These are digital
currencies that are worth real world money. For example, a single
bitcoin goes for about $2400 right now. This has become a really big industry. Not only has Bitcoin been
recognized as legal currency in places like Japan,
but you can spend Bitcoin at a lot of online
retailers, such as Microsoft, buying games on Steam. You could even purchase things with PayPal using Bitcoin. It is a big deal. For example, if you
fire up a mining program on your computer, it'll immediately start crunching the numbers on
different transactions that come it's way. As a reward for doing all that hard work, you'll gain tiny, tiny
amounts of cryptocurrency. Typically, this doesn't really equal much. However, as things like Bitcoin become more and more valuable,
it can actually add up. There are two different
ways of getting your hands on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The first is really straightforward. You can buy and sell them
just like anything else. So, the market will go up and
down and it does that a lot, but the theory is, you buy
'em for cheap, sell 'em for more and you make a profit
just like the stock market. The other is by mining. So, every transaction is public. So what that means is that
some computer has to do the work of deciding that
hey, someone has money, it needs to go to the other person. Make sure that's a legit transaction. In the early days, you could
use an ordinary gaming PC to mine Bitcoin, but as
it's gotten more popular and more importantly, there's
more and more competition for mining, it is pretty crazy to use a standard gaming PC
to mine Bitcoin today. There has been other
cryptocurrencies that have sprung up over the years. So, back in 2013, I had
a few different Litecoin mining rigs set up and generally speaking, if you have a PC with a solid
GPU, you can make that work. However, the issue is, as things
get more and more popular, people design what are called
ASICs, which are literally custom-designed chips that are purely made to destroy a PC at mining. Today though, cryptomining
has seen a major resurgence and a lot of that is thanks to
a new option called Ethereum. Now, this is something that
actually does make sense to mine on a standard gaming PC. So, we've been using this
CyberPower PC that we did a video on recently which
actually is now down to $650, which is kind of funny because
thanks to cryptomining, even the graphics card itself
sometimes will go for $650. Generally speaking, higher end AMD cards like the RX 580 that's
inside is going to be your best bet for cryptomining. NVIDIA options also do
work pretty well too. If you have a lower end card
that's maybe a little bit older that's gonna draw a lot of power, you wanna try mining on
the CPU, it's generally not going to be worth it. Cryptomining really is all about the GPU. The actual setup for mining is
surprisingly straightforward, a lot better than it used to be. So you just need three things,
a PC to do your mining, a Bitcoin wallet and a mining program. There are lots of options
for creating a wallet, but I use Coinbase. Not only is it fairly simple
as they do pretty much all the work for you, but
not only can you buy Bitcoin, but more importantly, you can
sell them or just spend them. For the mining program,
a really easy option is to use Nicehash. So, this runs as a normal Windows app and all you need to do is
let it do it's initial setup, give it your Bitcoin wallet address and it handles everything else from there. Nicehash does take three percent
of everything that you mine but in return, it's a
completely automatic setup, so if you're not super
familiar with this stuff, it works pretty well and
it's even smart enough to automatically pick
between different algorithms based on what's going
to be most profitable. The cool thing is, since
this is just a normal Windows program, you can
mine whenever you want. So, say you wanna actually play
some games on your game PC, just stop mining for a few minutes. Once you're done, turn it back on. So I'm about to throw
some numbers at you guys, but please take all these
with a giant grain of salt. This can go way up and way
down pretty much at any point. So right now, with this
setup over the last few days, it's averaged making about $2.10 a day. So, of course, you do have
to keep the electricity bill in mind. So with this system and
the electricity rates here, it's pulling about 25
cents worth of power a day. That might not sound like
much, but when you add it up, that's about $57 a month
or about $690 a year, which is actually enough to
pay for the entire system. But, and there's a giant but, this changes all the time, seriously. So, just today, as we've
been filming this video, prices have changed a lot. So, earlier this morning,
we were making about $1.90 a day. However, right now, we're
doing about $2.31 in mining. It really does change on
an almost hourly basis. All of this is just an example
with this single graphics card inside this system. So if you have a really beefy system with say, a pair of 1080
Ti's, you can be making a lot more money. On the other hand, if you
have an older graphics card, it might not even make sense
to mine in the first place. So, there is a cool calculator. I have that linked into the description where you can plug in
what your hardware is. It'll tell you roughly about how much you would make per day. What doesn't really make
sense is going out and buying a bunch of hardware just to start mining. So, this has actually made graphic cards not only out of stock in a lot of places, almost more important than
that, really, really expensive. One things that makes
a little bit more sense is if you already have a
gaming PC and you just wanna give this a try. It is kinda fun. The thing you need to keep in mind though is that this is going to
be essentially running your GPU at 100% 24/7. It's not necessarily
going to immediately break or anything, but it
will definitely shorten the lifespan of your card. This definitely isn't for everyone, but as a nerd, there's
actually something kind of fun about this. So, what do you guys think
about mining cryptocurrencies? Let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- So, I'm officially
Ken-less and on my own. But, it's time to drive the Model 3. Hey guys, this is Austin. The Tesla Model 3 is a big deal. So, this promises to be one of the first mass market electric
cars and I spent tonight at the launch event here in Fremont. First of all, huge shout out to Dan. He's the only reason I'm
actually here right now, 'cause he gave me a call
like a few days ago, he's like, "Yo, do you want to come "and check out the Model 3 event?" - I needed somebody that
has a good tech background. - And somebody who can vlog? - Somebody that can vlog, that's
a good hand, holding that. - [Austin] It's easy to forget just how big of a deal this is. So, unlike something like the Model S, which starts at around $70,000, you can pick up a Model
3 for about $35,000. And that's before the tax breaks which can bring it down even cheaper. They announced two models today. The Standard, as well
as a Long Range option. So, the Standard model will get you about 220 miles of range,
where the Long Range gives you a pretty impressive 310 miles. So, what's interesting is,
they're no longer branding it just like the Model S with
the actual kilowatt hours, but most people are
guessing that the base model is going to be around 50 kilowatt hours and about 70 for the Long Range, quite a bit smaller than the Model S, but this is also a
smaller and lighter car. - 'Cause like Model S, is already
and Tesla's made it clear, a superior car. So, there's almost no
reason for someone to go from a Model S to a Model 3. - Right, the Model 3 is the lower end, entry level version. - It's the entry level for
people who wanted a Model S couldn't quite get there, but
now have this $35,000 option. - It does however look very, very similar to the Model S. Personally, I like the look. It's sort of like a mix
between a shrunken Model S, mixed with a little bit
of Porsche Panamera. It's a little bit awkward
in photos and even video doesn't totally do it justice, but in person, I've got to say, especially from the rear
sort of three quarter view, it is a really nice looking car. I only wish it was maybe
dropped like an inch or so, but we'll see. Inside things are fairly basic. So, my test drive was
about 10 o'clock at night, so, it was kind of hard to see everything. But one thing you can very easily see, is the fact that the dash is basically just a single 15 inch screen. Now, don't get me wrong,
it's a nice looking display and you do get pretty
much all the information, like your speedometer, you get your nav, all your climate controls
but that's pretty much it. There is no speedometer or
anything in front of the driver. Now on stage, Elon was
talking about the idea that as things become
more and more autonomous, that it doesn't really matter
if you're actually looking at all your gauges and
stuff because the car will be driving itself. But as of right now, I'm not so sure how
well that's going work. You got to drive the Model? - I did. - I unfortunately just got a ride. What'd you think? - I really liked it. I got really used to
comparing all these cars I've been trying the last
couple months to my car and they're all super different. - Yeah. - Model 3, I've sat in it
and it felt like a Tesla. It felt very familiar. - It is so quiet, I feel like
it's quieter than the Model S and the Model S is super, super silent. - They're both very quiet
and these have smaller wheels so the rides a little
smoother, a little quieter. - Yeah.
- Yeah. - I unfortunately did 19 miles an hour in my test drive, so. - I think I hit 65? - So you drove it?
- I drove it. - It's obviously not
as fast as the Model S. - Right, it's not as quick but like, the weird thing is, when
you stomp on that pedal, you still get that lurch forward, that immediate torque of an electric car, because it's electric,
that's the benefit you get. So, it still feels quick. - [Austin] We don't have an exact spec on how much power it provides, but essentially they're quoting somewhere between 5.2 to 5.6 seconds
to 60, which is quick. At launch, they're only
selling two wheel drive cars but in the not too distance future, you should be able to get a dual motor car with all wheel drive, which I would assume is going to be a lot faster. However, don't expect this to be able to out run a Model S anytime soon. That is still going to be
over the double the price and I'm sure that they do
not want it to get too close. The Model 3 does support autopilot, just like the Model S
as well as the Model X, which means that essentially right now, it can drive itself on the highway. But in the future, you
should be able to upgrade it to nearly fully autonomous experience. They weren't showing off autopilot tonight and the full autonomous
version is definitely going to be a little ways out. But in theory, a Model
3 that you buy today has all the hardware that you need that you can drive from point-to-point without even having to
touch any of the controls. - Sitting behind the wheel you see more. Like the nose gets down
and out of the way. Where in Model S, the nose is very much in your frontal peripheral. - And this is way smaller than a Model S, way smaller. - It feels like 25%
smaller on the outside. But on the inside, - It's not so bad
- It's not that bad. - Not that bad.
- Not so bad. - [Austin] I only got to
spend a little bit of time with the Model 3 tonight, but they are well on the
way to shipping them. So, Elon Musk claims
that they're going to be shipping about 20,000 Model 3s a month by the end of the year. So, if you've got that pre-order in, they're actually going
to be coming fairly soon. So, what do you guys think
about the Tesla Model 3? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is
Austin, and today I'm here with the next best Tech Under 50. The reason I use quotation marks is I have no idea what I'm
about to take a look at because our good buddy, Mr. Savage Kenny has got the hook up. So, what is our first product? This is really fun, I'm excited. A Kindle Fire? (laughs) I've done a video on this. I've done multiple videos
on the Kindle Fire. (laughs) - Now, to be fair this
actually is a newer version. The last time I took a look at this was probably the end of 2015? So, for $50 you are getting
a full-fledged tablet here, and the newer version
does have better specs. So, this one supports dual-band WiFi, quad-core processor,
front and rear cameras, and the only real issue I had before was that the screen was not very good, but we'll see how it is. Also, I like how it comes
in a little cardboard bag. That's kind of cool. So the Fire 7 is running
a version of Android, but it has been heavily
modified by Amazon. When you actually take a look at it, you're not going to find anything like the Google Play Store. Instead, you're pretty much
forced to use all Amazon apps, including their app store,
music, and of course, Kindle. Hey guys, this is Austin. Recently, we took a look
at $400 gaming laptop. So the speakers are not
going to be anything amazing, but the screen is actually
better than I remember. It is a seven inch, 1024 by 600 panel, but as far as the actual viewing angles and color and stuff, it's a lot better than you would expect for $50. So, we try the camera here. Oh, that's uh (laughs). For $50, I have to hand it to Ken. The Fire 7 is not too bad, but what is up next? All right, we've got the
Koss Porta Pro Classics. So, I've heard of Koss
headphones, I've tried a couple, but I actually do not
know anything about these. They look kind of retro, though. These really cost $50? - [Ken] Yes. - Okay, all right. They look, I mean, I'm
gonna be totally honest, these look like toys. They're just so tiny,
they're so plastic-y. I mean (headphone pieces
clacking together), but I will say I do feel like I've heard that there are some really
good Koss Headphones. They're cheap, so I'm assuming
that's what these are. To be fair, they're
very sort of 80s styled, so maybe they're just like, I mean, it does say
Classic on the box, so. You know what? These are way, way, way
better than I was expecting. The Porta Pros by Koss, I would never have looked twice at these, but the more I play with them, not only do they sound
good, but I do kind of dig the sort of retro 80s styling. An Echo Dot. How much is the Echo Dot? - [Ken] 50. - Oh, again, exactly $50? - [Ken] Yes. - Okay, cool. So inside we have the Echo Dot itself, which, wow actually I didn't realize just how small this guy is. Ken, is there a secret Amazon sponsorship that I don't know about? Two of the first three products
are available on Amazon. Is it almost like there are links below to purchase all of these
products on Amazon.com? So the Echo Dot is a smaller version of the full size Amazon Echo. Essentially, what you're getting here is something that not only
can play music and what not, but more importantly has Alexa built in so that you can do things
like ask it questions, control lights, all that kind
of stuff just with your voice. Alexa. Austin lights on. - [Alexa] Okay. - Hey! The only issue with the Echo Dot is that because it is so small, the
speaker just isn't great. So sure, for normal use like being able to use voice commands,
that's totally fine, but for listening to music you're probably going to want to take advantage of the headphone jack on the back. Alexa, stop. The Echo Dot is a lot less expensive than the full size Echo,
and if all you need to do is a little bit of voice command, say turn on some lights in
your house, it is not too bad. But, I'm curious what do we have next? (sigh) Another mouse? Okay, and-- Oh, a mouse and keyboard. Okay, okay, hold on, hold on. So, how much were these? - Exactly 50 again? - [Ken] Yes. - This is getting slightly
suspicious at this point. All right, so let's start
with the Corsair M65 Pro. Now, if I remember right on our $30 video we took a look at a slightly
lower end Corsair mouse. This (laughs) this has
all the RGB apparently. So, first of all, I do have to say I kind of dig the whole storm trooper vibe with the white and black,
and at first glance. Oh yeah, that feels good. Before we give the mouse a try, we also have the Aukey
RGB Mechanical Keyboard. I feel like I'm sensing a trend here with everything being RGB. So, to test our super
cool new RGB accessories we have to, you know, play
an actual game with them. Immediately, I like the
way this mouse feels. It's nice and precise, I'm
not sure what the exact DPI settings are off the top of my head, but it feels pretty good. Well, you could save a little bit of money if you don't want the RGB. The keyboard itself does not feel bad. I really do feel like
the difference between this and the actual Cherry switches is pretty hard to tell in normal gaming. If you want to upgrade
from a lower-end mouse, and especially, a normal
membrane keyboard, this is actually a really good way of doing it on a budget,
but I think we have one last item to take a look at. Is this really the packaging? A Lumia 435 (laughs). Why is it in this weird packaging? Did this like fall off
a truck or something? So, I've taken a look
at a few Windows phones, but I don't think I've
ever seen the Lumia 435. The first thing that jumps
out to me, this is tiny. I will say I don't hate the design even though it's definitely
small and a little bit chunky, I kind of like the sort
of matte white finish with the black front,
but I'm not encouraged that this is going to be worth the $50. The bigger problem is that
this is running Windows phone. Now that's not necessarily
a huge deal breaker, I mean, Windows phone is
still technically supported, but it is definitely
not going to be as easy to have app support as say,
something like iOS or Android. Hey guys, this is Austin. This computer is making
me money right now. You know what? Even though the audio quality
isn't particularly great, that speaker actually gets really loud. It's rocking a four inch display with a resolution of 480 by 800. Now, if that sounds like a
spec straight out of 2010, you would be correct, but
at least the panel itself is actually not too bad. It gets fairly bright, and viewing angles are acceptable for 50 bucks. This phone is really, really small, but it actually does work pretty well and that's something that
I've always really valued about Windows phone is that
even on fairly low specs, it does run very smoothly. The Lumia 435 has a very, very impressive two megapixel rear-facing camera. I mean, it's not the worst
thing I've ever seen. I think it actually might
be better than the Fire 7. I really want to like this phone, especially considering the budget price. I don't mind the design, it
does feel unique and different, but for $50, I still
feel like there are going to be better options out there. Sorry Ken, five out of six. So I'm curious, out of all this tech what is your guy's favorite? Let me know in the comments below, and as always, links to
everything I talked about in this video will be in the description. Anyway, thank you guys
so much for watching, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. So you've probably seen a
lot of tech under videos so all of the tech I'm
going to take a look at, five items in total, cost less than $30. The twist is, I have no idea if any of it is remotely good. This is the ZTE Maven 2. How much was this? - [Ken] $30. - $30 exactly, okay, all right. So this guy is rocking
Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 which is only like two years old, so not that bad, I guess. Eight gigs of storage,
a five inch touchscreen, which actually looks like a
pretty decent size for $30. You know, it always
surprises me how much you can get for so cheap, especially
when it comes to smartphones. So last year, I spent
a little while with a $20 smartphone and while
it probably was not as good as this, it was kind of usable. It's definitely plasticy,
although to be fair, it doesn't have the battery in it yet so that might help a little bit. The first thing that jumps out to me is that the screen is
actually pretty decent. So yes, it's definitely low resolution, it gets pretty bright, and that same thing goes for the build quality. It's not perfect, it
definitely is very plasticy, but it feels reasonably sturdy. Okay, yeah, that's a lot of bloatware. Get a shot of Savage Kenny. Oh wait, no wait, no, we
gotta switch over to fun mode. Oh, it totally worked. So it will actually take
the picture when you smiled. That's actually kind of cool, all right. I'll give them that. Okay, it won't stop taking pictures of me. Okay, all right, so we're recording. This is the 720p video. Ken, you're looking
not as savage as usual. (laughing) I'm done. So, is the Maven 2 worth $30? Yeah, when I saw a $30 smartphone, I had pretty low expectations. When you consider that this is
1/20 the price of a flagship, and it does basically everything. Maybe it's not quite as
fast or not quite as sexy, but at the end of the
day, it's hard to argue with a smartphone at this price. All right, so that actually wasn't bad. What do we have for item number two? (drumming) (laughing) The Roku Express? So for reference, this is about $5 cheaper than a Chromecast. So we have the Express
itself, which kind of looks like an IR receiver. We also have a USB wall
adapter, some batteries, and what you don't get with a Chromecast is an actual remote. This is actually a lot of stuff for $30. I will say that navigating
through the interface actually is reasonably snappy. It's a little bit of a different
thing than a Chromecast because that really
does rely on you casting things from a phone or
a computer or something whereas this is more meant
to be used with the remote and as a proper streaming box. This totally works. So there's really not that much exciting about the Roku Express,
for $30, you are getting a pretty solid standalone experience. Oh boy, the mini wired controller
for XBOX One and Windows. To be fair, I have not used
a third party controller for a console since
the Playstation 2 days, but this just looks really cheap. Oh boy, that's some shiny plastic. (laughing) Oh, it's a wired controller, okay. I guess that makes sense. Putting the mini controller side by side with the full sized one, it actually isn't a huge difference in size. It's a little bit smaller,
but what really jumps out to me is that this doesn't feel that bad. So the glossy plastic
definitely looks super cheap, but having the textured finish on the back actually feels pretty nice. More importantly, it feels
like a solid controller, so there's really no flex in it. Maybe just a little bit
if I really torque it. That is a lot of auto aim. (laughing) The controller itself feels pretty good. It definitely is a little
different from the normal XBOX One controller and for $20 less, I don't know if the difference is really going to be worth it. Maybe if you were just playing on PC, you don't care about a
wireless option, it's fine. You even do have the impulse triggers and you also have the death,
that's more important. You have the death. The Corsair Katar FPS
and MOBA gaming mouse. Another $30, actually
did a good job of getting everything exactly on point. So have four programmable buttons and we also have on the fly DPI tuning. That sounds exciting. For $30, though, if this
actually isn't too bad, that's going to be pretty
solid for a gaming mouse. That actually feels pretty good. So the entire thing is coated in a sort of soft touch rubber. Oh yeah, that actually feels pretty good. It's a little bit on
the smaller side though. What really jumps out
to me is that this feels a lot better than most sort
of cheap, low end mice. The tracking is nice and
responsive and I think it might be a little bit on the
smaller side for some people, but more importantly,
it feels really nice. So far, I actually think
we've been doing pretty good, but it's time to see
what the final item is. Mister Bolido. Cinderella Girl? Ha ha, very funny. Lightning AirPods? Oh cool, something I actually
wanted to do a video on. The Sony MDRVX110, a
powerful, high-quality sound. How much were these? - [Ken] $14. - $14? All right, $14 it is. It's been a while since
I've tried cheap headphones and even those were usually ear buds, so, oh, the folding
mechanism actually doesn't feel that bad. I mean, they're definitely
cheap and plastic, but for $14, you really shouldn't expect anything too crazy. Pull out our super cool ZTE Maven, probably not the greatest
headphone amp but I'm curious. What? A bag of Doritos? What? Why does that smell so bad? Wait, what are these? A USB cable and some
really terrible headphones? Wait, wait, wait, what is this? While you're crunching
on the boldest snack in the universe, plug
your headphones straight into the front of the
bag, play, and rock out to songs from Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack. There's a headphone jack on the bag? Okay, hold on, hold on. So I just plug in and just do it? (laughing) Where did you get this bag? (laughing) Oh, this is a Ken and Jimmy special, huh? - [Jimmy] Hell yeah. - All right, that's actually cool. So the headphones sound
good when you plug them into a bag of Doritos. Something I never thought I would say. Okay, that was actually kind of cool. Let me try it with some real music. So, are these going to match
really expensive headphones? Absolutely not, but especially
if you're coming from something like a headphone that's included with your phone, these sound a lot nicer. There's a little bit of lack of clarity, especially when you get towards
the bassier side of things, but for $14, this actually
might be my favorite thing here. As always, I'll have
links to all this stuff in the description of this video, with the possible exception
of the Doritos bag, which I don't think costs $30 anymore, but let me know in the comments, which one of these pieces of tech would you guys pick up for $30? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Dual cameras, an aluminum build, a fingerprint sensor,
a bezel-less display, and a headphone jack in
a smartphone in 2017? Hey guys, this is Austin. When Honor reached out
and wanted to sponsor a video on their brand new 7X, all I needed was the word
headphone jack and I was in. Now the first thing I noticed is that blue is actually pretty nice. So something I really
liked with the original Pixel was the very blue color. While this isn't quite so
vibrant it is definitely unique. There's not exactly a lot
of other stuff in the box. There's a European style power plug as well as a micro USB cable. The idea here is that you're getting a lot of what you would expect on a 2017 flagship but
at a much lower price. So the actual official announcement of this phone will be on December 5th, but from what I've heard it's
going to be under 300 euros. Considering the price, this feels good. So the design actually reminds me a little bit of the iPhone 7. It has very rounded corners
it's a bit of a seamless design, but when you flip it around front the screen is a lot bigger. While it would be nice to see USB-C on the bottom instead
of the micro USB port, we do however get the headphone jack. I will say that the bottom firing speaker on this is maybe not
quite as loud as I'd like, but the addition of the headphone jack kind of evens that out for me. There's also a fingerprint
sensor on board, and it's fast. Basically as soon as you put your finger on the button the phone wakes right up. Inside it's powered by a
Kirin 659 octa-core processor, 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigs of storage. Kirin is Huawei and
Honor's SOC manufacturer, so unlike pretty much every other phone out there that
has a snapdragon chip, this is going to be
something a little different. And Honor claims that this
should be able to hold up better under longer periods
of use, such as gaming. When you get into a game
like Modern Combat 5, you'll see that it actually
holds up pretty well, and it does take advantage
of the 18 by 9 display. So while yes, this is not going to have the same power as
something like a flagship, it looks surprisingly
good and for pretty much any game that's available on Android it should be able to handle it. And with a 3340 milliamp hour battery, you should be able to get some pretty good gaming in on this guy. Honor claims that it should last up to a day and half of normal usage. Software wise we have Android
7.0 with EMUI 5.1 on top. This is a bit of a heavier skin however you can customize
it by re-enabling the app drawer which
is what I've done here, and there are some cool features like being able to pull
down and get something very similar to Spotlight. A big selling point of the Honor 7X is the bezel-less display. So it's rocking a 6-inch
2160 by 1080 max view panel. When you look at it up front
it's pretty much all screen. So it has similar screen to body ratio to something like a Galaxy Note 8. And while yes, the panel
itself is not maybe the most color accurate
thing in the world, at this kind of price there's
not much to complain about. Plus, that wider 18 by 9 aspect ratio does a really good job of showing you more wide screen videos such
as our iPhone X Is It Worth It, it fills out a lot more of the screen. One of my favorite budget
phones of this year, is the Moto E4 Plus. With a 5.5 inch screen it's actually a fairly similar size to the Honor, however you can see just
how much less screen real estate you actually
have to work with here. Having such a big display is also helpful when it comes to split screen. So you tap and hold on the multitasking, you can pull up like another app, and if you want you can be
watching a video at the same time as you're scrolling through a web page, replying to a message, whatever. Around back we have two cameras. A 16 megapixel main shooter
backed up with a 2 megapixel secondary camera for
stuff like portrait mode. (Laughs)
Wow, that's so stylized. Let's go crazy town on this. You can tell they're really sorta pushing the shadows and the highlights, but with this sort of wide aperture mode that's an interesting look. I mean, it's different. Get a little bit of HDR action see what the dynamic range is like. That's not bad. I mean it helps it's a
little bit cloudy right now, but it's pretty much keeping
everything in the shot. You can also enable a simulated bokeh for the front facing camera. The front facing portrait
actually doesn't look bad. So it does lose a little bit of the side of my face and especially the glasses which a lot of phones have a problem with, but considering that it's
doing this purely on software, whereas on the rear
facing cameras you do have that secondary camera to
sort of figure out the depth, this isn't bad. This is what the 1080p video
looks like from the Honor 7X. So while it would be nice to have 4K, the stabilization is actually not too bad and even when I'm kinda
trying to move around and change exposure stuff
it holds up pretty well. The Honor 7X is an interesting phone. So considering the price
there's a lot to like. Stuff like the bezel-less
display, the dual cameras, the good build quality,
solid battery life. But the question is what
this thing actually costs. Honor will be announcing
the full price of the 7X at a launch event on December 5th, and I'm very curious to see
exactly where this lines up, because if the price is right
it's really compelling phone. So, what do you guys
think of the Honor 7X? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin, and this is my portable gaming setup. So, it might not look like
much from the outside, but inside this bag is everything
I need to game on the go. First of all, I've got
to give a big shout-out to Acer for sponsoring this video. The star of my portable setup is their Predator Helios 300 laptop. For just over a thousand dollars, what you're getting here is
a pretty well-built laptop. So, yes, for some
people, the gamer aesthetic might be a little bit strong. But, for me, I feel
like it's fairly subtle, and you do have that nice
brushed aluminum look. What really makes this
guy special are the specs. So, inside it's rocking a
Core i7-7700 HQ processor. GTX 1060 graphics, as well as 16 gigs of DDR4 memory, as well as a 256-gigabyte SSD. Take a look at the
benchmarks and you'll see that that Core i7 is
about as good as it gets as far as gaming laptops go right now. With the GTX 1060 inside, it is a big step up over the 1050 Ti, and especially the 1050. It's also pretty upgradeable. So, underneath a pair of doors
on the bottom of the laptop, both of which only need a
single screw to get into. Not only can you upgrade this
guy to 32 gigabytes of memory, but there's also an entirely empty 2.5" drive bay for adding a hard drive or another SSD. It's also rocking a
15.6-inch 1080p IPS panel. So, a lot of laptops,
weirdly even gaming laptops, will skimp in the screen department, but this is a solid IPS panel. It's got good viewing angles, solid color, and 1080p is a good sweet
spot for that GTX 1060 inside. It's also running a basically
clean build of Windows 10, which is nice. So, if you want to get into
the gaming side of things, there is the Xbox app,
which gives you Game DVR as well as you can connect
with people on Xbox One. And one of the only things
that's actually pretty loaded is Acer's PredatorSense software, which is fairly basic but
allows you to take a look at things like temperature as
well as control fan profiles. With the Helios, we're able
to play most games on high, if not ultra, settings at 1080p. So, Forza Horizon 3 is
a good example of this. Now, I typically play it on the Xbox One, where it runs at a decent
30 frames per second on high settings. But, here, not only can
we crank it up to ultra, but more importantly we
have an unlocked frame rate, where we're getting anywhere between 60 to 80 frames per second. A game that I don't
get to play near enough but really enjoy is StarCraft II. Now, it's something that's
been out for a few years. It shouldn't be any big
surprise that we're easily able to play on full ultra settings at 1080p. Next we have PlayerUnknown's
Battlegrounds. So, PUBG is a game that's
actually seen a fair bit of optimization lately, and
it runs pretty well here. So, a 1080p with a mix of medium-high and a couple of ultra settings, we're actually able to
get a pretty consistent 50 to 60 frames per second. Oh god, oh god. That was a bad idea. Running naked down the
street: totally recommended. Never gonna go wrong. Now, to go along with the laptop, I actually do use a Samsung T5, which I keep in this little carrying case. So, this is where I keep my Steam library. So, because I go between
different computers, both here at the office as
well as my personal laptop, so, it's nice to be able to keep all of my games in one place. So, I don't have to download
them again all over the place, keep them updated. And because this is natively USB-C, it will go right into the
Predator's USB-C port, and give me an extra 500
gigs of storage for games. So when it comes to actually gaming, I don't use anything all that crazy. I use a pretty standard mousepad as well as the BenQ FK1 Mouse. Don't let looks fool you. Even though this is a very
basic, plain-looking mouse, it actually performs really well. So, I'm not really a big
fan of more flashy mice, with a ton of buttons and RGB. So, really this is all I
need for a gaming setup, and it definitely doesn't hurt
that it's only like 60 bucks. While the Predator keyboard
paired with the BenQ Mouse is what I need for about 90% of my games, I actually do like to play
some racing games like Forza, which is where the Xbox
One controller comes in. So, this is one of their
custom Design Lab controllers that I actually did a video
on a few months ago. But, as far as the actual functionality, it's the exact same as any of
the new Xbox One controllers that feature Bluetooth. So, some of the older ones, you either had to plug in via USB or use
one of the wireless dongles. But, for this guy, all
I need to do is pair it with the laptop and I'm up and running. For headphones, I'm still
rocking these Status CB-1s. So this is actually my second pair. I actually sort of wore through the first. But, I really do love these. So, not only do they sound really nice, especially considering
the 80-dollar price tag, but they're super comfortable
for long gaming sessions. And on top of that, they do fold up so you can easily fit them in a bag. It might not be exciting but I also keep a 4-port tap on me. So, not only does this
turn one outlet into four, but you also get three USB ports. Especially when you're
traveling and you need to plug a couple laptops
or tablets or phones in, this thing can be a life saver. Everything goes inside a Tumi T-Pass bag. Now, don't get me wrong, this is definitely on the pricey side. But, not only does it carry
all of my accessories, as well as sometimes some video gear, but most importantly, the Helios 300. It might not be overkill
but I'm pretty happy with how the setup turned out. So, as always, links to all this stuff will be in the description of this video, and let me know what you
guys think about my setup in the comments below. Anyway, thank you guys
so much for watching, and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. I'm today I'm here with the very best tech of CES 2018. One of the first things that jumped out to me is the In Win Winbot case. Now, normally PC cases,
not all that exciting, but here at CES, things get a little bit more interesting. One look at this and you're gonna get some Death Star vibes. So it is a clear case that is going to actually be able to house some pretty serious components, but what really makes it cool is the fact that it is going to be completely motorized, so not only can you open and close the case like Pac-Man, but the entire thing will spin around like a robot. Now, at 3,500 dollars, the best doesn't necessarily
mean the most practical, but I've got to say, it's actually a lot cooler than I thought. Something else cool is -- (cooing) The pigeon declined to be interviewed. Continuing on the gaming train, we have the Razer Project Linda. Now this is one of my favorite things from the show this year. So much so that we actually already did an entire video about it, but the idea is that
this takes the Razer phone and turns it into a laptop. So you plug it via USB-C, it functions as the track pad, as the speakers, and the guts of the phone are enough to run the entire laptop. So if you guys want more about that, definitely be sure to go check out our full video on Razer Project Linda. Speaking of Razer, they are also showing off their Synapse
support for Phillips Hue. So you guys probably know that Razer is all about RGB literally everything and they're taking that up a notch by letting you add your Hue lights to their Synapse software. The way this works is that
inside their Synapse software, you can control your Hue lights alongside all of your accessories. So say you want to get
a super cool rave going, you can hit a key and
the entire Wave will come all the way around your room. It's kind of ridiculous, but I mean, actually, I thought it's
pretty cool, so, you know. Something I think everyone
will think is cool is Sony's 8K TV. Now 8K is slowly been showing up at CES, even though you
can't really buy them in stores just yet. However, Sony upped the game with not only a full HDR-compatible TV but it goes up to 10,000 nits. How bright is 10,000 nits? - It's really bright. - You heard it here first. It's really bright. Almost as bright as the light that's in my face right now. (laughs) To put this in context, most standard TVs, even our HDR-compatible, might top at around 500 nits, whereas this guy can go all the way up to 10,000. Now what's cool about this is that especially for some games, like Gran Turismo for example, which have been designed
with some proper HDR support in mind, you can have incredibly bright specific sources. So say that you see
the headlights of a car or a bright sunset. That can be way, way
brighter than the rest of the scene, giving
actually a really impressive bit of contrast. Of course, that's to say nothing about the idea that it is that it is an 85-inch 8K TV, which looks ridiculous, but
it's actually the HDR stuff that really sort of blew me away. It looks so, so good. Samsung were also showing off The Wall. Now this is a new type
of display technology called Micro LED. The idea here is that it actually is going to be modular to a degree, so while they were showing
off a 146-inch version, you could, at least in
theory, build pretty much as big of a TV as you wanted, assuming you have a lot of money. LG was also showing off
a pair of new displays, so they have not only a 4K option but they also have a 5K ultra-wide. So we've been using their
ultra-fine 5K displays to edit on for a little while, and they're really nice. However, what they're adding with these new displays is HDR. At least kind of. They're using HDR-600, which is brighter than standard displays. However, because neither Windows or Mac actually support HDR
yet, it's still kind of a little bit in the middle right now. What's cool is the 4K option
support Thunderbolt Three as well as daisy chaining. So off of a single Thunderbolt Three port, you can actually run two
of these 4K displays. So what I think a lot of people are going to be interested in is the new 5K Ultra-wide. So with a resolution of 5120 by 2160, this is basically like
a super-wide 4K display and especially for gaming, if you have some crazy,
over-the-top system, it's gonna look nice. Moving to the audio side of things, we have the new Sennheiser
HD-820 headphones. Now the HD-800s are regarded as some of the best-sounding
headphones pretty much anywhere and the 820s add a glass
back to the headphones. This might sound weird. However, the 800s, they leak like crazy, so if you're in the
same room, you can hear exactly what someone's listening to, whereas with the 820s,
that glass helps to give it a little bit more of a closed sound while still sounding
absolutely incredible. Seriously, either these
things are gonna be probably well over 2,000 dollars, they're some of the
best-sounded headphones I've ever tried. Moving to laptops,
there's the 2018 LG Gram. So you guys'll probably know that I love the original Gram. I've done a couple of videos on it. It's one of my favorite
laptops of last year, but for 2018, not only are they going to be bumping it up to
quad core processors but it has an almost ridiculously large 72 watt-hour battery. There are also some nice additions, including the option of
adding a Thunderbolt Three port instead of USBC,
which is especially nice for those LG displays. You also now get dual SSD
slots, so you can actually open this guy up and not
only add some more memory but also another SSD. This is definitely a
laptop I wanna check out as soon as it comes out
in the next few months. Something I found surprisingly cool at this year's show is the
Casio Mofrel 2.5d printer. So you guys are probably
familiar with 3D printers that will print full 3D objects and especially when you get up higher in the budgets, you can
do some really cool stuff with that. However, with the Mofrel,
you're actually printing textures, so with our demo,
they printed a mesh material, but in about five minutes,
you can do all kinds of different textiles,
you can do fake leather, you can even do things like stone. Now, of course, this is going to be more on the manufacturing side,
so say you wanna build like a prototype really
quickly, it's cool, and they're 50,000 dollars. It will not come cheap. But it is really cool to be able to print stuff that looks and feels surprising real in just a few minutes. Ken, are we done? Is this is it for CES? Can we go home now? I don't have a voice anymore. I've been looking at tech all week. Hopefully you guys
enjoyed our best of CES. If you missed any of the videos, check 'em out over here. Or over here. I don't know. No, no, not there. There's no videos up there, Ken. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Today we're going to be
checking out some weird tech. We have a PO box listed on the channel, and sometimes companies
send us some weird tech. So Ken, please, what is our first item? That was a poor throw. Infinitton, the smartest
screen keyboard in the world. I mean, with a Bing button, you know it's gotta be smart. So, there are 15 programmable keys, and each key is 72 by 72 pixels. So, there is a product that I've seen that's kind of similar to this, which would be the Elgato Stream Deck. The idea is that, once you plug it in, you can have each of these
buttons be customizable. At least in the Elgato's case, it's usually used for streaming. So, after a few minutes of setup, we have a few things
that are programmed in. So, for example, I can
open up a Word document, copy and past "Hey guys, this is Austin," and then press the other button to actually launch the channel. This is super simple, and at $150, this is not going to be for everyone, but it's actually kind of decent. USB motion sensor. It places the computer into sleep mode if no motion is detected
for a period of time. You could just set the screensaver. I genuinely cannot
think of a single reason why you would use this over just setting your computer to go to sleep. Oh boy, the Russian Federation? Oh, this is gonna be exciting. See, the fun of doing this is that usually Ken picks out things that I know he gets on
purpose to be terrible, but with this, I have legitimately no idea what's inside this
weird box from Russia. "Greetings Austin, we're a small company "from Moscow, Russia, and we sent you "one of our wonderful Nixie tube clocks." If you guys have never
seen a Nixie tube before, it's essentially like a retro way of looking at the time
or numbers or something, and, I mean, I didn't even realize that anyone still made these. (laughing) Look at that! Whoa, that looks so cool! Ooh! That is so cool! And it's not really a
traditional piece of tech, but man, that is not what
I expected to see today. I was expecting lots of terrible tech and not this really elegant
and cool looking retro clock. Two? Two what? Auto water? What? "Step into the future
with touchless faucets?" Wait, so is the idea that
this is just going to be an automatic faucet where
you don't have to touch it? Yep, that's exactly what it is. Hey guys, this is Austin, and welcome to Austin's Kitchen Corner,
where I review the latest in hot new bathroom gadgets. Oh, so you can actually already tell that, even though there's no water, that the faucet's turning on and off when I put my hand underneath it. The Leagoo S8. Oh, I get it, S8 like a certain other Samsung Galaxy S8. Wow, that's really heavy. Why is it so heavy? So, at first glance, the phone, even though it is
similar to the Galaxy S8, actually isn't too bad. So what jumps out to me is that it feels not only a little bit
thicker, but a lot heavier, which I actually kind of don't hate. Although, the back is an absolute dust and fingerprint magnet. I can say one thing they did well though, there's a fingerprint
sensor at a reasonable spot on the back of the
phone, unlike, you know, the real Galaxy S8. Oh, I've got the blur mode. All right, let's try the blur mode. Whoa! Wow, blur mode, not good, not good. How much is this thing? I wonder, I'm actually curious, how much does it cost? The Leagoo S8. Oh, it's only like $100. That actually makes it a lot better. I expected it to be a lot more expensive. It does have a 1.5 gigahertz
octacore processor, three gigabyte of RAM,
32 gigabytes of storage, as well as a 3000
milliampere hour battery. I will say though, for around $100, this is actually really nice hardware. Yeah, the software is a little weird and the cameras aren't exactly great, but for $100. Climate Case, insulating smartphone case. Prevents your smartphone from
overheating and freezing. Fits all brands and models of smartphones. Man, they're making some
bold statements here. (laughing) What? What is this? What? What's inside here? It's so heavy. Oh, there's nothing inside
here, it's like gel. So, the idea here is that, if you're gonna go out in a cold area, you microwave this case, and if you wanna go out
in a super hot area, you put it in your refrigerator. What? Not only do you have this metal carabiner, which obviously shouldn't
go in the microwave, what happens when some person doesn't read the instructions, puts their cold phone inside this, and microwaves the whole thing? Soft Glass, you are unique. Is this a screen protector? What? It's for the iPhone X. Oh, it is a screen protector. Can I have a volunteer to try the Soft Glass screen protector, Ken? Ken? - This is the front, so we do that later, so I guess we peel off the back first. - Yeah, peel off the back. - Just take this off. - Oh, dude. - [Ken] Wow, I think we might've put a good screen protector on my iPhone. - The first time ever. "Hey Austin, I'm a 360 camera from Insta." It's kinda weird that the camera apparently wrote a note. Someone could've just said, "Hey, "we have this really cool
camera that does these things," not "I am the camera, this is what I do." Insta360 ONE, a 360 VR camera. They promise it can do 4K video and 24 megapixel photos in full 360. Inside the Insta360
ONE, we get the camera. So, the idea here is
that, not only is this going to be usable as a standalone camera, but if you plug it into an iPhone. Okay, so I am now recording
using the Insta360, which obviously will not look
quite as good on YouTube, but the idea here is that I can get a full 360 view of pretty
much everything around me. And, I mean, it actually looks kinda cool. I've played around with a
few 360 cameras like this, and while a lot of them look kind of okay, especially the ones that
plug into the iPhone, this actually has really surprisingly decent looking quality. I didn't have high expectations when I saw a 360 camera show up, but I gotta say, this is a
lot cooler than I thought. I might actually have to take
a closer look at it later. So that's it for this first episode of Weird Tech from My PO Box. Definitely be sure to let
me know if you wanna see any more of this stuff in a future video, and I will catch you guys in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. I am no stranger to
trying to game on a Mac. However, this time, well,
we're taking it up a notch. This is a $200 MacBook straight from 2009. To be clear, this is a terrible idea. But also, I don't really care. This MacBook is straight from eBay, and it has had a bit of a hard life. The inside is actually fairly clean, so there's no major
scratches on the screen, the keyboard and trackpad are all clear. However, on the exterior of the shell, there's a pretty sizable crack here, and it looks like someone just attacked the bottom of it at some point. Generally speaking, the words "Mac" and "gaming" don't go together. When you put "2009 white MacBook" together with the word "gaming," you usually have a recipe for some straight garbage town. Inside, the specs are, well, not great. It has a 2.3 gigahertz
Intel Core 2 Duo processor, four gigabytes of RAM, an
Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics. A step up from integrated
graphics, but not by much. However, it's not all bad. The rest of the hardware
does feel reasonably modern. It's running currently
a copy of MacOS Sierra, although you can update it to High Sierra, and you got stuff like dual-band Wi-Fi, a good keyboard, a decent trackpad. It doesn't really feel that slow. - [Video] It is the first
iPhone to drop the home button. - So, with an only 1280 by 800 display, don't expect to be blowing
through 4K YouTube on this guy. Watching normal 720p video is no problem. Because it is running a
modern operating system, not only do you still
get stuff like patches, there's even support for things like Siri. With a resolution of 1280 by 800, the screen is definitely low-resolution by today's standards. However, the panel
itself really isn't bad. Yes, it does not get quite
as bright as I would like, but the color and especially
some of the viewing angles are a lot better than other TN panels that I've found on laptops around $200 today. You're also getting a
good selection of ports, including not only MagSafe, but Ethernet, Mini DisplayPort, and a
pair of USB 2.0 ports, and you get an optical
drive, because 2009. I have to admit, when I first
had the idea for this video, I expected this to be
pretty much garbage town. But it really isn't. However, the real test is going to be, can I play any games at all on it? Minecraft is a game that runs on basically every piece of tech on Earth, and it runs just fine here on the MacBook. Yes, you do have to turn
the graphics settings down. Especially, you have to
turn the chunk distance to be lot closer, but it does work. Now, Steam does work on MacOS, so of course, I have to give CS:GO a try, and I'm not expecting good things. 16 FPS (laughing). Alright, let's-- Oh, oh no! Okay. I'm gonna give this a solid F for failure. CS:GO is not MacBook
compatible, at least not a 2009. However, the main reason I
actually wanted to this video was a new thing from
Nvidia called GeForce Now. GeForce Now itself isn't new, but what is is the Mac beta. Essentially what we can do here is we can go through pretty much any game on Steam and Battle.net. Now, they don't support everything, but a lot of the major
games, such as Dota 2, Fortnite, Battlefront 2,
you can all play for free, at least right now during beta on the Mac. The only catch is that you
actually have to own these games. The way it works is once you
actually log into GeForce Now, you log into something
like Steam or Battle.net, and you can play the games
on your own accounts. Now, back in CS:GO running in GeForce Now, it is a huge difference. Because the computer in the cloud is doing all the heavy lifting, all the MacBook has to do is essentially just decode the video and pass through my mouse and keyboard input over the internet. I know that there's absolutely
a little bit of latency that is added, but because
we're over Ethernet and because we have
fiber here in the office, it's really hard to see any
kind of major difference. Next, we have Playerunknown's
Battlegrounds. This is a game that you
would never be able to run on the MacBook in a million years, but here again, it runs pretty
well here with GeForce Now. It's crazy just how far
cloud gaming has come. It feels like not that long ago that, while you could do stuff like this with PlayStation Now and GeForce, it really relied on having a
crazy-good internet connection. Without it, it was super-choppy and there was a lot of latency, even with a good internet connection. But here, I mean, yes, if I look closely, I can see there's a
little bit of a difference as far as not being able to
fully get that instant response, but it is not bad. Is there nothing in here? Oh, no, no no no no! Get-- No, no, yes, yes! I did it! I (laughing) killed someone with my fists! Yet again, Overwatch works totally fine. Dude, I'm really impressed with this. I've been wanting to try
GeForce Now for Mac for a while, but there's really
nothing to complain about, if you have a good internet connection, and I can't stress that enough. If you don't, this is not going to be as smooth as an experience. But if you do, it runs basically just like you're running it on your actual MacBook. The only real catch here is
that this is free only in beta. At some point, Nvidia is
going to come to their senses and start charging for this. But man, as long as it's free, it's essentially like
you're getting a free high-powered gaming PC that just happens to run on a little tiny MacBook. So, should you buy a 2009 MacBook to turn into a gaming PC? Of course not. But if you want to get into GeForce Now while it's still for free on the Mac, this is not a bad way of going at all. This is a great example
of how newer technology can mean that you don't have
to leave older hardware behind. Speaking of the hardware, this MacBook is a lot
better than I thought. I'm actually considering
maybe doing a few upgrades and doing a part two to this video, so if you guys want to see that, let me know in the comments below. Anyway guys, thank you
so much for watching, and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys this is Austin. And inside this mysterious brown box is what I very much
hope is the Xbox One X, but the question is, is it worth it? So first of all I have to give
a big shout out to Microsoft for actually sending us
out the Xbox One X early. The moment of truth. Oh, yeah. So first we get all of our paperwork in this nice little folder. So we get the Getting Started Guide. Actually something cool about the One X is that if you do have a One S right now, literally all the cables
are in the same spot, and they use the same cables. So you can just unplug the One S, plug the One X in, that works just fine. You also get one month of Xbox Game Pass, as well as what I assume is 14 days of Xbox Live Gold. We also get what seems to be some cables. Yeah so we have the tiny power cable. One of the nice things about
the One S and the One X is that you don't need a power brick, you just plug it right in. Alright we also get an HTMI cable, as well as the oh controller. I don't think the One X has a different controller than the One S. They already updated it last year with Bluetooth and a couple things but let's take a look. Yeah that looks pretty much like a normal Xbox One controller. These have a little bit
of a texture on the back, but I think it's the same as the One S just in different color, but nice although what's not nice is that the $500 console still comes
with double AA batteries. It's actually not that big of a deal but having it charged an extra $20 for the battery is kind of annoying. Now the Xbox One X. So I've actually held one of these before. It is so heavy. So it is actually slightly
smaller than the Xbox One S but it weighs a lot more and it's supposedly because
they put some crazy cooling to actually get this thing to work. There it is. Xbox One X. So if you look here in the back, it's literally just a giant heat sink. So the idea here is that because this is so much more powerful than something like the Xbox One S, they need to get a lot more cooling to actually make sure this
doesn't like, you know, explode or catch on fire or Red Ring. So just like on the One S, we have the power port, HTMI out, as well as HTMI in, a pair of USB 3.0 ports, IR out, speaker out, as well as ethernet. My big takeaways from the One X, as far as hardware goes, it's just so heavy. I'm just gonna keep saying that. This is so heavy. Ken, get up here. - Wow, yeah.
- Isn't that heavy? - I mean it's 'cause it's
smaller than One S too, right? - It's basically the same size. It's like a little smaller. - But, like, I mean, this seems like very dense. - They got vapor chamber cooling inside which is like what you'd find in like a 1080 Ti or something. - I mean also this thing, like, probably draws more power too. The power port is the same, yeah. - I'm actually surprised that they were able to do that because the PS4 Pro uses a more PC style. - [Ken] Yeah. - Speaking of the PS4 Pro, to me the One X is a much more attractive console across the board. Not only does it pack more power and a smaller and better looking chassis, but you're also getting extra features such as Ultra HD Blu Ray that you just can't get on the PS4 Pro. Put the One X side by side
with its little brother and the family resemblance is clear. It drops the bins on top in favor of a matte-like finish all the way across. While this is nice for
usability and allowing you to actually put things
on top of the console, to me I still feel like the One S is the better-looking console. Especially in white, it is such a classy look, but the One X is very similar. Like the PS4 Pro, the major advantage of the One X is that it is a more powerful
version of the Xbox One S. Look at the specs and it's no competition. While it has a similar 8
Core Processor on the One X, it's clocked higher at 2.3
gigahertz compared to 1.7. Memory sees a massive upgrade. We're going from eight gigabytes of DDR3 to 12 gigabytes of GDDR5. Now having that extra space means that not only can you do things like store higher resolution textures but it is of the faster GDDR5 variant. The original Xbox One
relied on DDR3 memory which is a lot slower but it was backed up by some very small and very fast ESRAM on
the actual chip itself. And this was expensive and part of the reason
why the original Xbox One did not have as much power as the PS4 which decided to bail on all of that and just go with the faster
GDDR5 memory out of the box. And the Xbox One X needs it. So it has an AMD mega-based GPU with a pretty impressive six
teraflops of performance. And to put that in perspective, the original Xbox One
had about 1.2 teraflops while the PS4 and the PS4 Pro have 1.8 and 4.2 teraflops respectively. That is five times the graphics horsepower of the original Xbox One and it is right up there with
a lot of high end gaming PCs. Now it's actually kind
of necessary in 2017. The original Xbox One
barely struggled to hit 1080p in a lot of games, much less 4K. The idea is that all
current Xbox One games will run right out of the box, no problem on the One X, but some games and especially
new ones going forward should be One X Enhanced. And this can mean different
things depending on the game, so a lot of the times this means that you're going to
get 4K and HDR support, but at the very least you should see some resolution and quality improvements. As I'm doing this video
before the release date, not all of these game patches are live. However a couple of them
that I can test are, Gears of War 4 and Titanfall 2. Gears is right up there with some of the best looking
options on the Xbox One and you get a ton of options on the One X. Not only does it have a 4K rendering mode with enhanced textures, but you can also opt to play it in 1080p at 60 frames which is awesome. Not all games do this but it brings the experience closer to the flexibility you get on PC. When you're playing on a nice 4K TV, the difference is very noticeable. Take a closer look and you'll see that not only are textures on his face and jacket much improved, but the higher resolution helps to clean up stuff like his hair. In action, while the details
aren't quite as obvious, the extra resolution and
textures make a big difference. It's not a next generation
leap or anything but especially if you have an
HDR display, it looks great. Titanfall 2 also shows a
substantial difference. This is a game that struggles to get close to HD on standard hardware, but here it's running
with a dynamic resolution that aims for 4K while keeping locked to 60 frames per second. In most areas it's not quite at 4K but the difference compared to the standard Xbox isn't even close. It goes from being a bit of a blurry mess to looking crisp in detail. This is all based on playing on a 4K TV but you will see some
of these improvements if you're using a 1080p
or even a 1440p monitor. The One X will Super Sample down to HDE to get you a sharper image with the same improved
textures, et cetera. You won't be getting these full benefits but as 4K and HDR-compatible TVs become more and more common, having more powerful
console isn't a crazy idea. Microsoft recently brought
out backwards compatibility for original Xbox games which works well in the X as you'd expect, but what's really impressive
is the 360 emulation. On the standard one, it looks essentially identical
to base 360 hardware, but for some games including
Halo 3 and Fallout 3, there's a special One X rendering mode. Not only does this massively
improve the resolution, but it can also add
things like HDR support without touching the base game code, or at least, supposedly. Take a look at Halo 3 and the difference is kind of incredible. There's a massive leap
in not only resolution but just in sheer detail. If you take a closer look
at Arbiter here for example, he goes from being a few
blurry pixels on the 360 to being razor sharp on the One X. It's clear that they're drawing higher quality textures farther away than was possible before and the results are awesome. Unfortunately this won't be the case on every 360 game on the One X but it is still incredibly impressive. Get outside of gaming and you'll
find a very familiar sight. So the new Xbox One interface is shared across all Xbox Ones, and while it is a big improvement, it still has a little bit of clutter compared to what I'd like, PS4. You do get some new options including being able to record gameplay at up to 4K60 in HDR. Although if you want to record for longer than 30 seconds, you will need an external drive. Also just a little tip, if you want to know which games take advantage of the One X, there's a dropdown menu
which will show you which titles are One X Enhanced. The vapor chamber cooling inside the One X absolutely does its job. So it does get a little
bit warmer on the back. Thankfully that doesn't
mean that the fan speed is going to be all that high. It's only just a little bit louder than something like the One S. Given the power draw tops 165 watts, I had to give Microsoft credit. They did not cheap out when
it comes to the cooling which brings me to one of the
biggest issues with the One X, price. At $500 it's not only a
$100 more than the PS4 Pro, but it's basically double the price of the standard Xbox One. The Xbox is fighting an uphill battle. On one hand there's the
more successful PS4, and on the other is the
surprisingly excellent Nintendo Switch. So is the Xbox One X worth it? Well it depends. If you're the person who wants the most powerful console
out there, then yes, but for a lot of people, the cheaper PS4 Pro is going to deliver not only more games but the performance is close enough that it might just be enough. So what do you guys think about the One X? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. The original iPhone is
ten years old today, but how have things changed
over the last decade? Taking a look at the
original iPhone today, what jumps out to me is that
it actually doesn't seem to have changed that much over the years. So it's still made out of aluminum, it still has the same
sort of general shape of the current iPhone. Yeah, it's a lot smaller, but they actually did
get a lot of stuff right the first time. Side by side with the iPhone 7, there is a very clear evolution here. The design and build quality
really do hold up today, and that is not something
you can say about other smartphones from the time. There are definitely some issues with the original iPhone though. One of the big ones was that
it only supported 2G network, which was weird in a time that 3G was becoming a lot more popular. Because of that, when AT&amp;T shut off their 2G network earlier this year, it meant that the original iPhone, short of trying to unlock it, is no longer usable as a phone. There are also some weird quirks like the recessed headphone jack. So because of how the phone
was designed with this taper, a normal pair of headphones
actually will not fit in. You're going to need
some kind of extender. The biggest issue with the
orignial iPhone though was price. When this came out back
in 2007, it cost $600. And that was on contract! That's pretty much unheard of today. Now to be fair, a couple months later, Apple did drop the price to $400, as well as discontinuing the
skimpy little 4 gigabyte model, but still, this was an
incredibly expensive phone back in the day. All this makes a lot more sense, though, when you look at it compared to other smartphones of the time. So the iPhone looks pretty
clean, and to be honest, not that different from phones today. It's very sleek, it's very minimal. Whereas something like the Sidekick, which is a popular smartphone of the day, looks a lot more busy. It's easy to forget just how big of deal phones like the Sidekick
were back in the day. Oh yeah, it actually did have the super cool sliding mechanism, almost like a modern-day fidget spinner. Nicely timed Ken. But, when you look at it, it's such a different design, it really does feel a lot
older than the iPhone. Another major competitor
was the Nokia N95. Now while this does definitely look like it's straight out of 2007, there are actually a
lot of cool things that this could do the iPhone couldn't. One of the main ones
was actually the camera. Now the iPhone did have a camera, but this actually has a pretty solid 5 megapixel auto-focus camera. It also has a little shutter
thing, which is kinda cool. It also had a front-facing camera, which the iPhone didn't
get until the iPhone 4, it supported 3G, and to top it all off, it had not only T9 when you slide it up, when you slide it down, you
actually had media controls. Selfie time! (shutter click) Alright, that's a little crunchy,
but gotta focus here, and (shutter click) That actually doesn't look bad. Honestly, this is probably
a little bit better than some budget smartphones
I've tried recently. Move over to the iPhone and
not only do we get the awesome, old-school slide to unlock, but there is a slightly less impressive 2 megapixel camera here. Wow, it's not that bad, but iPhones have
definitely come a long way as far as cameras go. What really set the iPhone
apart though, was its software. The hardware itself was
fairly underpowered, but what they were able to
really nail was iPhone OS. There was a lot missing when
this first launched though. Not only was there no multitasking, but it didn't even have an App
Store until the second year. But, what really saved
it were the fundamentals were absolutely there. Stuff like scrolling felt way more natural than pretty much any
other phone on the market, and its definitely
multi-touch was really cool. Keep in mind, back in the day, most phones didn't even have touchscreens, and the ones that did
typically used a stylus. The iPhone and iPhone OS was a huge leap. (box lands) But, that's not all. Inside this slightly
suspicious-looking black box is a prototype for the original iPhone. Now the hardware itself
is basically unchanged compared to current iPhones
that actually ended up shipping, but what is different about this is the actual software experience. There was a ton of secrecy
around the original iPhone, so much so that they created
a super basic UI so that if something did leak, no one would really know
what they were up to. It was also helpful for testing, as you can see, we have all
kinds of different options. But what's cool is that it has the little SkankPhone Easter egg on the bottom. All the basic functions
of the phone are here. So not only could you
get and receive SMSes, but there's also a bunch of
pre-programmed test messages, which sadly don't work since
this isn't on a network. There's also the phone dialer, you can get to the camera,
which in theory will work, although it might not the
prettiest thing in the world. But this really was meant for testing. There's also a full diagnostic menu, which can show everything from the WiFi, the Bluetooth, the accelerometer. See if the touch screen is working. You can see the camera, buttons. There's a lot of very
interesting stuff with this. Yes, it's a prototype and it was really meant more
for avoiding leaks than anything else, but it's a
cool piece of Apple history. After ten years, it's hard to argue with how
important this iPhone was. Pretty much any modern smartphone today owes at least something to the OG. So, what do you guys think
about the original iPhone? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. If you bought a single bitcoin a year ago you would've paid just under $1000 for it. However, if you wanna sell that same bitcoin today it is worth over $17,000. Which really begs the question, what exactly is a bitcoin? The idea is that this
is a virtual currency that isn't backed by anything physical. It's important to know
that this isn't a stock. It is a currency. Now mind you, it's a little bit different
than something like a U.S. dollar, or a euro, or the yen, which are all backed
by specific countries. But the same idea still applies here. And the maintenance reason why bitcoin is skyrocketing in value is because everyone wants to get their hands on them. So how does this all actually work? Well, unlike something like cash, which is printed by a government and I can hold it in my hand, bitcoin relies on something called "the blockchain". A simple way to understand this is to imagine a ledger. Every time anyone buys or sells anything related to bitcoin is
recorded in this ledger called "the blockchain" and then it is copied hundreds of thousands of times every single hour across
multiple computers to make sure that everyone is on the exact same page. What makes this interesting
is the idea that because it is copied across all these different computers and
because it all is public, before I say, wanna go buy a bitcoin from Ken or before he tries to sell me a pizza for a whole bitcoin because he's greedy and wants to sell me a $17,000 pizza. I can actually see exactly
how many bitcoin are in his specific wallet and vice versa. It is all totally public. So say I wanna buy that
incredibly expensive and yet hopefully delicious pizza from Ken for a single bitcoin. Well, it works out from his end because he can look in my wallet and say, "Hey look, I have one bitcoin there." I transfer it over to him, he receives it into his wallet, it's all recorded in the blockchain and everything is totally fine. However, what happens when I decide to cheat the system and pretend that I have 50 bitcoin in my wallet
when I really don't have any at all? Well, the blockchain actually does a really good job of
protecting against this. Because that ledger and that list of transactions is copied
across so many computers, it's updated multiple times per hour. The idea that I can just say, hey I have 50 bitcoin
and try to tell Ken that, he can check, and unless I can access
all of the thousands of computers every few minutes and change those numbers, which is not remotely practical, Ken is still going to be able to know that instead of my 50 bitcoins I have 0.001 bitcoin. Because that blockchain
has to be double and triple and quadruple checked by computers all around the world you can actually set your own computer
up to help mine bitcoin. Essentially, every single time that you help process a transaction and make sure that it's legit you mine what is a very, very tiny amount of bitcoin. If you were lucky enough to mine bitcoin in the early days and
held on to what you mined, you'd become a very,
very rich person today. However, in 2017, if you wanna set up a
bitcoin mining system it really doesn't make a lot of sense. Bitcoin mining used to work best on PC graphics cards, which were originally meant for gaming, can actually do this kind
of stuff fairly well. However, nowadays ASICs have completely destroyed that market. And ASIC is essentially a small computer that its sole purpose in
life is to mine bitcoin. And when it does it does it a lot faster than your actual computer which makes it totally obsolete. If you're interested, I did an entire video on crypto mining a few months back. Now even though it's not profitable to mine bitcoin anymore
there are other types of crypto currencies that you can actually some money on if you
have a pretty decent PC and then trade those into bitcoin. So if you guys want
more information on that you can check it out right here. By far, the easiest way of getting your hands on bitcoin
is to simply buy them. But this is where I have
to be very, very clear, this is not a normal investment. Not only does it just go up and down, but it goes wildly up and wildly down. So if you do decide to
put money into bitcoin, please keep in mind this is a super risky investment. And that, honestly, it could all disappear at any minute. Hopefully it won't but just be careful. Prices really are wildly variable on bitcoin right now. So last week a single bitcoin was worth about $10,000 but this week it's worth about 17,000 and next week it could be worth 25,000 or it could be worth $2,000. There's really know way of knowing. If all that hasn't scared you off, then it actually isn't that difficult to get your hands on some bitcoin. So the first thing
you're going to need is a wallet to actually store them in. There are a lot of different ways of getting yourself a wallet. So on the very secure side you can get a hardware wallet that is going to be fully off line. But for most people the easiest way is to create an account in an exchange such as Coinbase. The advantage with Coinbase is, is not only do they give you a wallet to store it in but you can also purchase bitcoin from them as well as some other crypto currencies such as Litecoin and Ethereum, which is the other two
major ones right now. Alright, so after this
long and arduous journey we finally have our bitcoin. However, what can we actually do with it? So some stores will actually allow you to buy things with bitcoin. However, the vast majority of people are using it as more of an investment. So you can buy some here, hope that the price goes up and then turn around and sell it later. However, it's not all just digital. So there are some bitcoin ATMs that you can go to in the real world, put your wallet information in and withdraw or deposit into them. I don't know if I would
really use these myself, but it's a cool idea. Crypto currencies like
bitcoin are a really interesting piece of tech to me, and the idea that they
could be actual currency is super fascinating. However, how could it all go wrong? The big one is absolutely price. Well yes, bitcoin has skyrocketed in value this year. There is no guarantee that is going to continue in the future. And if you're not okay
with a really, really risky thing like that, then bitcoin is probably not for you. Even though the blockchain is secure, there's nothing stopping
someone from being able to steal your own personal bitcoin using your wallet. So just like if someone grabs your real world wallet and
pulls the cash out of it, if someone has access
to your bitcoin wallet they can absolutely pull
your bitcoin out of it. And this actually happened
to me a few weeks ago. So I used to use this
service called "nicehash" to be able to mine some
crypto currencies and then turn those into bitcoin, and as I was in the middle of mining they were hacked and all of the bitcoin were stolen. Mine included. So, like anything, if you have your entire life savings under your bed, probably a bad idea. And if you keep all of
your bitcoin in one place, an equally bad idea. Hopefully you guys found
this video useful and maybe learned a thing or two. If you wanna know more about the mining side of crypto currencies
you can check out my video over here. And I'm curious, what do you guys think about bitcoin? To me it's really exciting. But let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey, guys, this is Austin,
and this is the Xbox One X. So, Microsoft just unveiled it here at E3 and we get a super-secret hands-on, even though sadly it's
not actually plugged in. So, one of the first
things that you'll realize with the Xbox One X is that it is tiny. So, even though this is
significantly more powerful than the Xbox One, the Xbox One S, even something like the PS4 Pro, it's still a really small console. So, even though it looks fairly
similar to the Xbox One S, pretty much everything
inside has been changed. Inside the Xbox One X
is the Scorpio engine. So, this is an evolution of what was in the original Xbox One. So, not only does it have
the same eight CPU cores, which have been improved
and are clocked higher, more importantly it has
a much more powerful GPU. Honestly this is one of
the biggest improvements on the X, so it's going from 1.3 teraflops of computing power to six teraflops. Not only is that more than something like the PS4 and the PS4 Pro,
but I think more importantly it is a huge upgrade over the Xbox One. Games that were playing at
720p, 900p, or even 1080p, should easily be able to
be handled at 4K here. The X is also rocking 12
gigabytes of GDDR5 memory, which is a big step up over the
8GB of DDR3 on the Xbox One. What's cool is you're
really not giving up a lot by with going up with
the X, besides price, which we'll get into in a minute. So, the size, like I said,
is roughly the same as the S. It's very slightly smaller,
but more importantly, it is much smaller than
the PS4 Pro, and also pretty much has all of
the same ports, the I/O, the Blu-ray drive, and what's
cool is if you actually look at the back of the Xbox One
X, everything is pretty much the exact same orientation
as the One S, so in theory if you want to upgrade,
you can just unplug, replug it in, everything's the same, and that even includes the power cable, which is still the tiny
figure eight power cable. So, all of this noise right now is because we're actually shooting
in the skybox right above where we actually watched the E3 demo, and in about 30 minutes, they've
torn down the entire stage. It's like gone. I really do like this matte
black finish in person. So, even though I think the
Xbox One S looks really cool in white, just having a
little bit of sheen on the top, and we still have the vents
on the side, it looks nice. Speaking of the vents,
they actually have done some really cool stuff
to get so much power in such a small space here. So, it pulls air in here from the sides and runs it through a
vapor cooling chamber. That's actually really
cool, and it makes sense how they're able to get so much power in such a small console. So, that's kind of what you would find on stuff like a GTX 1080, or something. So, essentially, it pools
the air in from the side, cools it and then sticks it out the back through the vents right here,
which has the added benefit of you can actually stack
stuff on top of the X without it overheating and
exploding in your face. Speaking of the size,
even though it's around the same footprint of an Xbox One S, this guy pulls a lot more power, as you would expect from a
much more powerful console. But, what's cool is you
actually really don't notice that from the outside,
and Microsoft claims that it shouldn't be any
louder than something like an Xbox One as is. Of course, all that power
doesn't mean much without games to actually play, and
there were a fair few that were announced today at E3. So, the big one that I was
excited about is Forza 7. To be honest, I'm a huge Forza fan. I love racing games,
and I feel like Horizon, especially the Motorsports
series is awesome, so that looks really
cool and the best part is it runs at full 4K at 60
frames per second on the One X. So, Metro Exodus I think is probably one of the top ones that I'm excited to try. I was a big fan of Last Light and this looks like a great sequel. There's also Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War, which again is another sequel to a game I'm really excited to try. It did look really nice
looking on the Xbox One X. There are also some cool surprises, such as PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is coming to the Xbox
One, Minecraft is getting a super duper texture pack to support 4K, and there are other
cool things like Cuphead finally getting a release date. It's not just new titles
that will see a benefit. So, things like better texture sampling, as well as a faster hard drive should make all Xbox One games run better on the X, and there's also the fact that it's just a more powerful console. So, say an Xbox One game
had a low frame-rate or had dynamic resolution scaling, all that should be pretty much cranked all the way up when
you're playing on the X. About 30 games, including
the Forza Horizon 3 and The Witcher 3 are going to see updates to support 4K running on the One X, and that's the cool thing. We're talking about true 4K here. So, the PS4 Pro is undoubtedly
a very powerful console but very, very few games run at proper 4K. These rely on upscaling, or cool features such as checkerboarding, which get you close to
4K, but with the One X, you have that additional
power to make sure that supposedly, all games will run in true 4K. The big elephant in the
room, though, is price. So, the Xbox One X is going
to be coming in at $499 and it'll be on sale on November 7th. That is a lot for a console. So, when you look at
the original Xbox One S, right, it's not original,
but the standard version of the Xbox One, that's
going to run you $250. Even if you jump up to
something like the PS4 Pro, that's $400, which means
that you're definitely paying a big premium for the One X. Don't get me wrong, the One X is an impressive piece of hardware. Getting proper 4K gaming
for $500 is no small task. Building an equivalent
PC is probably going to be pretty difficult, which brings me to my next slight criticism of the One X. I wish it ran Windows. It wouldn't have been totally crazy. The Xbox One actually
does run on Windows 10, just with a different UI
on top, but I understand that that Microsoft
likes to sell Xbox games and not games inside Steam,
but I just can't help but imagine if the One X was a $500 absolutely killer little gaming PC. As is, it is just a very,
very powerful Xbox One. The Xbox One X is an incredibly impressive piece of hardware. If it was $400, I think it
would be totally killer, but as is, it might be a
little bit of a tough sell, especially with the PS4 Pro around. So, what do you guys
think about the One X? Let me know in the comments below, and I'll catch you on the next one. 
- This video is sponsored by LG. Hey guys, this is Austin. Today we're building a home theater setup. Essentially we'll have two
recliners against this wall and soundbar and projector. I think it should look pretty nice. If I can figure out how
to plug my chair in. Oh, uh oh. (laughing) You guys look so ridiculous right now. - Ken is extremely comfortable. - You guys can built the rest, right? - Oh, so is this a projector
that's not wall mounted? - So this is the projector. It's actually an ultra short throw. Instead of putting in on the
wall or something behind us, what we're going to do is going to put it on a table down here and
this is going to shoot up at our projector screen. - Yeah, so we just got the
TV stand out of the box. So this is what the finish will look like. - No, I don't think it
goes on top like that. - Wait, wait, hold on.
- These are screw holes. - You know what, I think that's actually going to look pretty good. - Yeah, not bad. - Have you actually measured this? The projector's going to be little more wider than this, or the screen. So this is our LG ProBeam Projector. Dude, this is totally
going to fit on this. You actually did a really
good job picking it out. That's so tiny. What's so cool about this is
that it's a laser projector. Not like a normal
projector where you'll have to change the bulbs every
thousand hours or so. This guy's going to last
you 20 thousand hours. So what I think we should
do is let's just set up here and display it on the wall. Just to figure out roughly what size. Especially I want to know how far we have to have it away from the wall. (laughing) Wow, it's not even that dark in here and we can totally see it that clearly. Look how bright that is! - Yeah, and it's gray
wall so it's not even-- - Ah man, once we get
the projector screen up. So Ken in his infinite wisdom decided to not just get us projector screen, get the most complicated
and crazy over the top one that Amazon sells, because reasons. It's going to look nice, if we actually get it together correctly. Are you sure the projector
can do 120 inches? Hi, my name's Ken Bolido
and I'm gonna do the math. - Square equals...120. - Is it actually 120?
- It's actually 120. (laughing) - No big deal, minor worry
there, but we're totally fine. Ken did the math,
#kendidthemath. After a lot of hard work, we have our projector screen put together. Now we have to move it back into the room because it was too big to fit in there when we were trying to put it together. Can this fit through the door? - Not like this, we're gonna-- - Wait, so pull the bottom out. So you roll it so that we
can get that side down? It covers the chip and
scratch, so we're good. This is our 120 inch projector set up. It took pretty much all day,
but I'm pretty happy with it. So, the projector itself is a
little hard to see right now because we have our giant video light, blasting light in the room but I think this actually looks really nice. It does start with the ProBeam itself. What's nice about this is an
an ultra short throw projector, it really simplifies our cable management. So, this is all connected to
an Xbox One X and a soundbar. Normally we'd have to run an HDMI cable from this all the way up to the ceiling or to the wall behind. Instead, because it is so
close, everything can stay here and you get the added
benefit of I'm not going to accidentally walk in
front of the projector and block the screen. Like if I did something like this. So we are maxing this guy out right now. It can handle up to a
120 inch screen and well, that's exactly what we're using. So what this means is you
have to be very specific on where you actually place the projector. If you move it closer, it's actually going to shrink the image. So that's why we have to keep it pretty much exactly right here. We made a slight mistake
in actually mounting the projector screen. If we would have lowered it a little bit, we could probably have tucked
this setup in by a few inches. Considering it took us like
two hours to put that together, I think I can live with it. So even in a full 120 inches, we're still getting a 1080p image. If you look up close, you can actually see the individual pixels. Once you sit down and kind of lean back, it's really hard to see. Of course, we have nothing but the finest in lean-back technology. When it comes to projector set up, the real advantage is in size. With the 120 inches to work with, that's pretty much bigger
than any TV you can get. When that really comes
in handy, is for video. Whether watching a movie or YouTube, it's an immersive experience. Especially with the set up
the way we have got here with the recliner and the
good audio and everything. It is so nice to just sit back and enjoy whatever you want on this thing. Something like this is usable
for more than just movies. You can game on a 120 inch screen. So yes, is it kind of overkill? Absolutely. Do I care? Nope. Since this set up is
powered by the Xbox One X, we're getting that 4K image
super sampled down to 1080 and it looks so, so good. Now I do think that it's maybe
not the most practical thing to play on such a giant display, but it's going to be hard
to go back to a small TV. Every TV is gonna seem small (laughing). No matter how good the screen is, you have to have good audio
to tie it all together. That is where the LG
SJ9 soundbar comes in. We actually did a video
on this a few months ago. This is the set up that's
working in the office right now. I liked it so much that I bought
another one for the house. Of course, nothing can replace
a full surround sound setup. But I've been really
impressed with the sound that you can get out of the SJ9. Not only does it have the top
firing Dolby Atmos speakers, but you also have a
pretty big dedicated sub. So the rest of the setup is
pretty much the Xbox One X as well as a bunch of bits and pieces of. I got some Playstations. We've got the original NES Toploader. Some games, most of this
is really for decoration. But we do have a Hue strip
that's running underneath. Mostly it just looks
cool and Ken went crazy with all my video game stuff. So on this side of the
room we have the recliners, which are actually really nice
because the screen is so big, you kind of have to lay back to see it. There's also an other Hue light over here. Right now I'm controlling
it from my Pixel, but I'm actually probably going to get a Google Home for this side. I also have Google Wifi tucked underneath. Up top here is the only
actual decoration in the room, a signed Game of Thrones
poster from George R.R. Martin. Yes, the room is a little bit bare, there's not a ton of
stuff in here right now. For one day, I'm really impressed with what we were able to put together. I actually have an extra
LG ProBeam Projector to give away to you guys. Be sure to check out the
link in the description to head over to Facebook
for all the details. I will do my best to find
links to all the stuff in the description, including of course the ProBeam Projector
because LG was awesome enough to sponsor this whole set up. I'm curious, what do you guys think about the actual set up itself? I think there's definitely
a lot more work to do, but I'm pretty happy
with how it's come out. Of course, let me know what you
think in the comments below. Anyway guys, thank you
so much for watching and I'm going to go watch this now. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. My voice might be gone, but
what isn't is the MacBook Air. Why does it still exist in 2017? Surprisingly Apple released
a new version of the MacBook Air this week. It's a pretty minor upgrade,
but for a computer that's essentially been around
unchanged since 2010, that's not bad. What's interesting about
the Air is that this is actually still one of the most popular Macs that Apple sells. So while they have updated
most of their other more modern Macs, I think a lot
of people look at the Air and say, yeah, that's all I need. Inside we get the Air itself. Now to be fair, this design
really has not changed since 2010, but it's still
a nice looking laptop. So it's all metal and it's
maybe not quite as nice as something like some
of the newer MacBooks, but this is not an old, terrible
piece of hardware at all. One nice thing that
hasn't changed is MagSafe. So while there are a lot
of advantages to going with USB-C and Thunderbolt,
there's something really nice about having a magnetic
cable that, if you say, trip and fall over your cable, And yes, I'm looking at you, Ken. (crashing) Open up the Air and you should see that it looks very familiar. Now that's not a huge downside. So the keyboard, the track pad, and especially the build
quality does feel good. And especially in 2010,
this was pretty solid. But when you're buying a
laptop that literally came out today and it looks
exactly the same as something that came out seven years
ago, you've got a problem. The first thing that
jumps out to me when using this Air, is how bad the screen is. So while some things from
2010 holdup pretty well, that TN panel definitely does not. So it has a 13.3-inch display with a 1,440 by 900 resolution. Low, but not the end of the world. However, the color, and
especially with the viewing angles here, are terrible. I mean, look at this. You can barely see it. I get it straight you can
kind of see it a little bit. But it's so bad. For a thousand dollar laptop,
this should be a deal breaker. So to put things in perspective,
this is the LG Gram. And I'm gonna be doing
a video on this soon, but this is also a thousand dollar laptop. And when you go look at the screen on this compared to the MacBook
Air, it's not even close. Now if Apple wants to keep selling the MacBook Air in 2017,
by all means go ahead. There are legitimate
advantages to having a MacBook like this still around. But the fact that they
have not updated the screen in this many years and it
looks this bad, is crazy. If this screen was on a $200 laptop I would complain about it. On a thousand dollar laptop? No. To be fair, it's not all
bad with the MacBook Air. So this is the new 12-inch MacBook. Now this is kind of the
successor to the Air and it is a very small and thin laptop. And when you put it
side-by-side with the Air, you'll see that it is a
much, much smaller laptop. It's definitely not perfect though. So this is a USB-C port. While that's a nice thing
to have on a laptop, it is the only port on
the 12-inch MacBook. Now that can cause some
big problems when it comes to using one single port to
not only charge the computer but connect to an external monitor, connect to USB accessories,
it all has to happen through this single port. Whereas on the 13-inch
Air, that is not a problem. This guy has a mini DisplayPort that also doubles as Thunderbolt 2, a full
size USB 3, SD card reader, and on the flip side, you
have one more USB 3 port, as well as the MagSafe power adapter. So while the MacBook Air
is not the perfect laptop it definitely is not dongle life ready. The Air has seen an update
for 2017, but the upgrade is incredibly minor. So it's gone from a 1.6 to a 1.8 gigahertz Core i5 processor, but it still
has the same eight gigabytes of memory and 128 gigs of SSD storage. What hasn't changed is the
actual processors inside. So the Air's still rocking
a 5th Gen Core processor, whereas pretty much all of
the MacBooks and most Windows laptops these days are on the 7th Gen. It really feels like an upgrade
just to say, hey look guys, we can put the 2017 badge on it now. Take a look at performance and the Air has definitely fallen behind. So not only is it slower
than the 12-inch MacBook, which has a much lower
power Core m3 processor. It's also much slower
than the LG Gram, which is about the same price, but
has a much newer Core i5. To be fair, performance
is not the be all, end all for the MacBook Air. One of the other big advantages
here is battery life. So with the way the
13-inch is specced with it's fairly large battery, you
should expect around 14 hours on a charge, which is really solid. The only issue is other
laptops, such as the Gram, have absolutely caught up to that number. One area where the Air
definitely does hold up is with the keyboard and trackpad. So the keyboard itself actually
still feels pretty decent. I slightly prefer what you
get on the newer MacBooks. But I do think a lot of
people like the extra key travel. And the trackpad is good. So again, it's not quite
as new and quite as nice as some of the newer
Force Touch trackpads, but I still feel like
this is a better trackpad than pretty much any
Windows laptop you can buy. When it comes to actually using the Air, it does feel reasonably snappy. So yes, if you look at it
compared to something else on a benchmark, it's
not going to be as fast. For more basic usage like
web browsing, which honestly is probably what everyone
does on MacBook Airs anyway, it does feel pretty good. The screen definitely does
let it down, but besides that it's a pretty solid machine. The value proposition with the MacBook Air is a little bit weird. So on one hand it's $300
cheaper than any other MacBook that you could pick up. On the other, it hasn't
really been thoroughly updated in quite a few years. It also only comes with a 128 gigabyte SSD in the base configuration. Now if this is just your Facebook machine, then sure, that can work out. But other than that, once
you start upgrading it it just doesn't make any sense. The MacBook Air was a
really impressive laptop when it came out in 2010. However, if you're buying
a new laptop in 2017, it just doesn't make sense. So what do you guys think
about the MacBook Air? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. A few years ago, I compared the Xbox 360 to the then new iPhone 6 and the results were surprisingly close. But with the iPhone 8 coming out today, how does it stack up to a
modern console like the PS4? First, let's take a look at
what's inside the iPhone 8 as well as the iPhone X. The Apple A11 Bionic chip. The A series of SoC's have kind of been on top of the game for awhile now and the A11 is no exception. So compared to the iPhone 7, which only had a pair of
high performance cores that were available for games,
the iPhone 8 as well as X both have not only upgraded
high performance cores. But you also have four low power cores that can all be used together. Essentially what this means,
is that when you're gaming, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone
X have a six core processor. That's not the entire story though. The A11 is rocking a brand
new Apple designed GPU. Now this is a first. Previous iPhones, going all
the way back to the original, used some sort of Imagination design. Whereas here, they designed
their own triple core GPU. All this is built on TSMC's
latest 10 nanometer process. Which means that the A11
has a fairly impressive 4.3 billion transistors. Now compare this to the PS4, which has a design that was
originally launched in 2013. So this is using a custom AMD based APU, which not only has eight CPU cores, but also a fairly sizeable GPU. On the processor side
the PS4 and the Xbox One have very similar designs. So essentially, while
you do have eight cores, they're pretty weak. So based on AMD's Jaguar tech, they're going to be fine for normal use sort of on their own. But when you combine eight
of them on a single console, it gives you pretty good performance. The PS4 also has a still
impressive Radeon GPU which is backed up by eight
gigabytes of fast GDDR5 memory. So back of the envelope math shows, that the iPhone's CPU is
significantly quicker than the PS4. Somewhere in the neighborhood
of about 40% faster. However, when you take a look at graphics, it is a very different story. The iPhone only has about 20% of the graphics power of the PS4. That is a huge difference. Now the iPhone is outputting
to a much smaller display. Which does give it a
little bit of leeway as far as the graphics power, but you do have to keep
in mind that all this is inside a seven
millimeter thick chassis. So with only about five watts of TDP, it has to dissipate all of that through the metal and glass design. Compare that to the PS4,
which has about 90 watts to work with, and it has
a heat sync, fan, vents. A lot of stuff that essentially means that the laws of physics
are in the PS4's favor. Of course on paper specs are one thing but let see how actual games compare. First off, we have The Witness. A PS4 game that was
recently ported to iOS. Take a look to see the differences
between the two systems. What you should notice
is that it is essentially the full experience on both devices. The iPhone version is running at a noticeably lower resolution which shouldn't be a huge surprise considering it's on a phone screen. And well yes, the graphics settings are not to the same level of the PS4. But the content is
absolutely there and honestly it doesn't look hugely different. Now I did notice a couple
of rendering issues on the iPhone 8, but honestly, once it gets an actual
patch to support the 8, hopefully these will be eliminated. Next we have Transistor which is another game that
will run cross platform. Here again the iPhone
resolution is a bit lower and the graphics have
been bumped down a notch, but it's still totally
playable and honestly not a huge difference
between the PS4 version. Now especially when you
do pair it with a gamepad it really is a very similar
gameplay experience. Now Minecraft runs on
basically everything on Earth, but how do the PS4 and
iPhone versions stack up? This is one of the better
comparisons for the iPhone. Not only is the resolution a lot closer to what you're getting with the PS4 but the graphics settings are similar and especially once you
pair it with a controller it feels very similar. Especially with that locked
60 frames per second. Continuing on the Minecraft train, we have Minecraft Story Mode. A classic Telltale game that of course is going to be running on both the iPhone as well as the PS4. You can notice some differences here so not only are the
settings going to be lower but also is definitely not running at that full 1080p of the PS4. But, yet again, it is completely
playable on both systems. Although with this one, I
would definitely take the PS4 if I had the option. To really see what both systems can do, let's take a look at some exclusive games that just simply take better
advantage of the hardware. So on the PS4 Horizon:
Zero Dawn is a huge leap over anything that's
available on the iPhone. The level of detail, the actual graphics, and of course the gameplay is
seriously worth that $60. On the other hand, there are certain games that simply are better
suited to the iPhone. Stuff like Monument Valley
not only looks great, but also takes great advantage
of the touch controls and games like Oz: Broken Kingdom do a really good job
of leveraging the power of that A11 chip. Like I mentioned earlier,
one of the downsides to having this much power
in such a small device, is always going to be heat. You don't have those fans and vents to be able to pull it away. As you have to fully rely
on the glass, metal build to dissipate all the heat from the device. Now I'll have to do
some more throw testing but at least based on first impressions the iPhone 8 does pretty well here. So under an extended
30 minute gaming load, the back of the device actually
doesn't even get that warm. So is the iPhone 8 as powerful as the PS4? No. To be fair, it is catching
up surprisingly quickly. And for some games the
experience isn't far off but the law of physics means that for this time the
dedicated game console is going to win out. So what do you guys think of
the power of the iPhone 8? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Today, I'm here at CES 2018 with what is the world's thinnest laptop. This is the Acer Swift 7. Now, if you remember,
I actually did a video about a year ago on the
previous version of this laptop, which was at the time the
world's thinnest laptop. However, 10 millimeters. (laughing) No one wants to use a laptop that's anywhere near that thick, so this guy brings it all the
way down to nine millimeters. To put things in context, all you need to do is look at the ports. So, the thickness of the USB-C port is pretty much the
thickness of the laptop. And of course, with a
laptop this thin and light, you do have to have some trade-offs, and the ports are actually
where that begins. So, on here, we're really just
getting a pair of USB-C ports in addition to that headphone jack. However, because you have something that's so thin and light, I'm willing to make some sacrifices. Even though it is very thin, they actually didn't really sacrifice on the flexibility of the chassis. So, if I really try to
twist it in my hands here, it really doesn't do
anything, which is nice. The last thing I want is my
laptop to snap in half in my bag because it was just a little bit too thin. Now, as you would expect, the Swift 7 is hardly the
fastest laptop in the world, but it still does have a 7th
Generation Core i7 processor paired with eight gigabytes of RAM, as well as a 256-gig SSD. Now, because it is so thin, it is going to be the Y-Series processor, which does mean it can be fanless. However, this is actually the
only config of the laptop. There's no additional RAM, SSD
options, anything like that. What you get is what
you get with this guy. For the display, it has an
actually surprisingly large 14-inch panel with a 1080p resolution. And while the screen itself
based on first impressions looks pretty decent, what's impressive is
that it is a touchscreen, and that really shouldn't be impressive because it's 2018 and all laptops should have touchscreens,
but there you go. As you would expect, there
are some quirks here. So, something I immediately noticed is that the backspace key is shared with the delete key up top, which is a little bit hard to get used to. And you also share the Caps
Lock with the tilde key. But for the most part, the keyboard actually feels pretty good. Even though there isn't a ton of travel, it's actually pretty easy to get used to. The trackpad is also interesting. So, on the surface, it
actually is not bad. So, you've Windows Precision drivers and the actually tracking seems fine. The problem is is that
there's actually no click, so when you actually go to do
it, you have to just tap it, which I actually don't
mind on a lotta track pads, but it is a little bit weird to have essentially no sensation when you actually go for
a full click on this guy. One thing that does
legitimately separate this from a lot of other laptops right now is that it has a built-in LTE connection. So, the model I have here
doesn't have it working just yet, but the idea is that you
will have a nano SIM slot on the side of the computer
where you just put a SIM card in and switch between networks
fairly easily, which, especially for something that's
this thin and this portable, does make a lotta sense. We also have a 720p webcam onboard. So, you guys can judge
the quality for yourself, but one thing is, as with a lotta these
ultra-portable laptops, the webcam placement being on
the bottom is less than ideal, unless of course you wanna get
some wonderful nose selfies. Do people take selfies on laptops? So, while it might look
like an ordinary laptop, this is actually being powered by the-- All right. So, because it is such a thin laptop, the speakers are hugely loud,
but it does sound decent. I'm actually not totally sure where they're coming out though. Oh, it looks like on the bottom here. One thing you're really
not giving up though is battery life. So, the Swift 7 should last for around 10 hours or so on a charge. And on top of that, it does also support a fingerprint
sensor for Windows Hello. The Acer Swift 7 will be available
in late-March for $1,700. So, yes, it is absolutely pricey. But considering just how thin
and how nice the hardware is, for some people, if you really
want the best in portability, it's not bad. But of course, what do you
guys think about the Swift 7? It's definitely not
going to be for everyone. Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is a $120 laptop and I'm going to find
out if it's any good. I recently did a video
on back-to-school laptops and while there are some
pretty solid cheap options, some of you guys wanted
to see me go even farther, which is where the RCA Cambio comes in. At $120, this is the cheapest, brand new laptop tablet
thing I could find. Taking a look at the box, it
actually doesn't look too bad. We have an 11.6-inch screen, 2GB of memory, as
we all 32GB of storage and it does come
preloaded with Windows 10. I like on the box that shows
it has four different modes, laptop mode, display mode, tablet mode, and presentation mode, but it's a two-in-one, not a four-in-one. Cardboard quality. Aw man, this is gonna be a fun video. I have a good feeling about this one. Well actually, you know what? It's reasonably heavy. It's actually not too bad. This might be the cheapest
plastic I have ever seen. It has somewhat large bezels, but it actually is for a good reason. Because of that, they are able to fit what looks to be a full-sized keyboard, although the trackpad is
maybe just a little bit small. For ports, this guy has a mini-HDMI, a micro-USB port, headphone jack, power button, a full-size USB, as well as a tiny Windows key. Even though the plastic and the build is definitely cheap on this guy, it actually doesn't feel
too bad in the hand. The weight's about right,
it's nicely balanced, and there's not even a lot of flex. I mean, sure I wouldn't
wanna pay $300 for it but if you can get past the
actual build, it's not bad. This guy actually doesn't have
the worst specs in the world. It's powered by a quad-core
Intel Atom Processor, 2GB of memory,
32GB of storage, and have an 11.6-inch
display like this unit, where most of the Cambios I've
seen have a 10.1-inch screen. So what exactly can you
do with a $120 laptop? Well normally, I would try to do a few standard things
I do with all laptops. However, Mr. Jimmy Champane has some other thoughts in mind. You have a list of demands. - [Jimmy] Yeah, but they're not from me. - "They're not from me," okay. - They're from the gods. - Challenges from the gods, edit a photo. Select to focus, yeah. Let's just focus on Ken's back. So yes, it can edit photos. Challenges from the gods,
play one game of CS:GO. This is a revolutionary gaming experience. I feel like after everyone plays CS:GO with this for the first time, they'll never be able to go back. [Ken]: Are you shooting with the "up" button? Challenges from the gods,
play Minecraft Pocket Edition. All right, so I can actually
say that with Minecraft, this is actually kind of playable. I mean, yes, I have to turn
the graphic settings down and lower the chunks, but
it's actually not that bad. Of course the biggest
problem is this trackpad has no left and right
click dedicated options, so I just have to tap to click, which is not great. Challenges from the
gods, watch one HD video. Wow, not only does this work, we can actually play 1440p YouTube. Okay, all right, I mean,
it's a 720p screen, so. Challenges from the gods, draw with the touchscreen in MS Paint. That's pretty impressive. This is Ken, in case you guys are curious, but Ken is super cool and he
wears his hat slightly sideways and then he's got a big frown 'cause Ken is never happy 'cause he doesn't believe in me. There we go. Successfully painted with MS Paint a very true to life
picture of Mr. Ken Bolido. Many, many tests, long arduous tests end. Are the gods pleased? Your head is out of the frame right now. So many tests later, are the gods pleased with the power and
performance of the RCA Cambio? - Actually, you got all but one. It was CS:GO that we couldn't do, right? - Yeah.
- That's it. And you were able to play CS:GO. - 15 frames per second with the trackpad is exactly the way that
everyone should play CS:GO. So, should you buy the RCA $120 Windows laptop tablet thing? It actually isn't that bad. No, it's not the greatest
thing in the world and if you can afford, spend another $100, you're gonna get something
that's a lot better but it's better than I expected. So, what do you guys think about this guy? Let me know on the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin, and today I'm here at E3 2017 with a simple question:
PS4 Pro or Xbox One X? The big story here at E3 is
definitely the Xbox One X. Previously known as Project Scorpio, this is a souped-up version
of the current Xbox One. I've spent the last couple days
not only using the hardware, but also playing some games on it. However, I feel like we're in the slightly wrong place to talk a lot of Xbox stuff. - Get in here, get in here. Big Dom. Big Dom showing up to
crash yet another video. What do you think about the
Xbox One X versus PS4 Pro? - Oh, Xbox One X all the way! I mean, we're talking
about real 4K, right? Real 4K? - Get out of my video. Get out of my video, Dom. For the last four years
since the PS4 came out, it has been the most powerful
console on the market. While a lot of games on the Xbox One would run at 720p or 900p, most PS4 games would run at 1080p. However, with the Xbox One X, things have definitely been upgraded. Is someone behind me? - It's true. - It's just like the CES
video all over again. PS4 Pro versus Xbox One X? - Games versus hardware. That's it. - Excellent answer from Mr.-- UrAvgConsumer. - No, but more serious
answer, though, I don't know. That's what it comes down to, I guess. - [Austin] Way more titles, you're right. There are way more titles for
the PS4 than the Xbox One. It's a more powerful console,
but it's still an Xbox One. - I like the Xbox One honestly
'cause I'm a Kinect lover, and you're not gonna get that from-- - Wait, wait, wait. You still use a Kinect? - I still use it. Voice controls, man. I like to control my videos and whatnot through voice controls. - Alright, I can respect that. - Xbox One always has
my love because of that. - While both the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X are big jumps over the base versions, the Xbox One X is an even bigger jump. With the PS4, you're going from 1.8 to 4.2 teraflops of power. It's a big jump. But on the Xbox One X,
you're going from 1.3 to a full six teraflops
of GPU performance. Teraflop jokes aside, the Xbox One X is a huge jump over the original Xbox. On top of that GPU power, the Xbox One X also has a 50% faster
hard drive, faster CPU, and a full 12 gigabytes of memory as opposed to 8 gigabytes on the PS4 Pro. For the first time, the Xbox is now the most powerful console
of this generation. How's this going to change things? Well, for one, I do think
that this is going to bring consoles a lot closer to the PC market. Sure, a high-end gaming
PC is more powerful than either of these consoles, but what most people are using is not going to be that far off from something like the Xbox
One X or even the PS4 Pro. It's going to bring everyone
a lot closer together, and that can only be a good thing. Having the PS4 Pro and One X together actually does bring things a
lot closer to the PC model. All games that come out for PS4 are going to work on
PS4 Pro, and vice versa, and same thing for the
Xbox One and Xbox One X. It's very similar to a PC
game that's going to be the exact same game across different PCs. The difference is going to
be what quality settings you're going to be playing at, and here, almost more
importantly, what resolution. While the PS4 Pro runs a
few games at native 4K, most titles are running at
something closer to either 1440p, or something in the
middle and using upscaling to make it all the way up to 4K. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially some of the upscaling options look pretty close unless
you're really pixel-peeping. On the other hand, the
Xbox One X has the power to run most games at a full 4K resolution. Not only is this going to
be simpler for developers to just set it to 4K and forget it, even though that might be
a slight simplification, but more importantly,
it's going to give you a cleaner, crisper image across the board. While most games run pretty
well on the PS4 Pro in 4K, there are a few titles that
have some framerate issues. The Xbox One X, on the other hand, has a lot of extra raw power, so hopefully these
things can be eliminated. How do these consoles compare to a PC? In a word, pretty well, even
though that's two words. In two words, okay? Two words. Oh, look, it's a wild Kevin Kenson! Wild Kevin Kenson. - Famous YouTuber Austin Evans! - Yes, it is, okay, so... PS4 Pro or Xbox One X, go. - I did a video on this. You should go watch it. - Shameless plug, youtube.com/ralphy. - Dammit. - Put simply, it is really
hard to imagine building a gaming PC with this level
of performance for $500. Unless, you know, you cheat at
Scrapyard Wars or something. Dual power supplies were the
correct answer, by the way. Sony and Microsoft have a big
advantage in being able to order custom hardware
to build these consoles. So while, yes, the PC
will definitely catch up as far as price and
performance in a couple years just like it did when the
PS4 and Xbox first came out, right now, $4-500 dollars for this level of performance is pretty reasonable. My big takeaway here is that both the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X
have fairly similar levels of performance to a lot of gaming PCs, which can only be a good thing. All this means is that
we all get better games, and we can all live happily ever after. The PS4 Pro has a big head start, though. Not only is it going to be on the market for a full year before
the Xbox One X comes out, but more importantly than that, there are lots and lots
of great PS4 games, and to top it all off, it is $100 less. Don't get me wrong, the Xbox One X is the more powerful console, but at end of the day,
it's still an Xbox One. If that's not something
that's interesting to you, the One X isn't really
going to change that. What do you guys think about
the PS4 Pro versus Xbox One X? Let me know in the comments below, and I'll catch you on the next one. 
- Electronic yodeling pickle. Hey, guys, this is Austin. And welcome to yet another Ken Torments Me with
Terrible Products video. This time we are apparently
looking at pickles. (chuckles) Electronic yodeling pickle. Yodel-a-he-ooo, says the pickle. Should I ask how much this was? - [Ken] Eleven. - Eleven dollars. Much better than I was expecting. All right, let's see what we get with
our accoutrements pickle. This is a very detailed looking pickle. (pickle yodeling) (yodeling continues) (out of tune yodeling) The Odin Serafim, world's
first projection mouse? Ken, you do realize that
I actually had ordered one of these already, right? Not even kidding. This is actually a product
that I wanted to do a video on anyway. How much was this? - [Ken] Sixty nine dollars. - Seventy bucks. Oh, I'm sorry. (clears throat) Sixty nine dollars. I have to be very correct
on my pricing here. I've got to say, after the
last one where I was wearing a pink suit at this point in the video, much happier with my laser mouse. Oh! It totally works, look at this. So, if I swipe with it,
it is totally plausible. It's like, click, whoa. That actually kind of works. I mean it's not the greatest
tracking surface in the world, but that's a laser mouse. Well, I think, more
specifically, a laser track pad. But still, that actually is really cool. You know what, if I
actually move a little bit more quickly with this,
it's pretty responsive. I mean, it's a little
bit inaccurate, I think. But, I mean, that doesn't feel terrible. Oh, even tap-to-click works. Dude, this is like a legitimate track pad, that just happens to be a laser. Next item, please. You did not. So, for those who are not in the know, a little while ago, this
Supermario puzzle came out. And what was so special about it, is that it's basically all red. It's basically impossible
to actually put together. Puzzles are educational,
challenging and fun. Yeah. Challenging and fun when it's literally impossible to put together. Oh, boy. That's quite the bag. So, with a thousand pieces on board, you know that this is going
to be a fun time for all ages. Look at these pieces. They are all the exact same, they just have a little
bit of a texture on them. Why, why would anyone want to do this? I honestly think that
this is the extent of how much this puzzle is
going to be put together. All right, moving on. All right, I'm afraid to ask. What's next? The BlackBerry Leap? How much was this? - [Ken] Seventy five. - Seventy five dollars for a BlackBerry. OK. Not exactly what I expected. Starting BlackBerry 10 OS. OK, so it's actually a
legit, original BlackBerry. I mean, the hardware is not bad, I kind of like the sort of
rubberized finish on the back. It's got a headphone jack. Hard to argue with that. That's a rare commodity these days. Well, a pretty impressive eight megapixel auto focus camera on the back. I've got to say, those bezels
are straight out of 2015. Man, that looks very bizarre these days. So, we are now inside BlackBerry 10 OS. And I will say, this actually
has aged pretty well. I mean, sure, the app support is, well, minimal at this point. But the actual sort of interface, how smooth everything is, it actually doesn't feel too far behind. If only, you know, Android wasn't a thing. But of course, with an
eight megapixel camera, we're probably dealing
with some crispy images. Wow, that's a lot of shutter lag. Actually, you know what,
that's not that bad. Alright, the real test is
going to be the selfie though. Oh, it's a little bit colorful,
but I'll give that a pass. I'm curious, do you know how much this was when it was brand new? Two hundred seventy five dollars. Well, if you look at it like that, this is a relative
bargain at only $75 today. Of course, you're going to have to deal with BlackBerry 10 OS
which is basically dead. But, I mean, besides that. The Edifier P841 All right, it's been a
while since I've taken a look at a new pair of headphones. This actually looks like
a kind of reasonable and not stupid thing to take a look at. Well, at first glance, they're actually a little lightweight, maybe a little more
lightweight than I would like. But, of course, that's not
the only thing that matters, certain headphones will put
weights in their headphones just to make them feel more hefty. They pass the Hotel California test. Now, the sound stage
isn't exactly super wide, which isn't really a big surprise. And there is not a ton of clarity there. There is definitely a little bit more bass than I would like, but they sound decent. For $65 though, I would probably lean towards the Status CB-1s, which, if you guys have watched
my videos, you know that I have recommended many, many times. I'm excited. What do we have? Printoss? This is very Japanese. Ken, did you get this is Japan? So, the entire box is
basically in Japanese. It looks like something
that you put your phone in and then a picture comes out, maybe? I'm very confused. I'm just thinking, in my
head right now, right? At what point would I
want to scan my screen and print it versus just transfer
a photo to a printer? I'm not going to think about it. I'm just gonna see if this thing works. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This isn't a scanner. This has actual film inside, doesn't it? - [Ken] Instax - It has actual Instax film inside? Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. So, you put your phone on here. You take a picture of the
screen and it will print out on Instax film, I guess. So, it's not even a printer, its just camera that takes
pictures of your phone screen. One pack of minion-themed
Instax film later. Let's see if we can
get this thing to work. Look at this. That looks much more
realistic and reasonable. The real test is, what
am I going to print? All right, here goes nothing. (click) Is that it? Oh yeah, there we go. It's blank right now, that's fine. Just let it bake here for a second. Develop is what the cool kids call it. And hopefully, we'll see
a picture of something. You know what? That's actually not that bad. Yeah, it's Instax, so
it's not going to look quite as crystal clear as this wonderful pixel photo that I have here. One thing I will say is, even though they say
to crank your phone up to max brightness, especially if you have a newer Smartphone, it might be a little too much. I'm going to bring it down just a little bit for the next one. All right, shot number two. (cheering and booing) This is obviously a toy. It's not like some super high end printer. But I will say, it's kind of cool. Stuff like Instax is really fun anyway. And the idea that you can
print photos on your phone instead of just taking shots on a camera and hoping it works. I can see this being something that a lot of people could be into. So, as always, links to
check out all the stuff, including the Printoss
will be in the description. And I'm curious, what do you guys think about
Ken's picks on this one? I gotta say, I'm not in a bunny suit, so I'm not complaining. But anyway, let me know
what you guys think in the comments below and I
will catch you on the next one. 
- This video is sponsored by Bitdefender. Hey guys, this is Austin. It is almost 2018 and
here are five tech items to get your year started off right. To kick things off, we
have the Bitdefender Box 2. You guys have probably
heard of Bitdefender before for their antivirus
software, but with the Box, they're stepping it up to
the hardware side of things to protect your entire network. But on top of being able to
cover things like your phone as well as your laptop, it
also can help protect against your smart home devices
from being attacked. That's quite the flow chart
they've got right here. Pull this guy out of the box and it's actually surprisingly light. So there's really not a
whole lot to this guy. You essentially get power
in, you get Ethernet in, and you get Ethernet back out. So after a quick set up we
have the Box up and running. All we need is the Bitdefender Central app for iOS or Android, and from here we can control
pretty much anything. So you can see notifications if it decides there's any kind of vulnerabilities in your network. You can also make sure that
all your devices are protected, if they need attention, or if they're unprotected. While the box will protect your device when you're at home on your own wifi, the included total security software will also protect your other devices, like Mac, Windows, Android from threats when you're
staying on public wifi. Since this is hardware-level security, you can do some pretty
interesting stuff with it. So not only is it going to do it's best to filter out any kind
of suspicious activity, but on top of that, say you're on a website
that isn't secured, and you're trying to
put in your credit card, or your social security number, well Box is going to try and catch that and give you a warning saying "hey, are you sure about that?" You're also getting some protection against brute force attacks
as well as ransomware, and because it detects all
the devices on your network and gives you a full status report. Say you connect a old laptop that hasn't been updated in awhile, you're going to get a notification saying, "hey, it's time to get
an update on that guy." Windows XP is not cool anymore. So if you guys wanna check out the Bitdefender Box 2 for yourself, like always, the link will
be in the description. The next item is the Google Home. Now this isn't brand new, however, I've just gotten a whole set of Google Homes for my house, and I love them. Well there's a lot to like with Alexa, and I'm sure Siri on the
HomePod is going to be great if you have like 400 bucks, Google Home has really
hit a nice sweet spot between sounding good, as well as having the super
useful Google Assistant. The real sweet spot for me though, is the Google Home Mini. So these guys launched at 50 dollars, which is a pretty decent price for what is still a nice speaker, and gives you all the functionality. However, for the next little while, these guys are 30 dollars. And at that price, I've got
like 3 of them in my house. Now this doesn't matter at all to anyone besides me, probably, but even though the Google
Home does sound better, I kind of prefer the Mini just because this to me
looks like an air freshener. I don't know, I just don't
like the way this thing looks. Where as this, this is cool. You can just slide this on
like a desk or something, and no one would ever really look twice. There's a lot you can do with Google Home, but the main things I
do is listen to music, do like alarms, as well as listen to a little bit of like
podcasts and some news, but for 30 bucks, you should definitely consider
checking this guy out. Continuing on the Google train, we have the Chromecast Ultra. Now the Chromecast has been
one of my favorite ways to stream video for a few years now, but the Ultra is the way to do it in 4K. If you guys caught our iPhone
X is it worth it video, this is actually how we were
able to test HDR on YouTube. So what we did was, we would
upload the video to YouTube, wait for it to process
for like three hours, and then we would play
it back on a OLED TV, using the Chromecast Ultra to actually see what it would look like once it was fully processed. This guy is pretty powerful considering just how tiny it is. It's also really stuck in there. So it is a little bit bigger
than a standard Chromecast, but really not by much. It's the same basic idea where you plug it in via HDMI to your tv. There's a micro USB lead here for power. Once you set it up on wifi,
it's pretty straightforward. So you get just a bunch
of generic wallpapers in the beginning, but you can stream pretty
much anything to it from the app or from Google Home. Hey Google, play the latest 'Austin Evans' video on Youtube. That is so cool. So what's really neat about this, is not only can you
control that with voice, as well as of course from your phone, but you can also have
multiple Google Homes as well as multiple Chromecasts
set up in your house. All of these gadgets are great, however you're probably going to want an actual phone to control everything, which is where the Moto E4 Plus comes in. This is a phone I actually did a video on a couple months ago, and I think it is lowkey one of my favorite devices of the year. So what's nice is, for a phone
that costs less than $200, you're getting a metal
build, a good screen, good camera, fingerprint sensor. There's really not a lot to hate on. One area a lot of budget
phones skimp on is the screen, and thankfully the Moto
E4 Plus isn't too bad. So it is a 5.5 inch panel
with a 1280x720 resolution. Now yes, that's going to be
a little bit on the low side, but thankfully it's a good
panel with solid color. Inside, the specs might
not look impressive with a Snapdragon 427
processor, 2 gigs of ram, and either 16 or 32 gigs of storage, but what really puts this
over the top is the battery. This guy is rocking a massive
5,000mAh battery. To put that in context,
that's almost double the size of something like the iPhone X. Now yes, it does mean that the phone is a little bit chunkier
than it might otherwise be, but especially considering
the fairly low end internals, this guy is going to last forever. Well that battery is really what pushes it over the edge for me. This is hands down the best battery life I have ever tried on a smartphone. And when you consider that that's again, less than $200, you should really give the Moto E4 a shot. But say that a smartphone isn't what you're looking for this year. Well that is where the
Acer Asprire E15 comes in. I've actually wanted to do
a video on this for awhile, for one big reason. It is one of the most
highly selling laptops on Amazon period right now. You don't exactly get a
lot in the box though. So on one hand we get the laptop itself with some wonderful cardboard and some cardboard shavings. On paper, it looks pretty good. So you're getting a Core i3-7100U 4 gigabytes of RAM, as well as a 1 Terabyte hard drive. There's some nice features
that separate this from other budget laptops, starting with the display. So it is a 1080p panel, and well yes, while it may
not be the best looking 1080p screen in the world, but it is a lot of
better than other laptops in the 3 to 4 hundred dollar price range. Nice touches like having
a backlit keyboard as well as a full number pad is nice, and the port selection is interesting. On the left side we have a good selection including a pair of USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI, VGA, Ethernet,
as well as USB type C, but on the other side we
get the headphone jack, another USB 2.0, as well as the DVD drive, because you know, laptops with USB type
C ports and DVD drives are all over the place. (laughs) Remove three screws and pop
off this bottom panel though, and not only we get
access to the hard drive, which is actually kind of slow, and I would probably swap with an SSD, but also our memory. Four gigs is fine for now, but it would be really
simple to upgrade this guy to 8 gigs. Acer claims that this guy has up to 12 hours of battery life, and while the build quality does leave a little bit to be desired, at $350, there is a ton
to like with this laptop. I see why everyone keeps buying them. As always, links to
everything I talked about, including the Box 2, will be in the description of this video. So I'm curious, which of
these products would you guys want to pick up for 2018? Let
me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey, guys, this is Austin. This is the Photon 3.0, and at $500, it really is aimed at
the majority of gamers. So inside this guy, it is
using an Intel Pentium G4600. So Pentiums have typically not had a great rap as far as gaming goes, and that's typically because they've been pure dual core parts. What that means is, is that when it actually comes
to gaming, a lot of times games will actually
really require four cores or at least some Hyper-threading. In the past, you had to at
least jump up to a Core i3. However, with this
latest Kaby Lake edition, you actually do have Hyper-threading in a cheap Pentium chip. So for about $30, $40
cheaper than a Core i3. You're still getting a
3.6 gigahertz processor and for most games, that's
going to be totally fine. Alongside it, we have the EVGA
GTX 1050Ti graphics card. So as you can see in the system, it might not be the
biggest card in the world, but don't let that fool you. This definitely has plenty of power. If you caught my video on Cryptomining, you'll know that most
high-end graphics cards are nearly impossible to find in stock, and the ones that are,
are incredibly expensive. But thankfully, the 1050Ti
has been mostly unaffected. Now a big reason for that is that while it isn't quite the
best Cryptomining card, it is still great for gaming. Thanks to the four gigabytes
of memory on board, as well as the fairly
low power consumption, which means that not
only does it nicely fit in that tiny little card, but almost more importantly than that, you don't need to connect
external PCI power. It pulls everything it
needs from the motherboard. For a motherboard, we're
using the Gigabyte B250M-EVO. Now, this is a fairly basic motherboard, but it does support not
only our Pentium processor, but all the way up to a Core i7, so if you do wanna make some
upgrades, that's easy to do. And speaking of upgrades,
it also does have an M2 slot directly on the board. so on top of the SSD and
any kind of hard drives that you wanna have inside the system, you can also add a super fast M2 drive straight to the board. For memory, we have eight gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM. So eight gigabytes is going to be enough to run pretty much any game as is and of course if you do want
to upgrade to 16 gigabytes, it's as simple as grabbing one more stick and throwing it in your system. It's also going to be
DDR4, 2400 megahertz, that's pretty much all you need for now. For the SSD, we're doing something a little different this time. So this is a 250 gigabyte WD Blue SSD. So I've been using WD Blue drives in my builds for a very, very long time. This is the first time I've
used one of their SSDs. To be fair, pricing is
actually pretty solid. So for about $80 you're going
to be getting 250 gig drive, which should be enough for most people. However, if you do need more space, because it's a gaming PC, of course you can always
throw a hard drive inside. On top of that, if you are
building a computer in 2017, you really should be using an SSD. It makes such a huge
difference to how snappy and responsive pretty much loading everything on the computer is. When you go back to a hard drive, it really does feel like a huge downgrade. For the power supply, we
have a 450 watt EVGA unit. So this is another part that I've used in a lot of builds over the years and for good reason. Not only is it going
to be fairly reliable, but it's also cheap and
with power supplies, those two things don't always go together. So this guys is going to
be a 80 PLUS Bronze rated and with 450 watts of capacity, not only is it enough for the build as is, you can do some pretty serious upgrades without having to touch the supply. For the case we're using
the Rosewill Tyrfing? So weird name aside, it
actually is a pretty solid case. So it's going to be full-size ATX, so there's plenty of room inside and for about 40 dollars, we're actually getting some pretty decent value. So not only does it have
a pair of 120 millimeter fans but also does have a window to show off your super cool cable management. Now yes, build quality
could be a little bit better but for the price there's
not a lot to complain about. So the Photon 3.0 really
is aimed at 1080p gaming. First we have Rocket League. This is a game that is
not that difficult to run and as you can see here,
it's absolutely no problem for the Photon. We're getting about 140 frames
per second on high settings and that is with a frame rate cap. If we actually uncapped that,
we'd probably go even higher. Next we have Shadow of Mordor. Now yes, this is a little
bit of an older game. However, it's really well optimized and it does hold up
even on higher end rigs and on high settings at 1080p, when we're getting in the 80s to 90s, depending on how much action we have here. Completely playable. Another game that's slightly older but still looks really nice is GTA5. So again on very high settings at 1080p, it looks really nice. And frame rate wise, we're
still doing pretty solid. So we're keeping in the, generally 50 to 60 frame rate per second range. Again, super super playable. The more I use the system to game, the more I realize just how quiet it is. I mean, even right beside it, I can barely hear anything at all. Another game the Photon
3.0 can definitely handle is Overwatch. So here on Ultra settings at 1080p, we're getting really nice frame rates. So right now we're
hovering between 90 to 100 and especially with a high
refresh rate monitor like we're using right
now, it looks really nice. Plus, Overwatch is just a nice looking game on Ultra settings anyway. As always, I'll have all
the links you guys need to build the Photon 3.0 in the description and if you are curious on how
to actually build a gaming PC, I did do a full 2017
tutorial using this system. So be sure to go check that out and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. The 3DS originally came out in 2011, but in a world with the Nintendo Switch, should the 3DS still exist? So, if you want to buy a 3DS in 2017, you're going to be picking from
one of these three options. To start with, we have the Nintendo 2DS, which came out in 2013. Now, as you might be able to
imagine, this has a little bit of a different design. I remember when Nintendo
originally announced the 2DS. I totally thought it was a joke. So, in the transition from
the standard DS to the 3DS, one of the major advantages was the idea that it did support 3D. However, the 2DS, not
only does it look weird, but it doesn't support 3D at all. That doesn't really bother me though, as I very rarely use that
3D feature to begin with. So, there are a couple
of other trade-offs here. Most notably that it has a
couple of fairly small displays and the actual speaker
itself is kind of quiet. But, when you consider
that this only costs $80 and comes with a copy of Mario Kart 7, it starts to look like a pretty good deal. Take a closer look at the 2DS and it is a little bit odd looking. So, this is the only DS
or 3DS that doesn't have a folding clamshell design, which means that it is
definitely not as pocketable. But, on the flip side, if you're
someone with larger hands, this is actually one
of the more comfortable consoles to play on. Next in the lineup, we have
the new Nintendo 2DS XL. Now this actually only came
out a couple months ago and I did do a full video on it, but if you guys missed that, there's actually a lot of
interesting stuff with this guy. Because this is a newer
console, Nintendo are still rolling out some new
colors, including this white and orange, which I actually
think looks pretty nice. But what I really wanna get my hands on is the Poke Ball Edition,
which comes out next month. Unlike the original, the
new 2DS XL doesn't give up a lot over a 3DS. So, you're getting those larger displays, you're getting the upgraded speakers, and of course, it'll
actually fit in your pocket. There are also some nice
upgrades like faster internals, which help with load times as well as give you a
couple of exclusive titles. And, you do have Amiibo support. Long story short, this is actually one of my favorite 3DSs you can buy today. Which brings us to the
only actual 3DS here, the new 3DS XL. Open this guy up, and we'll see the same quick start information and AR cards, as well as the console itself. What you don't get is an
A/C adapter in the box, which is weird considering that this is the most expensive 3DS you can buy. I will say though that some
of the limited editions, such as the Samus edition
3DS XL, look really nice. So, this originally came out in 2015, at least for the
non-special edition version. What you got here was very
similar to the 2DS XL, except with facetracking 3D. I do have to admit,
this looks really cool. But, the problem is, is
that for only an extra $100 you can go all the way up
to the Nintendo Switch, which makes the 3DS XL
kind of a hard sell. If you've never owned a
3DS or just haven't played in the last few years, then there are a lot
of great games for it. Mario Kart 7 is one of
the earlier 3DS games, but it still holds up surprisingly well, especially considering that
it comes for free on the 2DS. So, I will say that I'm typically
a fan of a little bit more simulation-style games,
like Forza and Gran Turismo, but it is really hard to
argue with just how much fun Mario Kart is, even though
150cc is not my strong suit. It is hard to talk about
a Nintendo handheld without mentioning Pokemon. This is the series that
keeps me coming back, and there are so many
great games available, including the upcoming Ultra Sun and Moon. But, the original Sun and
Moon are also not too bad. This is a game that I've actually put a fair bit of time into, and one of the things that's actually nice about playing it on the 2DS is that, even though it does
have a smaller display, it's the same resolution
as the bigger ones, which means that, this actually
looks a little bit sharper than playing on the 3DS XL or 2DS XL. On top of playing pretty
much all of the Pokemon games for the last 10 years or
so on the 2DS and 3DS, you'll also have a couple
in the Virtual Console, including Red, Blue,
Yellow, Gold, and Silver. I grew up playing the
original Pokemon games, so they definitely have a
special place in my heart. But, I've gotta say it is
really nice to be able to play them on a backlit display
with a headphone jack, having a battery. It's a lot nicer than
the old-school Game Boys, I've gotta admit. All 3DSs can also play
original Nintendo DS games. So, the only issues is,
is that because the screen is slightly higher resolution
than the DS screen, you're either dealing with a
little bit of blurry upscaling or you just can't use the
entire display for the games. But, in return, you're getting
one of the best handheld libraries of all time. The games really are
why you should consider picking up a 3DS in 2017. Sure, Nintendo is slowly bringing
a lot of these franchises over to the smartphone,
but at the end of the day, there are a lot of games
that you just cannot play anywhere else besides the 3DS. I think it's only a matter
of time before the Switch totally replaces the 3DS. But, for now, I think it makes sense why this exists in 2017. There are still new
games coming out for it. If you just wanna play
through a few DS or 3DS games, then the original 2DS
is not a bad pick up. For $80, you're only a single
pair of headphones away from having a pretty
solid gaming experience. My favorite 3DS isn't
actually a 3DS at all. It's the new 2DS XL. So, if you're okay with
giving up the 3D display, which personally I just
don't find all that useful, you're pretty much getting
the full experience here, and it's cheaper. To be fair, the new 3DS XL isn't
exactly a terrible pick up, but at $200 it is so hard
to justify picking this up when the Nintendo Switch
is only $100 more. Unless you're a hardcore
fan who really likes these special editions, I would
go with the 2DS or 2DS XL. So, what do you guys think? Should the Nintendo 3DS
still exist in 2017? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. It has been nearly four years since the original Nintendo 2DS came out. But today there's an upgrade. Big shout out to Nintendo
for hooking us up with the 2DS XL a little bit early. So, the 2DS has always been a
little bit of a weird product. When the 3DS came out the big
feature was the new 3D screen. And of course that's exactly
what the 2DS takes away. So, if we open up the box
the first thing we see is the power adapter. So, this doesn't seem like
something that should be all that impressive, but the new
3DS XL doesn't even actually come with one. You know I actually kind
of like the look of this. So, with the blue accents and the kind of textured black finish it, oh, it looks really nice. One thing I will say though
is it feels very lightweight. It doesn't feel like there's
a lot of sort of heft to it, but to be fair it's all plastic and it feels pretty well put together. I mean... So, the first thing that I noticed is that there's some weird
quirks with the design. So, the hinge itself
actually kind of sticks out a little bit and because of
that the front facing camera is actually exposed even
when the 2DS is closed. So, when you open it up it makes sense, you can see it pretty well there, but when you close it it's
actually kind of exposed. Something else that's kind
of weird is that there's no obvious way to put the games
in besides what I assume is behind this flap. Yeah, so inside here we can
put in a 3DS game, a DS game. We also have what looks
like a micro SD card, which is going to be four gigabytes. So, right here beside the
headphone jack there's, oh, the stylus. That is the smallest
stylus I've ever seen! What? What? Hold on. So this is what the normal
2DS stylus looks like. You know, it's meant for human hands. Whereas this is the 2DS XL. It is a lot smaller. Like, I don't even... How is that even supposed to make sense? That is... Comparing the original 2DS with the XL, the first thing you'll notice
is that the XL is a lot bigger and a big part of that is that it now has a clam shell design. So, when you look at the
original 2DS something I think a lot of people make fun of is the sort of weird flat design. Now, to be fair, in the hand
it actually doesn't feel too bad depending on
how big your hands are. For me it feels about right. But, when it comes to
actually trying to put this in your pocket, good luck. Where something like this,
even though it is fairly large, it folds up nice and neat. I will say I do like
the look of the 2DS XL. So, as far as I know
right now in North America there's only this black and blue color, but I think it looks pretty nice. Something that I really
keep coming back to, though, is that this is really light. It feels, not cheap, but
lighter than you expect. The real comparison here,
though, is with the 3DS XL. And the first thing I
noticed with these two is they actually have slightly
different camera layouts. So, with the 3DS XL,
if I open this guy up, you'll see that there are two 3D cameras, or I guess one 3D camera on the back. So, essentially you can use
this for some mini games, but they actually do take
stereoscopic 3D images. Now, the 2DS XL also has that, but instead of being on the screen, they're actually on the back. Yeah, that's what I said. Weird, right? Put them side by side and
the biggest difference that you'll notice between the 2DS XL and 3DS XL is the lack of 3D screen. So, with this guy you
can turn on the 3D switch and you can adjust it
to the sort of strength that you like. And there were some cool things that they did do with the 3DS XL, including some eye tracking to
sort of customize the screen. As before with the 3DS if
you got a little bit off axis it could look really weird. However, for me I just
don't really enjoy the 3D. It's kinda nice, a
couple games do it well, but for the most part that
switch is off all the time. Which essentially means
it's the same as the 2DS. So, this is the new Nintendo 2DS XL and that new name means that it has the upgraded specs from the 3DS. So, while the original
hardware came out in 2011, they have since upgraded
and it runs a lot smoother. When you look at the XL side
by side with the original 2DS, there are a lot of very nice upgrades. So, some of them are super obvious. The screens are much
larger on the newer unit. But there are also some
more subtle upgrades. Like the original 2DS
only had a fairly small and weak speaker, whereas the 2DS XL has
dual front firing speakers, or side-ish firing speakers. I accidentally opened the camera, so I guess that means camera time. First thing I noticed is
having the cameras on the back means I have to really sort of twist it. So if I try to take a
shot of Savage Kenny here, that's some potato quality. Again, the angles are super weird. You actually kind of have to... So, you might not wanna take
your next selfie masterpiece on it, but for a lot the
stuff like games need it for AR stuff it works. Of course, as a game console
we have to play some games. So, to start with we have Pokemon Sun. The Pokemon games, I will
be totally honest with you, are a huge reason why I
played the Game Boy, the DS, and the 3DS, that's really
what keeps me coming back to Nintendo handhelds. And Sun I think is, well,
another one that I've spent a lot of money on. Yeah, I've bought a lot of Pokemon games. It looks good, the screens
on the 2DS are not great, to be totally honest with you, but it's about the same
as every other 3DS, so there's really not a
whole lot to complain about. Speaker also sounds decent,
not great, but decent. Next we have Super Smash. This is a game that really
impressed me that's even playable on the 3DS. Considering this is hardware
that originally came out in 2011, the fact that
not only does it look nice and it's playable, we're
getting a full 60FPS is awesome. Smash is also one of the few
games that do support Amiibos. So, with the 2DS what we're
doing is we're actually putting it in the middle of the screen, but once we do that it
pretty much immediately loads up the Amiibo. You can train it, you
can do different things. To be honest, I don't find
that there's a ton of games that really make Amiibos all that useful, but it's definitely nice to have. So, one thing I'm noticing
the stylus actually isn't quite as annoying
as I thought it would be. Yes, it is very, very short, but depending on how you hold it, it actually doesn't feel that bad. Now, you do have the option
of buying digital games for the 2DS XL as opposed
to buying physical ones, so most of the titles are
available on the eshop, but generally speaking I'm
not a big fan of the way that Nintendo handles a
lot of the account stuff. And to be honest I prefer having
the actual physical games. What is cool, though, is that you do have the full
virtual console on here. There aren't a ton of games, but you do have a fair few
options such as the original Pokemon games, you have some NES titles, some Super Nintendo games, Game Boy Color. And there are still more coming, for example Pokemon Gold
and Silver will be available on the 3DS a little bit later in the year. So, Nintendo is still making
both the 2DS as well as the New 3DS XL right now. So, which one should you pick up? Well, if you wanna be cheap and you want just a basic Pokemon machine, it is hard to argue with
the 2DS at about $80. It is definitely not perfect, it would be nice if it had better speakers and the design that was a
little bit more portable, but I think a lot of people would be completely fine with this. The 3DS XL is definitely
the superior console as far as tech goes. So, not only does it have
all the updated specs, but you have the additional buttons and controls, Amiibo support, and it does have that
nicer looking 3D screen. But for me, I don't ever use the 3D, so that really is not a big deal. Which makes the 2DS XL
look a lot more appealing. For $150 the 2DS XL is
probably the end of the line for the 3DS. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Well, sure, it's about half
the price of the Switch, but more importantly there are still games that are coming out for this. So, stuff like Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon will be out a
little bit later this year. And as far as I'm concerned, this is my favorite 3DS design yet. So, what do you guys
think about the 2DS XL? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- This video is sponsored by Squarespace, whether you need to domain, online store or website, make it with Squarespace. Hey guys, this is Austin! This
inconspicuous box right here contains a portable game console that is a full fledged PC with Windows. This is the GPD WIN2. Now to be clear, this is
the light prototype, so the final version will have
some fit and finish differences, but it should give us a
good look at what this guy is actually going to be
like when it goes on sale. Yo! It looks like a little laptop! Wow! (laughs) This is so cool! So if you guys remember
last year, we did a video on the world's smallest laptop at the time, which is also made by GPD. Well this actually takes
a lot of cues from that, but it actually has pretty
much a full Xbox controller built in, in addition to a tiny keyboard. I've gotta say, the hardware
feels surprisingly solid. So it's all metal and-
actually is that metal? (taps) Oh yeah this is
definitely metal. Man! This is very unusual, there's all kinds of weird buttons and ports, there's a full size USB port on the back of your tiny game console. So in addition to a slot for the SSD, you will also see the tiny fan. Now what separates this
from something like that GPD laptop that we
took a look at last year, is this has a proper core
processor, now mind you, its a low wattage core
M3, but still, it actually should be enough to
play some decent games. There's a pretty wide variety of ports, including a USB type C, which
can also be used for charging, a headphone jack, a full
size USB 3.0, Micro SD, we have a Micro HDMI, as well as we have three sets of shoulder buttons. Take a look inside the
WIN 2 and you'll see it's a pretty interesting little device. So in addition to having
a pair of joysticks, you also get a D-Pad as
well as your standard X, Y, A, and B buttons, there's
a little toggle here that will switch between mouse input as well as just turning it into a game controller. But even on the keyboard
there's some specific options, including the Xbox buttons, select, start, you can even use the arrow
keys as well as the WASD. Now is it a good idea for
you to set your tiny little laptop portable console thing up, and use it with a mouse
and this tiny keyboard? No, that's not a good idea at all. But you have the USB
port so, you can do it. So while I might not sound impressive with a six inch 720p display, it actually does make sense considering that the fairly limited power
of the actual computer... Or, game console? What do I call this? Do I call
this a computer, you think? I mean, it runs Windows.
It's a computer, right? - [Man] Handheld PC. - Handheld PC. Coming back! 2018! The year of handheld PCs. Do you hear that? That's the sound... of portable power! It's actually not that
loud; it's just a little... Little high pitched. I will say one thing: Now that
we're actually into Windows, 720p on a six inch display
is very, very small. Inside, this guy is rocking
that core m3 processor with the integrated HD 615 graphics, 8GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, as well as a pair of 4900 milliamp hour batteries. Which especially when you're
doing longer gaming sessions should definitely come in handy. So because this guy only
has 120 gigs of storage out of the box, I am using
an external drive, but let's actually see how the
controls hold up in gaming. The first game I'm going
to be trying is CS:Go. Now, this is a famous game
that is really well known for how well it is supported
by controllers and, how it really is the ultimate
way of playing the game. Alright, I'm just gonna
walk around with a pistol because I don't know what
the controls are to switch... Oh it's space. So, immediately the
performance seems decent. Um, I definitely need
to tune the sensitivity of these sticks but getting like 45 frames per
second on medium at 720p. The more I play this, the
more it really does feel like I'm playing on a PC version of the Switch. The six inch screen, even though it's not super high resolution or anything, because it's so small,
it makes a lot of games, even on medium, look pretty decent. Next, we have Rocket League. Now here I'm also going
to turn it down to 720p on quality settings. But, I think we should be playable. A game like Rocket League
does feel at home on the Win. Not only is it powerful
enough to play it pretty well, the controls feel really nice. So, something that I'm noticing here is that the quality of the
buttons and especially the sticks feels solid; it feels like,
while yes, this is going to be a little bit of
an expensive portable, would you see where they spent it? It wasn't like they
were just going crazy... And oh yeah, come on, come on come on... No, no... Next, we have GTA5. Now this, it claim, is
able to be played back at around 40 frames per
second with max settings. However, while I'm playing
it here at 720p on normal, I'm getting like 20 frames per second. So I'm not exactly sure how
they're getting that number. I mean, it's kinda
playable, just about as much as, like, the Xbox 360 version, maybe? But, yeah not the greatest experience. Even thought the controls
are good for the most part I will say it is a little
bit awkward to have three set of buttons on your
shoulders instead of two. So instead of being able
to press in the sticks for R3 and L3, you actually
have that dedicated button around back. And that's fine, but I
accidentally keep grabbing it when I mean to do something like shoot at someone or something,
which is kind annoying. Now comes the real test. Can
I play Overwatch on this guy? So at first glance, a
portable Overwatch machine sounds like a great idea. But I'm curious to see what the actual performance looks like. So in Overwatch its 720p
on low. We do see the frame rate dropping a little
bit from time to time, especially when you get into a
big battle, but it is usable. My big issue is just the
sort of the sensitivity of the sticks; I feel like
it does need a little bit of sort of customization to
be able to really get it into a good sweet spot. But it's, uh, it's not bad.
Also, what am I doing here? That was a bad idea. So, should you pick up the GPD Win 2? Well, it's a little bit more complicated than a lot of videos. On one hand, even though,
yeah, it's a little bit of a weird concept, the Win actually pulls it off pretty well. The biggest downside is price. So it's $650 on Indiegogo right now, and somewhere north of $800 when it goes for full retail sale. The GPD Win 2 is for a
very specific person. For everyone else, may I interest you in something called the Nintendo Switch. And, if you pick up a Switch, you can use all the money you saved to
sign up for Squarespace. See what I did there? Squarespace is the ultimate
way to build yourself a Nintendo Switch fan page, or well pretty much anything else. And, in case you don't have a ken to build a website for you, Squarespace makes it super simple with their easy drag-and-drop templates, to not only be able to create a really custom looking website, but something that's going
to be really easy to build. Squarespace makes everything super simple with their all-in-one
platform. There's no need to install, patch, or

- [Austin] Nothing like a
package straight from China to tell you that it's
going to be a good video. Hey guys, this is Austin. And this is a $160 iPhone X clone. The description of goods
here lists it as a phone with a total value of $159.99. The idea here is that this
is one of the very first, which I'm sure it's going
to be Android phones, that actually does have not only Face ID, but it also does have the notch. The good news though is
that we get support for a gravity sensor, which of
course is very important in your smartphone. Well from the front if we remove
the little screen protector that actually does kind
of look like an iPhone X. You've got the notch and it
actually is not that far off. So take off the rubber
case that comes with it and you'll see that the back
is actually a little different even though we do have the dual cameras, we get something that even
the iPhone X doesn't have. A fingerprint sensor. Also like the iPhone X,
we do have a USB-C port which is close enough to Lightning, but what we don't get is a headphone jack. Even though this phone is clearly thick enough to easily fit one. I'm surprised with just how heavy this is. Now I think part of it
is because it is so thick and it does have such a large battery. Especially when you put it side-by-side with something like the iPhone X. It really does not feel anywhere near the same sort of level of polish. Now part of that is of course the fact that this guy is rocking
a glass back versus, I assume it's metal? Oh you know what, that's plastic. Ooh, we have Google Assistant built in. Alright, I actually
will say that that's not what I was expecting on
a kinda low-end device. I think we're actually
running Android 7 here. So, with the U18 set up it actually looks like a fairly stock-looking Android. So there is a couple of
weird apps on here but for the most part it actually
looks fairly straightforward. Now the notch, the notch is
a little bit interesting. Put this side-by-side
with the actual iPhone X and you'll see they
actually look fairly close. So especially with the notch,
while it's a little bit bigger it's not actually that far-off. Although it does have a big
chin compared to the iPhone X. One of the nice things is, Android actually does have
native support for the notch. So in an app like Google Maps
here, you actually can see that we do get pretty much
the full screen even though it is going to be a little
bit grayed-out on top. Now this is also shared with something like the Essential phone. So even though this is a much
smaller notch that's just for the front-facing camera,
it actually does also take advantage of it in interesting ways, so it's not like that space
is always going to be wasted. So you're getting pretty
much the same sort of setup with your icons up on the top right as well as your time on the top left. Now the only thing I will
say is a little bit weird is the fact that even though
it is going to be curved it's not going to be quite
that same level as the iPhone, but at first glance it
is very, very close. One of the weird things
with the iPhone X is if you pull down from the
normal part you're going to be getting all of your information,
all your notifications, but if you pull down from the right you're actually going to be
getting control center. Now here, if you pull
down from either side, you're going to be getting
some different notifications. If you pull down from the
middle, nothing happens. So, you know, don't do that. Considering that it only costs $160, inside it actually has
pretty decent specs. You're going to be getting
a 4,000 mAh battery which is going to be powering
an octa core processor with four gigs of RAM
and 64 gigs of storage. When it comes to the screen,
you're getting a 5.8" display with a resolution of 1512x720. Definitely on the lower side,
but it is a pretty okay panel, I mean it's not really
exactly going to blow you away but it's fairly bright,
the colors are decent, the viewing angles though
just aren't that great. Again though, $160. Now in addition to the notch, you're also going to be getting Face ID. Or well, face unlock. "Please note. "Appearance, shape similar
to people or items, "you may unlock success." Oh boy. (laughs) "Check the face, keep this position "and wait for the countdown to finish." Oh, it added it. Wait, my face wasn't even
totally in the frame. Hold on a second, does
that actually work though? Oh okay, it worked. The real test though, is will it be fooled by a picture of me? So with this awesome selfie, can we actually unlock the phone? Alright so I'll put it like this, and face recognition failed. Failed. Failed. Failed. I don't necessarily think that
was the most accurate thing in the world but at least
based on first impressions, it kind of works. Alright so, something like this? - [Ken] Yeah. - Okay. Yep. (laughs) Alright, nevermind, I
take all that stuff back. It is easily fooled with
just a single photo of you. Well I mean, you know, they're trying. It's $160. Thankfully you don't
have to rely on Face ID, as you do have that fingerprint sensor. So we turn it on, drop your finger on it, it sort of works. (laughs) The second time, at least. - No matter
how strong Apple claims this glass is, it can absolutely
be cracked if you drop it. - Oh, okay. Well, I mean, you've got
a decent-sized screen but because the way that the
phone is treating the notch, unlike the iPhone where
you can actually punch in, especially when you're
watching widescreen video, here it's just like you
always have that much of the screen that doesn't exist. The only time you really get it is if you have an app that
specifically supports it, or you've got something
like the home screen, which does allow you to get a little bit of your information up top. Put these two side-by-side
and around back, they look absolutely nothing alike. However this guy is rocking
the same, at least in theory, rear-facing camera. Or well, cameras. Whoa. Wow. They straight ripped the iPhone interface. Like it's totally identical. You can hit the little
button to go to 2x. (laughs) Let's do a little side-by-side. So, first of all let's
take a photo on the U18. And now let's take that
same photo on the iPhone X. At first glance, it's
actually not that bad. But if you take a closer look, you'll see that there's just
not a lot of detail there. So this is what video looks like on the $160 iPhone X clone. It's not exactly what I would call crispy. The blur mode is literally just, like, a blurred edge around the photo. Hold on, wait. Let me try this. Are you serious? That might be the worst
portrait-mode photo I have ever seen. Literally nothing is in
focus, it's just like this circle of vague focus
around the middle part. We have face beauty mode. Alright, I could use
some beauty on my face. I don't think I would call that beautiful, it's just a little blurry. Okay, so, the camera. Not exactly so great. But you are getting the notch and I mean, if you wanna fool someone into
thinking that you're using an iPhone with like a
really thick case, I guess? So, for $160 should you
pick up the Oukitel U18? Well some parts of it they did
a really good job of copying. I think the notch is actually done better than I was expecting, and
especially over the next year or so I think we're going to be seeing a lot of Android phones with the notch. However, the face unlock
as well as the cameras are certified garbage town. So what do you guys think? Lemme know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin, and today I'm here with my
2017 Gaming PC build tutorial. If you guys have never
built a computer before, it is really straight forward,
but I'm gonna walk you through step by step. Also, I sound like some infomercial guy. Call now for your three quick tips on how to build yourself a Gaming PC. For tools, it's pretty straight forward. All you need is a Phillips screwdriver. Now, beyond that you need
to have a decent sized workspace, so I'm going
to be using this table. As long as you have an
area that's big enough to set out your parts, you're fine. Beyond that, you should if possible, do this in an area without carpet, as static electricity is not
a good thing with PC parts. The first step is to grab your case and pull it out of the box. Now this is by far our biggest component, and this is, as the case name implies, where all of our parts end up going. So this is the case. Now the first step here is just gonna be opening it up. So around back, there
are gonna be four screws, and all it's gonna allow us to do is take off the side panels. Inside here, all we need
to do is get all of our cables out, so this is what's going to go into the motherboard later. We also have a little bit
of hardware as well as some cable ties for our cable management. The first thing to install
is gonna be our power supply. This is the literal heart of our build, and one of the most important things when picking a power supply is
to get a high quality unit. There are lots of very cheap units that say they have a lot of power, but really you should
be looking for something with an 80 plus rating,
whether it's 80 plus, bronze, gold, silver, whatever. That means that you're going to at least get something with decent quality. Inside the power supply box, not only do we actually
have the supply itself, but we also have the
cable as well as we have a few extra little accessories. The most important thing here, is we have four little screws
that we were going to use to actually mount the supply in. Something else to keep in mind when picking up a power supply is modular versus non-modular. This guy is non-modular, and
these are typically cheaper. And the only thing that that really means is whether the cables are attached or not. For this system we have plenty of room for cable management inside. So it really doesn't matter that we have a bunch of extra cables
that we aren't going to use, especially if you're
doing a smaller system where every little bit of space matters, you may want to spend
just a little bit extra to pick up a modular supply. Installing the power supply
is pretty straight forward. One thing you do need to watch out for is where the fan is. This always needs access to cool air. So cases will actually handle this a little bit differently sometimes. Some cases will actually
put it on the top, which means that you should
have the fan facing upward. But for this guy, since we are going to be putting it on the bottom, it's simple as putting the fan face down, lining it up and it should
just slide right into place. To get this guy in
place, all we need to do is use the four screws that it comes with, and there are going to be
corresponding holes on the case. All I need to do is just get this in, you don't have to do it
super tight or anything. But, once we get these guys in place, the power supply is not
going to be going anywhere. One little tip when it
comes to pretty much screwing anything in, is you
want to use a cross pattern. I'm gonna do this one, then this one, then this one. This just helps that, pretty much any time you're mounting hardware,
to make sure that you're applying even pressure
instead of just doing one side and it's maybe slightly out of place. That is all we have to do
with the power supply for now. The next step is to move
our case out of the way and grab our motherboard. This might not look like much, but it is essentially
what everything in the computer connects to. This is the motherboard. There are different sizes of motherboards, and that is something that you definitely want to pay attention
to before you actually pick out all the parts for your build. This is the sort of medium sized, it's known as Micro ATX. Now thankfully, with this case, it actually supports full sized ATX, so pretty much any sized
motherboard will fit. This is definitely something
you want to look out for before you actually buy all
the parts for your build. Before we get this installed, let me quickly run you through all the different sort of slots and ports and things that we're going
to be using for the build. To start with, we have the CPU socket. Pretty self explanatory, this is where our CPU is going to go. Beside that, we have our memory slots. This board has two, but some do have four. Essentially this is where our RAM goes. We also do have our PCI slot down here. Different motherboards
will have different amounts of PCI slots, but this
is generally speaking where you're going to put a graphics card, and sometimes you're going
to put other add-in cards, so just something like a
network card or Wi-Fi card. Beside the memory, we
have four SATA ports. These are going to be
used for things such as installing our SSD, maybe a hard drive or even an optical drive. And over beside that, we have our M2 slot. This is a newer motherboard, not all motherboards
are going to have this. But this is going to be
if you want to install a newer, faster SSD. We're not taking advantage
of it for this build, but the motherboard does support it. Now, if you actually want to
flip the motherboard around, you're going to see that over here we have all of our ports. These are going to be
what's going to stick out the back of the case. Say you want to plug in
something like USB or ethernet or whatever, that's where all of these are going to go. We're also going to have to
get power to our motherboard. So first of all we have our 20+4 pin, so this is going to
provide most of the power for pretty much everything on the board. And we also have either
a four or an eight pin CPU power connector. This board has an eight pin, but it works the exact same way. Next it's time to install the processor. This is going to be a little different depending on whether
you're using Intel or AMD, but I'll walk you
through it on both sides, it's basically the same process. Inside, we're going to have some paperwork which we don't need at all, as well as our CPU cooler and processor. You want to be a little bit
careful with the cooler. Not so much the top, but on
the bottom there's going to be a little bit of pre-applied thermal paste. Do not touch that. And inside this little plastic piece here, we have the processor itself. You actually do want to
be careful with this guy. When you're handling a
processor, you always want to grab it from the sides. Do not touch any of these little pads. It's especially important
with AMD processors, 'cause instead of having
pads, they have pins and if any of those get bent,
you are in serious trouble. One thing to look for on
the bottom of the processor is this tiny little gold arrow. That's going to match up
with a corresponding arrow on the processor socket,
making sure that you're not going to put this in
sideways or upside down. It's pretty straight forward to install. You just need to pull the arm
back and open up the socket, line our CPU up, being very careful not to drop it too hard. And then, once it's in place, we just need to push
this arm back into place and our CPU is installed. Pretty easy. The next step is putting on the heat sink. Again, this is going to be
pretty straight forward. There are going to be four
pins which will line up to the corresponding
notches on the motherboard. All we need to do is line it up, making sure that we
don't actually let that thermal paste touch yet. And then, once it's in
place, all we need to do is just press it in until it clicks. Then we just have to plug in the fan. We just need to unwind
the fan header from around our CPU cooler. For this motherboard, we're
going to be plugging it in right here, however because the cable's just a little bit long,
what I like to do is actually just tie a little bit of a knot to get rid of some of the slack. Now, the actual fan header
itself will only go in one way because of these
two little notches. So, if we line it up and press it in, tuck our cable out of the way, and we're pretty much good to go. The next step is installing our memory. This is going to be
pretty straight forward. There are different types of RAM that you need to look out for. Most newer systems, this one included are going to be using DDR4 memory. But if you're doing a
slightly older system that will be using DDR3, it's basically the same
thing as far as installing. It might sound obvious, but
if you have a DDR4 motherboard you have to use DDR4 RAM
and vice versa with DDR3. Now, it can be a little tricky because these do look very similar, but DDR4 does have a different pin layout. What is pretty much the
same between the two, is there's going to be
a little notch about two thirds of the way down the memory. That's going to correspond
to a matching notch on the motherboard, so this is only going to go in one way. All I need to do is line it up, and just press down firmly (clicking) until you get the click, and
your memory is installed. Before we're ready to actually install our motherboard though, we want to get the IO shield ready. This is what's going to
essentially go over the ports right here, but instead of
putting on the motherboard, we're actually going
to put it on the case. You do want to make sure
that the shield is facing the correct orientation. Once you get it, all you
do is just line it up with the back of your case, and once you do, just pop it right in. (clicking) that sounded a lot more
violent than it actually was. Next, go into the bag of hardware
that comes with your case. Inside we're going to
find these standoffs. These are going to be what we actually use to mount the motherboard. On one side we're going to
screw them into the case and on the other we're going
to mount the motherboard. As I shall now demonstrate
with my wonderful assistant Wes, all you need to do is first take the
motherboard and just kind of test fit it in here. Don't let it all the way down. What you can do is you can see that we have six holes on the motherboard, and that's going to line up with the six holes that are
going to be in the case. Now because this is a bigger case meant for ATX motherboards, you'll see we have a bunch of extra holes. All we need to do is put the standoffs in the correct locations. So with the standoffs, all you need to do is just get them in finger tight, they don't have to be
super super hard in there. But, again, just make sure that you get all the standoffs in the right locations. The next step is removing our PCI covers. This case actually does it a
little differently than most. Essentially right back here is where our graphics card is going to go. And typically you would just
unscrew it and take it out, however with this case,
we actually have to just push them out of place. (clicking) There we go. (chuckling) That was way harder than it should be. So, once you get the first
one out, it's not so bad, but if you get a case that
actually just will allow you to unscrew it, that makes
things a lot simpler, otherwise you just have to
wiggle it back and forth until it pops out. All we have to do now is
just take our motherboard, line it up with our standoffs, and pay careful attention
to the IO shield, you want to make sure that all the ports are going to be fully
visible through the back, which they are. Once you have it lined
up, then you just have to screw it in place. So, we have a little bag of screws here. Most of the time, cases will actually have lots of different very
similar looking screws, so it might take a little
bit of trial and error. But just get a few of these screws out, and we should get this guy into place. This is definitely a
time when you want to use cross-threading on your screws. Say if you want to do one
side and then the other, what can happen is the board
will actually slightly shift. So just do one corner, then
go to the opposite corner, opposite corner, opposite corner, until you make sure that the
board is all the way in place. For this build we are using an
SSD instead of a hard drive, but the process of installing
and especially cabling it is basically the exact same thing. The biggest difference is an SSD is just going to be a
physically smaller drive, which means they use slightly
different mounting points. With this case we're
going to be using the full three and a half inch drive bay, which is typically used
for bigger hard drives, however we do have the
mounting points for an SSD. The only thing you have
to watch out for here is to make sure that the
connectors for the SSD are going to be facing backward
toward the back of the case otherwise your cable management
is going to be challenged. (chuckling) Once you've lined the SSD up, it's as simple as just using a few screws to hold it into place, and this guy isn't going anywhere. Then we just slide our SSD into the case, and that's pretty much it. We are almost done with
putting hardware in the case. The next step is to start with our wiring. This can look a little intimidating, but it's really not that bad. To start with, we can find the little three pin connector from our fan, and all we need to do
is just plug that into the system fan header on
the top left of the board. There's a lot of extra slack
here, so we're going to just tuck that around, 'cause you know, totally no one's gonna notice that, right? Now we have to find the 20+4 pin connector from our power supply. That's going to be probably the biggest one out of all your power supply cables. So just note that there's going to be a little clip on the side. All you need to do is
just line it up with the larger connector on the motherboard, and just press it until
it clicks into place. Working our way down the
right side of the motherboard, we now need to go and
pull all these cables that are connected to the case. For here, in this build,
we have a USB3 header. So there's one USB 3.0 port
on the front of the case. Now this is a little bit
of a tricky connector, mostly because if you get it kinda stuck, I've actually seen that
the whole front of this will actually pull off, so you definitely want to make sure that you kind of line it up correctly. But just like the other
one, there's going to be a little notch, so it's
only going to go in one way. So, if we just plug it into
our USB 3.0 header right here, again, just press it into
place and we should be good. While we're here, let's plug
in the front panel connectors. These are the tiny little connectors that are going to be running
from the front of the case. Essentially this is going to allow things like the power button to work, any LED's, that kind of stuff. Now, these are all going to be labeled, so there's going to be
a positive and negative. That's going to correspond
to whatever it says, either on the actual
connectors on the bottom right of the board, or if you just
check the owner's manual, that will also give you the exact diagram. For here, we actually
only have four of these. So if we line it up, it should
just go right into place. This case also has a
couple of USB 2.0 ports, which is what this cable is for. This is a pretty straight
forward connector, so it actually has one pin knocked out, so you can only put it in one way. And for this case, we're
just going to plug it in to the white header here. So we just line it up, and
press it all the way in, simple as that. Last but not least, we
have the audio connector. So, as the name implies,
it is going to allow the headphone and microphone
jack on the front of the case to work. And just like the USB
port, there's going to be one little pin that's knocked out, so you can't put it in the wrong way. So, just line it up, press it in, and we're done with the
little fiddly stuff. We're almost ready to
install the graphics card, but before we do that,
we just need to plug in the CPU power connector. So it's basically two four
pins that can go together as an eight pin. With this board, we need to use both, but a lot of motherboards,
you only have to plug one in. Now is the fun part, this
is our graphics card. So, with a Gaming PC,
when it comes to picking parts that really impact
gaming performance, the graphics card really is pretty much the most important part. Now, a graphics card
isn't especially fragile, so you don't have to be
super careful with it, but generally speaking,
you should touch it by the plastic bit or the metal as opposed to the board on the back. This is about as small
as a graphics card gets, but it works the exact same way even if you have a much larger,
more expensive card. What you do is flip it around so that you have the board on the top, and once you have your PCI slot and your cover's open, just line it up, and all you need to do is press it until it clicks into place. All we have to do is just make sure the graphics card is
lined up with the holes on the side of the case, and
just screw it into place. So we're gonna use two screws to do this, and that's pretty much it. Because this is a little
bit of a lower powered graphics card, we actually
don't need to do anything else. But for most graphics
cards, you're also going to want to run a six pin connector
from your power supply, it's gonna look a little
something like this, and plug it in. But again, with this card, we plug it in and it's good to go. We are almost there. Next step is to pull out the SATA cables that came with the motherboard, and all you need to do is grab one end and plug it into the board right here. These are notched, so they're definitely not going to go in the wrong way. And then, if we wrap the cable around back so it doesn't get in our way. Then we just plug the data cable into the back of the SSD. It's going to be the smaller port and this guy's going to click in place, and that's pretty much it. Now we just have to run power. So going back to the power supply, we have these SATA leads. So, it looks very similar to the data, so it's a long, flat
cable with a little notch. And just like before, all we need to do is line that up with the back of the SSD, plug it in, and our SSD
is 100% ready to go. While we're back here, we
need to plug in the front fan. We actually have two
options of doing that. Typically we're going to
want to use the little three pin header to plug it
straight into the motherboard, however this board actually
doesn't have another slot, so we can actually just use the Molex. This is another cable
that you're gonna get off the power supply. While it looks a little crooked and weird, all we need to do here is
just plug it into place, 'til it clicks, and our fan is gonna be good to go. Now, the system's basically done. This is always the most exciting part. Does the computer work? So, once you get a
mouse, keyboard, monitor, and plug everything in,
hopefully everything works. So, yes! It's the best feeling ever when it actually boots on the first try. The next thing we have to do is give it about 30 seconds or so, and we should get video up on the monitor. Or less than 30 seconds, that
actually is really quick. If you've gotten to this
point, congratulations, you have a fully working computer. Now is the point you turn the PC off, unplug it and start doing
some cable management. This, maybe not the
cleanest thing in the world. But once you get all that ready, you're good to install Windows and have a fully working gaming computer. If you want more information on the actual parts I used for the system, you can check out the

so much for watching and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Put the Eve V side-by-side
with the Microsoft Surface Pro and you'll see that they
look pretty similar. A quick glance at the Eve site
makes the comparison obvious. But take a closer look and you'll see that this is
a really interesting device. The second you open the
box you'll see the names of a thousand people who
contributed to the design of the Eve V. The idea was that this was
a crowd designed device. Eve originally reached
out to me over a year ago asking if I wanted to take a look at the V and in the meantime a lot of the specs have
legitimately changed based on community feedback. This is a really cool idea. Of course, there are downsides to buying from a small startup, but you can't fault them
for trying a new approach. However when you consider just
how good the Surface Pro is the V has to do some really cool stuff to justify it's existence. And it kind of does. While at first glance it
looks incredibly similar to the Surface. Take a closer look and there
are some thoughtful details. Instead of a single USB-A and
the bizarre Mini DisplayPort on the Pro, you're getting
two full-size USB ports in addition to a pair of USB-C ports, one of which is full Thunderbolt 3 and both can be used for charging. Now there is no facial
recognition with Windows Hello but you do have a slightly
hidden fingerprint sensor and a very similarly adjustable kickstand. Again, at first glance
the detachable keyboard looks nearly identical to the Surface but it has a surprisingly mechanical feel with a lot of key travel. It's not what you would
typically expect to find on a laptop or a two-in-one. And while it took me a few
minutes to get used to, it kinda makes the Surface
feel a little bit spongy in comparison. You've also got the slightly
unnecessary RGB backlight but it does double as
a Bluetooth keyboard. Detach it from the V
and hold control and F12 to sync it wirelessly. I don't know how often I
would end up using this but it is a nice feature. I will say the trackpad isn't amazing. It's totally fine and combined with the
touchscreen navigation is okay, but I do prefer the clicky-ness of the Surface Pro touch pad. Probably the best feature of the keyboard is that it's actually included in the box. This is almost a necessity
on a two-in-one like this and on the Surface it
will cost you another $130 to get the keyboard. Big props to Eve for, you know, including that basic necessity in the box. It goes beyond that too. They also include a pen. Another $100 addition on the Surface. To be fair, it's based
on slightly older tech than the latest Surface pen
but the slight difference in latency really isn't
a big problem for me. And again, it's included in the box. One minor issue I've noticed
is that while both tablets have a microSD card slot, the
Eve has a little notch on it which makes it really difficult to actually remove the SD card,
which is just kind of dumb. The rest of the hardware feels decent. It's a bit heavier and
entire thing is more rounded, which feels a bit cheaper than the incredibly tight tolerances of the magnesium Surface. But importantly both
have fan-less designs. Well mostly. The Eve uses lower
wattage Core Y processors, so on paper this is a
trade-off between performance and battery life. On one hand you are going
to be losing a little bit of performance, especially
in heavier tasks, such as video editing and gaming. But on the flip side at least in theory you're going to be getting
better battery life. However when you stack
it up to the Surface Pro not only does it offer a
higher wattage Core i5 model, which is still going to be fan-less, but it also has better battery life at 13 and a half hours compared
to 10 hours on the Eve V. The model I have here is almost top spec with a seventh generation Core
i7 processor, 16 gigs of RAM, and a 512 gigabyte SSD,
which comes in at $1,600. However if you want to
pick up the base model with the Core m3, eight gigs
of RAM and 128 gigs of storage, that starts at $800. Put the speced out V alongside the $1,300 Core i5 Surface Pro, and you'll see that they're
fairly comparable in Geekbench and that holds up well
in real world usage. The Eve is snappy and for
normal stuff it's totally fine. Just don't expect to go and do anything all that taxing on it. You do have that Thunderbolt 3 port which allows you to take
advantage of an external GPU but for most people that's going to be a little bit too much. Screen-wise the Eve has a 12.3 inch panel with a resolution of 2880x1920. It's a good screen. You're getting an individually
calibrated display straight from the factory, that while on paper is slightly
sharper than the Surface, but in reality both are top notch. I will say the rounded edges of the V does make the bezels
look a little bit bigger but there really isn't
much to complain about when it comes to the screen. However the speakers, while decent, fall quite a bit short of the front firing ones on the Surface. This is what the webcam looks
and sounds like on the Eve V. So as you can see it's a little bit grainy but for stuff like Skype
and Google Hangouts it should be okay. On the flip side the Surface
looks significantly better. Not only is it going to be 1080p, but as you can see it is
no longer the soupy mess of the Eve. The story of Eve is great. I mean who doesn't want
to root for the underdog? And to be clear, the V is a good computer. Not only does it generally match or even exceed the
Surface in a lot of areas, but it's around the same price or cheaper and it includes not only the
keyboard and also the pen, which Microsoft is going to
charge you over $200 for. The problem is that they're
building these to order so availability is a lot more complicated than you might hope for. However if you're willing to
take a chance on a new company the Eve V is absolutely worth a look. So what do you guys think? Is this a true Surface Pro killer? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin
and today we're back for another Mystery
Tech Items from Amazon. This time taking a look at
stuff under 100 dollars. Ken, if you would please. Okay, more headphones. The Professional 7506
sound monitors from Sony. How much were these? Well the first thing I see
is that copyright 1994. So I guess these are some classics. They actually, oh wait the 7506s. So these are fairly popular, sorta like studio
monitor style headphones. The OG headphone adapter. So naturally, because these
are headphones in 2017, I've gotta use my super cool dongle to actually listen to them. So they definitely lean
a little bit more on the flatter side of things so
it's not really super punchy on the bass like pretty much all modern headphones
are but it sounds good. However I actually don't think that this little headphone adapter's
actually doing it justice. I'm curious what these sound
like plugged into a phone with a proper amp such as the LG V20. It's still not super punchy to be clear but having a proper amp
to actually run them really livens them up. I think my real question here though is would I get these or would
I get the Status CB-1s which have been my
headphones for a long time. I think that, even though
they're about the same price, for stuff like video editing,
for music production, if you want something with a
little bit of a flatter sound, these definitely make sense but if you want just a little
more punch in your music, I still really do like those Statuses. Alright, item number two. 3D Doodler Create? The world's first 3D printing
pen. How much was this? - 82? Okay, alright. We're
still well below 100. Easy as one, two, three.
Plug in and switch to HI. Insert your ABS Plastic.
Doodle onto the page. Interesting. It does
kind of look like a pen. There's a couple of buttons here where you can pick fast versus slow. It looks like it extrudes out here and I guess the idea
is that you can sort of easily bring a little bit of
the Plastic out as you need to. Whoa! Do you see the smoke? (laughs) Alright, we're just
gonna put this over here. Oh, oh, oh! Okay, okay, okay. I guess I can do a 3D, huh? Okay, okay. Let's just
start with a new page. So Ken lives in a big,
green house with four walls so that's the bed and then
the TV, this is such a mess. Alright. So that's Ken's TV. It's this little blob of plastic which sort of represents
what he feels in his soul. How do they get this?
How do they get this car? I'm drawing a stupid square. Alright. Let me see if I can do, what's something that's not crazy complicated
that I could probably pull off? So, if you want to spend 85 dollars and make wonderful works of art like this, link in the description.
Alright Ken, item number three. What, just broke the table! Ken, did you really
just get a giant shark? A fusion of technology and personality. Oh, it's not a shark. It's a RoboRaptor? We've done some weird
stuff on Mystery Tech. This is up there. After
20 minutes of 'unboxing', let's actually see what this thing does. Batteries not included. (robotic raptor noises) Okay. (laughs) (mumbles) No, stop! (robotic raptor noises) It's like it's fighting even more the more I try to put it on. (robotic raptor noises) (laughs) Can the rest of this
video just have no words? Can I just laugh the whole time? Wait, no, don't! No, stop! Little buddy, come on. This
is not the way to end things. So if you've ever wanted
your own RoboDinosaur, you know, this is an option. Honestly at this point, I've lost track of what item we're on.
Ken, just bring it on. I don't think anything can be
as weird as a robot dinosaur. What is this? I don't
really have anything to say. It's a monitor. Wait, how much was this? $80 monitor? Alright. So even though it's a small
screen because it's 1080, the actual pixel density isn't bad. While yes, the view angles aren't amazing, when you're looking at it
dead on, it looks pretty good. For $80, you're getting something
that is pretty bare bones. So for inputs, you only
have DVI as well as VGA. - [Onscreen Voice] The silver
is basically just white with a silver chassis. With the space gray, swaps out the rear glass. - So yes, if you spend another 30, $40, you can get a panel with more inputs and maybe something that's
gonna be a little bit bigger but if you just need to get a monitor to get up and running
with stuff like gaming, this is really not a bad
way to go for like 80 bucks. Good job Ken. Digital camera? Every side of the box
just says digital camera. How much was this? $92. Alright. 24 megapixel sensor, uses SD cards. Oh man, what are we
getting ourselves into? Well, it looks pretty retro. We actually have a flip out screen. I mean, it's a little cheap feeling and to be fair, this entire
thing is absolutely plastic. Look at the lens! Oh
look at this giant lens. Oh wait, no. It's that tiny
little lens in the middle. Alright ready and... There's such a crazy lag when
I actually hit the button versus when it actually takes the picture. Alright, we're now
recording on the $94 camera. Let's flip it around here
and get some vlogging. It looks like we're getting a solid 15 frames per second. Not good. Not good. But you know what is good? The sponsor for today's video: 23andMe. 23andMe will take a look at your DNA and find out all kinds
of things about you. As humans, we have 23 chromosomes which is where the
23andMe name comes from. Oh hi, Austin from the past here with the 23andMe saliva collection kit. Learn what your DNA says about you. Register your kit, spit and discover. Okay, that sounds pretty reasonable to me. Oh wow, that's actually a
lot. You have to really do it. I suddenly question my
decision to do this on camera. Stop looking at me. Alright, so that's it. So I just need to put this in the bag, mail it off to them and in a few weeks, I will know my results. So it's been a couple of weeks
since I sent off my sample and now it's time to
actually see my results. I'm actually a little nervous right now. This can tell you a lot about yourself. My muscle composition is
common in elite power athletes. What? Hey, oh okay. I am 100% Austin. So 98.7% European. Wow, almost
entirely Northwest European. If you guys want to check
out 23andMe for yourself, you can check it out at
the link in the description at 23andMe.com/AustinEvans. Of course, huge shout-out to
them for sponsoring this video. Guys, what do you think
about Ken's wonderful Amazon picks for this one? (laughs) I can't even say wonderful. Anyway guys, thank you
so much for watching and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. I've done a lot of videos
on budget smartphones. However, this, this is something
a little bit different. Meet the Samsung Galaxy S4. The hottest flagship of 2013,
that now costs about $100. This might sound like a
weird idea to do a video on, but it's something that's
really interesting to me. So on one hand, you have a new smartphone that's meant to hit a budget price. But on the other, if you
get something like this, it is dramatically cheaper than it was when it first came out, and you're still getting
all the advantages of a proper flagship. So I was able to find this Galaxy S4 brand new in the box,
however there are still tons and tons and tons of these phones that are available on the
used market for anywhere between $70 to $100. So this brings me back. I actually was at the launch
event for the Galaxy S4. It's hard to believe that
was a full four years ago. But what I'm really curious to see is how well this phone
actually holds up today. Oh wow. This is so much smaller
than I remember it being. Look at that hyper glaze
finish on the back. Man, I remember how much of a
fingerprint magnet this was. But if I remember right,
there's actually a lot of interesting stuff in the box. So not only do we have
the microUSB cable, we have a wall adapter, as well as it looks like some fairly
generic looking headphones. But because this is an
old school Samsung phone, we also have a removable battery. When is comes to the
hottest phone of 2013, the Galaxy S4 actually
doesn't look too bad today. So yes, it is definitely all plastic, and with this sort of hyper glaze finish, it does look a little bit cheap. However, this guy is actually
rocking pretty decent specs for back in the day. Ha, it still has a charge. What is it with me and
pulling super old smartphones out of the box that actually can turn on? That's crazy. And that Android 4.2 life. Yeah, this thing is, this is interesting. This was definitely like
sort of peak TouchWiz, when they would throw every
possible feature at it and almost none of them were useful. Of course taking a look at a Galaxy S4 in a vacuum is no good. So to compare, we have the Blu Life Max. Now for $100, there is actually a lot to like with this phone. There are a ton of accessories here. And also it looks like we have a case and screen protector. For $100, that's actually a lot. The look of this phone is very interesting for a budget device. So it has this soft touch rubber which is meant to look like leather, and it even has sort of fake
stitching around the side. It actually reminds me of
some older Samsung phones. I don't hate it though. Especially compared to the
super generic black plastic. It's not that bad. One thing this does have going for it, is pretty giant 3700mAh battery. Which should definitely
give it tons of longevity especially considering the specs. On top of that, we do have dual SIM cards as well as a microSD card slot. And if I pop the back on,
you'll also be able to see that in addition to the camera, there is a fingerprint reader on the back. That is really cool
for $100 Android phone. So if you try the fingerprint reader, huh, that's actually pretty quick. This may be be a little bit
slower than newer flagships, but that's actually not bad at all. I mean pretty much
leaving your finger on it, it almost immediately unlocks. Side by side with the Galaxy S4, one of the first things that you'll notice is just how much bigger this is. And this is fairly standard
for a lot of phones these days. The Galaxy S4 just looks
tiny in comparison. And what's interesting about this, is that while this does
have the bigger screen at 5.5 inches, it's only 720p. Whereas the Galaxy S4 was
one of the very first phones that moved up to 1080. It's an AMOLED display, and
it does look a lot nicer. It is super interesting
that both of these phones now cost about $100. Especially considering that while this phone was kind of made to kind of hit that price point, this one has come so far, and
yet there's a lot of areas where they are actually very similar. Not only do both phones
have LTE, but they also have quad core processors
with 2 gigabytes of RAM. However the biggest difference here is going to be in software. Where the Life Max ships with Android 6.0, the Galaxy S4 actually has
Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. Now to be fair you can
upgrade this to Android 5 which should make a fairly big difference. But a lot of apps out of
the box are just not going to work on this guy. Where the Galaxy S4 has TouchWiz pretty much everywhere you look, and most of it's not really
going to be all that useful, luckily the Life Max actually is going to be a fairly stock build of Android. Now to be fair there are a
lot of pre-installed apps which definitely kind of
help to keep the price low, but the good thing is
nothing's all that crazy, and of course all of it can be disabled. One of the interesting comparisons
between these two phones are the cameras. So the Galaxy S4 is rocking
a 13 megapixel camera whereas the Blu has eight megapixels. But of course it has four
years of advancements. So see how they actually compare. So there's a lot of contrast here, but, ah, this is a really difficult shot. It's not bad, but the
background is blown out, and Ken is super dark. And now if I take a shot with the Blu. Oh wow. That has a lot more in it. To be fair it's a little
bit older school style of doing HDR. So you can actually see it
taking multiple exposures, but this is a much more usable image. To get a little bit more
of a normal shot though, and the Galaxy S4 looks a lot better. Colors are a lot more vibrant. You can see it's a bigger sensor, there's a little bit of depth
of field in the background, whereas with the Blu
it's very washed out and yeah, that is not sharp at all. I'm actually really impressed with how good this Galaxy S4 camera is. And yeah, if you push it really hard with a very contrasted image, it's just not quite so great looking, but you get a decent looking shot and it is really clean. One area where things
definitely have improved over the last few years
is in selfie technology. So, that's actually pretty close. I think I'm going to have
to give a slight edge to the Galaxy S4 based on sharpness. The Blu just looks a little soft. The more I use these phones, the more I realize that
they are very, very similar in most ways, but the biggest
difference is software. Put simply Android 6 is totally modern. Pretty much all apps will run on it. And while yes, while this is
not the most powerful phone in the world for $100 it will do basically
everything you need it to. You've got two options here,
a safe one, and a risky one. So with the Blu, not only are
you getting a brand new phone, but it's running that
newer version of Android which just simply means
it's going to last longer. On the other hand, I like
the Galaxy S4 as a phone more, but at some point in the
not too distant future, app support just really isn't
going to be a thing here. So for $100 which of these
phones would you guys go for? Let me know in the comments
below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey, guys, this is Austin. iPhones are becoming a
lot easier to pick up. So, I was able to get each
one of these three iPhones for less than $200 on prepaid carriers. But are they worth it? I did a video on this iPhone 5S last year where it cost me $150. However, today, you can
easily find these available for only $129 but even as
low as $99 off contract. It's the same story with the iPhone 6. While some places have it listed for 300 or even as much as $450, I was able to pick this
one up for only 200. The iPhone SE is also available for cheap. So, while it still cost $400
unlocked straight from Apple, I was able to pick this
one up for only 160. The prices are definitely going to vary depending on what sales are going on and the big downside is that these are all going to be locked to a prepaid carrier but I'm curious, what kind of iPhone are
you getting for $200? To start with, we have the iPhone SE. Even though this is a little
bit of an older design, this is actually a pretty new phone, it only came out about a year ago. What's cool with this is it's actually not even a base model, so this guy's going to be
rocking 32 gigs of storage. The unboxing experience
is pretty straightforward. So, not only do we have our Apple stickers and paperwork right here, there's also going to be the
old-school Apple EarPods, we have our USB power adapter, as well as a Lightning cable. Put it side by side with the iPhone 5S and the SE looks very, very similar. So, what you're getting here
is a pretty small phone. Now, to be fair, it's kind
of rare to actually get a decently specced small phone these days, but it's small. It's definitely really small. It still feels premium though. So, not only do we have
the chamfered edges as well as the nice
metal and glass design, but most importantly than
that, it feels sturdy and that's not something
that you can always say about budget phones. Moving over to the iPhone
6, just like the SE, we're going to be getting
a 32 gigabyte phone which is going to make
this a lot more usable. With the iPhone 6, we're
getting something that's basically the same design
as the current iPhone 7. So, while things have been
tweaked just a little bit in the last couple
years, for the most part, you're really not gonna
be missing out on much. Arguably, there are actually
some design improvements here. So, not only does the iPhone 6 still have the physical home button, but it also does still
have a headphone jack. You're getting some
nice upgrades with a 6, most notably, Apple Pay support. So, this is actually something I use on pretty much a daily basis. You're also getting a much
larger 4.7 inch display compared to the smaller four
inch panel on the others. So, while this is still a little bit small by most flagship standards today, it feels a lot more usable. The specs are pretty interesting. So, the iPhone 5S is
the oldest phone here, it is rocking an Apple A7 processor with one gigabyte of RAM. Whereas the iPhone 6 has the Apple A8 and the iPhone SE has the newest Apple A9 with a full two gigabytes of memory. All three feel reasonably snappy but the 5S is starting
to show its age a bit. With only one gigabyte of RAM, it does get a touch slow sometimes when you're doing a lot of multitasking, but it really is not bad. It's the same story with the iPhone 6. In real use, it feels almost
the exact same as the 5S and a lot of it does have
to do with the fact that it also runs one gigabyte of RAM. On the other hand, the
iPhone SE is super quick. So, it has the same
specs as the iPhone 6S, which absolutely puts it on par with a lot of current flagships. To put things in perspective, all three iPhones are going
to be more powerful than a budget option like the Moto G4 but it really is the iPhone
SE that takes the win here. All three are up to date on iOS 10 and they're all getting the
iOS 11 update later this year. That's especially impressive
when you look at the iPhone 5S which came out all the way back in 2013. I've gotta give big props to Apple for supporting a phone
like this for five years. Pretty much no one else does that. The biggest issue is just
the smaller screen sizes on the 5S and the SE. You know, I get it, a lot of people do like a smaller phone, but as far as I'm concerned, it just feels a little
bit small and cramped. To be fair, you're not really
losing any functionality, everything is just a little
bit smaller than usual. But if you're used to a bigger phone, these are gonna get a little
bit hard to get used to. When it comes to cameras,
the iPhone 5S and 6 have a very similar looking
eight megapixel camera, whereas the SE bumps
that up to 12 megapixels thanks to the iPhone 6S, which it basically stole
all its parts from. First, we have the 5S. This was probably the best
camera on a smartphone when it came out but today, that's actually not bad. The dynamic range is not quite there, but this is a really,
really difficult shot. These all look pretty nice. So, I'd have to give a
slight edge to the SE here, but really, I would be happy
with any of these phones. While smartphones have
definitely advanced a lot over the last few years, what's impressive is just how decent these iPhones feel to use
even though they're three, even four years old. What's really impressive
is the camera on the SE. While it's about a year old at this point, it really is only topped by
flagships like the Galaxy S8 and the iPhone 7. Video on the SE also looks nice. So, it shoots in full 4K and while it might not be a RED, the stabilization means that
it actually looks really nice. The iPhone 5S hides its
age surprisingly well. For just a little bit more and less than half the price
it was when it launched, I think the iPhone SE
is an obvious upgrade. But only if you're down
with a smaller phone. Which leaves us with the iPhone 6. While it might not be the most
powerful phone in the world, I think the larger size
more than makes up for that. So, would you guys pick up a $200 iPhone? And if so, which one would it be? Let me know in the comments below and I'll catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. It's been a while, but I'm officially back with a brand new gaming PC build. Meet the Photon 4.0. The last year has been a
really, really rough one for building a computer. Thanks to cryptomining, it
has been incredibly difficult to get your hands on graphics cards, especially the ones that
most people wanna put in game builds. When you can find them,
they're incredibly expensive. More often than not,
they're just going to be completely out of stock. Then, to make things even worse, other components have also
been driven up in price. So high-end power supplies are
really expensive right now, and memory is especially bad,
with a lot of prices going for about double the price
that they were last year. Put all of this together, and
it has been really difficult to recommend any kind of new build. Well, at least until now. Thankfully, that changes
today with the launch of AMD's new Ryzen processors
with Vega graphics. No, this is not a sponsored video. However, AMD did send
out a little press kit including both Ryzen 3 as well as Ryzen 5. I mean, Ryzen 3 and Ryzen 5. (laughs) The Ryzen 3 2200G is going to give you four Ryzen CPU cores that
can clock up to 3.7GHz, as well as eight Vega GPU cores. Very similar to the Ryzen mobile laptop that I recently reviewed. At only $100, this guy looks to be a pretty good performance bargain, especially considering that
with those kind of specs, some games are going to
be playable even at 1080p. However, for this build, we're going to be going with the Ryzen 5 2400G. This adds hyperthreading
to the quad-core processor, bringing the thread count up to eight, and you're also going to
be getting a clock speed of nearly 4GHz. Almost more importantly for gaming, the Vega GPU cores have been bumped up from 8 to 11 on this guy. This does come with a
heftier $170 price tag, which, in context, makes Ryzen 3 look like a pretty good deal. However, because this
build, we're going to go a little bit higher-end, we decided to go with the Ryzen 5 2400G. For the rest of the build,
we're using 16 gigabytes of G.SKILL Flare X DDR4 memory. With a super fast 3200MHz clock speed, this is specifically
meant to work with Ryzen, and that extra power is
going to be super helpful if you have a Ryzen APU. However, at a price on Amazon right now of over $260, this is
probably not the best idea to pair with your $170 processor. (laughs) Instead, I detuned this
memory to run at 2666MHz to simulate running a much more reasonable $100 HyperX FURY X kit,
which is going to have eight gigs of RAM. I will say, though, that if
you're looking to pick up a Ryzen with Vega chip, make
sure that at the very least you get some reasonably
fast dual-channel memory. Those graphics definitely
need some memory to be fed. At this point, it's hard not to notice our slightly unusual case pick. So this is the Thermaltake Core P1. It's a little different than
what we usually do here, especially for budget builds. With a solid piece of
tempered glass up front, it looks really nice. Of course, it's not going to
be the most practical system, with the entire sides being open. However, it does mean that you have a lot of different mounting options, including on the feet. You can even put this on a wall. Now, because we're using a Ryzen APU, there's actually plenty of space here because we're not installing
the graphics card. However, if you do wanna do that, there is an included riser cable where you can just drop it in. So, for example, if
you wanna upgrade later down the road, you're set. For the motherboard, we're
using the MSI B350 Pro AC. This actually isn't out
yet, so I don't have the final price, but it is a
pretty loaded little board. So in addition to full
support for a Ryzen APU, including overclocking,
you're also getting RGB, you have Intel Wi-Fi built in, and there's also a full-size DisplayPort, which means that,
especially for a B350 board, you're getting a lot of features. Storage is being handled
by a 500GB WD Blue SSD. Now I've used these in
a few previous builds, and I like the price to reliability. However, one of the nice
things about this guy is it is available in an M.2 form factor, which, especially for a
clean build like this, means that we can actually
stick it on the back of the motherboard to make
the cabling even nicer. Even though the power
supply, as you guys will see, leaves a little bit to be desired. For that power supply, we're using a 500-watt EVGA Bronze unit. There's nothing really wrong with it. I've used a lot of these in builds. They're gonna last a while,
and they're fairly quiet. However, it's not a modular supply, which, even though it
is a little bit cheaper, means that your cabling is going to be a little bit challenged in this guy. Thankfully, though,
especially on the back side of this Thermaltake case,
there's a fair bit of room to be able to run some stuff. Maybe not the cleanest thing in the world. It'll work. With a system like this,
especially if you're going with a Ryzen APU, a game
that a lot of people are probably going to
want to play is CS:GO. Now here, with high
settings at 1080p, as I die, we're getting a pretty respectable 50 to 60 frames per second. One of the nice things
is, because we are using a FreeSync high refresh rate monitor, if we do wanna turn the
graphics settings down to something like medium,
we could, in theory, take advantage of that
full 120Hz refresh rate. This is a bad idea. How do I do this? Moving over to Rocket League,
another game that I think a lot of people would play
on a system like this, we're getting high
quality settings at 1080p with a pretty solid framerate
of between 40 to 50. Just like CS:GO, if you do like that higher framerate over... Oh, come on. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it. Yeah. If you do wanna get that higher framerate, all you need to do is just crank the graphics settings down a little bit, and you can easily get well over 60 in pretty much all of these games. Oh, that was not good. It's funny, I've done a lot of videos on super budget systems lately. It's nice to see what
Rocket League looks like when you actually crank
the graphics up. (laughs) I'm on low all the time,
trying to get it to run on $200 laptops. Moving on, we have Grand Theft Auto V. Now here, running on
normal settings at 1080p, we're between 40 to 50 frames per second. Not the smoothest thing
in the world, but GTA V, even for an older game,
does run reasonably well. However, what I'm really curious about is how Ryzen, especially
with those Vega GPU cores, are going to handle a more modern game. When it comes to
Middle-earth: Shadow of War, we're dealing with a
much more demanding game. So here, at 720p on medium settings, we're getting between 35
to 40 frames per second. It's totally playable, but
when you get into those newer AAA titles,
the graphics settings are definitely gonna have to come down. So, how does Ryzen with Vega stack up? For the most part, pretty well. You're getting a solid CPU,
along with decent graphics. If you're only doing lighter
titles, it's totally fine, but if you wanna get into
more hardcore gaming, at some point, you probably do wanna add a graphics card to this guy. With the Photon 4.0 itself, there is a lot of room for expansion. So you already have the really cool case, but there's lots of room in
here to add that liquid cooling, to overclock your processor,
add a graphics card, more drives. The sky's pretty much the limit. Considering where the PC market is today, I'm pretty happy with how
the Photon 4.0 came out. It's a unique-looking system
that won't break the bank. So as always, links to check
out all the parts you guys need to build this will be in the description. Something else you might wanna check out is my 2018 gaming PC tutorial,
where I show how to build everything here, although in
a slightly different case. So, feel free to go
check that out over here, and I will catch you guys in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin, and welcome to another
very special edition of Mystery Tech. This time taking a look at some very special items that Ken has gotten us that cost under $200. Protection case for N3, (laughing) wait a minute, wait a minute. Is this legitimately just like an iPod? Okay. I have so many questions. Why would someone wanna buy something like this when smartphones are getting better and better audio? Stuff like the LG V30 has an amazing headphone amp and you know, it does more than just listen to music. Now let me let you in on a little secret. Because Ken picks the
products for these videos, I'm almost positive that he gets stuff that he wants to take after the video. All of the instructions are in Chinese. This is not helpful. So I guess this must
be reasonably popular, if they actually sell
dedicated accessories for it. And I've gotta say, this leather case that's a lot nicer than the little silicone one that it comes with. Never be the same again? What? Nope. Oh, it's all in Chinese. Wait. How do you even ... It's not a touch screen, is it? No. Okay. So loud. This thing pushes some serious power. Wow. Okay. It sounds good with the
actual headphone jack, but honestly, it's not a huge difference versus using AptX or Bluetooth. Alright Ken, I think you
actually did a good job. TheiaPro? What? Is this Google Glass? Alright, we'll see what we got here. Oh wow, those are ... (laughing) Are you serious? For context, this is what normal human people glasses look like. And this, this ... It even has plastic lenses for no reason. Oh, is that a camera on your face? No. What? What camera? These are my normal everyday glasses. Oh wait, oh it folds, it folds. That's a look right there. That... that's a look. Oh, wait, wait, wait, hold on, there's even more. So because this is just literally
a giant chunk of plastic that sits on the side of your face, they helpfully include
a tiny little cushion so that it doesn't rub your skin off. So to take a picture, I
need to double short press. Let's try the amazing image quality. I have no idea if it's doing anything. Did I just take a picture? Alright, you ready? So I'm gonna... Alright, did it flash a bunch?
- [Ken] Oh yeah. [Austin]- Oh it did. Okay.
[Ken]- Just now. [Austin]- We're recording. So this is what the quality
looks like on the ThetaPro, oh sorry, TheiaPro. Apparently it's supposed to give you a whole new world of point
of view recording devices. So, yeah. Ken, if you tell me that
this device was $200. - 78. - $78? - Yes. - Okay, I feel slightly less terrible that you wasted all of our money on (laughs) on this. A Jitterbug! (laughs loudly) It is the one and only Jitterbug Smart. Oh, man. All new easy to use smartphone with an all new larger screen. It actually is a kind of big phone but I will say a little cheap feeling might be a decent way of putting this. It does have a SIM card in it, at least. Oh, interesting this is an
Alcatel OneTouch phone. Oh, there you go! Powered by Android. (intense music) (phone dings) There we go. It finally did something. Welcome to your new Jitterbug Smart! Tap here to get started. Alright. Oh, do we want to use Advanced Android or Easy-to-use Jitterbug? We're clearly not good
enough for Advanced Android. Give me some Easy-to-use Jitterbug action. There are two ways to activate your phone. Call us to activate or you
can activate it online. - [Alma] Thank you for calling Greatcall, my name is Alma. May I have your first and
your last name please. - Yes, this is Austin Evans. - Is this a new device,
Austin, or a replacement? - This is a new device. - Okay, and then for you
or for somebody else? - This is for my dad. - His name is? - Ken. - Why did you decide
to purchase this device for your father? - He just doesn't have a smartphone. - Do you think he's gonna be more than 25 texts in one month? - I don't believe so. - You're all set have a wonderful day. Thank you so much for calling Greatcall. - Thank you very much. They just charged me twice for that. Alright, so we just spent
$80 on activation fees for a phone that's gonna be
activated in two hours. I hope you're happy, Dad. I hope you're real excited
about your new phone that's gonna charge me $80
plus another $30 a month. Oh, it's not activated. They're not kidding you. You actually do need to wait
two hours to activate it. So, because apparently it
takes twelve hours to charge my brand new phone and
wait for it to activate, the full Jitterbug Touch
experience might just have to wait for another video. Alright, next item. Digital Home Karaoke? (laughs loudly) Well, okay then. I think it's time for some karaoke. So, what did you guys think
about the $200 tech video? Let us know in the comments below. And if you hated everything
you can blame Ken, because it's all his fault. Anyway, thank you guys
so much for watching and I'm gonna go play some karaoke now! 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is a 188 dollar laptop,
and I'm about to give you five reasons why you should pick one up. Starting off at number
one, we have the price. At 188 dollars, the HP
Stream is one of the cheapest Windows laptops that you
can buy brand new today. Now, I took at look at the
HP Stream a couple years ago, the original model, and it
was good but it had a lot of compromises. However, over the last couple years, while keeping that price
low, they've actually done a fair bit to make it a better laptop. Recently, I did a video
on a 200 dollar MacBook that I picked up off of eBay. Now it was a good system,
however it is not for the faint of heart. Now, not only is it going
to be nearly ten years old, but there is no warranty and no guarantee that it's ever going to get updates. At least with the HP Stream,
you know that if something goes wrong, you can just
go yell at HP about it. To really put the 188 dollar
price tag into context, you could pick up 15 of
these HP Streams for less than the price of a mid
spec 15 inch MacBook Pro. Now obviously, the MacBook
is going to be a better laptop. When you consider just
how much this is able to do, for so much less,
it starts to make sense for a lot of people. And that brings us to reason number two. This is really all that you need. And sure, some people
do have specific things they have to do with their laptops, but a lot of people are rocking a thousand dollar MacBook
Air in their backpack, and doing nothing besides watching videos and typing some docs
or emails or whatever. And it just so happens that
the HP Stream will also do that, for less than
a fifth of the price. So, no, you should not buy
the HP Stream if you plan on doing hardcore gaming, or
any kind of video editing. However, if you're doing lighter
stuff like most people do, web browsing, watching
video, playing games, you know, on Facebook, wait, do people still
play games on Facebook? - [Offscreen Voice] Yes. - Okay, well if you're
doing any of that stuff, the HP Stream is going to be totally fine. It's also still a full
fledged Windows computer, so unlike a Chromebook,
you have all the advantages of running a complete copy of Windows 10, as well as all the disadvantages
of running a complete copy of Windows 10. This gives you the freedom
of using incredibly advanced technology like not Google
Chrome, you can install heavy apps, such as Photoshop, if you have a lot of patience, and you're going
to get access to the full library of thousands and
thousands of Windows apps that have been created over the years. Number three is the hardware. Now when you hear the
words, 188 dollar laptop, it probably doesn't fill
you with confidence. But the Stream is, well,
actually not that bad. Take the keyboard, for example. On a lot of ultra cheap laptops,
it definitely feels cheap, and while it isn't on
the most premium side for the Stream, it has a
little bit of clickiness that does feel pretty nice. The trackpad also isn't too
bad, and that follows through with the rest of the chassis. Sure, it's all made of
plastic, at this price point, you shouldn't expect anything else, but there's no real flex
besides a little bit with the screen, and the overall
hardware feels pretty decent, especially
considering how light it is. It's definitely not fancy,
but you have all the basics, including three USB ports,
HDMI, a headphone jack, as well as an SD card
reader, which is important for something that I'll
get into in just a second. One of the biggest
downsides is the screen. So, with a 14 inch 1366 by 768 panel, it was never going to be the
sharpest thing in the world, but what really lets it
down is the fact that it is a thoroughly average TN panel. Color accuracy isn't great,
the brightness could be better, but that being said, for 188 dollars, it is going to be usable. Reason number four is the performance. It exists. So at 188 dollars, you
should expect this to be a blistering fast PC,
and surprise, surprise, blistering fast, it is not. Inside, you're getting a dual
core Intel Celeron processor four gigabytes of RAM, as well
as a massive 32 gigabytes of flash storage. Nothing is what I would call
snappy, but at least it works, and a big part of that is
because this guy has four gigs of RAM, unlike earlier
versions, which only had two. As you can imagine, Windows
computers really aren't that happy with only two gigabytes of RAM, especially with certain apps. (coughs) Chrome. (coughs) Sorry, cough, I don't know what that was. The processor is decent
enough for basic tasks. So because it is so low
powered, you actually don't need a fan inside the Stream,
which at least does make it completely silent. One of the bigger issues is
that 32 gigabytes of storage though. Now, yes, you can get Windows
on 32 gigs of storage, but install more than a couple apps, it's going to fill up quickly. Thankfully, though, that
full sized SD card reader actually does come in handy. Put something like a 128 gig
card, for about 40 dollars, and you actually should
be pretty well set. Reason number five is that it's practical. So you think of a lot of
the things that will make a good laptop good,
the HP Stream has them. I mean, some of them, at least. Battery life is a big one. So with a 41 watt hour
battery, while that may not be impressive for a lot of
laptops, this has such power sipping internals, that
even when you're completely cranking it at 100 percent,
you're going to be getting decent battery life. And for normal usage, you're
looking at around 10 hours. You're also getting
some surprising features at the price point, including
2x2 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Now yes, this is not going to
be as reliant on the internet as something like a Chromebook, but you still think about
it, it's called the HP Stream for a reason, and most of
the time, you're going to be online, so it's nice
that it has solid Wi-Fi. The HP Stream is definitely
not for everyone, but I'm continuously impressed
with just how much you're able to get for so little. So, I'm curious, what do you
guys think of ultra cheap laptops, like the Stream? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. And today I'm going to
compare what are arguably two of the most important
tablets out right now. The brand new iPad Pro
versus the Surface Pro. This might seem like a weird comparison but they line up surprisingly well. Not even counting that they came out within like a couple
of days of each other. So to start with, we have the 2017 version
of the Surface Pro. So they actually hooked us up
with the review unit early, which is funny because it has "Not packaged for retail sale" on the box. But I'm going to unbox it
anyway because that's what I do. So, the Surface Pro as
far as hardware wise should be very very similar
to the Surface Pro 4. They've made a couple of small tweaks, mostly like smoothing
out corners and what not. But the hardware itself and the dimensions are pretty much unchanged. Inside we had what should
be the power adaptor. So if you saw our Surface laptop video you'll know that not only is the adaptor
magnetic which is kind of cool but it also has a USB port on it. Next, we have the iPad Pro 12.9 inch. Again another new product. And again something that actually
really hasn't changed much since the previous generation,
at least on the outside. Inside here we have yet again, pretty straightforward. So this is the actual
iPad itself in silver. We also have the Lighting
cable, some Apple paperwork, as well as the very very
small power adapter. The problem is this is
a tiny 12-watt adapter, so compared to the 44-watt power cable for the actual Surface this takes forever to
charge a big iPad like this. It still always surprise me a little bit when I touch one of these iPads because it is just so huge. I mean, look at this, this is an iPad. I feel like it's a... Actually is it bigger than the Surface? Oh yeah. The Surface is actually
smaller than the iPad. Which I guess makes sense, it's a 12.3 versus a
12.9 inch display but... Wow. One area where the Surface
definitely does have an advantage is with ports. So again like the Surface laptop we have the magnetic Surface connector which can be used not only to power it but also for the dock. We also have a full-sized USB 3.0 port, mini display, there's also a
headphone jack on this side. If you pop open the
kickstand inside of here is a tiny little microSD card slot. The iPad has a Lighting
connector and a headphone jack. So for basic tablet use this is fine. When it comes to say
connecting a USB device or wanting to use a second display the Surface wins hands down. Something else going for the
Surface is the kickstand. It's not only will it stand up by itself right out of the box but the kickstand's also very adjustable. So it will go pretty much all the way flat and you bring it up. And it will stop anywhere along the way. It does add a lot of flexibility. With the iPad you pretty much have to have a cover or a keyboard to get
it to stand up by itself. That is where the
Smart Keyboard comes in. So like earlier versions
all it does is just snap on with magnets to the side of the iPad, and then once you fold it out you get yourself a pretty decent keyboard that's going to be attached to the iPad. So not only does the iPad now support quite a few different keyboard shortcuts, so I can open up something like Spotlight, I can actually command tab
to go between different apps, and the keyboard itself
is pretty much full-sized and it feels decent to type on. The issue is, there's very little travel. It really does not measure up to something like a
proper laptop keyboard. By comparison, the Surface
type cover feels a lot better. This has actual key travel, so that actually makes a big difference. And not only this is full
layout with back lighting which the iPad is not, but
it also has a trackpad. So well, yes, the trackpad
is not super necessary on something with a touchscreen. I find I use the touchscreen about like 80% of the time or so, but sometimes it's nice
to be able to reach down and just be able to
mouse over to something. The issue is that neither of these actually come with their keyboards. So the Type Cover for the
Surface is going to run you 130 or a 160 for this Alcantara version. And this Smart Keyboard
for the iPad Pro is $170. Which is a shame because you
really do need the keyboards to get the most out of these devices. One area you can't complain
about with these tablets are the displays. So the Surface Pro is
rocking a 12.3 inch panel with a resolution of 2736x1824. This PixelSense display looks phenomenal. No one looking at the Surface display is going to be disappointed, but the issue is the iPad
screen is just better. Not only does the iPad have
a bigger 12.9 inch display with a resolution of 2732x2048, but it also has some cool
features such as True Tone to adjust the white balance depending on what room you're in. It gets really bright with
600 nits of brightness. But what blows all that away is ProMotion. What that means is that the iPad Pro has a 120 hertz refresh rate display. Now that's something that you find on stuff like high end game monitors, and it looks awesome in person. So in video it's a
little bit harder to show but the animations are incredibly fluid. And also more important than that it feels super super responsive. Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Fairphone 2 and it is a fully modular smartphone. The speakers on the iPad
Pro are also top notch. So it actually has four speakers, so there's going to be one each corner and combined, it sounds
better than a lot of laptops. Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Fairphone 2 and it is a fully modular smartphone. The Surface actually does
sound pretty good as well, so it has two front facing speakers. But compared to the iPad
it's just not as loud. All models of the iPad Pro
now come with the Apple A10X. This is monster of a processor, with six cores, three performance
and three low power cores paired with four gigabytes
of RAM is a lot for an iPad. The Surface comes with quite a
few different configurations. So not only can you get
it with the Core m3, i5 or i7 processor but it also has four, eight, and 16 gigabyte RAM options. Both the Core m3 and i5 models are going to be fanless
just like the iPad. But regardless of which
Surface you pick up they're all going to be dual core chips based on the new Intel Kaby Lake process. Now that's cool, but on paper the iPad has
a big core count advantage. Run them through Geekbench
and results are surprising. So not only is the iPad faster when you consider single core scores, but on the multithreaded side it is significantly
faster than the Surface. Now this is a Core i5 processor,
not even the base model, and yet the iPad Pro is still faster. That is impressive. Also Intel is probably
really scared right now. All the power in the
world doesn't mean much without software to take advantage of it. So the iPad Pro ships with iOS 10. Though it is not bad, things like Split View
really make multitasking a lot more doable on the iPad. However, what's really going
to change things is iOS 11. So at first glance it looks fairly similar but just like my wardrobe change there's a lot going on under the hood. So say I'm web browsing and I
want to pull up the file menu, all I do is swipe up
from the bottom, tap it, and then drag it off to the side and I get my normal split view which I can then just
readjust if I'd like. Or if I want I can shrink it back down, and if I pull down from the top it becomes a floating window. So I'm still being able
to scroll on Safari but I can also just
toss this up to the side and do whatever I need to get done. This way you can get up to
three apps on screen at once. Now it's not perfect. This is the very first beta, things are not quite as
smooth as they could be, but this goes a long way in making the iPad feel a lot more usable. On the other hand, the Surface of course is
running Windows 10 Pro. Now Windows 10 has actually
seen some pretty major upgrades over the last couple of years, but I've got to say I'm impressed with how much you can do
on the iPad with iOS 11. One area where I have no
complaints is with battery life. So the iPad Pro like
pretty much every iPad ever is quoted at 10 hours of battery life. Whereas the Surface actually can go all the way up to 13 hours. Regardless, you should
easily be able to take these for a full day of use
without needing the charger. Both also have solid stylus support. So the Surface Pro has
an all new Surface Pen which is supposedly a lot faster. And when I tried it recently, it actually does feel pretty solid. However, the Apple Pencil
on the new iPad Pro is stupid fast. It really does feel nearly one to one. The Surface Pro is
definitely the safe choice. It's a great Windows PC that
just happens to be a tablet. The iPad has a terrific
display, it's super fast, and iOS 11 is actually pretty good, but it might not be for everyone. So what do you guys think
about these tablets? Which one you would pick up? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. This might be the ultimate gaming monitor. (upbeat music) Big shout out to LG for
sponsoring this video. So we're actually doing
something really cool together soon, but I'll
talk about that later. So if you guys have been
watching the channel for a while you know I do a lot of gaming PC videos, but what I don't do is
cover a lot of monitors, which is where this
comes in, the LG 34UC89G. Because product names. Now comes the fun part of trying to unbox a monitor that's as big as I am. You know what, I'm actually, let's just tear it open, that
sounds like a way better idea. (laughs) Watch I like drop the monitor
trying to be careful with it. You know, actually, this is a lot lighter than I thought it was gonna be. Also putting a lot of trust in this to not fall and break right now. This isn't right at all, what am I do -- Whoa!
(laughs) I just saw my life flash before my eyes. I should probably screw
it in with these screws on the bottom of this,
probably a good idea. - [Ken] No. - I almost pulled a Linus on that one. So with one disaster averted,
we have the display itself. Now this is going to be a 34 inch display, and it's actually one of the best reasons why I like to use UltraWide
monitors for gaming. With such a big panel,
especially when it's curved like this one, it does really give you a nice immersive experience. So let's just show ports real quick, and then we'll cut and get the PC. (high pitched tone) - [Man] Ken. - Hm? How bad was it? Ah, alright, cool! For ports around back,
we have a DisplayPort, HDMI, as well as two USB 3.0
which can be used as a hub. This guy is rocking a 34 inch IPS display with a resolution of 2560 by 1080. Now while that resolution isn't too crazy, what you're getting here is some seriously high refresh rates. Out of the box, it's running at 144 hertz, however you can actually
overclock it to 166 hertz. Now that combined with
G-SYNC support means that this is going to be a
really smooth experience. But if you're running AMD graphics, there's also going to be a
FreeSync version of this monitor which happens to also
be a fair bit cheaper. The panel supports 99%
of the sRGB color space, which makes it suitable for stuff like photo and video editing, however for me the resolution's going to be a little bit low for this. It is really meant as a gaming monitor. Before we get started, we might as well overclock the monitor because it literally takes like 10 seconds. All you do is reach
underneath, pull up the menu, which all LG monitors
make this pretty simple with the little nub on the bottom. And what you do is turn on the overclock. It will tell that the
monitor needs to reboot and then it should be good. Then all you need to do is go in to the Nvidia control panel,
make sure G-SYNC is enabled, and select your refresh
rate at a crispy 166 hertz. So first we have DiRT 4. Now not only is this a really fun game, but I think one of the nice
things about it is that with this cockpit view, it really does make the UltraWide look nice. So on ultra settings here
we're getting anywhere between like 90 to 100
frames per second right now, and with G-SYNC it looks
super super smooth. While the resolution of the display is a little bit low,
it is difficult to run even 2560 by 1080 at a
super high frame rate. So right now with a Core
i7 and a GTX 1080 Ti, I'm still only getting
about 90 frames per second. Personally for me I prefer
a smoother frame rate with slightly lower
graphics versus something that might look a little bit better, but is not going to run
anywhere near as smoothly. Next we have a game that can definitely take advantage of a
high frame rate, CS:GO. Now, here with everything cranked up, we're getting between 200
to 300 frames per second, which is definitely enough to fully keep this monitor running at 166 hertz, and yeah, it looks pretty good. Now I am by no means any good at CS:GO, but even I can tell how much
of a difference it makes having such a high refresh rate. Now I know a lot of people like to play this game at a super high frame rate even though the monitor can't handle it to keep input latency
down, but especially when you pair it with 166 hertz, it looks nice. Although it's probably not enough to keep me from getting killed. Or maybe it is. Now there are some special
features with the monitor, and one of them is black stabilizer. So once you go into the
options and turn this on, so say I'm in this dark
area and I can't quite see someone hiding in the shadows. Essentially what this is doing is it's bringing up all of the contrasts so it makes it a lot easier
to see anyone who's hiding, but it still doesn't affect
the rest of the image. If you want to get a little sneaky, you can also enable a
Crosshair in the monitor. So if you say you want to do that and not pull up your scope, it makes that a little bit easier. Oh! Oh, did you see that? If you guys want a
chance to potentially win not only one of these monitors but also a whole lot more,
LG is doing their third UltraWide Festival, and this year, Linus and I are going to be hosting it. For 2017, it's all focused
around this UltraWide monitor, but the grand prize is going to get a gaming setup worth $10,000. To enter, submit a video
that's 144 seconds or less explaining why you need
the new UltraWide display. Now in the video, make sure
to not only include your face, but also your current gaming PC. Then just post your video on YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram
using these hashtags, and then submit it at the
link in the description. 50 finalists will win
a $50 Steam gift card and the chance to come up to Canada, hang out with Linus and I, and potentially win that giant setup. So the contest will be running from August 14th to 23rd, so good luck. So what do you guys think
about the UltraWide display? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Any other year and this phone
would be called the iPhone 7s. It has a new design with a
glass back, upgraded cameras, faster internals, and even a new feature in wireless charging. And yet, all of this is under
the shadow of the upcoming iPhone X, which really
does beg the question, why does the iPhone 8 exist? Of course, plenty of
companies have a wide variety of phones to choose from,
ranging from budget options all the way to the incredibly
expensive, and surprisingly, Apple is actually no exception this year. You have options ranging all
the way from the $350 iPhone SE to the $450 iPhone 6s, the $550 iPhone 7. Of course you've got the $700
iPhone 8, as well as all way up into the top of the
range, the $1,000 iPhone X. The issue is that Samsung
has already been shipping a truly next generation-feeling
piece of hardware with the Galaxy S8. Not only is it going to cost
you about the same amount as the iPhone 8, but it's been
shipping for the better part of a year already. In a vacuum, the iPhone 8
is a nice design, however, when you put it side by
side with the Galaxy S8, that iPhone really does look
a lot less like a brand-new 2017 flagship, and a lot
more like a 2014 iPhone 6. Apple has made some small
improvements to the iPhone 8, most notably including
their True Tone tech. So this is borrowed from
the iPad, and it adjusts the white balance of the
display to better suit the environment that you're in. It's a cool feature, and
of the course the iPhone still has a solid IPS display. When you put it side by
side with the Galaxy S8, it is absolutely no contest. The AMOLED display of the S8
not only has far better color, brightness, and especially contrast, but the Infinity display means
that not only does it have curved edges, but essentially
no bezel on top and bottom of the phone, either. This is pretty much the
approach that Apple is taking with the iPhone X, and I
would actually argue that they're taking it even farther. So yes, you do have to
deal with the notch, but in exchange, the rest
of the phone is pretty much entirely screen. There is essentially no bezels in sight. The only issue is, is that
the iPhone X costs a whopping $300 more than both the S8
as well as the iPhone 8. It's not all bad, though. The iPhone 8 shares a
lot of specs with the X, including very, very similar cameras. So paired with better
processing and new sensors, this is actually a surprisingly
big leap over the previous generation of iPhones. It brings it a lot closer
to stuff like the Galaxy S8, as well as the Pixel, especially
when you consider just how much detail you're able
to get in a single image. (laughing) You want to be in the video? This is like actually perfect. This is the iPhone 8. - Is that the iPhone 8? - It's the iPhone 8 right now. What are you guys' names? - I'm Davey. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Dayna. - I guess there's a little
occasion going on today, or something? - We just got married. - Congratulations! - Can I take some pictures with this? - Yeah. - Alright, let's do it. - Alright, ready, and (clicks)
that looks really good. (laughing) Alright, let me try
some portrait mode here. That's pretty nice, right? - [Davey] That's awesome. - [Dayna] Oooh! - It messed up a little bit
with the veil, but that's pretty nice. - Yeah, that's pretty good. - That's super good. - Video on the 8 is really impressive. It's second to only maybe the LG V30. So the stabilization works
really well, especially when you're hand-held, and you
do have some new 4K shooting modes, including 4K 24, which
I'm actually a big fan of, but you also can shoot
at a pretty impressive 4K 60 frames per second. We're also getting an upgraded
240 frame per second mode and a full 1080p. So the last iPhone could
do 240, but it was at 720p, and honestly, it was pretty grainy. With the iPhone 8, you're
getting surprisingly usable footage, especially when you
slow it down by 10 times, some of the results can
actually look surprisingly good. You're also getting the
Apple A11 Bionic chip. Now I'll spare you all
the technical details, but both the iPhone 8,
as well as the iPhone X, which share the same
spec, are very, very fast. Put the iPhone 8 side by
side with not only the 7, but also the Galaxy S8,
as well as the Note 8, you'll see that the iPhone
8 is hands down the fastest phone out right now in Geekbench. It's a similar story on the
graphics side with GFXBench, although here it's less of a
runaway victory, but the iPhone still does win out. It's impressive enough that
I slightly lost my mind and compared it to the PlayStation 4. You guys can check that
video out if you want to see how they stack up, but suffice it to say the iPhone is very, very fast. It's not perfect, though. While the glass back doesn't
get as warm under extended gaming, like the iPhone 7
did, when you compare it side by side with the Galaxy
S8, as well as the Note 8, you will see that the
iPhone 8 does exhibit some thermal throttling. In actual use, though, the
iPhone 8 is incredibly snappy, and that should be
shared with the iPhone X. That is a surprisingly
common thread between the 8 and the X. Not only do they both
support wireless charging, but they also have fast charging via a USB-C Lightning cable,
which my friend Danny Winget tested, and it actually
stacks up fairly well compared to a lot of other Android flagships. You're also getting the
same IP67 water resistance on both the 8 as well as the X. Now I don't have a X in to
test just yet, but I can say that the iPhone 8
speakers sound phenomenal. It's the same basic stereo
design from the iPhone 7. It's much louder, much
richer, it really does put not only other Android phones
to shame, but it's really the first phone in years
that's come close to matching HTC's BoomSound. So yes, the iPhone 8 does give
up the bezelless OLED display from the X, but in return,
the X gives up TouchID. Now FaceID is interesting,
and there's no doubt that Apple's put a ton of
really interesting technology into it, but it is the only option short of using a passcode. There are tons of situations
where I would rather pull my phone out and use
TouchID on the iPhone 8, versus hold the X in front
of my face and hope that it actually unlocks. Even if it's a perfect
setup, I would still prefer to have the option of using TouchID. At first glance, the iPhone
8 seems like a weird choice in a 2017 world of super-thin
bezels, but look past the screen and everything else is there. To me, the iPhone X is
looking like a classic first-generation Apple product. It's a beautiful design, and
there's a ton of potential, but it's also really expensive,
and if the supply rumors are true, it is going to be
quite a while before it's easy to actually get your hands on one. I can understand why someone
might want to pick up an iPhone 8 today. It might not even be crazy
to skip the X altogether and wait for the next generation,
which hopefully brings the same design, but with a lower price, and hopefully stuff like
TouchID will be readded. But, what do you guys think? Should the iPhone 8 exist in 2017? Let me know in the
comments below, and I will catch you on the next one. 
- This video is sponsored by Squarespace, whether you need a domain,
online store, or website, make it with Squarespace. Hey guys, this is Austin. Recently, I did a video on this guy. A six-hundred and fifty
dollar gaming laptop entirely powered by AMD Ryzen. That got me thinking how would it stack up to
an Intel and Nvidia option. That's where this comes in. This is the Acer Aspire Five. Not only does it have Core i5
processor and MX150 graphics, but impressively, it comes
in with an even cheaper 600 dollar price tag. On paper this guy looks
very similar to the HP Envy. So we're getting a 15.6 inch display and it's actually reasonably thin considering it is a gaming laptop. I will say at first
glance, the build quality does not match up to that HP. It's all plastic. While it doesn't look bad, it sort of lacks that
premium feel of the Envy. However, what it lacks in feel it makes up for in actual functionality. Not only are we getting a
full-sized ethernet jack, but we also get USB-C, HDMI, a USB 3.0 port, as well
as an SD card reader, and on the other side we're
also getting two more USB ports. You're getting a
full-sized keyboard layout in addition to the number row. And even though most of
the laptop is plastic, it does have this metal
shell on the inside which does feel pretty
nice as a palm rest. Inside this guy has
eighth gen Core i5-8250U so it's going to be one of
the new quad core chips. You're getting those
Nvidia MX150 graphics, 8 gigabytes of dual channel DVR 4, as well as a 256 gygabyte SSD. However, all it takes is for
you to fire up the Aspire Five before you realize that there
is one major thing missing: a decent looking screen. So on paper, it's not bad. We're getting a 15.6 inch
panel with a 1080p resolution. The issue is... it is a very very unimpressive looking TN panel; Color is okay, but the contrast
is straight up terrible. And specially with the viewing angles, the screen just doesn't look that great. I get it. Acer wanted to cut some costs to be able to get this much performance in such a cheap laptop, but the screen is a little
bit tough to deal with. Thankfully though, it's not all bad. So they keyboard is classic Acer. It's not the most tactile
thing in the world but specially for gaming you're
going to be totally fine. And thankfully this guy also is using a Windows precision touch pad. I love to see these, as
they are pretty much always not only track more accurately, but specially have those
multi-touch gestures. When you put the Acer
side-by-side with the HP Envy you're going to see that this
guy has a much nicer display. Sure, it might not be quite
as bright as I would like, but compared to the TN panel
over here, it is night and day. Plus, this guy is going
to be a touch screen, it's convertible, and built quality-wise not only is this side going to be thinner but also just feels a lot more premium. One thing the Acer
definitely has going for it is upgrade-ability. So underneath a couple
of flaps on the bottom you'll see not only do you
have access to your memory if you wanna upgrade that, but over here if you
pop up this little cover you're going to see that we have full two and a half inch drive
bay that's completely empty. So if you want you can upgrade
with a bigger hard drive. We can even throw in a
second SSD in this guy. When it comes to performance, the Aspire is just in a different league. So sure, the Envy does
have that nicer screen and better build quality, but in return, you're getting not only an
SSD but you're also getting just a potent combination with the Core i5 and dedicated graphics. The i5 8250U delivers good
quad core performance. It's right up there with a lot
of higher end gaming laptops and a fair bit above the
Ryzen inside the Envy. The graphics is where
things really take off. So with an Nvidia MX150
GPU, while it might not be the most powerful graphics
card in the world, you're getting enough performance to play some pretty decent 1080p games
as you guys will soon see. And when you compare it to
the Ryzen chip inside the HP, the vague graphics are just not
going to be able to compete. However, the real test is, of course, what it's like to play
in real-world games. First off, we have CS GO. Now as a game that even though it might be a couple years old, it is still incredibly popular this is one of my favorite
ways to test PC's. And here on 1080p settings at high We're getting near 80 to
a 100 frames per second. Super super playable. (Happy music) What's not playable is
my shotgun right now. Oh, did I get it?! Did I get it?! Ohhh! The game I just got my
goal in is Rocket League. So, just like CS GO, it's not
really difficult thing to run so we're getting between
40 to 50 frames per second on high settings at 1080. And again, this is
another great example... Well that's not a good idea. Another good example of a
game that is (laughs)... it's kind of perfect
for a 600 dollar laptop. It's nice that we're getting
this kind of performance out of something that is
relatively affordable. Next up, for something a
little bit newer we have PUBG. Now, obviously we're
just in the opening area but on 1080 low we're getting
like 35 frames per second. Man, this game has come a long
way now that they don't have 300 thousand people spawning in one area. I will say one thing. Even though the screen isn't
that bad on this laptop just having to angle it down a little bit to get a better camera angle means that it looks a little
bit washed out right now. I really wish that they had spent just a little bit more
money on a nicer paneling. Man, this thing would be perfect. So yeah, 1080p low is
definitely very playable here. So we are averaging around
30 to 35 frames per second. If you wanted to really
optimize those frames you could probably go down to 720p. But with a game like PUBG I feel like on a 600 dollar laptop I'm not really complaining
about low settings. To really put this to the test, we have Middle-earth: Shadow of War. Now this is not only a
much nicer looking game, but also a more technically demanding one. And here at 1080p on low
settings we're getting right around 30 frames per second. So if it's going to be me,
I'm probably going to turn on the dynamic resolution to get that frame rate up just a little bit. But again, a very playable game. So as you guys can see, the
gaming performance is not bad. Specially given this
600 dollar price point. Something else I like is the standard SSD. Now sure, it's easy
enough to add another SSD or another hard drive if
you want some extra space but having Windows and
everything fully ready on an SSD out of the box is nice. I can't tell you how many
hours of my life I've wasted waiting for slow old laptops with normal hard drives to update. This makes everything so much faster. The Aspire Five is a seriously
killer little gaming laptop. Now this is very rare for me to say, but I don't really have
a lot to complain about. They made a lot of really smart
decisions on the components. There is a ton of
performance for 600 dollars. Really, the only thing I can
complain about is the screen. Now, no, it's not a deal breaker, but it would've been nice if they had put just a little bit of a
better display in here. However, besides that,
this is a close to perfect gaming laptop considering the budget. And you know what else is perfect? The wonderful sponsor for

- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Corsair One Pro. A $3,000 gaming PC but is it worth it? Big shout out to Corsair
for sending this out a little bit early. So the Corsair One
launched a few months ago, however, this is the new Pro
model with the GTX 1080 Ti. So, while it's not a huge
box, what we're getting here is a very powerful gaming pc. And, that is actually really small. Okay. So, one of the things
you should know about the Corsair One is that it is water cooled. Which is part of the reason
why they were able to get so much hardware in such
a uniquely shaped chassis. The footprint of the
One is actually smaller than a lot of gaming consoles. What you're trading off here is that it's just a very tall system but I think for a lot of PCs that's really not gonna be an issue. It also is pretty much
entirely made of metal. (laughs) It's so heavy. Before we get too far into it, let's see what else we have in the box. Which doesn't seem like anything at all. Yep. A power cable. (laughs) They sure give you a
lot of great accessories with your brand new $3000 gaming PC. Oh wait, hang on, hang on. I'm sorry, I was wrong. There is a dual band WiFi antenna. So, you know, solid accessory pack. So, I am really curious
to see what's inside the Corsair One. From the front you don't have a whole lot. There's basically just a power button, as well as a USB port, an HDMI, presumably to make VR setups easier. What's interesting is, both
on the left and right side, you can see that this thing
has massive radiators. I've gotta say I actually
like the look of this a lot. Of course, Corsair's made
more than their share of RGB stuff, but with this, we're getting something that's a little
bit more understated. On top you have a fairly
large metal grate with what I assume is a 200 millimeter fan, there's also this button,
which when I press it, (laughs) the whole top panel actually comes off. So it's still cabled in, here. Of course I get a new PC and I'm literally taking it apart immediately. Inside you'll find the 500 watt small form factor power supply, as well as the rear of the graphics card. So what's interesting is, it actually has all the HDMI and display
ports cables coming out of it, because obviously no one's plugging stuff into the top of the system. Move around back, and not only
do you have the power lead but also all the video outputs that are being routed
from the top of the case and also looks like it has a fairly standard looking
motherboard, here, which is also where you
plug in the WiFi antenna. As a $3000 gaming PC, you would hope that it has pretty solid specs and it most certainly does not disappoint. Now one of the nice
things about the One Pro is that it's actually
really easy to work on. So, press one button to pull off the fan as well as the shroud, take out two screws and you have access to the full system. Inside it has an Intel Core i7-7700K and what's nice about this thing is that it's going to be fully water cooled with it's own dedicated radiator. You can also get a look
at the mITX motherboard, as well as the 32 Gigabytes
of memory that's installed. Now, I really do appreciate
just how easy it is to actually work on this. It's also rocking a 480 gigabyte NVMe SSD, as well as a two terabyte hard drive. Take two more screws off the top and we get access to the graphics card. So, Corsair's going all out here. This is the GTX 1080 Ti and again is also going to have a
custom water cooler on it. Now what's interesting
about the design here is that there is gonna be a
thin 240 millimeter radiator on either side of the system. So what it's essentially
doing is it's using this 200 millimeter fan on the top to pull air up and in through the system and exhaust it out the top. Kind of like the Mac Pro. I've got to give Corsair big props. This is a very thoughtfully
designed system. But of course the big question is can it actually game? Spoiler alert. With a GTX 1080 Ti and a Core i7. To start with gaming we have GTA V. Now here running on LG
UltraWide monitor at 3840 x 1600 with basically all of
the setting cranked up, the 1080 Ti has no problem running this at anywhere between 80 to
100 frames per second. Which of course should be no surprise considering that this is
like a $750 graphics card. Now the Corsair One is
generally pretty quiet. You can hear that it's spinning up a little bit right now under full load but considering that this
is a very small form factor, water cooled PC, it's not bad. Moving on we have DiRT 4. So Codemasters always does a
good job with their pc games and this is no exception. Here running at full resolution and pretty much all the
things totally cranked up, we're anywhere between 50
to 60 frames per second. I've gotta say, with that 1080 Ti and this huge nice display, this is a really cool experience. So, Ashes of the Singularity might not be the most popular game in the world but it's one of my favorite games to benchmark new systems. So not only does it take
advantage of DirectX 12 but it looks really nice and here with basically everything cranked to highest settings, the full resolution, we're getting anywhere between
50 to 60 frames per second. A newer game that can
definitely take advantage of the Corsair One Pro is
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. Now running on the UltraWide, we're getting anywhere between
60 to 70 frames per second on high settings. Not only does this game
look great on the display but almost more importantly
it really does go to show just how nice a game can look once you have some serious 1080 Ti power. So, is it worth it? At $3000 this definitely
not a cheap system and if you wanted to build
a similar spec yourself, you'd be able to save about $600. However what you're giving up here is not only the small form factor case but almost more importantly
all the water cooling that makes it all work. It's going to be difficult to build a small form factor system
with this level of power, almost regardless of price and you also do get a two year warranty as well as the simplicity of being able to pull it out of the
box and be good to go. There are also models of the Corsair One that are a bit cheaper and
nowhere near as overkill. So if you are looking for
a small form factor system like this, I've gotta say it's
a lot better than I expected. So, what do you guys think
about the Corsair One Pro? Let me know in the comments below and I'll catch you in the next one. 
- Hey, guys, this is Austin. This is a flip phone that runs Android, and my only question, as
always, is why does it exist? So this is a Target clearance special. I was walking around the corner, I saw this for a whopping
$50, it's hard to say no. The first thing I noticed
is that this looks enormous, so actually do we have a
flip phone around here? So for some context, this is the size of a normal flip phone, you open it up, you hold it up to your
face, very normal looking. However, when you look
at it compared to this, it's like (laughs) twice as big. Hey, we are activated, alright. Let's enjoy the wonders
of our ZTE CYMBAL-T. Okay, okay, so actually you do have a keyboard on the display. Man, this is gonna be (laughs), this is very bizarre. I don't think I've ever
typed like this before. I feel like the way to actually do this is to hold it in one hand
and just do a single hand for typing, this actually
doesn't feel like the worst thing I've ever done. It's up there. So we are set up with
our Android flip phone. And at first glance,
you're actually getting the full Android experience. We have the play store, we have Google Chrome,
Gmail, even YouTube. One thing this does have is actual hard buttons for your Android keys. For example, I have my back button, I have home, I even have multitasking. Once you get going, it's not like the slowest thing I've ever tried. There is a decent quad
core processor inside. It's just a slightly
un-ergonomic experience. So the first thing to
do when you're putting a flip phone to the test is
trying to make a phone call. Jimmy? - [Jimmy] Yeah. - How do I sound? - [Jimmy] Uhhh, bad. - What do you mean bad? - [Jimmy] It's just like,
it's grainy and it's soft. And it's not very clear. - Okay, so maybe calls not
the strong suit of the phone. However, let's try texting. Hi, Jimmy. So one of the best parts is
when you have the keyboard up, it literally takes up the entire screen. I cannot even see the message
he just sent me. (laughs) It also does have a secondary display, which only actually turns on sometimes. So you can see your battery life and time. So with blisteringly sharp
three and a half inch, 320 by 480 display, I really
expect that this is going to reset my expectations for what to expect with a high end device. Let's just start by
playing this 4K HDR video. That seems reasonable. - iPhone ever, it has the biggest screen, smallest bezels, and is the first iPhone to drop the home button,
but the question is. - Man. - Is it worth it? It all starts with the design. - (laughing) It's um, you know this is one
way of watching videos. It's really crispy. I think 360p is really the sweet spot that everyone should watch
all of our videos in. As long as you crank the
brightness all the way up, you can see most of the colors, at least six or seven of them. I think it might be time
to take this thing outside and really put it through its paces. Really kinda fully explore
the outer capabilities of this performance monster. So, there's no way around it. A flip phone is never
going to be as comfortable to use as a standard smart phone. When it comes to actually
scrolling on the screen, you kinda have to hold it
in this sort of weird way. But, if you can look past that, it actually does work pretty
well as an Android phone. Take Chrome for example. Once you get into a web
page, you'll find that it's pretty much the same as any
other budget Android phone. So, loading the page is fine,
scrolling is no problem. Really the only way that you
actually notice that this is a flip phone is when you have
to hold it by the screen. Especially because it has
not only LTE as well as wifi, the experience really isn't that bad as long as you're fine looking
like this all the time. Now, you're definitely
not going to wanna play a ton of games on this thing, but you can play some
simple titles such as 2048. One of the main issues here is that a lot of games you're
going to run into issues because the screen resolution is very low, and the fact that obviously the internals aren't going to be incredibly powerful. But, for simple stuff, it
actually does kind of work. I will say that there are some things about flip phones that I did kind of miss. Number one of course, is that flip. It just sounds so nice to
be able to close it up. You can toss it in your
pocket, set it down. It's not really something
you have to worry about getting like something like a
screen scratched or whatever. There are other advantages. You do have that removable battery. You're gonna get the headphone jack, the micro SD card slot. There are things that are
actually kind of nice. However, the size of this. Once you close it up it's not that bad, but I mean even when you
compare it to something like an iPhone 10, it is really chunky. You can carry it around, but definitely not as small as the
old school flip phones. Even though it might
look like a flip phone, we are dealing with a legitimate
Android smart phone here. So, of course, one of the most important tests is the camera. The first thing I notice
is that with the camera around back here, it
is super easy to cover, but if I line it up here. I mean, that's actually not terrible. It's not exactly a super
crispy picture, but it works. Supposedly this is 720p video. Um, it actually looks okay I guess. I'm gonna walk around here a little bit. Get a nice close up. Ken looking really professional here. I mean, you know, it exists. Hopefully that's not too bad. Woah, okay well this is
an unexpected benefit. Because the phone is so big, it actually looks like
I've got a selfie stick. Huh, alright, so if I
press the center button, not my finest selfie, but
it's actually reasonably wide especially considering just how far away you can get the phone. I'm actually mildly impressed. For $50, this is not the
worst camera I've ever tried. I mean, mind you it's not
the best by any stretch, but it works. I know I made a lot of fun of this phone throughout this video, but I'm gonna say that it is a kinda cool throwback. And, especially if you're someone who's coming from a current flip phone, it might not be the worst
upgrade in the world. For most of us though,
probably time to, you know, stick with the normal smart
phone and not this monstrosity. But, I'm curious, what
do you guys think about this smart phone/flip
phone, whatever it's called? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you guys in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Today, we're going to find out how not to buy yourself a gaming PC. After years of doing custom builds I have one question. Is it possible to get a decent gaming PC from a big-box store? This is an area we've checked out before. A few months ago, we picked up a $750 pre-built system from CyberPower that actually wasn't bad. But this time, we wanted
to step up the challenge. What would happen when
we walk into a store with $600 and asked to see what they have? - Um, so I'm kind of looking for a, like, gaming PC for around $600. - This is Ken. He usually
lives behind the camera, but today he has a mission. - Immediately, the salesman
offers him a $750 CyberPower PC. You know, the one we just did a video on, and definitely not inside the $600 budget. Soon, however, another option comes up. - Oh that's, that's really good. People must really like it. Okay. - Oh wow. Okay. Do you mind if I call my dad first? - Sure
- Cool. Dad, AMD FX-4300, eight gigs of RAM, one terabyte, 7200 RPM hard drive, RX 460 - $450? - $450. - That's not crazy for $450,
but it's not really good. - Dad doesn't approve. Okay, let's uh, I guess
we'll keep looking then. See if he was my real dad
he'd get me a GTX 1080 Ti. Do you want anything? - One Starbucks excursion later, Ken was on to another big-box PC store where the halls were filled with promise. Well, if you looked hard enough at least. - Oh really. - Oh well yeah, I'd imagine. Let me actually call my dad first. Core i3-6100T 8 gigs of RAM, 1 terabyte hard drive, GTX 750 Ti. - 750 Ti? - Yeah, for $449. - That is really old system. 750Ti is like three generations old. - That's what I thought. - See that's not crazy terrible for $450, it's not going to be very good though. - Are there any other alternatives? - Yeah so, originally it was $700, and I think he's going to take off like 30 or 40 bucks because it's a floor model. So the graphics card is basically worth more than half of the
price of this computer. I'm like, that's actually not a bad deal. - All right, that
actually doesn't look bad. So, HP Pavilion, you can
see the Core i5 sticker, - Yep.
- What's the deal? - So, this is an HP Pavilion something something something something. - (laughs) Sounds about right. - A really long name. It has a Core i5, RX 480. - 480, okay. - Eight gigabytes of RAM.
- Alright. - It has a 1 terabyte hard drive, with a 128 gig M.2 SSD.
- Oooh. Okay. So how much was this? - It was $664. - That seems like a pretty good deal. So you said it's a 480, it's a Core i5. Is that Skylake, is that Kaby Lake? - Is that older?
- Uh, 6400? - So Skylake. Okay.
- Skylake, yeah. - So it's a little bit of an older system. Probably like a 2016. Why did you get a floor unit? - Because this was the only
one that they had left. Because everyone, apparently,
that was looking for-- - Oh, cryptominers. - Yeah. Everyone that was looking for those cards just swiped the computers for the cards. Probably just sold everything else. - This is a very small 480,
it also has no branding on it, so I wonder who actually made the card. A 300 watt power supply! Well it's an 80PLUS bronze unit. 300 watts actually is,
that's really low for a 480. Um, I bet it probably just barely works. Oh dude, there's a card
reader and USB-C up front? - Wait, USB-C?
- Yeah, right there. - Oh wow, I did not even see that, wow. - For like $660 this seems
like a pretty good deal, I mean you've got wifi, you've got an SSD, you've got a solid graphics card. Congratulations, you successfully defeated the big-box stores. But, I actually want to see what we can actually do with this. I bet it's actually going
to be pretty good at gaming. First test will be Rocket League. And I have a good feeling about this. So right now, yeah, we're at 122 frames per second on high at 1080. So what were you expecting when you went into (bleep) and, er
sorry, (clears throat) Uh, random PC part retailer, what were you actually expecting? - Um, to get scammed? - Next we have Dirt 4. Now this is another
game that's fairly new, but I think the 480 should be able to handle it pretty well. Um, when you look at a system like this for about like $650,
what you're getting here is something that you
really should be able to play at 1080 on high with most games. - Right. To be fair, all those
stores that we visited had options that were
just really overpriced, that were basically like that, like we're talking, $1,000 for like a 1060 - And you obviously want to
avoid that kind of stuff, right. I think the mid-range is a little bit more of the sweet spot, of
when you're buying something that's pre-built, it
can actually sometimes make a little bit of sense, as I go flying off into
the woods. (laughs) So next we have
Battlegrounds, and since Ken is way better at this game than I am, why don't you take it away? - Yep. - What settings can we actually play on? - Let's find out. - Because Battlegrounds, I
know it's been getting better with optimization, but it still does not run very well. - No, it's pretty awful
on like a lot of systems. - Well it's defaulting to 1080 high, that's not bad. - I mean, we can see how it plays first. - It's a little bit loud. But then again, I mean, it's a fairly powerful
graphics card in what is not a super well-ventilated case, so. - Yeah - This is actually running
really well though. Again, 1080p high, we're
getting 50-60 frames which on PUBG, I think
is actually not bad. - Not crazy. - Ken, Ken!
- No, ah, dammit. - He didn't even see you, what was that? (Ken laughs) - All right, so Ken, what
is your conclusion here with this whole experience of trying to actually get a decent
pre-built gaming PC? - The deals exist. Keep your eyes peeled. That's really what it comes down to. - (laughs) Such great advice. Just pay attention, and life will be okay. - Hey look, there are a lot of people that will egg on you for
getting a pre-built PC when sometimes, maybe
it is the better deal. - This is a good deal. You did a good job. I know you had to shop
around a little bit, you had to argue with some salespeople, but you're able to get
a system that honestly is a better deal than
what you could actually, could get on your own. So I ran the numbers on this, and if you tried to
build this system today, now mind you it would
be a little bit nicer, with a Kaby Lake i5, and an RX 580, but it's going to cost you around $870. Now mind you, that 580 is
way overinflated in price, but even once you cut that down, you get rid of some
stuff like the DVD drive, and the wifi, you're
still looking at something that's going to cost you over $700, which is more than what you paid for this. So, what do you guys
think about how Ken did with the pre-built gaming PC? Honestly, I think you actually did a lot better than I was expecting. So.
- Thanks, dad. - Anyway, let us know that you
think in the comments below, and we will catch you on the next one. Well, maybe I'll catch
you in the next one. Ken will probably be behind the camera, like usual, but, you know. - The way it should be (Austin laughs) 
Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the MacBook Pro, and it is Apple's most expensive laptop. Now this is actually
computer that we've edited all of our videos for the last year on. However, starting at $2,400,
it does not come cheap. That's where Microsoft comes
in with the new Surface Book 2. Now full disclosure. They actually did send
this out for review. However, as a laptop starting at $2,500, I'm curious to see how it stacks up. So I actually did a video
on the original Surface Book a couple of years ago and it
was a very, very weird concept. So the idea here is that
you're getting a computer that on the surface looks very
much similar to something like a MacBook, but you can
actually detach the screen and turn it into a tablet. Pop this guy open, and
the first thing we see is the well, the Surface Book itself. What really makes this
unique is the hinge. So as you can see, when
you close the laptop, it actually doesn't go completely flat, and that's because, so if
you press the button here for a second, what you'll be able to do is remove the actual tablet. Put these two side by
side, and at first glance, they look pretty similar but
there are a ton of differences. So first of all, while they
do have 15-inch displays each, the port selection is very different. Where the MacBook has
four Thunderbolt 3 ports, two on either side, the Surface instead has a single USB C paired with a Surface connector
for charging and docking, but importantly, it also
two full-size USB A ports and an SD-card reader. When it comes to screens, it is really hard to argue
with either of these laptops, but the Surface is slightly sharper, with a resolution of 3240 by 2160 compared to 2880 by 1800 on the MacBook, and the Surface has the added benefit of being a touchscreen. Where the Surface Book 2 really
excels is in performance. So inside, it has a Core
i7-8650U, a GTX 1060, 16 gigs of RAM, and
anywhere between 256 gigs and one terabytes of SSD storage. With a GTX 1060 inside, this is going to be a very powerful laptop when it comes to video
editing and even gaming. So to put things in context, a 1060 is usually what you'd find in fairly high-end gaming laptops, but one of the advantages
of the Surface Book is that it's still fairly thin. Microsoft has updated
the Surface Book design since the original, so
one of the main things is is that you can now open and close it without having to put a hand
on it to sort of steady it, and the hinge feels good. So in tablet mode, you do
get the full PC experience. So the main thing is
you're pretty much losing all the ports besides the headphone jack but what's cool is you
can actually just drop it right back on, even backwards,
and you can have yourself a super cool, even weirder
than usual looking computer. It might be a bit low-key at this point, but I really appreciate the
addition of a USB C port. So yeah, it might not be Thunderbolt, but I've actually moved
a lot of my accessories to USB C at this point,
and it is really nice to be able to use a single
cable to not only connect to a monitor but to get
power into the laptop. Speaking of power, I love
the idea that I can use a single power adaptor
for not only the laptop but also my Pixel or even a MacBook. I like the keyboard. So the keys are on the stiff side, but unlike on the MacBook,
there's actual travel here. Now I do think I slightly prefer the way that the butterfly switches
work on the MacBook Pro but you're not going to be disappointed with either of these. Something interesting is that
Microsoft slightly tapers the middle of the keyboard
and then it comes down on the sides, and it's kind
of hard to see this on video, but when actually typing, what it means is that your fingers are going
to be slightly elevated, which for me alleviates
a lot of wrist strain. The trackpad is decent. So as you'd expect from
a Microsoft device, it is a Windows Precision touchpad and that means that not only do you get the additional three-fingered gestures like swiping up to pull up your desktops, but it also tracks really accurately. As good as it might be though, it can't match the MacBook Pro. This trackpad is enormous. I mean seriously, it's
like the size of my hand. Now yes, you can totally
abide with the Surface, but Apple has the best
trackpads in the business. As you'd expect from a device
straight from Microsoft, there's basically no bloat in Windows, except there actually kind of is. So in a lot of laptops, this included have a few different preinstalled games such as March of Empires, Candy
Crush, and while that's fine on a $300 laptop, when I'm
paying over $3,000 for a laptop, I don't want to have any bloatware at all. And sure, it's easy enough to uninstall but it just feels weird
that they're trying to make a few extra bucks on something
that's this expensive. Where the Surface Book 2 really
shines is in performance. So side by side with the
MacBook, you can see that for shorter periods and
single-threaded tasks, it does hold up pretty well, but on the multi-threaded side, you're going to lose some performance, but the real star of the
show here is that GPU. With the GTX 1060 inside, well, you should be using
this for video editing. I'm playing some Rocket League. Now I actually will say
that with this much power, you can play a lot more demanding
games than Rocket League, but even at 2560 by 1600 with
pretty much all the settings cranked up, this looks really nice. We're getting anywhere between like 60 and 70 frames per second, and because this is Microsoft, there's a little bit of
Xbox inside the Surface, as there is an Xbox One
wireless radio built in. Now what's interesting
about having a GTX 1060 in a laptop that's so thin
is that besides the battery, the base of it is totally
dedicated to cooling it. So yes, it's a little bit loud, but no worse than most gaming laptops, and it's a lot thinner. For 15-inch laptops, battery
life actually isn't bad. So the MacBook should
go for around 10 hours, where the Surface is
rated for up to 17 hours. Now that part of that is
because it has two batteries, one in the screen and one in the base, but something to keep in
mind with both of these guys is that when you're actually
doing heavier lifting such as gaming and
especially video editing, expect that number to be a lot less. The Surface has a pair
of front-firing speakers in the screen and it sounds good, but the MacBook sounds phenomenal. It has two giant speakers
beside the actual keyboard and this is hands-down
the best-sounding laptop I've ever tried. When it comes to price, both of these laptops
are incredibly expensive. So the Surface Book starts at $2,500, but that's only with a 256 gig SSD. Bump that up to 512, and you're at $2,900. The MacBook is $100 cheaper but I don't think that's
going to change anyone's mind at this price point. If you can take advantage
of the extra GPU horsepower and especially the ability to use stuff like the Surface pen, the Surface dial for maybe
something like graphics work, then the Surface can make sense. However, when it comes to the MacBook, it's just a solid laptop all around. It's thinner, it's lighter, and while the touchbar
might seem like a gimmick, it really doesn't affect
the actual laptop itself, and stuff like Touch ID is
actually really helpful to have. The Surface does have a
wider variety of ports, but I've got to say over the last year, having four Thunderbolt
3 ports on the MacBook has come in handy quite a bit. The Surface Book 2 might
be the most incredibly engineered laptop you can buy today. Everything from the hinge,
which while maybe not perfect, is actually a really clever way
of doing something like this to cramming everything you
need for a full 15-inch PC into the thin screen, they've
done an incredible job. However, the MacBook kind
of wins in its simplicity. Both of these laptops are available in a smaller 13-inch size,
and in that comparison, the GTX 1050 inside the
smaller Surface book is a major contender with the MacBook pro. However, when you look
at the 15-inch sizes, the Surface Book is a hard sell. So what do you guys think
about the new Surface Book 2? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin, and this is the OnePlus 5. So OnePlus has been known
for making flagship phones at midrange phone prices. But is the OnePlus 5 worth it? Big shoutout to OnePlus
for not only sending us a review unit so we can take
a look at the phone early, but we also have this entire box full of accessories to check out. (cardboard tab tearing off) So what's cool is this
is actually a custom pack specifically meant for reviewers. (laughs) Some very subtle marketing there. First, we have the OnePlus 5 itself, so this is the higher-end model with 128 gigs of storage, but we also have a few accessories here. So this is the bumper case,
we also have the sandstone, we have a rosewood,
and we also have ebony. Does anyone care about this stuff? So, we have the phone itself, which at first glance looks pretty similar to the OnePlus 3. We also have the Dash charger,
which is kind of enormous. It looks like two iPhone
chargers just like, squashed together. From the front it looks fairly similar to the OnePlus 3, however,
when you flip it around back you'll see they've actually done some pretty major changes here. So even though this is only
.2 millimeters thinner, because it has a more tapered edge, and the whole thing
feels a lot more rounded, it actually feels a lot thinner. And of course, we do have
those dual rear-facing cameras. Not similar to any
other smartphone at all. Yeah, there's uh, there's
definitely a little bit of resemblance in the family. So one of these cameras is
going to be your main shooter, and one of them is going
to be a telephoto lens. Pop out the SIM slot,
and again, we do have support for dual SIMs,
but what you can't do with the OnePlus 5, is
use a microSD card here. I'm kind of surprised at
how much I like this design. So up front, it definitely
has much larger bezels, than something like a Galaxy S8, but as far as just like, in-hand feel, I really do like how the tapered design just kind of fits nicely. For comparison, the Galaxy
S8 has a lot smaller bezels. So put side-by-side with the OnePlus 5, it's clear that this looks
like a phone from the future, and this looks like a normal smartphone. Now that's not necessarily
that bad of a thing, so the OnePlus 5 still
does have a full home key with a fingerprint sensor,
whereas with the Galaxy S8, you're gonna have to deal with
the goofy thing on the back, but when you look at these side-by-side, it's clear that while the
OnePlus 5 is caught up in specs, design, it still
has a little ways to go. Inside, the OnePlus 5
absolutely has flagship specs. So it's rocking an octa-core
Snapdragon 835 processor, either six or eight gigabytes of RAM, as well as 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage. So both the Galaxy S8 as well
as the OnePlus 5 are fast, and the OnePlus actually
slightly edges out the S8, but regardless across the board, these are very, very fast phones. What's almost more
impressive is the speed of the storage on the OnePlus 5. While the Galaxy S8 is
definitely no slouch, here we're able to get over
700 megabytes per second on the read speeds. To put things in perspective, that's faster than a lot of PC SSDs. Inside, this guy is also rocking a pretty solidly sized
3300 milliamp hour battery. That combined with the Dash charge, which is about at fast as
you can charge a phone, thanks to OnePlus's giant power brick, means that the battery situation's also pretty solid on the OnePlus 5. Now the comparison with
the S8 really isn't fair, as well, this guy starts at 479 dollars, the Galaxy S8 is over 750. However, it is impressive
at just the level of power and specs that OnePlus was able to cram into a phone under 500 dollars. On paper, this guy has
a very similar screen to the OnePlus 3, as
it's still a 5.5 inch, 1080p AMOLED panel, however, this year they definitely upped the quality. Not only have they done a much better job of calibrating the display this year, but in addition to supporting
sRGB, it also supports the full P3 color gamut. - Hey guys, this is Austin! And today I'm here at E3
2017 with a simple question, PS4 Pro, or Xbox One X? - The screen here is a really
big jump over the OnePlus 3. So while it's not quite
as good as something like the Galaxy S8, it's still AMOLED, it still looks great, and honestly, having a 1080p resolution
still looks totally fine. If anything, it's just going
to help your battery life. The one issue with the OnePlus
5 as far as video goes, though, is the speaker. So it's still a single
bottom-firing speaker, and while it sounds decent, it does get reasonably loud, compared
to something like the iPhone which also hides a second
speaker in the earpiece, it just doesn't sound as good. The OnePlus 5 also supports Bluetooth 5.0, which I shall now demonstrate
in total overkill fashion. (electronic music) The OnePlus 5 is also
running Android 7.1.1 with the latest version of Oxygen OS. For the most part it's
fairly stock-looking. They have made a couple of tweaks. For example, they have app priority, which will supposedly figure out which apps you use the most often, and preload them in the background. And one of the things they've done is they've enhanced the latency, so everything here should feel a little bit quicker than normal. And while it's hard to
tell without actually having something
side-by-side, it feels snappy. The OnePlus 5 definitely
has the specs down, but one of the biggest upgrades here, is the new dual camera. The OnePlus 5 is rocking a
16 megapixel main camera, as well as a 20 megapixel telephoto. So what's interesting
is it's the exact same orientation as the iPhone 7 Plus. When you switch over to that
telephoto, it is a 2x zoom. When it comes to taking a normal
still, it's pretty snappy. But, all you have to do
is just tap the 2x button, and it will switch over to the telephoto. There's definitely a
difference in image quality. I do think that the main camera looks a little bit sharper, but importantly, it's actually pretty quick
to move between the two. Next, let's try portrait mode. Oh, wow! That looks pretty decent. It's a little bit soft on the edges, especially around your shirt,
but it looks pretty decent. So I think the iPhone shot was a little bit more natural, so especially the way it handles jumping
from Ken to the background. It's a little but smoother,
whereas you can definitely see the line where the OnePlus does it. Is it fair to compare the OnePlus camera to a phone that costs
several hundred dollars more? I kind of think so. I mean, they're not exactly being subtle with who they're targeting with this guy. The OnePlus 5 also has
pretty nice-looking 4K video. So, compared to the
iPhone, it's a little bit more compressed, and because there's not optical stabilization
in 4K, it's not quite the smoothest-looking video in the world, but for a cell phone, there's really not a lot to complain about. The OnePlus 5 goes on sale on
June 27th, for 479 dollars. While it's a little bit more expensive than previous OnePlus
models, when you consider what you're getting
here, especially compared to something like a Galaxy S8, this is a pretty solid deal. So, what do you guys
think about the OnePlus 5? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you on the next one. 
- Hey guys, this is Austin. Wi-Fi is basically everywhere and odds are you're using
one of these devices over Wi-Fi pretty much every day. However, it just got a lot less secure. Two Belgian researches
were able to find a flaw in the WPA2 Wi-Fi protocol. All this nerd talk aside means, is that a secured network is no longer as secure as you think. So to take a closer look at this we have our resident hacking expert Wes, and you've actually spent a couple days trying to figure out exactly how all of this stuff works. So there are two types of
Wi-Fi: secured and open. Now you've probably
connected to an open network at something like a
coffee shop or an airport. And while it's great to have free Wi-Fi, the downside of being open is that it really is truly open. Nearly anything you do
on an open Wi-Fi network can be spied on by other people. So, the idea here is that if I decide to jump on Wi-Fi, you can intercept that
and see what I'm doing. - Yeah, my laptop is essentially now sitting in between your phone and whatever websites
you're trying to access. - Okay, so if I say, "Go
to google.com right now," I just load it up, so I
am on the Google homepage, no problem. But on your end- - And what you can actually see here is that it is showing me that you are going to a Google service. It's not gonna work for every website. - Right. - This is an attack that has
been known about for a while and is pretty combated in most websites. A lot of people have the
security features built-in to combat this. What I'm seeing now, after I started kinda diving into it is there are actually
some pretty major websites that are not fully protected yet. - So, from my end, this
looks totally normal. I see HTTPS, it's secure, and, generally speaking,
if you do see HTTPS with the little green
lock on your browser, you are secure because even though this will
get between me and my Wi-Fi, it won't get between me and
the encryption and the Wi-Fi. You can't crack that step just yet. - Exactly. What this is trying to do, is it is trying to target that HTTPS but most big websites at this point have the technology and place
to basically tell my laptop to get outta here. - So, give me a website, let's try it. - Let's go to spirit.com. - Okay, it's loading. It looks fine on my end. I see it's not HTTPS, but, I mean, it looks like a lot of standard, generic websites. - And that's kinda creepy. And look right there, I can see that you- - [Austin] Whoa! - [Wes] In an instant and what's creepy is it
actually parses the data, too. So, I can see the type was a check-in. I see the last name and right there, locator. - Yeah, that is really scary. But, to be fair, that's
only on open Wi-Fi. However, if you're at home- - Yeah, well, if you're at home, let's see that you're
checking something personal like if you wanted to
check banking information, so, I know some people are a fan of Amex so, go to American Express's website. - Oh, interesting. So, now I see wwwww.americanexpress.com. - Which is another tactic
that this kind of attack uses where, if it can't just strip it off, it'll try and do other little tricks to essentially allow it to all get bypassed.
- To get all the way through. So, at this point, if you see
something like this, bail. This is not right. It's one thing to not see HTTPS and you should really look for that anytime you're logging
into anything sensitive, but, if you see a bunch of extra w's, that should be a big red flag. - That's when you know
that something's up. So, yeah, go ahead and
press the login button that has a little lock next to it. - This feels like such a bad idea. - And go ahead and check your account. Feel free to use your correct credentials. - I'm not gonna do that at all. Alright, logging in. - And, boom. I can see that you're user ID is test and password is wesishacking right there, seconds! - So, you basically were
able to capture all that. Now, that's not a real account, as you guys might be able to imagine, so, it just bounced me out, but, normally speaking, if that was my actual account, I would have been logged right in, checking all my credit card
information, the whole deal. - Yeah, you would have no idea, and I would not only have the information, but I would have it laid out for me in color coded fashion. So, the concerning part about all this is the people that have actually
discovered the WPA2 crack. They have said that at
a security conference that's coming up, they are going to release the code. - It's gonna be in the wild. - It's gonna be in the wild. So, they've essentially put a shot clock on every company to say, "Hey, if your device supports Wi-Fi,-" - Which is everything! - A couple devices, "You have to update soon, otherwise-" - It's too bad. It's out there. Until things get patched everywhere, you really should treat all Wi-Fi as if it's an open, unsecured network. Now, there are ways around this. For example, if you're
plugged in via ethernet, then you're going to be
able to avoid all of this. However, something you
should always be doing regardless of how you
connect to the internet, is looking out for that
HTTPS in your browser bar. That mean that, whatever you're sending, whether it's bank information, login info, credit cards, whatever, it's going to be secure. At least, way more secure than otherwise. A VPN is also a good idea. So, it's not perfect. Your computer can send some information between when you get on Wi-Fi and when you connect to the VPN, but, generally speaking,
encrypting web traffic is going to get around
a lot of these issues and, as long as you're using
an actually trustworthy VPN that is going to protect your data, you should be pretty safe. Because this is so new, there actually aren't a lot of patches that are available for
you to download just yet. So, Google is working on an Android patch, which will be coming soon. However, that's going to
be going to Pixel devices and actually may take
awhile before it hits the rest of Android phones. Now, Microsoft did update
Windows 10 already for this. However, even though Windows is patched, some Wi-Fi drivers may
also need to be updated. You can definitely expect other companies to follow suit quickly with
updates for their products, but if you consider that pretty
much everything in the world that connects to Wi-Fi
is vulnerable to this, it's going to take awhile and if you have an older device, you might just not be able
to get an update at all. Thankfully, this can be
fixed with software updates, but for now, make sure you're using HTTPS, and if you're really worried, you can consider using a VPN. So, if you guys are interested
in more info on hacking, I actually recently did an
entire video all about it. So, be sure to go check that out and I will catch you guys in the next one.
