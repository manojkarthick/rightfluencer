If You aren't following the 'Live The Adventure' trip we are hosting in Africa  here's a little taster.... Tree top canopy adventures in the foothills of table mountain 🌳❤️. First evening of the @livetheadventure Africa trip! I’m so excited about these next   10 days! Such an awesome group of people 🔥 (make sure you’re following everyone!). Flying to Barcelona for Nokia Mobile launch at MWC18!. I always think of penguins as funny animals that have a silly walk. As soon as they enter the water they transform into graceful beautiful creatures. They are so fast and agile it’s incredible! ❤️🐧. "NaN". Chillin’ with the penguins! 🐧❤️

📷: @djiglobal #mavicpro. Whilst diving in Hawaii we reached a drop off in the reef and from the depths emerged a giant manta ray  it elegantly glided in circles above us and then disappeared into the blue. Incredible experience! ❤️. Whilst in Hawaii I found the perfect little retreat at the Honu Kai Bed & Breakfast to relax and recover from the chaos of traveling✌🏼. Adventuring around the entire world in a Cessna 210! What’s next? 🌎❓. Capturing some aerial sunset beauty with my mavic pro! 🔥

📷: @the_candourist. I think I scared all the fish away! 🐟🐠🐙. Magical Hawaiian sunsets! 🌺. Flying over uncharted islands and atolls thousands of miles from land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean! It’s mind blowing to think some of them have never been stepped foot on! 🌊🌴. Standing on top of the world! Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain in the world when measured from base to summit. (most of it is under the sea) 🌤🗻

🎵Direct - Memory (Mr FijiWiji Remix) (Monstercat) -. Flying into Christmas Island showed me the scary reality of climate change. The aerial view is stunning but it’s easy to see how rising water levels will affect these low-lying Pacific Islands. Sadly Large parts of the country could be underwater by 2050. 💔 #EyeOnClimate.

📷: @jcpieri. We met this lady sitting at the entrance of the Ramtek temple in India. She was incredibly captivating. It's encounters like these make me realise it's the people of this world that inspire me to travel 🇮🇳. How many monkeys can you spot? 🐒🇮🇳. It's inspiring seeing people around the world making business work for them. This lady is an entrepreneur. Simply selling vegetables next to her bicycle! 🚲🥒. We spent the day exploring a 400 year old temple over looking the Indian city of Ramtek. We climbed to the very top tower to watch the sunset. This was a pretty perfect moment! 👌🏼

🎶: Xarnda - Fly on by
[Music] [Applause] good morning guys is day two of the crates for change summit the YouTube creates the change summit and we've just arrived at the London YouTube space and today I think we've just got like the the morning together there's some workshops some more people speaking I don't know if you saw yesterday's blows but it was like yeah like a full-on day of inspiration baby and yeah and then I'm flying out again this evening back to Cape Town so there's been a very very short visit to London but super cool super super food so can we get a thumbs up in the back that way you guys can hear me and that you guys are stoked to be here can we get a little round of applause for yesterday look at these wonderful people from yesterday just taking a look at that we're actually gonna send out like a [Music] okay guys I left the YouTube space we had a cool morning of discussion groups and just learning from some people in the industry and yeah it was a good end to the the whole event and I've now come back that was in Kings Cross I'm now comes back to Shoreditch where I was staying in the hotel and I've got an interview with a guy called Steve Bartlett who I think he's one of the founders of social chain or you know he he does a lot of stuff in there in the space and he's running a podcast or a youtube series or something I'm not entirely sure but I know that he recently interviewed Casper and yeah I'm supposed to be meeting him somewhere here sitting down for like yeah chat sorry should be fun guys I've arrived you looked at the way society world and you said to every why could I not do it differently what are the things within convention or society that have proven to be opinion wrong or incorrect that say we could have been trained to want everything as quickly as possible and I'm guilty a bit like I'm like ordering something Amazon now trying out our life you know I'm like genuinely annoyed by you who's gonna take six minutes think I was like six minutes like do the way it's so weird that we like get training with this like almost this it's immediate gratification is up right so but I think the life that's work by that I think looking back from my twenties realize it's a point now where I can travel the world and income and have a positive influence that it come easy and and it came from things like when I was in my early 20s essentially sacrificing everything and living like sleeping in a sleeping bag eat eight cans of baked beans and not having enough money to pay you know to drive around and feeling I'm not saying that's goods back to you but it's like we and then when I first travels I was again like zero money like one of the really powerful tryptamines in Australia when I was like I guess is like 2021 where I I was traveling with Sierra mother like living homeless hitchhiking again I'm not suggesting everybody does this but for me it's like how desperately do you want that dream and I think a lot of people want it but they lose they want every comfort and luxury and everything they want their life to be easy and I say that doesn't I think sacrifice is a big part of getting into that place when you can make a difference and you're willing to surrender things to achieve your goal and work harder guys I'm about to jump on the trains and head back down to cover my parents house to get some more stuff and then head to the airport well anyway as I'm coming into old Street Station I noticed there's no pop-up store for the Dollar Shave Club this isn't a sponsored video by the way but I realize I need a shave because royal eyes do clean-shaven so they're doing free shaves and I've never been shaved by somebody else so I'm going to come in here and have a little stage I'm getting in the seat this is Gabriela she's gonna be my shaver is that what you call - a barber Etta oh he knows I'm just gonna go broke classic cliché [Music] [Applause] nice to feel like you're giving me a pika okay I've gone into full relaxation I'm worried now that I'm just gonna stay until I miss my toy taught me [Music] fry I got my shave done jumped on the train back in Surbiton now just got a coffee that's drive back I've still got time to pack it's all looking good but what do you think guys I want to know though actually comment below clean shaven or with stubble what do you think suits me better I'd love to know [Music] I made it to Heathrow on time I've made a brave decision guys to try and bring my boosted board down to South Africa and I've actually removed to the new the v2 you can take the battery off so I think this will mean they'll allow me to travel with it I don't know where they're gonna need to check it in a lot but I'm hoping not see weapons to see them get through okay I'm in the lounge just about to board the flight I got through with the boosted board well good hopefully they'll let me into South Africa with it now without any problems I'm just finishing off some Instagram editing and I just went the food bit right I'm very impressed I'm typically not a big be a fan but the food today really good selection got jacket potato some butternut squash and sweet potato curry and some penne kind of tomato pasta thing so good job with the food be a battery so it's not motorized but it's actually an okay longboard there's a bit of resistance from the motors but not too bad you know it's actually getting me around pretty fast it sounds a bit weird because obviously the belts kind of still wearing around but still an efficient way to transport press to it [Music] Thanks one word to Capetown so we're a few hours into the fly I'm gonna get some sleep now before we land in Cape Town and this is potentially the last flight I'm gonna be doing like a few months potentially as you know I'm gonna be based down in Cape Town working on the documentary jp's coming out with setting a team up with I can edit ah we're still looking for some help with a script to the documentary and yeah hopefully by the time I leave Cape Town will have a rough car like a directors part of the full feature-length documentary and then we can ya see where we go from there get some help cutting it shorter I haven't made the full plan yet but I'm really excited and yeah this was a nice little interlude back to the UK before I really get cracking on it I've really enjoyed the last few days especially hanging out with them Steve today in the podcast and that was that was actually really really cool really good conversation and then also just being at the the YouTube creators for change summit last couple of days just made me realise that amongst all the criticism YouTube getting and a moment and frustrations we all have they are doing some really good programs and they're trying to put things in place to support those and give those a voice or a platform for their voice and doing good things and wanting to provide good things yeah they I don't know if I was saying before but they've committed to investing five million dollars into the crates for change scheme this year to get behind either Paul created small around the world and yeah I just want to pick up YouTube because they get a hard rap sometimes and I know there's a lot they could improve on but I think this is something that they should be congratulated on I think this is an amazing program and I feel honored to have been included in this year's summit and just to be there amongst those other people was yeah it was it felt great felt good to be part of apollyon going as well right they will cut in the morning back to the sunny weather peace out enjoy life 
[Music] hey guys it's a very special day today today BJ I have announced their new drain it's the Maverick air look at the size of this as you know for a while now my go-to drain has been the Maverick Pro and I think up till this moment this has been the smallest kind of pro level drain with all of the incredible features that sets us apart from the spark which was released last year and to be honest I didn't even look at a spark because firstly doesn't film 4k and it had a lot of missing features for me and I thought this is a bit of fun if you just want to take it on holiday or something but for me I needed that next level of capability bringing us to the Maverick air it's extremely compact there's a few very clear differences between the build of this and the Mavic pro and what I love with all of the DTR drones is just the thought that's put behind the the design the way that it all kind of fits together in compacts down so for starters the propellers themselves don't fold in like the like the Maverick Pro I'm just going to use this as a comparison I mean this really is a lot of smoke laughs so yeah smaller propellers they are fixed not folding the battery instead of being on the top of the drone is actually on the bottom and it's again considerably smaller now for me instantly I really love the design of the protective hood over the camera and gimbal because I'm not as careful as I could be with my equipment something I continually broke was firstly is quite fragile plastic third that comes with the malloc pry I've gone through about five of these and and then there's this kind of Gimbels kind of stabilizing thing which is easy to lose and if you forget to put it in it can damage damage the gimbal itself and then the whole camera is kind of protruding out now with the Maverick air I really love how the camera hoods and the gimbal wood protector just built into one piece like that that just slides off revealing the camera underneath and the other cool thing is the legs the front legs have these other little stands that just pop up before you can fly you may have also noticed there's sensors on the front the bottom and the back for obstacle avoidance so before even testing the fly and photo and video capability of this drain I'm already loving the design this is just this is beautiful this is I guess DTI just keep outdoing themselves and compared to the Maverick Pro this guy that was tiny I'm probably going to do a shot by shot comparison of them AdvoCare animatic Pro for another video but today I'm just gonna focus on the Maverick air and see whether this little guy can do everything I need it to do so before we head out and test it I'm gonna show you some of the other accessories that come with this right so in the Box I've got two batteries and then this multi charger which I love the design of look at their flaps down and then you place the batteries in here I think boom boom you can charge four batteries at once by in the past have had quite a few crashes with my drains and typically the thing you're gonna damage is the propellers because if you fly into a tree or a wall or whatever yeah these propellers are going to snap off and break whoo okay one last thing to show you is the Malik air controller now the noticeable difference between this and the Maverick pro controller is that there's no screen which for me I guess makes sense because you're going to have your phone plugged in anyway some of the features I quite like is that the control knobs here actually unscrew and and if you're traveling with it they just slot in under there it just gives you a slimmer more protected profile what I'm really tempted to do before we take it outside is test out these these propeller protectors if I fly it around inside a little bit and just you know nudge it into a wall I'm really interested in what's gonna happen so we take you for a nice flight [Music] Wow oh my gosh oh my gosh all right let's head outside let's do this [Music] [Music] [Music] getting some pretty amazing shots guys I'm gonna switch to photo mode because apparently the camera on here is super high megapixel and there's a new feature which does a spherical face a witch [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] says to all guys I spent the whole afternoon trying this little going out flying him around shooting some videos and photos I would say first noticeable negative point is that these batteries have a considerably shorter flight time I would highly recommend that you get this drone that you get a few spare batteries I think if you have a few spare batteries you'll be fine but that's the first thing I noticed so I shot mainly in 4k at 30 frames a second and I tried a bit of 1080 at 120 the 4k footage on this the bitrate is much much higher than the Mavic pray it's actually similar to if not the same as the new phantom 4 Pro and I was amazed when I looked through the footage when I got back at just the quality the detail and also the fact that it was pulling all the detail from the shadows and it was maintaining the the highlights it wasn't blowing out kind of the brighter elements of the scene and I think that's down to the bitrate is it's just collecting a lot more information I'd also say controlling this guy and maneuvering them around did feel different from the Maverick probe but I still felt control and yeah it was a lot of fun it was cool trying different modes now I don't know if you saw but one of the photos I showed you guys was actually a spherical photo it was a 360 photo which I panned around in the video but essentially once you've taken that photo you can move it around yourself you can view it I guess as a 360 photo of a scene or an area I haven't tried all the new features out yet by will be in future vlogs now the last thing to say guys before I sign out is that I did do some side-by-side test shots which you can check in the video that I've also uploaded today it's a kind of behind the scenes of shooting at the beach and a Mallik Pro versus the Maverick air test shot side-by-side they've got a few shots together so you can really see the difference and I actually would say that the video quality of this guy is much better so check that video out there please do subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and look forward to some future vlogs with some epic footage from the maverick air peace out enjoy life and live the adventure 
[Music] good morning guys it's our second day in Dubai and some aha I've ended back in Dubai more like this wasn't intentional at all but I just had a really nice breakfast catch up with my friends and then jp's not quite ready yet he's still doing laundry at his hotel so she was like we're doing we drop you I was like huh I don't know I guess I'll get dropped back at the mall I needed to exchange some currency so we've got US dollars in cash for the rest of the flight but ya know I'm just wandering around the mall and I don't think JP's around for a couple of hours so despite spending the entire day here yesterday I'm back here and no offense to this place because I mean it's impressive but this isn't really my vibe likes hanging out on his shopping malls all day so I need to go until I find something to do with my time well guys I didn't last long and the shopping center I hear I had to get out of this be honest I have just swung past to pick up a parcel this is an essential thing for the plane I think it something to do with the oxygen system which means we can fly at a higher altitude and now I'm grabbing an uber going in there finding JPEG remnants the lunch I think IRA just open the package and I didn't know this is what it was I thought it was gonna be like an oxygen mask like like a mask just shoot suction up your nose a needle on here which you adjust and then you have a regulator and is this if we go up to light out which leaves are like thirteen thousand something basically there have been times where it should be okay wow this is like properly like when you're in an airliner and that you you imagine the like dropping down Friday okay guys we've arrived at another cool second shopping mall of the day to me my friend hey further you saw last night and probably know from my previous vlogs anyway she's just finished a meeting here we're going to grab some lunch to go and then the plan is we're gonna drive into the desert and hopefully go on a little desert tour and we're hoping to interview her from in her car while she's driving us there so a bit of a different kind of star good to be I'm just trying to call it now a juggle all these things I trying to get to the desert trying to do it into trying to make your coincide when it hits the desert before the Sun sets and it's like setting super early right now so hopefully we still will have time back the other thing we didn't bring the right GoPro mounts of films that we're hoping we can like this a camera in the car somehow all right we were in the car which seems a bigger house in the mountainous I think what makes us all human and what we have in common is our the needs the human needs we all have the same human needs we all want to feel loved appreciated and we all like to you know to eat and we all sleep we're actually so much similar than we think in such a beautiful way and I believe if we have anything different between us it's just because it's interesting our differences are a blessing that's something I already believe in we've popped up papers Jeep and we are jumping in another off-road vehicle and we're about to head into the desert we're running a little bit late but hopefully just lends an air out the tires there to drive understand tune bashing for sunset - and Hopa [Music] [Music] didn't hang it out the window and I literally have got sand in my mouth pleasure I gotta live that venture oh that's that listen nona we parked up perfect time to watch the sunset oh yeah yes getting those epic photos yeah [Music] it's always a rush to get the photos especially here like the sunsets so quickly doesn't give you much time to get them got some goodies of JP walking on the mound the wind is so good because it just everything's like flowing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] no see quick sunset not here not only quiet when you need it near the equator if you like up in the cover descent you guys are gonna be in a total different place tomorrow this is so empty but tomorrow is gonna be busy in India how do you find India so vibrant and colorful and India on its own is like a huge continent I've been to the north and to the south and they're very very different things with Sophia Kara Kara no I haven't to care enough oh it's so amazing Salam alaikum ceremony I remember shotgun you know what love means in Arabic it's called oh yeah that means love that how's it spelled h OB you may be stuck in the sand though we can just sleep here tonight don't worry about it you just figuring his way out oh we hit a quite big gene there he needs a hand whoa okay Oh II know we stuck do you need some help bad news guys we're stuck he's like we need another car yeah for sure he said we're in a really bad situation so you can use your Namibian skills JP he's in the ditch basically look it's pinned we're stuck away this is an idea guys we're um we're in the middle of the desert where we're stuck the car is is wedged both sides back in front we're doing yeah okay yeah we can dig that I go I'm gonna join it yay so I'm filming I wanted to help no but it's all in my eyes we need again you know I'd like to know what they're getting you know literally like sunbathed I mean sunbathe before they go to India I think we we push apart oh wow company for oh wow you're amazing hey Congrats we made it out of the Sun well nice teamwork well you're the core part yield the motivational JP give everyone a bit of background of why you're so experience with getting vehicles outs fight situations I think I grew up in Namibia like that country well like desert driving is very common though similar to this yeah and you just grow up with your dad having a big 4x4 and all kitted out and go on adventures

[Music] good morning guys today is a fantastic day okay it's a lot better than it has been the last few days basically just to update you JP's been over here and know why who in Honolulu getting the plane refitted with a bigger fuel tank there's been a lot of problems this week with paperwork trying to get stuff signed off so we can actually fly back to California on time which is tomorrow and mood we've got to the literally to the wire like if we hadn't got this sorted today I don't think we would have made it at all like I think we're you know we don't even want to think what happened yesterday we were both feeling kind of kind of sick especially JP like he's been working so hard this week but anyway early this morning like 7:00 a.m. I got woken up by JP on the phone to the inspector that's been approving kind of the fuel tank fitted on the plane signing off and it all got swords last night we literally were like we had no idea but it looks like we're good to go playing inspected I just do it you just did the test flight how was it it's the I guess the highest risk flight we've done so far because it's just over ocean there's nowhere to divert to say yeah we've got hope there's no problems because literally there's no there's no way to get out of a sticky situation we've had to get a different kind of radio to HF radio yeah every good a high-frequency radio fitted for this crossing and yeah hopefully earlier early hours of tomorrow morning we'll be landing in California and then heading over to Ken Valley for I think this is like the pinnacle of the trip I'm like super nervous for sale today so because everything we've been doing for us almost three mullahs santa this is its this is the climax of it all and I'm like really excited I've gone from feeling like sick and worried and anxious to like super excited but also very nervous I can't imagine how you're feeling because this is me and I'm not none of them the risk my mother have excited for everything that's coming after we land in California yeah especially the takeoff like once we're flying and everything's our cams cruise I'm easy but this takeoff is gonna be it's I've thought about it it's the most dangerous thing I've ever done in my life yeah and probably the most dangerous thing you'll ever be a part of so yeah that that's just to give you some context what we're doing a good today once we're in the air we're soaring we're on course I think well that we'll be able to breathe a sigh of relief hopefully but what we're saying yes that jpo is tenable yesterday as well if if we take off and those problems we're screwed because we cannot land again for eight hours like if there was someone to land an eight hours but like because of how heavy we are where we are fully laden with how many liters or gallons of fuel is there on the plane we have 280 gallons which is about a thousand liters well I mean that is serious where we're at thousand five hundred pounds of weight over what the airplane is certified to do we have permission to do that yeah we're test pilots so gonna be a good day okay we just JP's rental car off we managed to get a ton of snacks we are fully loaded nuts Pringles cereal was Oreos Red Bull everything now yeah we're gonna head into the plane there she is guys Balu is ready ready and waiting to the slight affair light we have a lot of snacks guys we this is a heavy bag of snacks filling up the big boy [Music] all right dude you ready I'm ready all right gentle right time and just fly the airplane you supply JP that's all you've ever done [Music] let's take over it right okay here we go baby high temperature is it good pressure the good flirting off 60 knots 70 knots 80 knots because she wants to fly so when I let her fly I want to just keep it nice and low nice low comma tiny gear up I want to keep a nice alone [Applause] okay she's clean crazy shit [Music] that's insanely blue that is probably some other producers what a speech yeah I'm so good one so good one [Music] [Music] hey guess what the autopilot well alright rock-solid Bob is nice waiting nothing oh it feels so good it does feel amazing we're cruising almost 800 feet ago and a level up for a bit at this rate uh-huh we're gonna have negative feel let's see compute data minus 13 gallops Wow but we're only doing it under 12 knots across the ground so that's pretty impressive actually if you think about it I need to get this HF radio set up [Applause] its sense frequencies to the Atmos like the top of the atmosphere then it bounces off the earth again and it's I pointed guys sitting in San Francisco with one antenna right now is like super long wave sanely high frequencies yatris but that's crazy to look man that's a fucking long distance how far is it like two thousand miles we still have two thousand thirty thousand thirty miles this is so good it's exactly what I needed right now I'm so excited I'm not okay they're looking off right ahead of us yeah maybe this excitement will doled out at like ten hours oh yeah do try to get California that is insane that is actually mental do you get like waves of excitement slaves anxiety where's the keys excitement like the blessed thing is I have like cables running into my ears which makes the noise canceling keep freaking out so I keep thinking there's something wrong but it's all gravy man wondering at what stage we should try to maybe we should do a 360 let's do a 360 on our arrival into so that should we haven't the wing I think I'll be cooler at the wake of it yeah sure I'm wondering whether we should do like a chatty one hey nobody wants to see us chatting on 360 don't know because you could look out behind you okay yeah actually yeah we try it yeah this was they're still right whoops we're playing around with so we there's a birthing carpet 360 were doing and it's with the new fusion from from GoPro the best real video we've got a few wing shots but this is the first proper 360 you should have probably done some earlier but we had the problem anyway look around right now guys it is like three big golden hour the Sun is saying we're 10,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean we are last week this is so fine right now it's gonna get worse when we get to there it's gonna so what something important that's the furthest you can ever be from any land point that is her caught whatever their fixes though I feel you guys we would have left early in the morning leaving us this batch of light type in daylight because of paperwork delays I mean we are so grateful that we got to leave the day at all but we left I don't know what was it what p.m. 2:00 p.m. bpm we've got 1724 those coupons till we get to California - laughs twelve hours 12 hours that'll realistically come down we have realistically about 11 maybe 10 and a half hours left and both of that now is going to be flying through the night so it's as if the two better I'm going to help keep JP awake if he needs to have little naps I'll keep an eye on the instruments [Music] I'm a little bit of a problem it's not a problem it's just me being overly cautious is when I'm running straight off the ferry tank so keep getting air bubbles they're small and they're not really making engine coffee but I don't like that and icon I don't know why so what I'm doing now is I keep running the right tank halfway down then filling it up again and then halfway down filling it up and then while I'm filling it I'm running on the left tank just to sort of alleviate any hiccups has me a little nervous like we are one hour from our turnaround point but one hour everything's not all sweet then I'm going to turn around but everything is looking good we're building speed I was actually surprised when we took off the take-off wasn't as intense as I was expecting you know it was just a matter of basically instruments did not matter it was purely feeling the airplane and making sure it's it's happy [Applause] and Senator November 10 ones Oh Akane of Omaha Deary redrew 5:30 can form we are to three miles from city maintaining 1 0-0 on the flight level circuit [Applause] [Music] we are not at all oh that's a good feeling oh my god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] left three six zero circuit medical case to create heavy fly heading three zero two four the dating game for town yeah this just doesn't see frail no it doesn't doesn't seem very let's go like it really it just feels like another destination that we're arriving it [Applause] but this is America this is my lessons that we went there we were we blew the loop from there well wait there on the world alright let's try and do a night landing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah that'll have to do dude all right I'm actually it's tough I think I'm just in a bit of like in disbelief I'm like what you just did that yeah the thing is gonna take a sec to thinking any more than a second yeah you can Valley I'll help ya I think with the yeah the big big hoo-ha later on today boy like yeah it like eight hours or something seven hours I don't like whatever we decide to roll up Oh stretch Oh how long was that 13 and a half hours hours in the air we made it we made it to California later today we'll be arriving at the official finish but this is the this is the this is the big this is the big kind of like relation everybody that cares about me should be asleep right now it's like 2:00 a.m. and New Zealand and say yeah yeah but they're all active oh really good Oh belay you did us proud right ah after the hotel all right we are barely functioning as humans right now we streamed exhaustively yes like so sassy wicked I'm just so done I just need to sleep we're gonna sleep for a few hours hopefully we'll just get just enough men injury just to push over the finish line for noon today where am I going where we go guys I'm gonna sign out here and then I'll start tomorrow this Login if here and we wake up and we are like overwhelmed that we're here but it's kind of also counteracted with our tiredness but tomorrow it will be the day so make sure you tune in whoa peace out enjoy life live the adventure [Music] 
good afternoon guys I am had a little laying this morning I think I'm still in LA time so it's already 2 p.m. just going to p.m. these guys had a fun morning down at the beach to me yeah did you enjoy that little cycle right we're now we're gonna head up to these ziplining I don't know you saw my vlogs from before here and I did Riya but this Dominican treehouse village place has is also it has like a ziplining activity which is at the top of this kind of valley so going to walk up there and help got my GoPro and really nice way to wake up with us oh we made it luckily the day isn't as hot as it was last time I came out here not as exhausted go have you done anything like this before no you're gonna love it right on it you getting so confident another three houses this is what I want like a massive tree coming through the middle you'd have to keep replacing the floorboards that's it that's it right right I can't believe in the beginning you're scared by the end you're like pilling up loads gonna move this bridge is super rocket Wow I feel like you could easily lose your footing as well oh yeah that's two separate planks right we just lift back to our rooms to get things to head out and just the heavens open and it's just stuff different array we made it on the jungle path through the rain we're all pretty soaking we do have plastic bags for the cameras though we're gonna drive down to the beach and see it already seems less dark it doesn't mean I think yeah I think it's because we're like not in the middle of a valley we had to cross that River before and we got stuck in the river yeah no this is brandy this was definitely not her yeah she said that was oK we've got down to the beach still still raining a little bit it's nice to get down here before before the end of the day I came down to this beach before we didn't really walk around like I send the drone on a little bit of a mission and being right I got some food here but I didn't walk down this way apparently it's like a cool cave or something I don't know how we're gonna get over that though without getting wet okay we're taking our shoes off annoyingly I realized I left my flip-flops in Hawaii the other day when we were adventuring at the waterfall which means yeah I haven't got very suitable footwear for Dominican Republic I think we're going to try and hit a market tomorrow and find something in the meantime it's it's all about a barefoot adventure whoo that is quite whoa this is fresh water flowing out from under this big kind of rock thing this is a river and then it's heading down here to the sea we've got a bit of a landslide those three routes okay dinner now all right guys are setting up for BIV evening slacklining after dinner I just had a very very tasty bowl of lentil soup let me see if they've got another bulb this guy is just showing up guys it's 6:00 a.m. I've been up all night editing did a pretty mammoth vlog like normally when I cut down my vlogs it's like I don't know 15 20 minutes like try and cut it down to between 12 to I don't know 18 not link this vlog one side cut in all the b-roll and the clips I was thinking of using it's over an hour long which indicate to me that is put it was probably similar to editing or trying to edit for vlogs back-to-back which is why it's taken so long to get this one done and since the the LTA summit and Hillier landing finishing the world flying and rushing off onto this trip I haven't managed to get this vlog done because it's just so crazy so finally done it I'm about to render it and hopefully upload for you guys I'm learning a lot of lessons about kind of how much to take on when it comes to future adventures and how much to try and vlog but anyway I'm getting there guys I'm slowly getting there and I'm gonna get three hours sleep within it I'm gonna get up for 9:00 grab some breakfast and head out with these guys and make the most of tomorrow because we're not here for long and I want them to enjoy themselves and for it to be worth it for them right warning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure 
[Music] it's day seven of prep to the world flight guys we are leaving first thing tomorrow I am so excited it's finally happening JP has been working hard this morning on the plane the seats are back in the tank is all fitted we've got a very loud helicopter circling but I'm just going to carry on vlogging yeah just doing some cleaning now [Music] okay I'm giving JP a little hand with the cleaning we've got our brushes apparently these on what we're supposed to be using for this about doing the job there's a lot of oil and grease buildup helicopters circling overhead landing and taken up again all day is not convenient for vlogging [Music] I guess they're doing like helicopter pilot training or something so loud anyway while I was saying was using all this grease buildup back here this is what we're trying to wash off right now the Jaypee was just saying one of the important reasons why we have to clean it so thoroughly is that he can then see if there's any leaks that happen throughout the trips he's going to be inspecting the bottom of the plane and if you can see any oil coming out of something then you know there's a problem so it's going to be clean and shiny yeah gonna keep cleaning it we have to otherwise you can't diagnose any - or see any issue I know it must seem like I'm not doing a lot of the work but um I guess pop my work he's getting these videos done and out for you guys [Music] Wow we don't even need to do on our site the objective is to bulge this cap a little bit okay so it's just a few pumps to get that going and then once you've done that so always before and I will always check this but make sure you check it - just it helps if there's two eyes doing it this one has to be closed before you start pumping and then this one has to be open and you know it's open by the fact that it's going to be yeah I was coming up and I was very little a few than this tank I keep on normal that's normal go it'll do that in flight - so we need yeah you don't need much more passion okay and now now we're close to that now you close that and now we've trapped the pressure in there so the extra tanks benefited as you saw there's a manual pump to pump the fuel when we need it I don't know whether it's going into the wing tanks or I think they were saying is going straight into the engine I don't really understand how it works but my job is to pump it when I'm told to love it and we're gonna go up and test it now at altitude so we're gonna take off give it a little go [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right so you can start pressurizing the tank a little bit okay I'll put your phone away and put everything else away yeah open it up okay pressurize so I keep you know that that back up a little bit more we should be flying on the ferry field so just keep like making note of where that needle is right now okay okay we want to be heading 1 to 0 on here so just turn until that number up there in the middle says 1 to 0 right yeah yeah all right so straight and level now okay so how do I go client food yeah so we don't want to be climbing ok kakazu was like is this the same as does it you know it is yeah so this is forward oh this is back this is left okay sorry other way but you know what yeah so if you want to do a 360 degree turn to or go left okay yep 2 about 295 degrees keep going left and remember when you turn well you're using what that what I go do I want to keep that so that's pretty good there and then just whenever you turn you need a pull pull back a little bit cause you're changing the left lift vector which then you know you need to counteract that so that yellow arrow you know you're perfect right now so ideally when you keep it right there you should not be going up or down because you're flying right at the horizon I think it's pretty accurate oh it's very accurate because that's what you use an instrument flying please do so yeah it's very accurate I didn't go left 90 degrees it's just pretty much exactly where the winces the wing is pointing now and you can just pull signee from that which would be a hundred ninety and then remember this is gonna defend a little bit now with the minute [Music] literally turning in the stuff that's full the high rate turn I don't like doing max racing this thing I don't know without the stress left you always feel a little bit weary [Music] we are back on the ground that's a pretty fun flight getting to actually control the plane that's the first time I've had to go flying that plane I had to go flying Zazu back in the day when me and JP were in Namibia but this is the first time of the controls of I think we're going in Philly guys I think we're going with Balu there was a few other names that I liked like one the wing or wonder bird but I think we're going for Balu anyway it's the first time I've been behind the controls of Balu and it's it's cool it is cool it feels amazing guys we just sat out and watched the most incredible sunset sorry I didn't film it I I was busy filming with JP we were just doing a little sit down kind of preflight chat for the documentary yeah yeah it was it was good JP is feeling a little bit worried or kind of anxious about it all because as we said on camera like other night a lot of the responsibility falls on him and I'm kind of at this point in an isolation now I don't have to worry about it all too much because essentially I'm just kind of tagging along I don't you know if I was a pilot I think it'd be different because we'd have a shared responsibility but because I'm just a passenger essentially yeah it's gonna mean that I just don't have the same emotions flying around so my job is just to keep JP positive and encourage Airmen and when he's feeling stressed just yeah just trying to help out we've been chatting over dinner about the plan and we may have to tweak the plan slightly JP saying in order to get to Boston in time where we're gonna meet his friend who's gonna be joining for some of the flight and intertwined time it so we can see the solar eclipse he's suggesting we actually leave first thing Monday morning instead of tomorrow but what we'd like to do because the the place where we're having the arrival party in Kern Valley that's the official end is what we could do is tomorrow flyovers Kern Valley it's like an hour away camp there for the night or stay there for the night and then set off from the exact place that we're landing so that when we complete around the around-the-world flight it's kind of like a proper completion that we're landing at the same spot so that's the plan hopefully we can do that and it gives us a little bit more time just to prepare the last little few things we need all we need to go and get that adapter that we can find tonight but yeah feeling good and feeling pumped and feeling ready guys I'm feeling catching the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good morning guys today it's the day that we're gonna fly around the world we're in Kernan Valley Airport it's 6:00 a.m. he's just behind me here getting the plane ready and yeah we're gonna be flying across the country today I don't know how far we'll get but we're gonna try and get as far as possible I'm feeling as excited as I have been every single day this week super pumped obviously wanna be supportive for JP because it's kind of the burdens on him he's the pilot and he's feeling the pressure a bit but yeah I'm hoping today goes well he said there's a few concerns because it's kind of stormy over some of the mountains all there's a potential for bad weather but and that's what we're trying to get off early before the heat comes in and there and weather picks up and then hopefully this afternoon it all goes well or goes to plan we might be able to coincide with the total solar eclipse it's happening over the states today so yeah it's gonna be a very very good day [Music] hey we're ready to go this is James he gave us a ride into town last night and offered kindly to come by this morning with some coffee to send us off he is our send-off party we didn't really plan much ahead because we didn't know exactly which day we were able to leave and I don't know we've been concentrating on other stuff so we didn't get anyone down here to send us off but I'm glad you came James thank you I'm glad you guys are yeah and are you gonna be around in the 10th of November to see us all right absolutely fantastic fantastic how you feeling JP to be honest I'm just focused on the phone right now yeah and there's really nasty weather on the way so okay you're just focused that's the face of pure focus [Music] leaf of nice and cool this morning at night sweltering yeah I don't think so it's the well there's not too much white maybe let's see how about preparing for it huh let's do this around the world baby around the world [Music] [Applause] [Music] like that so we're thankful me when I have to wait on the ground like it gets my anxiety up so much but once we get in the air [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay it's a slightly anticlimactic start to the trip because we've had to land at a nearby airport just to refuel because there wasn't any fuel at Weekend Valley Airport but after this I'm thinking we're gonna be in the air for quite a while JB's gonna fill up the ferry tank the big 40 gallon ferry tank and then both wing tanks and then we've got yeah very very long flight today we've just been looking on the little map JP she's been showing me there's some storms that we need to avoid so we're gonna kind of fly around them I'm feeling particularly good for this time in the morning obviously it's a very exciting day so I'm gonna make sure I use the facilities here before we take off because there's no toilet on the plane as you probably are aware a lot of you've been asking what happens if we need the toilet mid-flight well if it's a number one we should be okay because we've got we've got empty bottles to use here it's a number two there is a way for that to happen but it's obviously not gonna be pleasant for anyone on the plane no we'll just hope that doesn't come to it the only time I can imagine I mean this is gross talking about but the only time I can imagine is if one of us gets really ill and has kind of a bad dodgy stomach and we can't land anywhere but let's hope that doesn't happen so guys I got a little timetable here with all the locations and times of this solar eclipse and JP's saying we'll probably be around Jefferson City Missouri in time to see it this is the heaviest the plane gonna be for a while [Music] so did that takeoff give you reassurance for oh yeah if we if we're taking on from sea level because we had 3,500 density altitude out there if we're taking off at sea level and we're at the weight that we were there now we'd have no problem whatsoever [Music] where are we right now morover oh my god no wait look this is Kay nap down here and I cycled this road and if we look so that's cane ma put the video on my channel where I talk about living a life of candor yeah show you right now I filmed right there right prick it there on that hillside Oh [Music] can't see the TV eclipse yet well you need a photograph of but there's some yeah yeah you have a filter on there and II know I never got big enough did we have wow we got about four hours four and a half hours left until we land again but yeah I'm pretty pretty like my excitement level is building like a little bit of that once or now enroute stuff I know it'll come in again at some point but it'll to go up so that's always with my grand adventures is it it's almost like a bipolar experience because I have these massive highs and lows yeah our life story's a bit of a roller coaster I know but these trips tend to be more of that which is kind of what I love about them too is you can actually with the 10 minutes be completely happy and everything's going great and then everything is just go wrong so what other things you need to be careful of guys is one of the signs of altitude hypoxia hypoxia is like feeling super happy but I've kind of been like super happy anyway so I don't know whether it is whether I'm happy because I'm big stuff of oxygen or whether I know we're not now an altitude where there'll be an issue today but we might at some point get there [Music] [Music] so that was eight hours we did we just completed eight hours no toilet break myself the fuel trucks just coming over to help us fuel up what else I'm glad all the stickers are still on they survived an eight-hour flight or even went through some rain looking good oh I just saw a lightning strike so the plan was we were just gonna stop here for fuel and then carry on that JP what's what's going on we're not going anywhere this is weather radar right now I mean in theory we could try and weave our way through that but that's just looking for trouble like this could just close up in any moment or anything and considering we're going to be doing this in the dark bad idea so I'm calling it we're not going anywhere say looks like we staying here tonight yeah when we came in none of this existed Wow and it just just came in so this is nasty weather we should be fine it'll just be an early morning tomorrow so the people here have kindly offered to take our plane into their hangar to protect it from the incoming storm [Music] Wow so kind of them isn't it like I just said it to my caroling people that we are meeting on this trip and the last four five days we've been so helpful everyone I think people just love the idea of what we're doing that we're going around the world and like instantly they're like no way like we won they're like help in some way I'm getting a ride into town the rain is really coming down now crazy absolutely crazy okay here we go thanks so much for giving us a ride and sound guys look how nice our room is literally we were just expecting to stay in a expecting to stay in a motel this is quite an upgrade from where we were sleeping last night in the 10 and go we can't pick up the kind couple from the airport yeah managed to get us this room for $75 and it's normally $300 tonight because of the eclipses today and stuff so if you're watching guys thank you this up right I'm gonna probably edit for a few more hours and then get some sleep it's only 11:00 p.m. so it's simple a bit of time I think the plan is we're gonna head off first thing and do another kind of mammoth flying day and try and make it all the way to Boston it won't go it's not gonna be as long as we flew today but it's another long flight and then who we meeting in Boston JP now we're meeting Matt girl's mother who some of you might know was the youngest person to have flown around the world I think it was 2014 that he flew around he's a good friend and because this is my first time crossing the any ocean really I thought it would be wise to bring a wise soul on board and Matt's a cool dude so yeah he's gonna join us from tomorrow onwards hanging out with us and he's gonna help me get used to the whole I guess crossing oceans Rick Merrill he's got plenty of experience cool well I know I've never met him either so I'm looking forward to meeting him and yeah we're gonna be sharing quite a bit of time together in the plane all of us alright catch you guys in the morning early morning peace out enjoy life and live the Adventure Bay [Music] 
[Music] good afternoon guys we're in Nagpur and in the up still third day and we've just met back up with a cache of friends he's been showing us around the last couple of days and we are about to head to a village I think it's like 40 minutes to an hour outside of netball where there's gonna be some music and cultural stuff we're gonna get some dinner and we've spent the whole morning just relaxing and game getting some work done and stuff yeah it's ready I'm ready to adventure [Music] so we've arrived at this kind of event resort place where they're gonna do some cultural stuff is called Chalker Danny well tell us what's gonna happen tonight Akash and if any of you have been long longtime fans you may remember the ritual run where we drove little tiny rituals from chillon all the way to gel Sameer for the end destination that is in Rajasthan so yeah some stuff from that region also we get great with tomorrow see you wanna see [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] time to taste the tomato soup oh that's delicious we're going on a little mission now to see if we can find a good lookout spot for the sunset thinking we're thinking on top of this roof oh I love that door bellows ancient cheers cheers Cheers chin chin chin chin [Music] [Music] I'm gonna go and see a magic shiner from back there he's he's pretty good it's like a family [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we are pretty exhausted from dancing we're now gonna see this girl do some I guess she's gonna do some acrobatics oh I'm we probably can't join in this [Music] [Music] Oh Alex Proctor [Music] [Music] [Music] so after three very energetic dances we're finally arrived where we're gonna get head massages and I am super excited because it's not often I get one and the Indians are famous for the Indian Head massage thing hopefully even though I've got dread [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] and oh never have I felt anything like that you only guy you're looking forward to this JC good he just punched me in the head [Music] [Music] [Music] open your eyes he's spraying in your eyes where is it you spray in your eyes [Music] [Music] yeah thanks thanks okay we're gonna sit down to dinner shoes it looks like we're kind of sitting on this little cushions of floor with the tables a traditional registan traditional style all right we are being served by 10 waiters right now yeah we need more waiters so half the things we've been served I'm not entirely sure what they are [Music] [Music] [Music] this guy looks so casual just walking around hello yes JC you look like you literally look like a tiny child Ariane's gonna teach me how to play the drum what's this song called with the name of this drum I was it yeah thank you okay thank you Oh guys if you're wondering where JP went and he got bitten by something like he thinks maybe a spider it could have been a spider or some kind of insects but um anyway he had to head off early today he missed out on dinner um we're gonna head back to the hotel and join him now we're gonna have to wake up a taxi driver he's falling asleep tickle his foot give me a little tickle [Applause] okay caches off sealer broke guys if you haven't already seen from my Instagram you need to go and follow him an Instagram he's been making these incredible stories which you won't be able to see by the time you watch this vlog but going to get his pictures anyway he's very talented and he did a just before we left tonight he did like a light painting shot of us me and Josie was standing and he's like painting this phone so yeah go check it out and JP's feeling a little bit better aren't you bro you got some food poisoning yeah yeah you feel better after yeah well I'm glad you're feeling a bit better anyway so point um updating you on is that when JC arrives he had his ronan which is this like big stabilizing rig this gimbal and we couldn't get it working I think there might have been something damaged when he checked in on the flight and we have just been on the phone to DJI and they suggested checking all the cable connections JP got a screwdriver I opened up part of the I don't know all the details but opened it up and reconnected one of the cables and now we have a working gimbal which we can get some epic footage with so this is going to make things this is going to like the cinematics are gonna get crazy now yeah balance a bit more or I think it's maybe just long you see that yeah anyway we're gonna figure it out and yeah hopefully get some very cinematic shots over the next few days you have awesome it's been a fun afternoon and evening a pretty brief vlog today we pretty much just went to that um cultural music place but um well catch you guys in the morning we're gonna go to some markets peace out enjoy life live the adventure [Music] 
hey guys today I am gonna be making a different type of video I don't usually do these sit-down videos but now I have an office space for a little time whilst I'm in Cape Town this is the perfect opportunity and I have been requested for a number of years from I see in the comments you guys always ask me please show us how you edit your instagrams how to use Lightroom and that is what I'm going to attempt to do today this is my first kind of tutorial video I would love to do more of these especially now I've got this set up I would love to show you how I edit my vlogs and what are we doing now is sharing my screen on the video and talking you through and you're going to see how I do things so here we go so what I've done is I've grabbed a number of images from different trips over the last couple of years representing different types of places I've been in so a few from kind of tropical locations I think this is Hawaii and the Maldives and then kind of more evening Twilight sunset shots I think this is Hawaii South of France Hawaii then I've gone for shots I did in Iceland which were a bit more kind of overcast tundra then some shots I did in Peru so I've really tried to kind of look at a range of places totally different kind of climates totally different architecture landscapes everything here this is Mexico these are can night shots I've done some evening night shots and these are forest shots I've filmed in different parts of Canada in California and actually this is from I think the Dominican Republic and then some street shots architecture stuff and people from India and then finally some desert terrain when I was in Abu Dhabi recently and this is a shot from Morocco I believe anyway so these are the photos I'm gonna be demonstrating today for you guys and show you how I typically edit now firstly for those of you that don't have this already I would highly recommend paying for the Adobe collection Adobe Adobe suite which includes Lightroom and if you want to edit I personally edit on Adobe Premiere as well so Adobe Lightroom it might be something you're used to you've tried before you may be better better than me but I'm just going to show you what I do and how I edit photos cool so as you look down here I usually open up all of these tabs so you can really play around with the image as much as possible I probably won't fully explain everything here but you kind of get the idea so this is the the first kind of panel here you have kind of temperature and tint where you can create a more yellow you bring more yellow into the image or you bring it more blue and then you also same kind of with green or magenta and then you've got exposure obviously the image is too dark or bright you've got contrast I mean there's so many settings it I won't take you through them all sometimes you want to pump the shadows up you've got vibrance and saturation I've still never fully figured out exactly what each is doing but they definitely kind of bring more color into the image this is a curve here where a tone curve where you can bring black and other mids up that the highs up you can bring a vide the darks up and this is how a lot of people do kind of that faded faded blacks in an image I'm going to reset that for a second and then here is the hue saturation and luminance of an image so you can play around if I want these blues here to be more kind of turquoise which I often do with my blues I can pull that in this direction or you know maybe I want my if you look down here saturation it's very trendy to kind of mute your green so I might pull my greens down I might pull my might pull my blues a bit more turquoise there I might reduce my saturation so this is where you can start playing around and this could you know you can fiddle around this for hours and I have done guys and definitely recommend you do this yourself kind of have a real play around with Lightroom here's you can bring different colors into the shadows the dark tones you might want to bring a kind of warmer or a cooler shadow into the image I often bring a bit of a post vignette which kind of darkens the outside a bit and kind of brings the focus to the middle of the image oh there's there's many many settings and I feel like if I carried on talking like this we are gonna this video is gonna be like two hours long so anyway it gives you an overview roughly and that was a very bad overview of kind of how you edit images and what you can play with now what I found is depending on the kind of image is the kind of landscape the kind of kind of subject in the image the lighting the colors in the scene like you might want to just play around with all of those different settings and it can be very very time-consuming and sometimes you can get lost you feel like I've been editing this image so long it doesn't look good so what I've done to make it easier for you guys is creative nine different presets that I use for different regions around the world different landscapes different lighting the colors I want to bring out and they're all very different and I'm gonna quickly show you what those nine presets look like and also show you how to use a preset because unfortunately it's pretty impossible to create a preset that just works on any photo you just click it and it perfectly amazingly looks great what you're gonna need to do is tweak the preset once you've applied it to an image and I'll show you some very easy tweets it's much much quicker than trying to do it from scratch let's start off with these tropical photos i've got i'm i've named one of my presets tropical paradise so what i'll do is i'll apply that now and as you see i've lightened the sky up I've brought the shadows right up here i've brought a bit of color in there on the curve here i've faded the blacks so they're not as dark and then i've really played around with the color the hue saturation and luminance for each individual color this is why it can be very time-consuming we're live added kind of highlight tints and shadow tints what I've done is spent a very long time on each of these presets to kind of really work and enhance each image depending on where I am so I'm going to show you now this same preset on this image and this is an example of where it hasn't worked perfectly I would personally probably pull this saturation of the orange down a little bit and and maybe even pull the luminance of the orange down a bit just to bring our skin tones a bit more just to make them look a bit cooler and then yeah maybe the greens I could reduce a bit the saturation of the green but as you see it's very quick that you know I'd say that's done now and then finally this is the aerial shot this is a drone shot in the Maldives again just literally one click apply that I mean I'm pretty happy with that that's pretty beautiful yeah maybe I could slightly meet those greens and the island on the trees actually I think because I feel like they're actually actually more yellow so I pull the yellows down yet there you go again slight tweak and we're good to go so let's move on to these sunset images here I have this preset the sunset mood I supply that now I've really messed around with this and this again it's tasties might not be everyone's taste but I've I've added quite a lot of blue to the shadows and I've also faded the blacks up and just played around brought the the highlights down so you can see a bit more of the kind of that the sun's not super overexposed and yeah I really like this look and I think there's different ways to edit sunsets you can go super vibrant you can try you could potentially pull the shadows up if you want it to but again I'm happy with this I'll show you what it looks like with some of these other kind of Twilight sunset shots this is later in the evening this is after the sun's gone down but if you look what happened now sunset mood boom it really pulls those oranges back and I really love the Edit on this image but it and yeah some of these images are ones I have instagrams before again another kind of stiffen shot the silhouettes of trees here's the clouds in the sky and I just apply that preset boom there you go cool so let's move on to the tundra shots or if I call this one stark tundra and this you can see immediately I really like use the the vignette here might not be able to taste and it's very easy to remove if you don't want it we just scroll down here post crop vignette you can take that vignette off if you think's a bit extreme but yeah I've really played around the coloring I brought the highlights down to bring all this kind of detail in the sky faded the blacks again a little bit and yeah I've kind of tried to meet the greens pulled the saturation of the greens down what I've realized it might be a good idea guys is if I just show you a split screen of before and after this might be nicer for you to kind of get me an idea of so let me pull these ups it gives you a bit more so before and after as you can see let's click onto the next one so this is the same as soon as I apply the preset you'll see just boost it but it looks a bit more moody I think when you're going to some of these kind of climates and places in the world it feels a bit moodier it feels a bit kind of yeah I've used the word Stark in the in the name of this pretty set but as you as you can see I'm assuming in I've really kind of pulled a lot of contrast and tried to really enrich these these blues and then finally yeah let's look at this one yeah again it just I think yeah added a bit tiny bit clarity pull the shadows up because you can see it kind of really enhances that image and makes it pop a lot more let's go on to the this is in Peru Peruvian palette so yeah again use a bit of a not as extreme but used a bit of a vignette and yeah really messed with kind of pulling the highlights down to get this detail just adjusted kind of exposure control and then again trying to meet the greens a little bit some of these presets are more extreme than others I quite like this one it's not too extreme again check this out so if I preview in palette yeah I mean this one you can really notice the faded blacks and kind of really trying to focus in the subject of that image with the vignette and this one might be a bit extreme with the vignette but like I said quite easy to remove that it might look a bit nicer and you can really play you might want to you might want to pump the the exposure up if you want a bit of a brighter image it's it's very easy to play with once you've applied the preset this is a nice shot I got out of the train window on the way to Machu Picchu in Peru and there you go guys before and after that's the final shot and obviously I'm not cropping any of these images and you might want to give them a crop and you can kind of rotate them too for me I like to kind of keep my verticals straight swipe I probably kind of pull in there and these lines obviously for using the rule of thirds which we can do a bit more of a depth video at some point about composition and learning kind of photography together they go might be a nicer composition there anyway on the woods so this is brighter colors now moving into this trip in Mexico and I was driving the happiness bus back from Mexico so this is the preset this is I've called it Mexican streets very strong vivid colors there and I really love this preset what I might do is well guys and again this is if you want to get a bit more advanced and play around with it yourself but as you notice this image isn't kind of quite straight the house is at an angle and what's brilliant about Lightroom is you can skew the image so you go down to transform you can pull the the horizontal here across until the image looks a bit more kind of kind of straight on there and then I'd be tempted to kind of rotate that image as well so it kind of as you can see this the top of the roof here is straighten for me already that's looking way cooler and then I would again like I was showing you can then crop that in but you can see how fast I'm doing all of this that is amazing in it and then if you if you look at the before and after coloring wise yeah it just pops especially that beetle that looks amazing that car and then if I reset you see yeah the whole kind of image doesn't look straight so those are some other things you can play around with but that is kind of depending on the image each image is shot differently and of it obviously I probably could have shot this image a bit better but there you go and then again Mexican streets boom you see that kind of sudden pop of colors and contrast and yeah really loving that another one outside this was Sammy gets the door and I might just bring the exposure down a little bit on that and yeah you get that fine a strong powerful coloring and yeah I would love to see what you guys do with this precip so I think it's it's very unique moving on to an even more unique preset actually inspired by a guy on Instagram I cannot pronounce his second name but his name's Brandon I'll link in below but if you look at this I'll call it magic Twilight now it's a really unique look it might not be your taste but I love it and and I think for kind of evening images obviously you see there I've really faded the blacks I've pumped a lot of blue into the shadows but you might want to play around with the coloring here and just create a warmer look by just kind of pumping up the the yellow a bit in the photo and but it's kind of yeah I've kind of reduce the contrast pump the clarity but as you can see it's a pretty stunning image again if I apply that preset to this shot of a mosque in Abu Dhabi magic Twilight boom I mean super crazy colors it kind of Pumped the the blue if you look side-by-side here kind of it brings in a lot of kind of Pink's that maybe this the first place really gives you a more interesting sky because that's a very dark kind of just pitch black sky there but I found just and again with this image look at how interesting that is pulling up the shadows the blacks to fool the clarity just for me and yeah this is this is quite incredible the gradients have used to pull this color up I really love this look so let's move on to some green kind of forest vibes and this is in California on a road trip order I think two years ago and right let's go for forest adventures again the kind of muted faded blacks really kind of tried to work with these greens I really love this image this is one of my favorite images of the Wonder bug as you can see have really played around with this and if you look side-by-side I try to kind of yeah just just enhance the whole image again if not it might just be a subtle change but I feel like yeah this is a great look again if I apply that to this image really makes everything pop you know the contrast pulling the highlights down you might even want to reduce the exposure even a bit more on this image it's quite a strong look there but yet but but subtle but definitely makes the image pop and then finally for the forest adventures boom look at that so it has reduced the vibrancy of the greens a bit but creates quite an exciting look for me that's yeah that is definitely a kind of adventure look and the other thing to see here is as you crop any of these images again if I'm going to crop for a square for Instagram or a kind of portrait ratio for Instagram four four five and as you apply that the vignette moves into the crop that you've made moving on to the the street shots I took an India of the people here this older women and these kids in the street and then this cool temple if I apply the Bombay Brite to this you can really see that pop straight away I really love the kind of pulling those blues more turquoise if you look side by side and just everything about that image looks better to me really making the vibrant kind of skin tones and the oranges and the wall here just everything like that pulling the contrasts yeah I really love the Edit on this one again that's that's no tweaking that's straight just applying the preset and then moving on applying the same preset to this temple again just brings the colors out and I've just popped pump the shadows a little bit to get more detail back in there the clarity is high and side by side you can just look that just that's just a much nicer image and then finally I've got some updates there to do finally this this lady popped that Bombay bright and yeah as you can see just much stronger more vivid and for me this this kind of look feels more of a real representation of being in colorful vibrant countries like India let's move on to the final preset I've prepared for you guys and yeah this is the arabian sun preset so this again faded the blacks and i've kind of not gone overboard and the vibrancy of the colors but wanted to kind of darken things a bit and yeah just said bring a bit of mystery to these shots which yeah i really enjoy taking these when we're in Abu Dhabi again just if you look side by side it's quite subtle but yeah a very kind of distinctive look I'm not imagining all of these filters are your taste and that's why those kind of annoying different ones maybe you travel the world like me and you take photos in all different types of locations and you want to play around with all of these you can also mix these up so you might decide that the Arabia and Sun look if you see the preview here in the top left isn't quite a look if you hover over maybe the Bombay bright actually fits this photo better for what you want or you know any of these might might suit but you can kind of scroll through and have a look like I said each of these presets can be tweaked and hopefully you guys are going to enjoy playing around with these I have linked below where you can purchase them try them out I would love for you to tag me send them to me when you've applied this preset to your image on Instagram I'd love to see how they look and I could I would love to

[Music] good morning guys I've just taken a few days off vlogging I've been resting up in this beautiful little air B&amp;B tucked away in the hillsides near Kona and it's been just what I've needed this little like sanctuary just to recuperate and yeah I've realized I've been completely burnt out I'm sure you're not surprised but it's been yeah a very intense couple of months and I'm happy with with her this week here in Hawaii just to kind of rest and gain some energy and yeah I feel like I've done that I'm heading off now and I'm actually going over to this University this Christian University it's the why WOM base in in Hawaii I don't know if any of you know about why I Amish like this Christian organization youth with a mission and yeah they're pretty cool and I met some of the guys in Denny's a couple of nights ago anyway I've been hanging out with them we went and watched the sunset the other night and they've invited me to come and hang out and potentially share a little bit at one of their classes they're doing like a kind of media class I guess video workshops and stuff like that anyway I'm gonna go in them yeah meet the guys hang out with them and then they're kindly offered to hosting me as well I'm gonna be staying with some of the guys crashing in their couch the next kind of nice getting to know them a bit and hopefully as well they've connected me with a local Hawaiian lady who will get to interview so it's gonna be a fun day [Music] right guys I've arrived this is Zane yeah we watch the sunset we have a night like I'm saying and yeah today I'll try and give you a little bit of a tour if I can of this like compass because this is incredible I had a little look here last night but this is really inspiring and yeah hopefully I'll get to meet some cool guys is this the closer and it's like a media video class okay so basically training people on how to take love tea into the world basically the way you do it for those of you that don't know me I have been making videos in YouTube for the last like probably like five years over five years now and most of that has been daily vlogs I take the occasional day off and then yeah built a relatively big audience in YouTube and the last two and a half months I've been doing a particular trip which has been probably the biggest adventure but the most challenging adventure I've been on yet and that's circumnavigating the world in a small plane that my friend JP is flying success in a 210 and in the next couple of days we're going to be doing our final leg to California and I've been trying to vlog the whole thing I'm a little bit behind in my videos I think the one I just uploaded this mornings from Pakistan and then from there we went to India Sri Lanka Malaysia Bali Australia New Zealand Fiji American Samoa Christmas Island and then here so there's a few videos to come there and one of the other big challenges on this trip for me is as well as making the videos in YouTube I wanted to create some content that was something I could share with the rest of the world people that aren't necessarily subscribe to my channel or maybe they don't go on to you too much so I decided to embark on making like a short documentary about trip and I wanted to focus on how we're all connected as humanity how we're all United and I guess celebrating the different diverse cultures that we come across rather than the kind of segregation and conflict we see in the media a lot is actually saying like we want to embrace people around the world and also here hearing from other people it's been so encouraging for me and I was saying to these guys the other night they're the one thing that everyone share shared that when I asked up what do we all share in common was the need to be loved no matter what culture or religion or any any one we spoke to that was the resonating thing that people were saying is that yeah that they they feel the need to be loved and that's something that I guess all humans do across the world so it's gonna be really a really cool film hopefully it will have a bit of an impact and I'd love to share it far and wide once we once we get it edited and stuff early next year right wow that's pretty awesome we had like two hours of they have me sharing my life and answering questions and chatting with a lot of these kids everyone's just I'm excited to this lot because they are like they've just started I think they're a month into being here on the campus and they're gonna be heading out all around the world doing like missionary trips and I don't know I'm excited they all seem super pumped about life it's good to be around a lot of positive people that are wanting to change the world and yeah now we're going on a little tour these boys are taking me around the campus where we head in our guys CrossFit gym they run to train people to hike oh nice and then later on we need to go back and see the treehouse again in the day guys in a minute I'll take you to there's this like awesome tree and they've built like this tree house that looked like a boat in it and I went up in there late last night but I can really see a lot but it's fear was inspirational it was inspirational something that's really cool that they just told me about is that this little area in here is for when people are leaving because they've got people comes kind of coming in and out of the campus all the time it's like constant like conveyor belt people this is like a thrift store but it's like free for people just to come and like take from so like people drop off stuff when they're ready to go and then it's like people the neat stuff they can come and take it though I like it what's going on over here what are these what are these trees banyan trees every time this grows it starts a new trunk that grows up instead of my trunks growing up they grow from the top and come down so these start it at the top and then they touch the ground and then they the roots go in and they know I have no idea this is how they I mean I can see it now you've mentioned it but I just had no idea that's how it oh you've never had so much fun climbing a tree it's like it's crazy okay this is so insane this is like my absolute dream yeah if I could make a treehouse like this this would be like my life goal yeah yeah but like but like more put multiple treehouses connected these are the yeah these are the bridges you want like these are pretty safe as well like because these are like kid-friendly yeah it's true you wouldn't worry about like someone falling off that yeah I think let me like a bit more room maybe like four times this may or may be multiple rooms if you go this is so cool yeah this is like a kid's dream this is like my dream guys this is one of my favorite things about the whole campus is in the entrance here they've got this fountain just surrounded by like not every nation but a lot of nations flags [Music] great news I finally found someone with Hawaiian heritage to interview this is lady I don't know much about her but people have said she's like the perfect subject chatty she hasn't got long she's probably got like a 20-minute slot so I'm racing now I'm gonna go back and pick up this guy meek who we were hanging out with this morning and he's gonna help me film a little bit and some good content for the documentary yes bro thanks for coming to help me man my name is Lee Nala foreign born and raised here in the Island of Hawaii Kona this district my Aloha for my place my people teaching the next generation is what part of my passion my family come from this land as well from different parts of this aina and so again I'm passionate about my culture my language my people my heritage my history and the responsibility that I have to share what we have to offer to the world well the Hawaiian culture is wrapped in what we know of the word Aloha so the meaning Aloha is the face ha the breath the one who gives life and so one thing that is so different from many nations or countries around the world is we live that way of life and growing up here is we learn that you Aloha everyone you love everyone could be the stranger the closest to kin but a love was a part of just our culture our language and who we are and some of the things I see growing up and why my Hawaii or we as Hawaiian people are so connected to our place and our stories we come from a place where all of our language is wrapped in oral stories and it's passed on from one generation to another our island Zuber it's love you know it's a gracious people we are gracious people we're kind people we might not know you will Aloha you and we might not even know who your friends friend is is but it's the right thing to do Aloha is the word that has so many meanings and it's the word that represents the people Aloha is the people and the people is Aloha Aloha is the land and the land is what the people take care of so I am passionate I'm happy to travel the world but I'm very happy to return home okay guys we have just finished shooting an interview with Liana Ella she has been sharing a lot about her heritage as a Hawaiian did you enjoy the interview yeah it was great it was great I think the best interviews I've said this before us like I'm not really asking many questions and it's just you know some was just sharing and talking and yeah this was really really cool I can't wait for you to see some of the clips when we finally released the documentary yeah I'm glad we got this I've been worried for a few days because I haven't found anyone to share and you were like perfect I was really really cool see ya thanks so much [Music] I've just dropped off me Kat this brave that why I'm putting on for some local youth and I thought I'd pop in they really know what to expect [Music] okay this is where I'm staying for the night it's a it's a pretty comfy couch um yeah this is a nice space I actually don't know anyone in this house I haven't met anyone in this house maybe I met someone yesterday in this house anyway everyone was asleep when we got back from the cinema and I'm just gonna I'm just gonna sleep on the

[Applause] [Music] as we back home and it's been a really chill day but really nice especially to see Ben I know he's having a rough time right now at this elbow and recovering and I want to spend a lot of time with him I also who want to try and get more regular vlogs I know I've been pretty sporadic but I wonder you I guess I'm trying to adjust to like having a base now and having waking up in the same place every day and some of the days aren't we're not going out and doing exciting things every day I'm like just getting on with some work we're doing things like no working out and just trying to bring more I don't know just just working on my kind of itself like I've said just my fitness and just getting some routine and but I will I know not all of you interested in that part of my life by will actually show you in the coming weeks just some day-to-day stuff I'm doing now like my routine it sounds weird saying that words cuz I literally haven't had any for five years but this is a new journey for me and I'll try and take you guys along I don't find a lot of it particularly inspirational to like vlog about but I guess this is my life right now so I'm going to vlog about some of it and don't worry there's some exciting trips and traveling and friends coming over to South Africa and loads of stuff I will be vlogging but it's just quiet right now which is okay anyway I will catch you guys probably not tomorrow because it's Valentine's Day and I'm taking the day off Araya but probably the next day peace out into a life and live the adventure 
[Music] good afternoon guys we're in Dubai we drove here from Abu Dhabi last night after flying in and yeah I've come down to the Dubai Mall I think it's one of the largest malls if not the largest mall in the world I've been there a few times in previous vlogs and we've got a little bit of shopping today for the onward journey as we're traveling around the world the first thing we need to get is a bunch of hard drives because I've used all my hard drives up and yeah then we might do some sightseeing do some activities hang out some people later on I'm so glad to be here gorgeous weather [Music] [Music] okay we haven't found hard drives yet but we have to start with some lunch we've got some pad thai which is pretty tasty it's so much choice that this mall is crazy isn't it I've been here I think almost five hours if boring is just shopping but it's still amazing it has like I'm sure you guys team up looks before it has like a nice ring one of the largest if not the largest Aquarians in the world and had STIs of skis like a net mother now just has everything you could possibly ever imagine cinema anyway it is crazy I'm sure you could get lost in everydays all right these are the drives we need we're gonna get four of these which is 16 terabytes so it should do this for a while for some reason that the different colors are different prices this is like $20 more just cuz it's white is that we're gonna go up the Burj Khalifa JB's never be done as a Sun setting either so this could be pretty epic and my friend papers coming to join us you ready hey but I'm also waiting we're just tucking into some very healthy ice cream and sorbet [Music] right we've got to the top of the Burj Kalifa this is my first time being here at night and it's pretty epic it's very different experience because you can just see all the city lights and it's also kind of rush hour so there's just so much traffic but it's really mesmerizing watching all the little cars they're just like moving around and yeah this is that this is really really cool you know so guys we're definitely not at the top look how much further ago that [Music] have you ever been up a building this tool before great be uneasy about it a beam up the building it sways they all sway but it was noticeable really that's pretty good yeah I'm sure if there weren't so many people and if you just had the time to like analyze it and it was really windy you'd probably feel this way this is so cool boys I've never seen the big fountain display on the top you can see how fast it's moving might is pops twice in the way down like pop they're like the 100th floor and then again about that here - - it Hafer didn't make it the top of the tower with us but she's swaying outside we're gonna go get some dinner now check that out [Music] [Music] guys we found hey fire it's taking a while you gotta use I like them did you have like a heels on or something before okay thank you we need to find some food now we're gonna go and sit down and chill this is so funny when we sat down to order at this place hey food was just like have you got anything that looks like this do you like pulled up this random YouTube video and it's just like a steaming cup of soup and she's like wish you to be fair they actually found something that looks pretty much like what you asked for oh thanks that's him yeah yeah I mean I don't usually but we're both pretty tired so little a little pre-dinner coffee in the Dewar chairs with your water so we've finished dinner and we've just popped up to the Apple Store because all of our phones died at the same time so we're literally just like stealing power right now and charging all our phones before we head back unfortunately tomorrow to do it properly but we've had a bit of a like a chat tonight when we were sitting around eating just about like I don't load zuv different issues and we're gonna we're gonna have a really long chats around with and boys and religion it got pretty deep so hopefully tomorrow we can just yeah we can get deep it's just hit me again how insane the shopping mall is somehow it's 10:45 it's like almost 11 p.m. and it's like fully busy everyone still shopping I don't know when this closes this is insane it's actually insane okay so he was going to drop us somewhere JP's staying in a hotel tonight this to get a little bit of breathing space because you know we've been on top of each other for six weeks so it'll be good to have a night apart I'm gonna be staying at Steve's house Steve bond here we saw as we arrived them to buy Benny we lost two papers car we're just walking around in the parking lot this place is so big that we've lost her car right I wasn't gonna hang around hey fern JP to find a car I ended up just jumped in it uber back but I'm yeah back at Steve's house now I'm gonna crash out it's been not massively eventful day but I quite like the having a first day just as in like an establishing day in a place it's hard to jump straight into the action so we're gonna have a bit more of a productive day tomorrow and like I said we're gonna be having a really in-depth interview with Hafer I think she is awesome and I can't wait for her to share some of her life on camera for the documentary and yeah it's yeah it's nice to be back in Dubai and I'll catch you first thing in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys I'm in London I've taken a few days off I think the last time I was vlogging we've got a hotel in Brighton well we spend the whole next day just getting editing done working and then briar landed so I've spent a few days with Raya just yeah just having a little bit of a break from the trip it's been very intense the last three weeks in the prep and then flying all the way from California to the UK so I've recuperated a little bit now and we're about to head into central London for a interview with Conde Nast the Travel Magazine and then later this afternoon we're getting back on the plane and we're heading to Germany [Music] okay we made up to London with Briah you miss me three weeks apart guys but we managed to make it work Raya flew in two days ago from Copenhagen if you haven't been watching her videos she's been doing this really cool series where she's like backpacking and interrailing around Europe and she at the end of each video she's letting you guys both where she goes next so I'd be like following her videos and it's been really exciting so you did Amsterdam yeah Amsterdam and then Hamburg and then company cool and she's just taking two days out to come see me so I thought whilst I was in the UK it made the most sense to try Mia yeah those of you that are in relationships where you spend long times apart you'll understand it's it's it's hard but it's kind of unavoidable on this trip so we're gonna yeah we're just gonna try to each other as much as possible but we're gonna head it to this Conde Nast interview now if JP was supposed to meet us here with Matt but he just texted me saying he slept through his alarm so I think they're just gonna come and I guess move this in a little bit and we just grabbed their coffees you're ready [Music] we're just checking out the offices now that all these massive magazine covers I don't think we're going to make the cover but we're getting an article written and I think we're going to do some regular updates for the Conde Nast website just about our trip what's going on also JB's just arrived it's bright hello you have a nice couple of days off yeah yeah me too Matt said oh I just found out I didn't know this book on Venus owned Vogue and GQ and Wyatt so there's like tons of magazines under the same kind of umbrella of godliness and it's condoms traveler that will be featured in hopefully [Music] yeah this is Matt Laura's giving us a lift down to the plane well Jim's driving okay and we got enough room for everyone okay [Music] all right back it back at the airport in Shoreham it's actually Brighton City Airport but it's in Shoreham and if you saw the last vlog we here we flew in here to a really nice welcome for my family and a few friends like Steve and Alan join us for little flights and it's been a it's actually been a bit of a bizarre few days being back in the UK because this is kind of normality for me this is where I grew up and seeing a bunch of friends is kind of almost felt like there's we've kind of like paused around the world flight for like a couple of days which we haven't but because I guess this is this is home for me it's felt like I'm I'm home randomly in the middle of this trip [Music] this is your first time seeing the plane isn't it it's so worryingly tiny how do you feel about the size of it what do you think [Laughter] [Music] okay Laura Rachel and Jim were going out for a little flight before we leave we weren't entirely sure whether we gonna have time for this but look Laura just kept pestering JP unfortunately Raya has a flight to catch not a little flight either like a proper commercial flight so he needs to head off so she can't come up in the plane now but what we're thinking is hopefully she can join us for another leg I'm hoping Australia that would be cool Australia would be really cool and then you can actually get to experience doing airplane I'm gonna walk her out now let these guys head up [Music] Laura how is that yeah okay how good was her flying right honestly Laura I don't know well you better cuz nobody else you have a little plane tour Dave we're just saying it's quite similar whether you're living in a bow or a heart or a plane despite how do you optimize for these small spaces yeah well if we didn't have a fuel tank you probably put a bed in the back that's what we were thinking you could actually just if you were just a solo or you just a couple when you were flying around the world you could actually per film babe in there yeah that would be nice that would be real nice this is property yes even smaller than I thought actually spiritually very much lusha yes it's nice innit luxury guys this is dima he's joining us one of one of JP's friends is gonna join us all the way to to australia right yes and we're just filing our flight plan just figuring out of the details so talk us through what you're doing that piece of paper trying to figure out how to file a flight plan from here to somewhere in Germany I don't even know where we're going laura is the boomerang queen Dave you gonna come from flight at some point we're gonna figure out huge cons California maybe I'll do in California hey still let everyone thanks for coming to see yourself live the Adventure Bay be right back on the flight we it's gonna be a bit cramped from here on out and over t10 you know what we have the traffic yeah we're clear takeoff runway two zero temperatures and pressures are good [Music] now we're hitting Germany today we're going to you Karlsruhe how do you say it I would come pies would sound like I've got like food in your mouth it's not like college [Music] Oh what's up day to be fine yeah a little bit of everything poncho the ankidroid go out this cloud looks crazy it like looks like it just nice pulls off and then there is the other way yeah yeah that's big parlor there with the with the Seawolves [Music] now well we're felted though yeah so we just crossed the English Channel now we're gonna route put it down across Belgium Germany square to the right nice bow it just sighs bow hey you gonna cross yeah you guys ready yeah back into France we're gonna end up crossing Belgium Luxembourg Germany just catch a little corner of France right there then end up right about there [Music] November 2 1 0 echo uniform versus control radar contact continue I couldn't say that was the space I'm sorry but you lost it was accent the brussels approach number 2 on 13 apology flight level 9 0 eddie direct dick hello Bertrand Piccard maintains a lot a lot of it one continue tour like you I can't I just cannot manage the temperature in this thing they're not a bonanza he's just cold I just think that on like a strictly you know point by point faces civilians is a better airplane I don't think this is a bad airplane or that it's a bad airplane for this mission or anything like that I just think it's the video better you had my feelings I mean there are a few hundred people that have done it I think around a hundred or 120 solo around the world that is around the world and small aircraft is probably more like yeah 300 [Music] solo around the world that have been to space so we have some pretty hard to see just a really bad ice here by the looks of it I yeah we do ice buildup be deadly oh it's very deadly like like probably an instrument flying one other biggest killers Wow a because it distorts the airflow so so the reason why I the reason why notice we had ice was because our speed dropped by 20 knots and there's no reason for it to have done that and the boy built up just a little too high enough to run all right gears down how many miles where you got three miles oh I'll wait a little bit longer before I put the laps down never been to Germany before they're coming in my lunch fine fine I don't know I have no idea you just that said welcome to my country my friend thank you little one do it cool you call my plan for pick up on the blue lines parking honest written there the blue lines flavoring for and we're free to park anywhere is it um just take out one of the blue lines so we have landed in Germany it's actually raining a little bit so we're gonna try and get into the the main terminal or whatever that's pretty cool flight I enjoyed that cheers boys I just missed the glasses [Laughter] some amazing vegetable pasta okay so guys when we fly out of Europe and down to and down into the Middle East and Asia and they're just not used to getting any kind of private aircraft it it's all commercial airline is they're expecting like really smartly dressed pilots to come in so to make sure we don't get pulled aside and like interrogated we have to dress the part so Jay please yesterday with Matt when it bought a bunch of pilot uniforms this is so good or aircrew I'm not applying it obviously but like oh this is like crooner for the top button probably close on one side this way this isn't a fad effect you know you need more straps stripes stripes but this is a bright it's such an insult towards a I'm so if you're in foreign airline fire I'm so sorry anyway I'm gonna sign out there I've got a few more hours of editing like I said like firstly I'm sorry I haven't been on top of the air bits I'm trying to juggle everything and I'm gonna figure it out even if I just do like more chilled edit so I'm not including all the GoPro footage but also guys in we have been shooting a lot of stuff for the documentary we've been doing interviews in each country and I don't want you to feel like we're just you know flying through a few people have mentioned you know barely stopping but we are doing our best to kind of interview people and also we want to leave as much time for the Middle East and Asia as possible and kind of the more unique locations that were going to be traveling through so that's the plan and Matt's been making his own videos from this trip so those will be slowly getting released over the next couple of months probably yeah so make sure you are subscribed to him if you haven't already and he'll give you a bit more in-depth understanding of the flying and what's going on I'm kind of just observing so my vlogs aren't particularly accurate or technical information about the flying but that's where that's where Matt's the the main man for that yeah so yeah links below and give it also complete comments of where you think we should go on a flying adventure potentially I'm guessing like next year now if we have some time together let us know where you think we should go I guess we'll probably have to say your plane I don't know where our plane is gonna be by the end of her yeah I'm gonna sign out now guys and I'll catch you tomorrow peace out enjoy life live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good morning guys I've just landed in Barcelona in Spain I'm here for the Mobile World Congress which is a conference happens once a year where all the mobile phone companies come and show off the latest tech and I'm here with Nokia mobile who are sponsoring today's vlog and I'm about to go and meet the team and hear about some exciting announcements they're making today Oh [Music] fantastic right I've just arrived this is Charlotte and Adi they're gonna take me around okay still pretty early things are getting set up back in there in the main building and we'll get em prepped for the press press was it good press day and yeah we're gonna come out and get some breakfast this is Eduardo our food has arrived guys we are winning with this Cafe recommendation to this now [Music] I am loving the vibes this morning here in Barcelona good food interesting streets are just the few streets we walk to get to that cafe is like beautiful architecture for freee these people like skating everywhere feels very creative here [Music] cool guys the announcements happening in less than an hour and I've managed to now neo here he is going to talk me through the what they're announcing so I'm getting a sneak peek at the new Nokia phones there's five of them they're announcing today first we're going to do shoot is the all-new Nokia 8110 very old day yeah many of you might remember it as the as the banana fired it was also a star at a certain Hollywood Hollywood blockbuster it's got things like Google assistant it's got Gmail it's got your Google Maps Facebook Twitter all ready to go and of course not very fun you know you just slide to answer the call you sided shut it away for the weekend if I wanted to chill out a bit from social media what's the note so the second phone here is super-exciting phone store so this is the all new Nokia one and the Nokia one is really an answer to a problem a lot of people find in the smartphone market where typically low-cost smartphones have offered a very very poor experience it's inherently color polycarbonate nice nice scratch it the color runs all the way through the material so it all looks great I'm I would definitely scratch it I'm pretty rough with my in my tech this product is is machined out of a single block of 6000 series aluminium so I mean we start the brick of aluminium and we carve out of that the body so you see it's completely seamless and we're bringing Zeiss optics to the Nokia 6 for the first time murmuring high-end features like dual site imaging so that's the ability to use your front and rear camera at the same time oh yeah what's that called both fit both ear so let guys there's there's me and Neil and love it so allows you to refocus it and then I saw can you do like a little they go around the corner this is actually a key improvement in this new version yeah cool site so all of these people told us they wanted to still be on a captured both side but they want to put the emphasis more on one part of the story in our eyes so picture-in-picture yeah and this is like the feature that jumped out me initially as someone is not really into the video side about I was like oh how could they use that could I be live-streaming something and kind of reacting to you go or explaining something whilst and showing something else I don't know I'm an experiment with it but I love that future that's cool ya know it's a lot of fun so this is the new Nokia seven plus it's got absolutely beautiful 18 nine six inch full HD Plus display but we've got a 12 megapixel main sensor it's features large micron pixel technology so each pixel is 1.4 microns in size so they're bigger they're they catch more light they're more sensitive and we pair that with a 13 megapixel telephoto lens that gives you 2 times optical zoom and then lastly we're introducing the all-new naw curate Sirocco we machine this has stainless steel so actually see at the edge so the edges this is a stainless steel chassis it's just 2 millimeters slim at the edge you see the dual diamond cut yeah and then we wrap it front them back with 3d Gorilla Glass 5 can I try and bend it ok so actually in our bend test it actually took up to 450 pounds of pressure I feel really weird so so it's probably it's probably it don't try this at home but it shows you the sort of quality that we're engineering the device to yeah Wow ah thanks for your time that's really really cool yeah right all the pressur arriving this is you ho he's about to do the keynote you excited I can't wait to chow afters I think we're doing a little interview later on yeah Coco what's your what's your role the chief product officer ok you're the guy to talk to you then ok good luck good luck four minutes - cheeky comfy you're cheeky coffee what's this ah perfect I'll just have it black that's fine thank you so much I've got a cheeky one I really love the butts before events like this because I've been chilling with all the staff people behind the scenes as well people grinding around and get everything organized like I don't know I love it a lot miss minister I haven't been in event so many years I totally relate to it so I know kind of it's not like stress is like kind of chaos and if people that perform well under pressure I guess do weather and I've been organizing and being part of things like this everyone's gonna stick [Applause] [Music] respect the device to be bright eight-five doors keep our camera features of my diving sensor technology we combine for pizza to watch Newport Beach so we put a few friends models so you depend on the quality of your cap by possessing extraordinary phone [Music] give it these interviews with some of the main guys at monkey mobile film it that's not a camera die set filming I haven't quite memorized the questions of the circus my name is Johanna because I'm the chief ride officer at HMV global okay I look up at the product you did fantastically with the the keynote by the way what would you say out of all the phones your favorite feature is personally is that difficult question that is a difficult question yeah I would say like because all of them have something unique then like I'm really proud I was actually using the Nokia one that's my daily phone for a month well as we were finalizing the software so I simply took my SIM card out of my Nokia 7 plus restored all of the same applications and I started running with it well I love about these phones as well as like how accessible this is to so many people now around the world whereas what usually I think of a smartphone it is high-end at a high price bracket but sit when you announce this and the price these are selling for I was like yeah and away some like this is and this is like everything you need in it and that's actually a key part of Nod Nokia has always been about yeah right and that's why we're so passionate about the feature phone segment as well it is a lot harder to deliver a great experience the lower you go on a cost thank you thank you I'm gonna do a little I'm gonna do a little Instagram like story [Music] I can tell me what your role is not here I'm the chief marketing officer Hatem de globo I felt the excitement of the build-up before the keynote because I could you know as upstairs with all you guys and like you know being everyone scrambling to get ready and then all the press coming in so I felt excited well of course you know it's a big day for us and we've been really preparing for this for a long time tell me more about what's on behind the kind of the whole ad campaign I saw some of it yes yes we were first you know thinking that should we go to California or Cape Town where you just came from and just to some beautiful people or nice sunny beaches and so on but then we realize that no seriously we need to remind people that they are going to use these products in real life situations so therefore we we are saying that the ordinary life that we all actually living deserves an external phone well congratulations on today I think it was a master suite thank you thank you thank you and how long I'm gonna be here I'm leaving tomorrow but it's been great okay being able to celebrate this launch with you guys yes right I've just come up to my bag and everyone's still hard at work sawing everything out for the launch today I'm gonna go and check in to my hotel because I literally stroke the water here a lot of fun I love that they have bananas next to the yellow phone this is literally the banana phone yeah I'm setting that down as a fun day mm-hmm tasty banana okay the plan is tomorrow so this is just like the press day for the Nokia mobile launch the plan is tomorrow I'm going to a different venue for the Mobile World Congress day I think that's where it starts like properly and it's going to be massive it's gonna be loads of people there and there's going to be a whole kind of like Nokia village area set up where I'm gonna be hanging out chilling with these guys and yeah I'm pumped Barcelona is way more vegan friendly than I realized I think just even on this street there's like three vegan restaurants it's it's awesome so I'm heading into this place now the veggie garden main course has arrived it's the tarley vegan thali which is like an arrangement of Indian dishes as you know curry is like my number one food safe and well excited do you know the craziest thing about this place is is that starter mains dessert and a drink is all 9 euros 25 which is just over $10 honestly if you're ever in Barcelona alike you have to come here you just have to such a good move okay guys I'm in the hotel I just heard this banging outside and everyone's on their balconies with pants hitting their pants look what is this in someone's Spanish tell me what is going on literally all the balconies like over here as well taking it [Applause] what is going on [Applause] no anyway um I'm gonna bunker down for the night get some editing done and yeah okay she knows tomorrow for another fun day literally um I'm flying out tomorrow and go back to Cape Town tomorrow so it's like two days of bars later not even anyway I will catch you guys in the morning peace out enjoy life live the adventure 
[Music] good morning guys is a nice day here in the Dominican Republic we're just about to head out on a bit of an adventure we were gonna head out earlier than this but I had some problems rendering and uploading my blog so that's some sorted now and yeah we're gonna go into town buy some shorts maybe some flip-flops and then how many flip-flops and then yeah and then we're gonna head to the beach how you guys doing okay alright we just pulled over found this little store we're gonna duck in to get some Surrey short there's all these look at these cute puppies hello puppy happy puppy lover I know rise just totally converted me I only like puppies but oh my god now you're obsessed flip-flops have the honors I also found some these would be these will kind of make their swimming shorts but look just doesn't make any sense this reckons they are quadruple XL but they really aren't like this is a tiny waist the nearest town to where we're staying seminar has this really cool and pedestrian bridge out to these islands you can see here this is the start of it and this is gonna go all the way out you've seen a second it's pretty unique like you can see it on on the map and it just goes out for ages in over the city so yeah go check it out maybe chill on the beach for a little bit I'm hoping there's a cafe there where we can get like a little coffee or there was there was a very big sign saying do not cross I don't know I don't know why it's like there's like a big gap in the bridge maybe there's another maybe there's like another entrance bit a caution stop construction ahead of what this is I mean we will tell pretty quickly if we can't cross it I think you know these big hurricanes I've been hammering the South southern states that come through the Caribbean and apparently a few of them that caused some pretty bad damage here but this brick I mean it looks sturdy to me [Music] it's really nice coming back to a place I've been before but exploring new parts of it and this is the bridge I saw when I was here with Raya but we never got to come out here this is way cooler than it looks guys check out this starfish below us and they're actually so beautiful oK we've reached the end of this bridge you have no idea what's on this island but we're gonna go and explore [Music] this place is really baffling I don't know whether it was something in use that's now been abandoned or whether it was abandoned during construction this place now this could be a really cool house it's just an like an empty concrete structure I really want to research and find out what this was oh my gosh if this was like a hostel or a hotel they would make so much money okay if I was to develop this place as my house which I really would like I think you could build some cool like treehouse structures even though these are small trees you could like build stuff out this could be the main house I think this would be the living room this Jacuzzi right here right on the edge here then you could just like see it you could be chillin looking out the sea the palm trees maybe the coconuts fall down just drinking a fresh coconut [Music] I'm gonna guess that this place there was some kind of like problem with paperwork or like corruption someone screwed someone over like maybe the league that was like a legal problem this looks like it's been like derelict for like over ten years Oh chicken well it is the chicken doing out here I have to know what this is I have to know is that the end there's no no cafe if anyone knows what this place is and wants to build a cafe here but how far can we get down I finally found out what this place is so built back in the 60s there used to be a two level restaurant bar which I guess is this the structure still remains today I was hoping for a bit more information I found some more information so this is someone that's wrote a whole blog about this who said well stories about the reasoning for the environment for the bridge to nowhere conflict the general consensus from locals was that in the 70s and 80s a prosperous businessman when it's open a restaurant on the island in the bay okay so he wanted to construction began on the bridges and share of the restaurant which we're standing in now but at some point the money ran out and construction halted make sense recently though efforts have been made to rehabilitate the bridges structures for the moment that means walking paths that do not pass construction zone signs and stepping out between the concrete gaps I want to see what's happening now though so there you go guys the bridge to nowhere literally leads to a half-built restaurant bar if anyone out there has a ton of money and wants to embark on a pretty exciting renovation project this could be Apple this could be a good spot I don't know who owns it but I think I think with some goods marketing this could be like a very cool tourist spot [Music] we're about to jump back in the car and head to the beach it's already quite late today but before we do we're gonna get a pineapple to share a coca-cola oh I thought maybe I want a coconut to drink yeah I'll get a coke I'll get a coconut I'm gonna get a coca-cola and a coconut how was it bye cheers cheers Cheers we're way drawn on these John needs one for his cheers guys coconut coconut the coconut brothers take this with us guys this pineapple is delicious we couldn't get more tropical right now we're just sitting here in pineapple and coconut [Music] okay we've arrived at the beach look how nice the water looks so beautiful yeah this is I'm what I might go swimming first and then eat this is more vehicle than they ought to be to area just now we have a plan restaurant closes at 6:00 so we're gonna go for a swim nice leisurely swim get some food and then this lovely ladies offered us a massage so the shorts I bought in town are the same shorts we all bought they said quadruple XL as you saw but they were tiny like they just felt the netting inside particularly felt super restrictive so I thought it was a good idea to rip the netting out of the inside like just the the inside part the shorts turns out it just completely destroyed the entire shorts like the whole waistband ripped off they're useless now so thankfully Durham bought two pairs and I'm I'm wearing a spare pair I won't break these ones burrito [Music] that was so perfect just the sea temperature is lovely it's it's I think I could just float around the water for hours without getting chilly okay we're sitting now for food we've got some more coconuts let's give this one a taste this these are like more aged more mature coconuts yeah yeah oh yeah way better right yeah yeah yeah food was delicious now it's massage time oh why we we only got a 30 minute massage because these guys have been waiting and we're gonna cruise back to the tree houses now oh I think I might fall in the sleep in the doors the ladies down massaging us there on this moped in front but they don't have headlights and they asked us to drive behind them say they can see where they're going I don't know one earth they usually do what do you think maybe they just have to go real slow and they use their cell phones this thing we're back in the main lounge area of the treehouse village and almost editing my blog has been uploading all day still not uploading and I think it's unlike 95 percent of the week five percent half an hour left it's already like 2:00 in the morning in the UK right move to the couch everyone is in full chill mode right Paul's hidden off it's 2 a.m. he's getting a long ride to the airport and then and then a couple of flights to get home for tomorrow that's cool man yeah it's all about push no outside the comfort zones have a good journey back yeah I'm heading to bed now I feel quite proud of myself managed to get another entire vlog edited it's uploading and I'm still gonna get a reasonable amount of sleep tonight I'm not feeling too well my immune systems not performing 100% I think I need yeah I think I just need to rest after this trip as I've seen the other night but anyway I'm I'm feeling alright I think a good sleep tonight will help and yeah I don't know what tomorrow's gonna hold Adventure wise but I think we're gonna yeah then we're gonna have a lot of fun alright see in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure 
[Music] good morning guys we are in Boston and this afternoon we are hopefully going to be heading into Canada on the next leg of the flight we had a few minor things and the plane fixed yesterday and this morning and yeah we've also met art with a map new you are introduced you to yesterday you'll meet up later in the vlog that he was the youngest pilot to fly around the world back in 2014 so he's gonna be joining us for the next few legs just to you know just to have an experienced well navigator on board and yeah hopefully he'll be able to help us alright we've grabbed a lot of bags heading down to the car I'm more excited now than I was when we left here in Bali yeah yeah just this is more real like I'm not starting out sighs this is definitely where it gets real here across the ocean going to like bring me almost the Arctic Circle excessively compasses are gonna be yeah [Music] guys I just met this dude on the street all right my name is captain incredible just one word captain incredible Josh if you see a big sign like a anchor like that this is captain incredible Josh all one word this is the Flintstones complete visional Flintstones meets Family Guy all my own lyrics move on to the right here right now hooks up ripping meet the Krypton's their destruction of their body their problems from the pound of cold ha their buffets right out of this story what let's pop with the family system bars drinks up in we might end up on Mars wind or with the Griffins we will fight with giant chickens up in the kitchen whoa ha ha giggity giggity goo yes that guy was such a joker right after the airport [Music] so before we get to the airport we're just picking up a few extra things including I think some life jackets and we need another from a satellite tracking thing called an iridium GO and what's the other thing oh yeah we're gonna see we've got a cigarette lighter splitter so we can use the power which we got fixed in the plane today I'm imagining most of the trip we're going to be stopping off to get little things you need [Music] was the guide the packing the plane and figuring out the route we're doing today I just whizzed into town firstly to drop off the ten and yoga mats that we slept with the other night and Ken Valley we can't bring those around the world with us we are hanging those sleeping bags though in case we can crash people's houses and secondly I had to pick up this an other adapter this is a cigarette power adapter which gives us power to one of our satellite tracking devices and it also means we can charge USB things and we can charge our laptops and stuff in flights which is pretty essential so I thought I'd better run down and sort that out and yeah like I said we will be sorting out ongoing things throughout the trip I'm sure we'll have little things go wrong little extra things we need to buy but Nick in general with pretty much there we pretty much have everything we need and yeah I'm pumped to be heading to our next country yeah hopefully ball goes to plan we'll be landing in Canada tonight country number two on the trip what's the weather looking like but I think we'll be okay definitely if we get up there during the day yet it'll be cool and we'll have all the audio running in the plane again as usual say these guys can update you with all the technical information I'm actually being relegated to the backseat for these journeys because Matt needs to be up front of the Jaypee keeping an eye on everything so they'll be sitting in the front and all obviously perched in the backseat just yeah I'm gonna try and learn as much as I can about flying and instruments and stuff but obviously these guys have been training for years and they've done you know just extensive amounts of education around it all and I'm just kind of learning little bits here and there a lot you're playing by the way what is it pretty similar to the 210 handles a little better carries a little bit more taxiing that thing and then try taxiing this thing and I was telling my audience you have a YouTube channel tell them about it what the videos about flying adventures so stuff like this a lot of times stuff a little bit smaller scale but here's some interesting destinations go out fly somewhere in a plane and have a good time it's youtube.com slash Matt yeah I'll link it below and he'll be making some videos well sir on this trip as well I'm gonna learn a little bit about the best ways to film inside the aircraft and stuff we were chatting about GoPro settings and geeking out last night but yeah it's gonna be fun he's got like a GoPro Hero 4 with a massive battery pack which he can run for like eight hours on the wing it is pretty impressive and the plan is as well we would really love to get a camera from there on the tail of the plane I don't know when we're gonna be able to fit that but we can have a shot up here looking down on the the top of the plane that'd be amazing oh and we're gonna hopefully connect a 360 the GoPro fusion on the wing here on this mount and then we can do some over capture where we can embed the 360 video on the normal video and like pan around the shot maybe a time lapse is what I'm hoping to do that'd be pretty amazing tonight's the night guys tonight like we're we're gonna do the map every day every day I say it but [Music] we we just landed this little airport what's another state this is another state before anyway we just jumped in a courtesy car and we're down to to a place to get this satellite device that we didn't get before and they gave us a Mustang as the courtesy got this is amazing okay guys we managed to get the satellite device we only just made it in time literally they were closing it as we were rushing there we got it and hence is gonna help us one of the important instruments and the plane to keep us safe so we're still waiting around at this Airport trying to figure out the best flight plan into Canada and as we were waiting and we're just finalizing plans I've reached into my pocket and realized that I still have marks he's and he's the guy that works on the plane this morning back down the last airport that we flew from which is really bad because this is he'll lend us his cars going to stay somewhere last night so new I need to try and get it posted back to him from this airport which hopefully they can be [Music] oK we've filed our flight plan and the thing we need s permission to enter Canada and we have now just whizzed down the road to get some dinner before getting on the plane so we have to give him an hours notice before before taking off oh it's good it's fine you saw it was it seems like a complicated process but well there's more complicated than yeah you should see my inbox it's just like we didn't have time to eat our food so we're gonna eat takeout food in the plane hopefully doesn't stink the plane out too much click the Italian equal back Bravo Airport by the ps3 that has files and expect seven thousand five minutes departure squawk four seven three three seven Centurion two ones are beautiful this is pretty fast flying at night actually feels completely different cuz I thought really see out so I let's just be a few little lights going faster slowly burn yeah it feels way more cozy at night and it's cool that we've managed to grab some food and eat takeout yeah this feels way more this I don't know this just feels different do any of the other four aeroplanes flying I've done because we never flew Zazu at night back in the mid beyond a couple of years ago this is the first like proper night flight we've done this dress actually I love it I love it and it's nice because it's taller as well in the heat of the day get really hot the place even though we've got these little Airmen I'm getting a pretty epic shot of another with their weight no I like this a lot better you can see the water over there and some stars everything but you see water off to the right a little bit this whatever you just oh yeah [Music] yeah so we're about how far out are we were like deadly other way from land oh yeah Quebec City we had a few changes of plans today big garage anyway deportment picked up a Sat phone plans like five different flights going to get up here find somewhere where customs is actually available trying to get all the way up to acknowledge to go over the greens are better than white working out so tonight we're just headed up in Quebec City where their customs here get some slavery wake it up morning five hours of you callow it published on the rest of the day there and then hopefully the next day body cream yeah this is really nice that we got this river that just runs right through the city that's pretty much like here I've heard it's like a very very nice City actually that is beautiful have you been yeah [Music] you'll get now here is this where we're parking okay we've just landed in Canada we've just seen customs they've checked our passports from inside our little plane just cool and now we're just grabbing our bags uber has arrived heading into Quebec City so we found a pretty nice hotel lovely nearby and before we crack on with it editing I find me getting around to doing the map guys I've set up the camera I'll show you a clip as we're marking out hopefully where we're going to be going we might need to shoot this again for the documentary in a like a studio or something but I'm doing my best for the moment we've got the map lay down on the floor and I'm going to attempt to draw out our route it's saying it's completely point it's definitely going to try as it's changing tomorrow literally changing tomorrow so this is the docks oh yeah this is this is all going well okay Greece Egypt okay I just don't follow the route this is this gonna get us killed if we go this way possibly it'll be interesting to see when we look at our actual route when we land in 80 days how close to this I think it's gonna end up being quite different well I'll just say we're gonna fly straight directly across the whole entire but I was in rainforest that's probably not gonna happen okay back to work that yeah that looks pretty good that looks pretty good I kind of want to say like it looks like something like a guy with a hat this kind of looks like a gutter like a peek hat and this would be like the face well it's 6:00 a.m. I've stayed up all night editing I'm still not caught up with my blog skies I'm so sorry and the vlog Amedda things from the from the day that the solar eclipse happened some like four days behind I think anyway I'm gonna get some sleep now I think we're heading off relatively early from Quebec City which is where we are if I didn't mention and we are going up super-high north in Canada and then across to Greenland the following day and yeah I'm imagining I'm gonna be napping a lot of the flight tomorrow which I'm totally down for I may not go to get everything up though we'll see maybe I could do some editing on flight in on the flight as well right I'll see you in a few hours peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] today is episode one of the world flight vlogs if you don't know me my friend JP our circumnavigating the world over the next three months we're going to be leaving later in the week but I want it to start now just to show you the build up after prepping getting the plane ready talking through the gear planning the route properly we've already done quite a lot of planning but I think for the next three or four days we're just going to be focused solely on the trip and what's happening doing some test flights loads of cool things I flew into LA last night and I've just driven my beautiful camper van up from LA to Simi Valley where I'm staying I'm gonna be staying tonight in this lovely house that we just arrived at and yeah let's go in and see JP I just need to grab all my stuff so I think I'm staying in here tonight oh here he is the main man how was the flight yesterday bro 14 hours yes 14 hours flying when I don't have any sort of blood last night back I was tracking JP on this website where you can because they had Wi-Fi on my flight from London to LAX and I could see JP like traveling across the country at the same time in the little plane but that we're going to do a lot of them down the slope here and it's made me a lot less excited for it it's so brutal it really is very hard work yeah that was there's not going to be many days without money flying I guess the nice thing is it was yesterday and I'm already kind of I can't want to go flying again yes and a blessing so so hopefully we're going to go up tonight we're thinking go up for a little some steps lie and get some cool photos maybe go to dinner in Catalina the plan is over the next three months we're going to try and invite friends and get and other youtubes and stuff to join the little legs of the flight and later on I've got this world map that we're going to lay out and we're going to like draw out where the rough route is potential people that could join at certain stages I know some of you that helped us with a Kickstarter are going to be joining us and yeah hopefully we can yeah think of a bit more out tonight obviously like I said there has been a lot of planning up to this point but I just want to make make the start of the trip now so we can like talk you through everything that's happening hey Lindsey guys we're going to lay out all the stuff that we currently have and then JP is going to tell me what we can't bring because of the way I thought feeling a few of the things that we might have to have a discussion about is we're going to fight yeah okay that was a slightly easier process and I thought with pretty much an agreement there's a few things here this is our definite no pile not taking the UE boom boom old-fashioned leonesse not taking my Stoney no he's cancelling headphones and this slider JP got extra weights not needed I just mounted at age 7 s with this suction mount just on the door here just to test it out and we're going to be taking this up on the flight at the cool angle for inside the cockpit this is a 12 mil 12 to 24 brand-new Sony lens that's 1224 the plan now is we are going to van eyes Van Nuys Airport and going up for a little stunt it's like [Music] basically for 30 minutes of every flight I need to be in myself like I need to be completely quit checking everything through etc the lab beyond of doing is living with cameras yeah we write like a set like a checklist I do Everest it's just all private debt it's amazing [Music] guys there she is the hatchet here is our flame I haven't seen the plane since we bought it in what what state will we where do we buy this from again Oklahoma and that was that was awhile ago that was over a month ago right it might be like six weeks ago if he's playing China now and 14 hours of flying in support of oil such as good as we cut yet we still haven't got a name to the plane please let us know below what you think we should call that we need a name ASAP next couple of days we need to get an official named JP suggesting Balu from The Jungle Book that's I mean we may roll with that but if there are any other suggestions we'll take those into account if we don't see any better ones we call it Balu I like Balu but yeah that's nice I currently have a few spots to go through one since we're not there then which wing is that this side and then a mount over here yeah check here oh wow this has been actually built in yeah okay but we just connected the phone to this GoPro on the wing we've got that ready to control [Music] okay guys are doing a little record test to bring the GoPro and the a sub NS this is ideal testing for low-light because the sun's already set is quite quite dark I'm feeling like the 80s will be good it's a lot bulkier I don't know if you can see the GoPro shot down here but it's it's not the same amount I think with some shock use the ideal fish you know there we go they would go around the wing as well [Music] probably one three point six five a nice blue for the clients awesome [Music] and I have relationships if there's even one operation when one to throw its ability one to is Geisler five one time open lieutenant Reed has eyelids also [Music] hey but I was heart is warm innit where is this going now they go over the siesta market private landed safely although JPS learning explained a lot this is actually only my second flight and it was feeling good very comfortable a little bit warm but I can't handle that yeah I'm so excited I can't believe we're gonna fly this all the way around the world and when I say we I mean JP I'm going to be a passenger all the way around well maybe a few little maybe we'll get behind the controls a couple of times but I'm excited you're excited first Lindsay yeah who could be so good you're gonna be on it right I like that's me yeah these are the full craftsmen so that's defined there's like one little bounce but it was like it wasn't it bounced I put it out real good yeah because it's all craftsman to your class correct so you put it down on one wheel so we're going to head back to the house now hopefully grab some dinner maybe jump in the hot tub and also stop doing some planning for the brew and who would bring him with us then you know you know start sketching things out on that world map it's hot tub time it's very important to stay hydrated in the hot tub zone of this wall because JP come from Canada and I've come from the UK with a little bit jet-lagged so we've decided that I think we're going to leave the planning with the maps and stuff until tomorrow morning and then we will be fully alert with it and full of ideas right now we display from the just chill well we've had a nice few hours in the hot tub I feel very relaxed ready for a week of prep for our trip and like I said tomorrow we're going to be starting to feel this map out throughout the route and and I've got some stickers and here's what we're going to make it look really pretty and also guys none of you saw this the other day this is my pocket printer a little portable printer and I'm going to print out some photos of the people that are going to be joining us for different legs and then we can just stick them on the map as well to kind of indicate and yeah who's coming and when they're going to join yes you have to wait till tomorrow to find out our rough through and itinerary when we'll be places and also who will be joining and also guys what we'd love to do over the three months as we're arriving different locations is basically put an invite and up to you guys to yes to help us make this documentary to collaborate with us and with love to find places that we could come and crash like stay over for a few nights and maybe yeah hopefully stay with some of you guys you can show us around show us your local area help us find interesting stories to share and the whole curve vision if you haven't seen anything so far about the movie the documentary we're going to be making is we want to celebrate global diversity and yeah find amazing stories from around the world that we can yeah yes put together in this feature-length documentary and yeah I just think it's going to be the biggest adventure not only for me and JP and the fun and adventure of flying but also just meeting amazing people meeting you guys and hopefully also collaborating some other filmmakers to help us make this and yeah having our eyes opened to just yeah a lot of things that we haven't seen in the world a lot of the mode in a way like we're trying to plan it but also aware that this is going unfold and there's going to be lots of continuity but yeah hopefully just getting to meet incredible people and share their stories that bastard planned that's the idea and yeah if you're interested and want to help out the email below beyond borders at Libya venture club yeah let us know where you are and cool stories and people that we can meet in your area any way we can place them all tomorrow I'll catch in the morning peace out enjoy life a little adventure [Music] 
good morning guys it is 9:30 maybe some of that and we are leaving the Dominican treehouse village today unfortunately and we are all heading off to different places as you can tell it's just woken up I managed to get a coffee but always takes me a few hours in the morning nothing like a nice little jungle trek guys we've just been flagged down by the dominican police I guess for speeding a little bit probably have to pay a fine hola don't speaking Spanish sorry yeah sure turns out I was doing 104 in in an 80 this is a national park so they want to keep the speed slow for animals and stuff I think I need to wrap my head even though I driver in other countries a lot like around kilometers and miles like I don't ever convert them when I look at Columbus now I'm like I don't know like you know 80 is slow though that is really slow that's like 50 those cars Oh oh come on I'll get guys we we basically just had to pay a bribe to the police they said there's two options we have to go to court and pay the full fine or we could pay them there and then he just let me up then he let us off like a thousand pesos oh yeah so we paid notice okay mm but originally was going to be like three thousand or something anyway it was very nice of them they seem friendly they took a selfie with us I like it when I meet like nice policemen you know I annoyed we're gonna try and find a waterfall down how far was the waterfall it's another 15 minutes I think we pulled over this is the place we're going to check out do we know how long the track it marked the walkers this is an unexpected last-minute adventure before we fly I think we allowed just enough time to you know spend like a half an hour or something here this looks like quite a cool local spot two guys have just shown up the little boom box playing salsa I think I think I could spend a few hours here it looks like the waters probably warm enough to swim in as well look at this guy just chillin absolute relaxin to the max jungle waterfalls never get old from it does anyone know any destinations which have the waterfalls with a swings where you can like swing and like you know backflip into the pool I've never done that I'd like to do that but actually maybe I've done that in Brazil before being on a swing by waterfall the rental-car guy finally dropped us off at the gate I'm heading in now drawings off first when's your flight okay so got like an hour and a half and then me and David are gonna be waiting around for a little while Ola with free security it's quite long and through security joram had to literally run that for his flight we don't even know if he made it yet but me and David have had a chance to sit down and grab a last meal together and David's like did start boarding ten minutes ago - just started boarding but I think if we eat quickly we're not gonna have problems sir speed in a nice the last day isn't it yeah it's been good it's good that we actually got to do some stuff I'm hoping this is as good as it looks this is uh the only thing on the menu that looks suitable for me or Windows or anywhere else okay landed in Miami I have I think 20 minutes to winx flight boards it's been quite long going through security I've cleared customs into the u.s. now and now I need to find my connecting flight yeah it's quite tight I managed to get some food before getting on the next flight American Airlines I guess I don't know this is all their flights but they don't do they don't serve meals you can buy like little packets of chips and hummus and stuff but I needed something a bit more substantial so I'm just to get a vegan baguette how most and vegetable forget this is my thing this is my guy so I've just been doing some editing at the gate funny story I still have my phone set to Dominican time so I thought I was like rushing to catch this fly it turns out I was an hour early and Rio is chatting - music is light wait what time is it there no anyway I was mistaken and then we realized it's much better this way around though I was now early then it's if my phone was set an hour the rotten the other way because then I would have just been like chilling walking to the fly and could have missed it just landed in LAX very productive flight managed to get a blog edited read their notes blog and flights like that can't really see out the window literally I could blow to my feet but it's not a lot yeah there's no a lot going on I'm really excited to see Riya I'm going to jump into eben now and I'm gonna order an uber each to meet me at the hotel this is my guy all right I've arrived I think this is my pad I'm glad to be back in the states it's gonna be a really nice chilled week cash not a dryer and a bunch of other friends here and yeah I'm gonna sign out now get some food in me and getting really good night's sleep it's I have months of sleep deprivation that's built up and I need to look after myself because I'm not very well right now peace out enjoy your life a little adventure 
[Music] so is they ate of our prep for the world flight we were due to be flying out today but with postponed till tomorrow morning what we are going to be doing though is flying over this afternoon to Kern Valley which is where we are going to be arriving in three months to have our three-day weekend party which actually guys if you haven't got your ticket they are for sale on the fly Beyond Borders website anyway so we're having this arrival party so we thought it'd be so good to leave from the exact same place so we like to fly out fly around the world and then fly back onto the same runway so that is why we're going there today we're gonna camp overnight and yeah head off first thing as the Sun is rising tomorrow which means we'll be flying over the states on Monday meaning we hopefully will get to catch the full solar eclipse that's happening in the afternoon but we've got a few things to sort out before we go we're just getting the last few things prepped on the plane which is helping us with the electronics we're trying to power their tracking device so you guys can track where we'll be yeah again on the fly Beyond Borders website there'll be a live map and you can see the plane moving across so you'll always be able to keep an eye on us and see that we're safe ah other than that I think we're almost ready we're just going to go and get some snacks as well buy some snacks and yeah I'm ready I am ready guys this is already 24 and we look in here delhi 24 we've got 24 30 votes out it's just not charging a things are usually multiple cigarette lighter charges okay guys I'm just testing the tracking device I've just plugged it in here to the car and if you go on the website you can see that you can actually track where we are on location this is pretty epic there we are guys yeah check it and then enslie's take off and start flying you'd be able to trap us all the way across the stakes across here and then once we figured out our route down here we did a little loop and then this is quite a long flight over the sea this is probably our sketchiest right here and then back up through South America and we still have Florida and then back so kind of doing more than around the world landing in 81 days we need we need food for the entire day and oh we might buy little pop-up tents so we can camp in here buddy just just need to make sure we got the supplies oh yes warm day today guys very warm I said to JP when I wake up this morning every morning I'm waking up even though I didn't get a lot of sleep I'm waking up really excited like really pumped still I've just been on this constant high for like four or five days I'm hoping that I am like this excited the entire trip also I always they think jp's slowly getting excited I think he's been had a very high stress few months of just like getting everything finished he's been working a lot lot harder on the prep and build-up for months so I think he's but I think he'll relax into it yeah he's cracking a few more smiles he's cheering up a bit oh he's gonna be such a good trip thanks for all the support guys I'm reading all the comments and it seems that you guys are as hyped about this as I am so yeah yes stay tuned stay tuned we are copying all our important documents and we've got this amazing USB stick to put them on take this out guys Darth Vader as the USB stick what we just had this realization today that we are not on the ball I don't know what it is but both of us completely forgot to get camping gear we just need that pop-up tent I just pretty much the only reason we went to Walmart yeah I got a gardener snacks anyway all I can think about all right all I could think about was like I think about with food and yeah it was just nothing about anything else so we're gonna quickly fall back to Walmart and then we'll go to the airport okay let's try this again what we like why are we like guys just in the camping section just out like this it's not even in a cabinet a hundred rounds of 12-gauge shotgun cartridges I just twenty dollars let's do it turned out gang yoga mats was a lot cheaper than getting camping mats this is like 14 bucks versus 50 and then some little sleeping bag warm weather sleeping bags and a little tent okay we just need to get all this in the plane now find somewhere for it I got a massive bunch of bananas thanks Richard ready to leave Tracy Airport this has been this has become our home this week this has been very random that awesome awesome that we found riches he's an absolute legend you ever need a ferry tank fit in your aeroplane probably quite nice but just general aviation work he's just master he does yeah you have a plane you needed work done right times ahead so we're gonna go pick up something in Fresno and then hopefully don't camp in Ken Valley but my pump you missed you missed yesterday's vlog you think it would have been we fitted the tank with this manual pump so this is for me in flight to help pump the fuel or we're not using that today so that's not until we're not going to need that until we fly across the North Atlantic right yeah [Music] November 2 ones are at uniform just a born out of Tracy would like flag following to Fresno Danko [Music] both of doing a test I've just plugged my headset into my blog camera or I don't the GoPro I tried office by now try another vlog camera to see whether I can chat see guys it's like oh yeah hopefully it's worse the bar I've the plan is we're gonna set off really early because we're gonna try and make it far across the country as possible towards the east coast there's gonna be a bigger day seeing like almost the entire States from the air and hopefully come across the path of the total eclipse yeah we could pull that off oh my gosh it'll be so epic [Music] right room the little where was cool this less fixed Facebook right up base it's just like a nice lounge at the airport just helping myself to tea no coffee and I think we're getting straight back on the plane because we picked up what we needed to which is JB's friend Matt who's gonna join us across the Atlantic as his emergency driver see [Music] so I tip it out snapchat spectacles birth perfect on the takeoff [Music] you see how there's hardly any red in Hawaii right now and that'll change as well as we keep climbing we're at 8,000 feet now I wonder what the worst please the plane would be Taco Bell something really smelly are you gonna like Circle down or are you just gonna we're gonna have to fly around like that cuz I came quite high over the mountains when we come true next time I'll probably come well luckily that's like quite a distance so we just come over the ramp so we start out easy [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah Jesus that was the hard work right there that was the scariest nothing how the chariots just I just really had to take that through we have arrived in Kern Valley yes bro that was crazy and amazing landing amazing I don't if you remember after VidCon we did a road trip up to Lake Tahoe and on the way and the first night we just popped up the bus is over there there's a spot over there guys so we had the buses parked up this is such a cool location for a festival it's where everyone's gonna be there their tents they're probably gonna have a big tent as well with some music and just saw some really so many cool plans if you haven't checked out the the tickets for the summit there's still tickets but there's still some tickets left go and check it out linked on the fly Beyond Borders website but yeah if you're in California or want to fly out here to welcome us back you better head over and grab the last ticket yeah we only realize it every day where it's almost flying around the world in 80 days which is obviously what Phileas Fogg did so this is our tent for the night got a little warm weather sleeping bags in there and yeah like I said it's looking like it's gonna be a clear night so we're not gonna put there the copper on the tent obviously then get up quickly if it's not raining this is uh this is an amazing first night of the trip camping I think that's a starting off on the right foot rather than staying in some swanky hotel keeping it real [Music] gabey's just got into the tent I'm gonna go over to the plane and try and get some star lapses and yeah then it's probably important to get some sleep because literally like 6:00 a.m. we're getting up and we're setting off for the beginning of our flight and I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to sleep I'm so excited this is just ridiculous I can't literally call remember the last night's excited it's like 10 Christmases rolled into one yeah if I managed to successfully pull off these star lapses sweet I'll catch you guys in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys today we have headed out of Reykjavik in Iceland if you didn't know we we flew in from Greenland this is one of the stops on our world tour and we are lucky enough to go out on a bit of an adventure today with South Coast adventures they're gonna take us into the highlands of Iceland and we're actually going onto the top of a glacier on the volcano that erupted back in 2010 I think it was anyway if we're going out in this monster of a Jeep check this out Louie okay nice to meet you [Music] okay it's pretty bumping in the back here guys but we started together quite fun little steep parts of the track by state track it's not really even a track here we're completely operated but they felt big some of this the rock some of this drive it straight over thankfully the the tires you can deflate and inflate they're like Mike's going into them and then all this time to cool but anyway they're down there like five psi right out there almost flat which means believe crews over stuff is helping with a suspension not damaging the tire too badly [Music] [Applause] oh yeah the first glimpse of the ice and snow [Music] alright guys this isn't a glazier yet but this is some snow from the winter still sitting on this is like nice to be slave up and then we just like hitting a solid wall of rock [Music] guys you'll never believe this but we actually actually burst a tire it came off wait oh but we're a crazy angle the horizon is actually right the horizontally here this is the actual angle that the whole vehicle this is uh this is pretty serious guys look at that you might have might be stranded out here this is actually crazy quite a beautiful place to get stranded though so this this is very rare is it in the winter before on this this is quite a sight do you think there's some big punches in that or not no it just came clean off the room it wasn't like it was a sign love it that's all that here you can see in the footage just keep driving Rock right whoa he doesn't I bet it's also big rock oh how we should be okay if we [Music] this is what the tires are supposed to look like and this is what this tire currently looks like [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] guys we've gone into survival situation here we've run out of water we're stranded JP's scooping up ice into the bottle so he can have something to drink I'm just gonna have to eat the ice mess standing on top of this rock to try and get phone reception so what you're doing here so what we're trying to do now is squeeze the tire from other side so it makes a rough feel and as it builds our there it will pop on [Music] yeah yeah oh that's weak pop color a sweet spot coming [Music] alright the tire has been inflated that was a big mission what would have you done in this situation desi I would have immediately put rocks under the diff so that there is a tie down there which she's using to keep those suspensions compressed I wouldn't just put rocks underneath there to be able to use the tie down and then just put it around the tire and squeeze it while it was on the car and I would have been like maybe 20 well the tire is finally back on took a little while to get sorted better I think we're ready to continue our journey up to the top of the volcano I [Music] just hope it hasn't weakened the tire and made it more vulnerable we have just driven onto the glacier [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's amazing to think that this entire sheet of ice is just slowly drifting and moving and eroding all the rocks beneath it as well and then all this ash here this is from seven years ago is it yeah it did a net how long was the where the flights grounded now we have to be careful on the way down because this is all really loose and we don't have dislodge and start a landslide [Music] guys look how much gravel is in my that's pretty amazing a lot of fun oh my gosh what a mission guys this kid I put in my shoe just to show you how small it is they falling asleep in my shoe hey buddy that is amazing [Music] literally sitting in my hand because I needed okay doing a standard add to your right a little bit well I've just finished a pretty cool interview with helgi our driver he lives in this amazing van look at this view look what he lives next day and he's just been sharing a little bit about his passions and why he enjoys driving so much they good [Music] so we've just arrived at this beautiful little Canyon called noite husam Gil I think that's how you pronounce it Icelandic very hard to pronounce anyway this is one of the most picturesque spots nice and apparently they're on there on the south coast it's been an amazing day so far I can't believe the difference between being on top of the glacier and then this is almost like I don't know this does not maybe think of Iceland right now it's always feels tropical in there [Music] go to the end and there's this epic waterfall oh my god [Music] we are back in Reykjavik after an absolutely amazing day yeah I really enjoyed that Jeep ride up the of the mountain of the volcano even though we had a bit of mechanical problems with the wheel full enough yeah it was still a great day we are now going out for Simba food I'm pretty hungry [Music] check check check check check Mike check Santa's good when have you felt the most loneliest in your life when how I felt the most loneliest in life Wow each winter doing January there's a certain pressure in society to be somebody to to go through college to get a good job you have to have good money and you have to you have to have this social status guys we just finished a cool interview and our scare if you don't know I was give sort this out last time when I was here in Iceland we're like Dave and all the boys my birthday trip and he's sorting us out again today helps organize the whole tour that we went on the Jeep of the volcano all that stuff and he also has a YouTube channel really inspiring videos if you're looking to travel here he's got tons of chorus and he's like cover different spots across the country so head over to his channel subscribe to him check out his videos I'm loving it bro and thanks okay guys interviews and stuff are over someone I haven't introduced you to yet is Benjamin Hardman we've been chatting like back and forth little bit Instagram he lives out here originally from Australia but we were chatting last year trying to meet up you may recognize him from recent vlog Steve's done and when Steven Ben came out to Iceland two years he loved it anyway epic Instagram our photographer and I just met a bunch of the guys it's been on your photography course been running this week up out in the wilderness like camping out then loads of cool stuff I was actually really jealous and you have to give me some photo tips at some point bro maybe if I'm sure after all this hectic world fly maybe I'll come and chill a little bit I Steve just did just got a little cheeky coffee both of us have got a long night of work ahead on do some vlogging it's back at our place and Benjamin's doing is we do photography fashion shoot yeah in Icelandic scope yeah we are back out of had it's all a bit of mess cuz I was like we're just gonna organize everything to leave tomorrow trying to charge everything up we have got a departure time planned for 11:00 a.m. and then the plan is we're going to be flying to the UK tomorrow to arrive in the late afternoon and this is another big ocean crossing so we need to prepare everything we can and yeah I'm pumped I'm excited I think we had a pretty epic day and yeah okay in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure babe [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys we were in WIC in Scotland we've been here a couple of days and yeah we're about to head out now hopefully the weather stays like this then we can just get incredible views over the whole of Scotland and the whole of England as we fly down we're pretty much just going all the way down to the coast from literally the most northern point of the UK down to the one of the most southern points okay we have the fusion roll in we have the hero for the massive battery pack rolling on this way we're not going to do the tail cam today and then we've got a we've got three GoPros rolling in there one there one there and one back there all right you guys ready to go rolling one three will be departing to the North Pole [Music] [Music] look at these ruins yeah they do it pretty cool what I can see is there's some really nice cliffs over there I think we just scoot around and then we depart as a fisherman and another castle run and another console there pretty awesome it looks exactly like I thought Scotland would look look at that castle it's a colorful ones right next to [Music] [Music] so that was my most enjoyable departure yet guys get to do some low flying over something scenic cliffs of castles and stuff oh my gosh so good and it was cool that we actually visited those consoles from the ground and I think got to see you prop the air as well and got to get so close to them but is what's weird is from the ground obviously their passive joined office parcels and even low-level from the air they looked pretty tiny so yeah get it but everything into perspective when you're flying around so cool the other thing I can't get over is eyes and multiple occasions driven up to Scotland that even to get to southern Scotland like a 10 hour drive south of the UK and today we're going to be we're gonna be cruise down there and I think like three three and a half hours this is pretty incredible I mean obviously Flying Saucer the driving part it just reminds me again how cool they did that's a cool form of transportation so just update you on our plan we are landing insurance it's Saturday right now and we're gonna be here for a few days hopefully takes people up four flights bunch of people are going down to beat us this afternoon there including my mom and dad and a bunch of friends hopefully like babe Steve and stuff yeah take people up this looks like I don't know where there will be flying tomorrow it looks like it could be bad weather but anyway Ryan's gonna be arriving on Monday night so it's gonna be nice to see Rio because we we not we're not sure over the three months of this trip how often we're gonna get to see each other so we're grabbing every opportunity she happens to be in Europe so she's flying in for a couple of days I think currently the plan is we fly out Wednesday night to Germany Thursday boarding will fly into Austria Oh check out that color down there almost looks like oil or something Louie can you pass me my breakfast yeah one of the most not healthiest people I've ever cooked nothing like a cake had for breakfast I just realized I had Oreos it's not very vegan is it re the vegan fried what yeah how can that be we're gonna enter on our right coming up this is a pretty big ship below us so we went down and get the same for them oh wow that's a biggie we're actually crossed into a clip now okay so I don't know what I don't know what that is fairway cup of tweed I did not think I would struggle with the UK accent but on hearing you you ought to talk about the thing now I mean it's given a little better but I thought I I'm not here they're saying that the way they do think it doesn't make sense they're retiring air space system for the UK is clearly nonsensical the way they run airports doesn't make any sense and then they just talked so funny that you can't understand there's a British a uniform surface 21-0 is 12 [Music] noise this is so nice it just landed and my whole family ahead to welcome us back to England hey okay we've had a few people will arrive to welcome us including Dave Steve Allen Sammy and then my parents my grandpa we're gonna take a few of them up in the plane just for a little I don't know a little 10 15 minute fly around and the first people have opted to join is my dad and my grandpa so we've just walked back over to the plane and we're jumping in now we're just gonna cruise around and I think it's really cool that my grandpa's here because this morning as we're flying out of Scotland we flew over Dundee and he just reminded me that that is where he grew up I was born and grew up so it's kind of pretty special that we just flew from from where I guess my roots are from all the way down to here we're near where I I've kind of grown up and lived living well I'm living when I'm in the country how many hours have we spent in there so far JP since we left California so you couldn't suffer claustrophobia for doing so like no I don't think you'd handle it this is gonna be so hey are you looking forward to that like this amazing [Music] [Music] yeah the broken the I 360 design pretty cool so right now we're so it's just like a car either way and then if I want to go up a little bit you pull back and [Music] so we actually need to be going down and about that direction there so a little right yeah you can slide right down this is quite a physical airplane oh it requires a lot of strength [Music] yeah it's a beautiful airplane applies really really nicely that was such an incredible experience guys so kind of JP to take me and my dad and my grandpa together right and then stand me in the back you ready excited okay we haven't told you this yet but JP is gonna let Steve fly the entire time all right Steve have fun but I'll leave

[Music] good morning guys we are up bright and early in lesbos we've been staying with some locals and I'm barely awake I've just managed to grab a coffee but we've come down to this little patch of land because okay because last night we haven't dinner and we saw this really inspiring group of people that were just sitting around reading poetry and playing music and we thought these would be cool people to interview so and there's lady Emma who has been living out here and writes poetry and yeah we're gonna go and just learn a bit about her life and and get a good solid interviewing for the documentary if you haven't seen the last few vlogs Arya's with me yes bro and he's been up all night editing we're both being up all night it's just been you know again not much sleep but yeah this is gonna be an exciting day gonna be finding some cool stories and we've already found some really cute puppies we can tell you before we flew all the way to Europe by a Greenland and Iceland so we like neva gating the world and on it and I'm documenting it with videos on YouTube oh okay and where is this plane right now is that mean Austria like we're getting some maintenance done in officer we can move it if you want no no it's fine what's holding you great its holy a great point up yes yeah bring it round here grapes it was all about a foot lower this will go on top of I guess this one yes well I was 27 when I first saw an olive tree oh that was the first time I came to this I never seen an olive tree before once upon an island there are fish with green bones and a holiday for flying kites there are mountains no one lives on in towns full of empty houses there are men who spend all night alone on the sea and men married to their bottle of ouzo there are children playing in the streets and mothers who know somebody is always watching there are gulls who fly high for the fun of it and roaming donkeys that nobody owns there are edible greens covering the floors of the olive groves and men and women who gather them after the rains there are young men who dance on the backs of horses and young men who die in cars there are sheep with bells that wake you when they pass in the night and turtles hibernating under the wild bushes there are in Maine television shows and radio channels without advertisements there are goat cheeses and sheep cheeses and cheeses of both and breads baked in wood-burning ovens to eat them with there are shellfish who spend their lives spinning a hole into stone and a spiky sea creature eaten raw that's said to be an aphrodisiac there are buses from the port town to bring the children to school and holidays when the women shine there are a handsome young men who give you their hearts and dealers of drugs who harm everyone they touch there are days when the Sun returns your love multiplied and days when without would you die there are little stone houses tucked into the sides of mountains and some of them have poets inside [Music] was all clean five days ago when my son came it was immaculate but now it's gotten catastrophe messed up this I can give all of you guys your for right is it just holding great it's 15 poems in green and we are standing in front of the voila gate oh because I had a Wofford from Borla ah Belgium and I let her make this gate we put this fencing up to keep the chickens out because if you don't keep chickens out they all over your portrait oh oh so we made this fencing when she was here and she built the gate and when she finishes she said well so no Jerusalem has the Damascus Gate I have a wife this is the chicken coop which was built with the help of one of my loser drinking friends but it has to have cement because there are foxes and so you must have a port floor and he told me this wasn't even strong enough wire so we get that kind of wire to go into the cement and at the present time I have five hands and a young rooster to live in a property with no electricity or water what's that like I'm so hot I it's funny because the men all say oh you have no TV and the woman I'll say oh you can't iron many Springs change course many Springs dry up this one always runs and from when I first moved here people told me go get a hose go take that water it's just going on the road so finally I'd been here a couple years and I had to go and buy like 800 meters of black hose and she was not running water from this oh I get it from that spring Oh oh wow she's named a hundred three yeah this one is the Kathleen tree Kathleen is one of my very best friends and in America this one is bumped by after my grandfather and this is Nana show us inside your house if you're happy to ignore the mess I say I find a mess and clutter it just shows that a person's more creative thank you I think so then I must be very creative so this is more or less my storeroom and there there is no electricity so you work with either flashlights or lanterns or candles I had kerosene lamps for a long time and then my daughter sent me these three little boxes out there yeah Phil what solar they're wonderful wonderful but this is always very dark oh wow this is really nice and this is surprisingly light in here for the known electricity you know and when when I had the house fixed the wall had fallen down there it was built with only one window oh okay house there was this gate there I said put me a window so I got two windows and um this is a surprisingly high roof also for these dummies you some of them you you wouldn't build a wall oh yeah no you wouldn't that low but this is a very high then this actually was only for animals before I had them put a window in here also because this corner fell down this is I call my my nuns quarters oh yeah oh wow this is your bedroom and I even sleep in it in the winter with no heat because I have a really warm the Greek word is pop Woma yeah which is a stuffed quilt but either stuff with either wool or heavy heavy cotton yeah thank you thank you take care bye alright guys we are leaving now Emma she was incredible I think that was the most natural flowing interview I've done yet she just had so much to talk about and such an interesting experience of kind of leaving America and and coming to Greece but yeah I'm very glad we got to meet her this morning and share a bit about her life and we run to have a couple of meetings now to try and find time where we can meet up with some refugees and share their stories down the fig tree oh yeah like that that is the right thing I can just eat one bang the whole thing yeah so guys if you didn't watch yesterday yesterday's vlog and this is Seraphim and Stelios and they basically are hosting us here I've been like putting out my vlogs asking if anyone wants to come and I guess kind of show us around their local area so Seraphim reached out sent us an email and that's how this is all happening which I love I love this kind of spontaneous just connecting with people they're both filmmakers and photographers and just been able to collaborate with them and and create I don't know it's just I love it I just I've really loved this and it's making me want to travel like this a lot more even after this world trip I've realized like staying with locals is by far the most exciting way to travel and the most authentic so anyway we're gonna bounce and go to meetin's now have you found everything so far hanging out and doing the projects it's an amazing experience yeah even the locals here I didn't know this lady existed yeah and you heard my face but I didn't know what she was up to it was amazing getting a glimpse into her everyday life yeah awesome well let's continue let's continue the adventure we've just hit a car I don't know why I thought he pulled away I look to see those space and I seem to driven off [Music] we've just hit someone [Music] yeah yeah good what's just happened Louie that was entirely my fault I I just I don't know why but I assumed because there was space in the road and I saw the first car fell off the cars in front of me would just go in with a traffic light though they would just go in and for whatever reason totally my fault the car in front didn't he didn't pull away into the space then I was checking the left and was like cool I think I've got time to go and by that time I started feeling aways to just know it was like a low-speed impact as like wasn't a fast impact but it's still scraped up still bashed in his bumper a little bit in the hit with damage here yeah mashed up messed up the bumper here a little bit mail-id not good so I have to do a little insurance claim in a long time years like it's not like unto the radio it's just it's just getting this the place in this time mainly it's not a nice feeling knowing that you've made an error of judgment and caused an accident even though it's a minor accident I feel don't feel great feel like a bit stupid thankfully no one's ended or anything but it's just I think it's just cause a lot of annoyance with this dude he'll have to get his bumps or without other know just I feel like more like I'm just wasting his time really no one was like injured or in an area it's like I must have here my like 5 10 miles an hour max just yeah like being it's like I I've been in more of a shocking like a bumper car yeah it's just that unnecessary it's just long in it is long it's just long and everyone else yeah [Music] okay we just had a little coffee with a group of people called the coexistence and communication in the Aegean which is this sea for the region here they've been running for 20 years I only just found out today that the refugee problem it hasn't just been since the Syrian war and floods of refugees coming in but even way before that for the Afghan Afghan war in like 98 apparently there was a ton of refugees coming over to Greece so for the last 20 years they've been operating and they are looking after a lot of the unaccompanied minors like the kids that come over without their families and they take them out and look after the stuff so on Friday we're gonna be tagging tagging along to a little beach outing with a bunch of kids and now we're heading to another meeting to talk about visiting one of the refugee camps and whether we can shoot some stuff there and how you know whether we can get into a camp because some of them a lot locks down I've probably fenced in and have guards and all that so we just we're just working it all out so we just had an incredible meeting with the guy who runs this I've always called him the refugee camp but he wanted to he's been calling it like a residence day and instead of refugees referring to them as guests his name Stavros and he's an absolute absolute legend he was like this very strong authority figure but seem to have like the warmest heart and just love these people and kept on referring to himself is like I'm human first you know and when I asked that what we could do like could I encourage people to volunteer or donate money he just said he just wants us to tell the truth so he's invited us on Friday

[Music] good afternoon guys we are in Greenland we flew in yesterday and we've only got like one or two days here so we're trying to explore as much as possible before heading onwards on our trip to Iceland but luckily we've met a local girl Natasha who is friends with one of my friends and we've managed to me up yesterday we hung out with her last night and she's taking us around today to see some of the sights some of the scenic stuff and then we're gonna try and film with her maybe some of her friends like interviewing them later for the documentary so just learning a little bit about Greenland and what it's like living here in the culture and stuff so yeah we're gonna jump in the car now and go for a little mission you guys ready to explore Greenland last night so we flew into Nick Nick and things we found out as none of the cities or towns are connected by a ride in Greenland so we are just gonna drive as much as we can [Music] so first up today we're going to the National Museum where we're going to learn a bit of the history of Greenland embarassingly before getting here yesterday I really didn't know anything about this country but I've been learning Lots asking a lot of the locals things but hopefully we're going to find out a lot more especially about the the native people the Inuits that were originally living here like for thousands of years oh yeah also guys we're with Matt if you haven't watched the last couple of vlogs he's joined us for a few weeks flying around the world so we're looking at some of the traditional outfits here check these out love the patterns so ornate [Music] is that our national costumes that we would wear for like any traditional celebration or someone who's maybe birthday first day at school like that's what you have the little kids won and weddings something fascinating about Greenland is that there are no trees here trees do not grow so all of the tools that they would have had to use hundreds and thousands of years ago would have had to be from bone or rock or potentially like driftwood that washed ashore but I just find that amazing that they managed to have a sustainable civilization here without wood as a as a resource to build things mind blow and a mentor to light fires they would just burn like blubber like seal or whale fat to cook things and to use as a fuel source which is just mind-blowing so resourceful [Music] say these bodies were excavated from a burial chamber an estimated to have been there from 1475 and their mummified from the cold dry air and clothed in fur to give him a safe voyage to the land of the dead the Inuits would be living in Greenland for thousands of years and then in 1721 Denmark colonized Greenland so so there's a lot of Danish culture that's come in with a Danish language but there's also the Greenlandic language which is still alive today and I guess this museum had a lot of kind of interesting cultural artifacts and kind of old ways of life explaining the old ways of life of the Inuit so Matt was just telling me he read some information there saying that up until the Second World War all of the coastal towns that were colonized with totally isolated so didn't have communication or travel between them and then it wasn't a Second World War where they found a way to connect those places it still feels like in a lot of ways they are still really remote and detached from each other and like I was saying they only travel via air or sea there's no roads though this is one of the most unique fascinating countries of NT I'm so glad we got to learn a bit about history where we off to next Natasha the oldest part of town so it just arrived on this little outcrop of rock looking out over the oldest part of town which is called mocha de lijn it's just loads of colorful buildings with an incredible backdrop of this mountain [Music] so we've just flown drone out to this iceberg out here am i getting some close-up shots of that bad boy if we had more time in Greenland we would head up north where there's ginormous icebergs and you can kind of get boats through the icebergs and get up close but unfortunately because of our scheduling and there's a weather front coming in kind of mid next week we're gonna try and head out tomorrow across to the other side and then onto Iceland so yeah no icebergs close up for us but I'm I'm content with just seeing well from this distance they're just slides straight up [Music] right yeah we're gonna head off to the next place I don't know where we're going next but this is the kind of place I could just hang out all day because it's so picturesque I can just get a little bit obsessive like taking photos and video shows [Music] so we've driven out of town as far as we can and we've just arrived at the end of the road this is it this is it this is the look you check this out this is crazy so there's no town beyond this or there is but not not via ride is it this is the end this is this is just so nuts what do you think of this JP by far the most unique place we've just driven up to another lookout point and I'm scrambling up the rocks Oh to try and get a good shot the other 70 to 200 on [Music] we're back at Natasha's house where she's kindly said we could stay tonight and we're gonna crash in the room downstairs this is her lovely dog what pseudo came again pew skit and he made me a coffee and we're just chatting about where we should shoot a few interviews so we're gonna have a cool like discussion about Greenland I'm gonna ask a bunch of questions we're gonna try and yeah shoot an interview with our proper mics and cool lenses and stuff does this look with me sitting it's great my producer well I really want to do is be nice enough that when you're talking to me yeah this is kind of like just that over the shoulder thing all right if you could be able to like sit down different types of people different religion beliefs or culture to understand each I think it's about wanting to to understand each other and respect each other's opinion or way of living okay so we're trying to figure out how to get to Iceland tomorrow basically there's a couple options we can go down to the south of Greenland and then up a little bit up the coast and then over to Iceland or we can just go straight across Greenland but this little tricky because the ice caps really high we don't really know what the weather's gonna be like over that - yeah we're just kind of weighing all the options and trying to figure out what to do right we've just completed our first proper interview we had three different camera angles I think I went all right I think it might need to work on my interviewing skills a little bit but um yeah Natasha was the legend she killed it and now now we're gonna go and try and shoot the sunset get to a cool spot and then we're gonna go out and get some Thai food and then so ready for Thai food Greenlandic food hasn't treated me too well yet it's being kind of old it's just been like pasta and potatoes and I haven't really have to find anything vegan but I will just arrive at this spot to watch the sunset and I think this is quite a significant spot why is this significant because we have the only house that shows the way we used to live up here including when it's made a factor in stones the dirt holds it together in one and it's to remind us that the way we used to live and the amazing part is that you can see the house is filled with how to call it I have flowers flowers yeah flowers and grass okay and the Greenlandic people have never settled to one specific place because they always follow the food the animals so they're kind of nomadic yeah so almost every single summer of the move and yeah it's the most natural house that you can imagine huh also guys I don't think I've actually introduced Jay Jay Jay Jay's Natasha's boyfriends and he's been teaching us a lot about Greenland too and let's have a cheeky little look through it okay that looks pretty crazy in there I definitely wouldn't be able to stand up though huh that is cool [Music] right we are heading down to the waterfront I reckon we've only got like 5-10 minutes before the Sun dips behind the mountains [Music] can I drink this water is it fresh or not we have one I think it's fresh yeah but is it seawater it's not saltwater this it's on the snow I can't think what's gonna do things bad yeah I'm taking a risk here guys and gambling but I think this snow runoff is good it's we're drinking it so close to the sea though I feel like it should be salt water but it's not matter how you feeling getting down to the fury walking back it's tough mother shape right after dinner I'm so glad found some Greenlandic friends [Music] this dude is showing us how to make Greenlandic coffee [Music] Cheers what's that what's Greenlandic for Cheers gasps to sorta get through that nice dinner guys check Northern Lights aurora borealis [Music] it is finally the end of the evening we've had an incredible day it was so nice of an adoption to take us out as a tour guide of something that didn't mention geysers she is actually a youtuber I think she's like one of the biggest influences in Greenland she has like Instagram and YouTube she does really incredible makeup artistry so you're interested I'll link her channel below go show some love and yeah she's kindly hostess that hosted us tonight playing us they air which is something we'd love to do on the rest of the trip as well so if you are vaguely on our route make sure to email us and maybe you'll get to show us around as well we can collaborate together and maybe choose some interviews I'm super chuffed that we did finally get to do some solid kind of chats the camera interviews today something I've been wanting to do we didn't manage to get done in Canada because it was so fast going through or the US yet yeah we had an amazing day very productive sunset she saw the Northern Lights yeah I couldn't wish for much more I am definitely coming back to Greenland we have all our stuff on charge ready for tomorrow I used all of my a7 s batteries like 10 of them today which is mad but yeah we got some great footage and ya see in the morning we're heading to the airport early not entirely sure yet whether we're gonna be able to leave the country because of the weather conditions but we'll check that first thing and yeah hopefully it all goes to plan and the weather's good we can get all the way to Iceland if not we all go to the east coast of Greenland and then head to Iceland the next day all right see in the morning peace out enjoy life a little adventure [Music]

till we're due to depart JP's fueling up and I'm gonna have a little nap got two hours sleep last night [Music] [Music] we are finally ready to leave it's a lengthy process JP frantically trying to

following Breyer is joining us Australia she came in surprisingly she came in surprising in Bali it was so so cool I'd no idea yeah yeah it's gonna be fun tio he's been a legend looking after us in Bali the last couple of days absolute legends like I don't know what we would have done without you bro we've been staying at Te'o's house and if you haven't seen any of their vlogs oh I'll link one I think I did but B of a tour of it last time we were in Bali but it's also available to stay out so I'll link the website below I highly recommend it's like right on the beach absolute like paradise

got like a crew going alright see you next time this is the first flight in a while we haven't had to wear our official looking shirts with like ID badges he's Australia people it's normal for people to fly around their own plane say we're not going to get weird let's maintain trauma he being done with their own minor particles potato sir and I maintain our runway heading circle alright our set temperatures pressures are good when I wake up in the morning love sunlight is my eyes and something without heavy on my [Music] so excited for Australian accent I'm glad to hear him but I'm also very grumpy at them right now that was just ridiculous who's that up there with the my father hardest by real are ya let eat 30 forms I had to fill in seems impossible to face when someone else instead of always seems to know the way write it up like a chillin some analysts by far the best weather we've had in a long time he just was like hazy and like there's like dust in the air when we got to if the air is like fog but there's so many places just like zero bit so they were visibly been such bad visibility like wasn't clear skies now this is my father Paris we've been able to see for a while and I'll get better Australia yeah Dana lies ahead of me seems impossible to face someone else instead always seems the last three flights 7.2 hours eight point six thousand seven point eight at them I thought I'd have those kind of hours of my logbook pleases like the things that I would like to work on in my life and and maybe change a little bit one of them is free education I feel like every human on this planet deserves that irrelevant of their their their situation and the reason for it is that is your biggest opportunity you'll ever have this education nothing nothing is more powerful than it and then it ends up being your ultimate choice to pursue to what extent you want to pursue that education you should have a right to drop out at 16 but you should also have the right to carry on and you know qualify yourself beyond beyond your wildest dreams the other one is health care yeah every human deserves to go to a hospital when they're not feeling well I guess the best treatment we have available as humans you know with all the technology all the medical progress we've made it should be accessible to everybody the medical industry should be completely nonprofit and social education every dime made as profits should be reinvested into it think how advanced would be in medicine maybe if it was all about just burying yeah medicine for the human race right none of it's driven by profit none of it because like there's so many drugs our second I should bad for people but they make a program yeah one of my favorite quotes is the cure for cancer is stuck in a child's brain you can't afford education yep [Music] that we're currently estimating broom at zero seven four to zero and we're maintaining 1/1000 yeah everything's looking good sir careful don't worry I won't worry it's hard because it's so close the key we won and I've spent a lot of time at all so it's really it is it this feels more like a vet never be one why did one of your toilet backs [Applause] well I'm trying to think like I feel like I'm pretty proud of myself having made it this far around the world and I'm like I could just I could stuff for the next hour like in like really

landing guys Australia pretty straight don't know okay migratory stress of what comes into the country they're trying to protect like the ecosystem estas so they're especially by electrical contaminants they try to put I get all these two tens everywhere one two three four five six seven eight oh yeah we're amongst them anyway yeah yeah they have to spray the outside of the plane maybe the inside of the plane other day the delays of record six inning today as we're arriving before we clear customers oh no one Jesus Wow sorry buddy Blaine another one another one just two tenth row that's amazing doesn't know what let's try to play all right just hold on I just sprayed straight on the counter that's the fat if they're at the back in our luggage yeah sorry right we can't breathe she's like ooh oh it's so good to be in history I can't believe like everything here is here like it's hard to explain but we physically moved a huge piece of mass more than half it around there were more than halfway around the world purely by using fossil fuel yeah it does fit it literally does feel like we're right Western Australia it's the same kind of sensation yeah and the more I do these trips all these flights the more used to I get get to them as well and the more it does just feel like driving [Music] all right let's gonna find where we're staying [Music] all right guys check this out this is so awesome I really don't know anything about broom like this whole part of Australia I know anything about it but it's pretty lovely climbing there it's almost like too hot yeah yeah I was asking about it and they said people from the southern and like east coast of Australia during the winter they like all migrated up here pretty cool and a science just saying so we're going to wander down and try some food and hopefully catch a little glimpse the sunset I just can't believe we're in Australia yeah it's so good with a few sandflies and mosquitoes outs they need to get the bug spray lathered all over right dinner has arrived we have linguine samosas edamame this is like this is so incredible isn't it yeah we've been snacking l-type also good news we didn't get our snacks confiscated we thought half of the stuff will get confiscated but they're only interested in like homes going off fruit and oh like I don't know anything organic so we were good I'm ready to eat and just relax with the evening we've we've made it a long way today this has been good this has been a very productive day yeah we're just planning now like who were gonna see where we're gonna be able to go I think most people will see we'll be in the East Coast like in a few days but yeah well it's nice to be here in Broome we are gonna get some sleep now I've been trying to crack on with some edits but it's dawned on me that I'm gonna get even more behind in my vlogs what's here in Australia because the Wi-Fi is just so terrible the internet is so slow and yeah I don't like it's just it's very disheartening there's not many options and ways around it because we still want to be doing stuff having adventures every day and then the mission it's gonna be to try and track that last Internet it's gonna take up half a day so I think there just be a lot of delays and we'll just have to wait until we get to faster internet maybe I'm sitting there we're set to do some bulk uploading but in the meantime you know other day I'm just gonna crack on with the edits yeah it's gonna be a fun flight tomorrow we're gonna be heading over today I think Alice Springs and we met a guy at the restaurant tonight like a young pilot who suggested some places we could kind of detour to on the way and some cool waterfalls we can see from the air so hopefully we'll be able to find some spots on the way down and yeah I think we're gonna get to don't check out uluru right okay in the morning peace out enjoy life the adventure [Music]

[Music] good morning guys it's almost 5:00 a.m. we got up at 4 a.m. ready to fly out of Abu Dhabi today we're heading to Pakistan and we have JC with us if you haven't seen the last couple of vlogs he's flown in from France to come help Phil and yeah I didn't sleep at all that's like been gaining I was up finishing some vlogs and then I was gonna sleep like an hour and then I just I focused didn't have time to say I might have a little nap from the plane you're excited for the day JC yeah let's hope that you don't have like a fear of flying and small flames [Music] we have a small problem yeah the airport might not have aviation engine oil for us no thank you [Applause] engine oil the third is 15 w 50 aeroshell but whatever you get it no no I'm leaving in 40 minutes unfortunately yeah yeah it's okay I'll figure something out if not I'll call you again okay thank you I can't believe that Abu Dhabi doesn't have this [Music] what do you think of the plane JC that's pretty big this is first I'm saying in real life laughing it's gonna be crazy yeah you got a first class we're gonna be serving three males some Oreos some Pringles yeah to explain the situation [Laughter] well we we have sort of situation we try left Austria with six quarts of oil but at two of it was not compatible with the oil that we're running right now well three we only had three quarts left I have one quote left in the back though I was worried that because we had a nine hour flight coming here that we were gonna have used a lot of oil and and that we need more because we got a lot of flights now and I'm not sure when we get oil and we're in the country of oil and we can't get oil but luckily I just checked our levels that we didn't lose any oil in the last flight so we should be okay to get to at least India either in Pakistan or India we'll find oil that's good news the we're in the country of oil it is weird but everywhere like everything here is - I like nothing they just they just don't know peasants like us what's that all our planes different from every other flight every well to the engine like we're just cheap no don't say that about balloon these are the things we got delivered so we can access out of some tanks at high altitude and we're just gonna see if they fit I really hope they fit yeah perfect right filling the ferry tank first then we'll fill the wing tanks settled up with the money and we are just watching if the most incredible sunrise it's just I mean to be fair I never I never am around for sunrises but this just looks pretty spectacular to me it's cuz it's such a smoggy kind of hazy or cool yeah yeah I'll sign that okay [Music] how's it back there it's okay all right we need sir you get going your dog closed yep everybody's secure your safety belts off yeah I'm good good man it helps when you put it really close yeah that's easy to talk ready to go there if um you know from two one zero equals four coach in November 2008 uniform when the light and variable when you agree one three for takeoff causing 1,500 I play protect off three one will contact 1000 1500 see all right here we go runway I want to just take it left of the center line because there's quite big lights on here our set temperatures and pressures are good HP's alive Bixby not 70 not reply oh yeah it's good to be back at the air yeah I can't see a thing Wow well this is just amazing what lovely boarding I think we're just about to break out of there the haze as well so here it I have just a kid we literally have to like I'm supposed to go directly for those buildings but because we climb so slowly to go this way though right because we would just fly straight into the take the overhead bsl-4 that wind left exactly one right okay don't know about these things this is actually the same just like the photojournalist shooting free throws fellows heading three zero five that he adds water problem [Music] [Music] JC the head oh I used like dying or you just sleeping I just the headset has bluetooth so you can play music and stuff okay if you want to that's it's on there airplane is literally stopped climbing Congo higher they're too heavy I thought that was not fishing twenty to thirty thousand is that I was like yeah well I'll be impressed but we'll get there it's just we're too heavy right now that fulfill okay so we're trying to keep up that number yeah spo2 over 90 okay so you guys just need a path that around every now then breathe a bunch of oxygen maybe if you want to like put it on yourself for two minutes or three minutes and then pass it on okay like that yeah sure what's your rap still reading 87 at the top is our Arsenal know if it's of oxygen gonna take you Africa are you an 85 maybe you get you go first 187 the Uni know make sure you hold it the right way and then make sure that fall yeah it's pretty much like on the altitude that we're flying which is about there so if you just want to hold it on for a while maybe like one or two minutes yeah you can put it on cool oh wow what's up here is went after 84 all right Jay Z's going first because he's got less oxygen in his blood to be [Music] who farted own space Jesus dude I'm sorry I think it's the falafel dude that Paco and I can't avoid it like even our oxygen here I did a deal with guys it's just let's be fair we're halfway through the trip I was my first smelly fart oh and I fell I smell cookies think he was okay those that I just gave cry that's what bad on that is that it what a different way that's a really spiky Mountain good job changing the subject [Music] Wow Pakistan yeah yeah alrighty everybody buckled up no loose items lying around yeah make sure your shoes and then the pedals there when she's back up that's up to you but I just need full control of the airplane quick it's a bumpy lady remember to have their hopefully established on the hours to pilot John continued contract on this one one eight decimal say goodbye contact tower 18 decimal three and have a good day circuit one I've got a lot of birds in ahead ahead of us you guys better stay out of my way and at people as well and well they would hurt us pretty badly [Music] [Music] that's how you arrived in Pakistan yeah getting one is wrong one to one section vacate wired outside contact ground one to one sexy are you gonna take us right between two helicopters yes please I like his moustache yes that's cool a really treat to see what's different between period idea oh my gosh this is amazing so the city we've landed in this Karachi they were only going to be here two days yeah like I said I'm I'm just so pumped how you feelin JC I took it yeah another world isn't it so crazy [Music] [Music] we've arrived at our guest house after a very fun drive from the airport that was awesome I love all the hustle and bustle color and just so it's just like a visual overload just getting our room ready yeah JP he's already conked out and I so fade he's been working hard today guys I literally just looked on Google Maps as I wonder there's anyone to eat round here and the first restaurant I spotted is literally look look at this it's like a castle and it's like it's got like a rooftop on it that we're gonna we're gonna head in and check it out no they're not open yet they're opening at 7:30 but we've asked if we can just run up to the roof and take some photos before the Sun completely sets and I think they're gonna let us see [Music] turns out we can stay here now but they're just not serving the main dinner courses until 7:30 so I've asked if we can just chill up in this spot here [Music] we're just having like a little Buffy dinner right now JEP he's just woken up as well and he's he said can we bring him some food back so we're gonna bring him back although we know I'll have to take this food back because this is the buffet food they said we need to order another dish to bring that to him which a bit weird but you know this is how they do it in Pakistan okay we have some takeout food JP just our place you guys it's it's quarter to 1:00 in the morning we've just been in there in the room all night and we've just got a midlist like I don't know how we managed to do this but we just asked if they do food and I don't even know they've got any other guests here and about an hour ago we're like can we get some food and we ordered some different things forgot about it and then I just went out like 20 minutes ago and they were like all this stuff were in the kitchen like cooking up this big feast for us and it's like absolutely incredible how's it tasting it's really good yeah perfect okay I'm gonna tuck in tomorrow I've got some doll and right looks in here alrighty yes this is all like literally cooked from scratch this is incredible actually that's a wrap for tonight guys it's time for bed and tomorrow we are just gonna smash it we've got a lot planned I'm gonna be meeting some guys who just met briefly tonight you live locally and they're going to show us around and hopefully we'll find some cool stories to share and yeah make the most of our one day like it's done about one full day and then the following day hopefully off to India right catching the morning peace out enjoy a life adventure [Music] 
[Music] [Applause] good morning guys is they six I think of our prep leaving up to the world flight and today there's lots going on we have the plane here at Tracy Airport we're getting the tank fitted the extra fuel tank and the guys doing the vinyl wrap have just arrived and already stuck on the live the adventure logo on the tail yes that looks so good it is exciting it this is different by all the close up it's nice because I get to see inside of the airplane oh yeah I see stuff that I wouldn't normally be able to see like that here was some hydraulic to do it let's get the crap out of me what is it late yeah but then Richard came over and we felt all the joints and everything and it's fine then I felt the hydraulics but it's really good to be morning Richard good morning good this is looking so good I am pumped [Music] it was it was okay one side is done check it out these are responses that are getting on board with the world flight you notice there's actually a little bit of room left if anyone wants to join [Music] just eating the vinyl around the rivets every little thing we do just takes us one step further to departing this is a big one for me this really it helps me feel like it's yeah I know this is just as excited and it's just Snickers like it has no effect on a safe flight or not I think for me though putting the stickers on it it really kind of customizes the plane to be our plane and it's oh my gosh so good especially the live eventually go to bat that's just the one we're gonna kind of get some lunch now we've just been lent this lovely truck I love these trucks look the whole the whole front seat you can fit like it's a middle person the front seat it's like a couch you look very American right now I managed to find Indian food I can't believe you found it in ubud in Tracy and it's actually really really incredible and my name is upload my vlog iswhat eaten and then we're heading to Home Depot to get Sumer I think we can we get that cap for the fuel a lot of lies that'll get us around the world safely at Home Depot oh yeah there you go guys you get anything I own a boat anyway we've just got a cheeky coffee to go and then we're back in the truck Bri let's get some goof-off was a pro strength goof off so we're like looking for like a bathtub plug yeah about that big they use it for like water tanks and stuff we found it guys it's called a two inch flexible cap quicker that's exactly it we're just getting a few tools some essential tools for the flight JP said we need an adjustable wrench I found this guy in that's way like three kilograms oh my gosh okay you can show do you only need one this big you could almost probably crush them it's kind of an interesting thing knowing that this machine I'm entirely trusting my life to obviously JP as well and trusting my life too but to know that this is gonna carry us around the world I feel like I don't know I feel like this is bond happening with me right now on the plane I feel like there's a lot of deep kind of respect you know as we now may be calling her Balu maybe she's actually he hello it's weird cool vehicles like a gender female or male but maybe yeah maybe it's a guy and it is our dude Balu I was just telling JP over lunch that I'm in such a good mood and I think a big part of it is that for so many months even though this has been getting planned I've had so many other projects on and I've been thinking about loads of other things like the barsen and now arriving here and having kind of caught up almost caught up my blocks all of my attention is on this world fly everything is focused on this project and I just feel fantastic because of that I think having your attention split between different things I mean it's called to have a few things happening in your life but to be solely focused on one thing you're passionate about yeah been a while since I've had that so I feel very alive all right JJ's just screwing some panels special on this is like a sauna is it at least I don't need to go for a run tonight yeah make sure you screw them I'm really good boy well the thing is is I'm having to like fine screws a bit and I know it's not the ones that were there before so I mean hopefully Oh skipper if not we can get some capital that's good that's a toy aeroplane held together with gaffer tape Oh I've I've hijacked a desk in their office again just to get some work done because I can't really help right now because I don't know anything about aeroplane mechanics or kind of repairing the interior or building anything so I'm just cracking on with who I know best video editing okay guys it's finally time to fit the tank it's probably only like another half hour of light so it's gonna happen to happen fast JB's been hard at work getting all the piping feared I got the red strapped in the red tape and the red and red parties going off for the color scheme of the plane oh the red pump but no know if you realize yet that this is how we're getting your Field Manual nothing you're gonna pump the fuel so it's not like flicking the switch and having like an electric pump you're gonna be doing this the whole flight and the flames going down you're like public pressure it is wrong unless you do two pumps and you pressurize the tank and then he pumps the fuel up in the wing no big deal okay then one you need to do another pump like one every 10 minutes 15 minutes is nice so it's less than two days before we depart and I'm feeling really pumped like I think every day we get closest leaving I'm feeling more and more excited about the trip I can't believe it's finally happening after like years of trying to make this happen and trying to convince people to help us make it happen we're here we've actually pulled it off well not quite but we're at the brink of pulling this off and I think the thing that excites me most about this trip is we have really no idea who we're going to be meeting the experiences we're going to be having as much as we've tried to plan obviously we haven't been able to like plan an exact schedule we know roughly the countries were going to we don't know really what we're going to be doing in these countries but obviously with this aim to share stories and find incredible people and at this point with so much uncertainty but also we literally can go anywhere we have our own plane well pretty much anywhere we have three months ahead of us dedicated to doing this there's not many things in my life where I have a three month period to do anything I'm used to traveling at such a fast pace and we've got like a week here or you know two weeks at most but to have three months focused on one mission although we're going to be traveling very fast to be focused on one mission it's just yeah it's just so exciting yeah I know this is kind of doesn't weigh anything yes but it would be attached already yes touch me so and we're gonna have a host that goes up a little bit or else has to read a few and then it goes down between the seats on the floor I'm gonna be over there so you can pull up pull up so that's how it's gonna be say tomorrow morning so we've been back up on motel for the whole evening JP probably went to sleep about four hours ago but I've been up editing yeah I always edit best at night because I'm not disturbed I can just focus in there's nothing happening around everyone else is asleep I'm not missing out on anything only problem is it means our body clocks are out of sync and he wants to go in to start working the plane at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow which is in like three hours and I told him before I stayed up all night at the pear I would join him at 6:00 a.m. so let's see if that happens or not anyway tomorrow is our last day we yeah I have to do a bit more work on the plane I think we have to get some oxygen in the tank so we're at high altitude we can breathe oxygen other than that we're pretty much ready to roll maybe one bit of paperwork and then the plan is in about one day and nine hours or something so yeah like 33 hours we will be departing leaving Tracy Airport hopefully going past curved Valley which the is the official start location because that's where we're ending and yeah that's gonna be the beginning of the trip and I am so pumped I'm so excited all right catching the morning peace out enjoy life live the adventure [Music] 
hey guys today is a very exciting day today today that I'm going to be packing everything for our three months circumnavigation flight around the world me and JP as you know have a small plane we're leaving from California next week and I have to get everything together we have to pack super light but also pack enough for three months to create a documentary for me to do my vlogs charge with my things and yeah not over load the plane so only start off by showing you some things I've ordered the last couple of days some last-minute deliveries I've had it's going to be a bit of a an unboxing and then I'm going to lay out everything I'm taking on the trip and talk through each item and I guess yeah this is thing and knowledge I've acquired over a number of years of traveling and I want to show you guys what I found to be the best and most space productive and useful items and tech for traveling with especially traveling carry-on only so I never checked the luggage so it's going to be all fit in a bag which I can take on it as carry-on so let's start by unboxing all of these things I've ordered the last couple of days and I'll talk you through them quickly oh this is so exciting honestly right so number one number one that this is a nose hair trimmer and what I'm trying to do with all my little items and tech is try and find us be chargeable stuff so I don't have to worry about double-a batteries and rechargeable batteries everything can just plug in USB so if I'm correct and boarded correctly this is a u.s. be chargeable ego a u.s. be chargeable nose hair trimmer Oh conveniently I've opened the second grooming products I've got this is again a USB charger ball they like us be chargeable beard trimmer so listen give me looking presentable whilst we're traveling around the world I won't come back with a big beard by far this is the most exciting thing I ordered but it is also the most expensive I bought an external portable SSD drive 2 terabytes guys literally look how small with it and the read/write speed on this is just like I guess like 4 times faster than than the normal portable hard drive but this literally has one USB C input and what the plan is I bought a bit too much velcro but this is another thing I thought I'm going to velcro this onto the back of my laptop this is something I learned from Steve hooker a little tip and then this is what I'm going to be running all of my video editing off because it's fast enough speed to edit 4k guys I bought some of these the other day and then I thought Minjae probably made quite a few of these to charge batteries because we're both going to have an 87 s2 and both going to have an a7 r2 so at any one time we are powering with the Simpson batteries able to the same battery these guys so this is the most slimline charger I found for charging the batteries and amazingly when I bought this that is rad rad power when I bought it it comes with two additional power branded Sony batteries next up this is very handy guys this is an SD card case and inside there's little slots for the micro SD s so in total I can have 24 SD cards in here plugging our 12 micro C's and twelve normal solid jet ski Todd right this is the USB 10 USB charging box so this gives a 70 watt total power and can charge an output each port up 2.4 amps so these two ports are quick charge ports for charging quick charge compatible products I've got a couple of other small items this is a pen screwdriver so in the back this screws off and there's a nice little screwdriver heads that come out and then you can attach the front and adjust the micro ones you can use to fix little things that's broken so one of the things you want to try and do on the trip is livestreams from our phone i've ordered this amazing click on iphone camera lens i guess you can click on any smartphone it's actually a clip you can clip on the selfie cam so you can record your face a lot of the high-end iphone attachment lenses i only clip on the back of the phone which obviously is the better quality camera and if you're just using it for photography and filming normal shots it's great but i only really want a wider left angle lens so we can do at kind of selfie livestreams so if this is going to be an incredible lens check this out obviously I'm going to be linking all of these products below in the description of Amazon affiliate link you can click through those and order them yourselves I've spent quite a bit of time like I said traveling and learning what's best and what's useful so hopefully some of these items will be great for you guys as well oh my gosh guys that is seamless this is a pocket printer and this is the little photo paper that comes with it and what you can do is you can connect your phone to this little printer and print off photos walk around about so I thought this would be an amazing way to connect with locals around the world from different cultures we can see selfies we can hang out with them and then then and there give them a little printout of what we've been up to so this is a little bit like a Polaroid camera but because you can print the photos from your phone you can do a lot more with it I think out of all of these latest things I thought this is the thing I'm most excited to try out we're not going to be on the plane the entire trip we're going to be traveling around in each country and we may be traveling in vehicles I'm sure to get to some of the places we want to interview people and see the local culture we're going to be in vehicles so because we don't have any means of charging stuff on the plane other than battery banks that we bring with us we're going to be pretty desperate when we land to charge things up so when we jump in taxis or rental cars this is a way for me to plug my laptop straight in so this is a normal cigarette lighter power adapter but instead of just USB it has another output as well which clicks in there and then this gives you a USB C output at 90 watts so this will charge up my laptop honestly it feels like Christmas right now I'm so excited guys I may have gone overboard with these but these are little velcro and cable ties the idea is you connect the end of your cable in here and then you can loop over and make sure the wires all rattled up and it's not going to get tangled and I have literally hundreds of cables so this is going to be an incredible addition to all my things on that same theme I bought a case just for my cables and this also has ways of keeping your cables kind of tied together so I'll Ravel them up and I'll be able to stick them behind these little elastic bungee things just to hold it in place and add a little zip pocket and then this will kind of flat pack and hopefully I can just slip in my bag you may have seen before and I'll show you later I have a kind of power extension cord with multiple plugs in it but it's it's been slightly salty and sparks a little bit when I'm plugging in third places so this seems a bit more robust but again size-wise this might be a bit too much for the flight so to check this out this has six sockets and these are international seasoned plugs UK Europe and America incident and then it has on the bottom five USB ports including a quick charge port guys this was something I found from watching YouTube videos about any lightweight follow focuses I could buy it and if any of you are filmmakers and you view the follow focus before you need an entire frame around the camera and it does make pulling focus so much easier because you can just twist this little handle on the side of the lens rather than focus like this so when I looked into ways to make focusing easier on cameras and I found from years ago this guys found this hack so basically what you do is you put this is a jar opener this is a way of gripping a jar so what you do is you put that around the camera lends itself to the focus ring you pull this tight and then what you have is the ability to focus in and out with this kind of rubber handle on the side which will make it a lot easier and if you look I can go fully around very easily rather than having to kind of twist my whole arm and body to keep a hold of the lens though this is going to be great to the cinematics guys absolutely great so external power on the trips going to be important because the plane doesn't have main power we can't mess with the electrics on the plane obviously we don't want to blow anything if I'm trying to charge too many items at once so we're going to leave the plane electrics a separate and external to what we're trying to do with charging so there's our main power source on the plane I brought to these anchor twenty six thousand eight hundred milliamp hour batteries and they have three USB outputs including a quick charge output is the exactly packed come with a quick charging device that in three hours can charge it up to eighty percent charge and I think we're full charge maybe takes 10 hours so guys after many many hours is actually now dark it's very late at night I have managed to set all of the things out that I'm going to be taking with me around the world there may be some things here actually that I don't end up bringing but I've laid out pretty much all of the things and I'm attempting to fit them in that bag once I've shown everything to you so sorry over here most important things the trip is the cameras I have an a7 r2 and an a7 s2 and these are the cameras which I always travel with and I've also got these little micro muff fluffy what do you call them dead cats so this is for the the audio people always ask me what are these little fluffy things for the audio so you don't get wind noise and I have 9 spare batteries including the 2 in there so I think I've got 11 batteries so hopefully we won't run out and then I've got these three charges which I'm showing you I opened earlier and a got also got an aurochs 100 marks 5 this is just an amazingly versatile little pocket camera it's a good backup camera also shoots in 4k and 55 minute segments and they can do ultra slow-mo actually even slower than the eighth of an S right these are the lenses on bringing and let's start off here in no particular order I just got order I've laid them out in so let's start here this is being sony 85 mil 1.4 so this gets an incredibly shallow depth really good low-light it's quite cropped in apparently the best width for focal lengths for portraits then I've got a 20 mil 1.4 same aperture much much wider this is actually the widest lens I could find online that comes with enough to have 1.4 and it's not a a sony lens it's a sigma lens but i've got a little adapter but as you've seen before if you watch my videos it makes a bit of noise when it's also focusing when you're filming and then i'll don't quickly through this is the new 12 to 24 and it has a nest of before but this is the widest lens I have and it's incredible and then the most versatile lens I've got the 24 to 240 this was a bit broken thanksfully sony are going to get me a replacement to take enough light when I get to LA but I'm going to make do this in the meantime and then the 16 to 35 I think this is again one of my favorites and then moving on to some more compact lenders but still really good is the 55 1.8 and the 28 - and then this adapter here actually makes this 28 - into a 20 to 22 2.8 so length of the lens I used to shoot on this a bit when I was vlogging but it's still a fixed focal length but yeah this is pretty pretty epic and then the two lenses I'm going to be picking up when I get to the states are the 35 1.4 and then need the 16 to 35 2.8 which is a much lower aperture to the current 15 35 I have anyway lots of lens talk there okay let's move on we have a lot of SD cards here I thought come around this way because I thought this is really cool right guys I was just sorting through all of my SD cards I had and I meant it managed to find a 2 gigabyte and 8 gigabyte a 16 gigabyte mr. mister for 32 64 and also guys look at the the read/write speed of this one is insane 300 megabytes a second there 64 one two eight and a two five six gigabyte SD card obviously won't probably bring in the two or eight gigabyte SD cards with me but I just thought it's cool to look back over time and to see how with it you know how technology is advanced and still kept the same size like literally look at these two cards next to each other because that same card size two gigabytes and this is over a hundred times bigger 256 gigabytes and moving on as I showed you before the little pocket printer which I'm really excited about using I've got a little case somewhere for that and that I'm going to find a portable hard drive case just to keep protect it and it actually fits perfectly in there so zip that up keep that from breaking and then these all the little photo and there's a little tax of the photo paper and right we're moving across the table as fast as I can so these are my snapchat spectacle fools I've actually colored in with a permanent marker to hide the fact that their snapchat spectacles because then I can do a bit more covert filming when I'm out and about just click the button and now I'm filming them slogging knew that going on to some clips there so this is what I I have on my mind waste all the time white belts and I just clip the camera there this is a piece designed clip and then you can just look at clothes and that just you know it knots into things as you may have noticed my lenses and cameras on pristine condition but it's really handy just for quick release and you know pick it up and shoot and then this is really handy as well this clips clips didn't I actually have one each side the peak design clips and then this what you can do here is you can actually clip in lenses and have them quickly accessible so if you want to quickly you know switch lenses on the go and you don't have to take your bag off this is these are pretty cool I've got this gimbal as well this is the the I can ec1 think it is yeah and this holds the a7 s or the eighth of an R with most of the lenses I have and keeps it really stable sewing this really cool steady shot and that's quite bulky to bring on the trip so I think it's worth it and that takes these cool rechargeable batteries and exactly what these batteries are but in the epic battery these are two loom coops so these are the brightest little lights I've ever seen and these use be chargeable they're fully waterproof you can go scuba diving with them if you want and yeah I have two for you know various situations we might be in a mode we need some very bright lighting well so moving on to my GoPro setup I have the GoPro karma grip I have three hero vibes one with a floaty handle and this is actually a diving housing for going below I think I think these ones that are waterproof you have to make sure the little doors on but these are waterproof down to I think 10 meters but in the dive housing I think is waterproof down to 40 meters which is kind of essentially this scuba diving and then I've got actually even got a colored filter on if we you want to get some colored pop make that color pop when you're looking at coral reefs and colorful fish underwater that's always a must a couple of spare batteries all the sticky mounts we've got a dual battery charger here and these are all the different clips I think this is the clip for the peak of your hat or you can use it as a little mouth great this is for I guess gripping them for the handlebar a bike or a pole or something and yeah just different things this this is a GoPro mount for a normal camera a tripod mount and then I've also and I actually stole this of my friends but this is a really cool GoPro Pole and this is a really long ones I think if you want to get those cool selfies I think we're going to be able to hang out the plane with the poles but they'll be situations and also this floats so if it does fly into the sea or something we floating like that and what are we where we are now okay so I've got this I haven't chat with JP but I feel like this would be a really good for mounting cameras and if we need to sit on the the window of the plane this is like a three separate suction pads and I think this would give you such a secure mount for a camera now this is the the new GoPro 360 camera I'm not sure whether I'm even supposed to be telling you about this and only one is I think nine people in the world that has one of these and I'm going to be capturing 360 footage on the fly and the whole free month adventure and yes uploading it to show you guys right moving on so the DJI maverick pro is an absolute must to the trip all our drone shots will get on this and I've got two spare batteries all fully charged look how organized I am and then I've got the multi battery charger that you can just slot in I would totally advise if anyone's getting the Maverick Pro to get the bundle deal where you can charge up to or batteries at the same time right moving on to hard drive for the trip now this is nowhere near enough space although these portable hard drives these are Western Digital hard drives are four terabytes this and this I guess here's 12 terabytes this will not be enough for all the footage we've been going to be capturing over the four months these are amazing drives that I was highly recommended and we are actually going to try and get ten of these and where we can is post a duplicate of our footage back up back to the UK or the States and we'll hold on to one copy ourselves that is the plan when I get to the US I'm going to try and get a stack of these hard drives and then I'll show you this guys is what shown you earlier this is B 2 terabyte solid-state drive with USB C and I actually velcroed stuff a bit of velcro my laptop and this now I can just mount here and then I can do all my editing off this little hard drive and I can just lit literally just plug in around the corner down to that little USB C port the the dongle with all of the thoughts the HDMI USB Ethernet USB C micro and normal sized SD this is cool I was even wondering whether to velcro that onto my Mac as well but I think a hold off an elf so here I've got the rad power and external battery that you can plug mains power into and it gives an output of 100 watts which will charge your laptop so this is essentially like an external laptop charger and then I have two and 20 how big of these so these are two 26800 milliamp hour batteries with a quick charge and these will be our main lifeline whilst flying the planes we're not gonna have mains power we've got the 210 port USB charge blocks which I showed you earlier and I've been carefully connecting these all my cables and neatly wrapping them up and as you can see here this is our box bag of cables which is a moment I don't seem like any other clothes so I may need to you throw out even more cables or put them aside and then I've got actually another bag of cables here so there's a lots of cables but necessary to charge and power all of these things here the only other thing is my tripod was in Andy's car and he just sent it in an uber which should be arriving soon that's the last piece of my kit that I need and we're going to try and pack it all into my bag ok guys we did it we packed everything into here and yeah I don't know if I'm going to go to lift this but just see how heavy this is to be fair it's not quite as ridiculous loads or is it it is heavy but yeah it's manageable this ban on using is the new bag I got sent to my friend companies pack and I'm really impressed I've had a few bags and I often struggle and we're going to get my things in there and it not being too uncomfortable but this thing is pretty epic and yeah I I'm highly recommend getting one I like all that extra lip spaces I like the fact that I can just easily slide my laptop in and out even once the bags kind of ram.4 as you saw we literally like pulling the zips up I'll link the link to the Kickstarter campaign for this bag in the description you guys can go check it out and hopefully order one of your own and like I said earlier on as well guys everything that I talked about today pretty much everything I'm going to be linking below and seeing go through to Amazon or bnh I've got a B and H affiliate links as well and you can just click through and yeah all of what you want from what shown you today I highly recommend everything I've got and this is going to be essential to flying around the world capturing our journey in the most incredible way possible and getting it getting to share it with you guys so anyway we are flying out tomorrow and it's going to be yeah the most incredible adventure I've ever been on I'll catch in the morning peace out enjoy life a little adventure boom 
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] good morning guys we are in Broome and North West Australia and we are heading south today towards Alice Springs and oilerie it's a long flight unfortunately I felt pretty ill this morning so we've just been gauging whether this is a good idea or not but I'm feeling a bit fed up I'm just hoping I don't like throw up and the plane or something it's gonna be quite bumpy ride because of they hate and yeah yeah over deserts this will be very hot hopefully we'll see some cool views especially this afternoon hi everyone ready okay she's straight up I'm loving the barefoot flying again so much like Namibia so they don't have any doors like there's no baby yeah yeah they went straight through my flip-flop it's so lovely cuz we're flying VFR I just literally go direct to on the GPS no fancy from freaking readings or anything did that to that there right there yeah I think you mentioned over 62 times at this Airport Wow and you have a little stab at Matt I don't see a single Bonanza and I would be very sure that some of these operators that have been doing this for 40 years would be choosing the best airplane they would not be flying an inferior airplane miss Tralee the outback I November 2 ones are at a uniform ready to taxi for VFR flight to Alice Springs all right there we go [Music] [Applause] [Music] other fairly heavy 41 degrees what do you want the grade do you lie to pray [Music] [Music] negative we'll be following the actual shoreline I just I'm trying to stay as close to it as possible but I'll be tracking right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] the red stopped at the turquoise water never see that copper before there's a massive battery we'll see more I have to cut this way for now yeah said when we get down there I can do whatever I want to be a part traffic and the broom area no Peppa to10 keen informed me along with shoreline tracking sound currently 12 miles south of throat along the shoreline below 1,000 feet [Music] well what can we find out here any shark there's something there what is that I just kind of upped it to the air as well dope it fit yeah there's so much sea life in this water the colors the colors is crazy [Music] November 2 1 0 a cuneiform 20 miles south of Broome climbing 9,000 feet heading direct Alice Springs [Music] must be weird got on road trips out here like we need a fuck off work just to get over true oh so like a bet there's not many gasps eight there must be big areas with like Vegas oh yeah you definitely need to be prepared out here you think backpackers could die out here is loose they say a lot of them do do why do you think there's a Betty back out here this is what I used to do in Namibia is just look for people that have got lost on a desert run out a few had accidents you must get into the 50s here and there or do you want to right now at 11 o'clock in the morning yeah [Music] because they are kangaroos down here I'm pretty sure but there's no way of seeing them yeah we're flipping hi [Music] what do you think it's in number one most used emoji qualifies I need our combined well we better figure out something sorry miss you face in my face centerpiece sign you're such a flirt I'm a heartbreak fine oh I love emojis that's why I wanted to get it I think they added so much emotion to text that a lot of like interpretation was left up to the reader honestly I think floating without an iPhone is like very difficult oh yeah hell yeah are you sued I used to do it though I don't know how I got by but yeah are you used to like make these approaches right like this super long wait the other side ever faces down as well right yeah but when I before his iPhone I didn't have a bow geez I remember I do you did never type a yeah we met and then that's why it took us so long to get together because I couldn't flirt with you you're like hey [Laughter] [Music] and he is rock traffic November two ones they were attainable that's not to ten we are currently six zero miles to the northwest maintaining 9500 inbound way is Rock number two was very beautiful [Applause] [Music] Wow [Music] is rock traffic November 2 of their genome test at 2:10 orbiting northwest of the lure and at 4,000 feet [Music] all righty oh that's pretty cool way to see it yeah which way that late spring no way that way and it was rock traffic number two was there I felt bad just northwest of it we were four thousand climbing 9500 heading correct island spring [Music] music what genuinely makes my life better my gosh like I don't listen to it enough yeah because I'm talking to people and stuff but if you listen to it while experiencing something I do feel like it enriches the moment yeah I have to show you the song I listen to when I was watching the norther in life I made it like 10 times better yeah I I always want to listen to me do it on like snowboarding oh yeah like Java face this causes injuries but there are moments to music doesn't have a place like I offered me a mazhab there would probably be moments where you just want to listen to the birds yeah the beach sometimes this is just laughs hey is that it's definitely nature sounds which it's always like yeah they're like music in itself right okay this is a very very very emotional arrival for me because I literally sent seven seven or six then thousands of hours flying flight simulator out of the people like thousands I know it out of my head it is actually ridiculous is better than I imagined much better oh my god I just want I loves as well yeah this is amazing I'm having a really good day yeah good this is exactly how I imagined it I can't explain it you did they have all this terrain correct on the well like I started when it was just pixels all right I am in heaven right now I can't even explain it [Music] [Applause] [Music] cuz I can't see daddy kangaroos oh no really no I love to do see any kangaroo [Applause] [Music] how bigger the pack that they travel in calories yeah I think like dozens Wow a lot of the trees here plant if you look down it'll just see about you ashes where's that from that's a bit a big fire at some point you see all these tracks down here that animals pretty sure kangaroos will follow those as well [Music] this is amazing right so I can go 300 feet lower than us [Applause] this is some of the coolest life I got yeah yeah for sure on this trip yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh springs traffic Peppa - I'm very good of all tests my 210 only to seven miles to the southwest inbound at 4,500 feet will be joining a bad short-circuit and [Music] I will Springs traffic number two on their uniform on a white base for one two [Music] and I was spraying stuff have a two-ounce are you gonna fall short final 1/2 full stuff [Music] and I'll string this traffic number 200 Oh clear of the actor property guys we've landed in Alice Springs we are being attacked by mosquitoes right now I have no idea I knew this flies in Australia but there's so many mosquitoes so we're trying to figure out how we're gonna figure out how to get out the airport and did they just drive off we don't know how to get out and then we need to get to our hotel wow I'm getting shredded alright we've arrived guys I've been working all evening and I haven't managed to get my tab it done and uploaded for tonight just 3 a.m. I have to sleep I've been feeling awful all day I think it's all catching over me but I'll do my best it has been an amazing day it was very very cool I think one of the most scenic beautiful flights we've done and very very different terrain and it's good to see JP so excited to be here yeah it's it's a big accomplishment get Australia and I think we're kind of just making a way to Sydney I think that's the plan and then we're gonna cruise around from there alright I see in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys is the second day of our circumnavigation trip around the world and we are in some Joseph Missouri and we are heading back to their little airport we actually were planning to stay here we ended up landing and then a storm rolled in immediately by the lightning thunder is a crazy storm anyway I think the storms passed now and yeah continuing olives to Boston where we're gonna be meeting one of JP's pilot friends he's gonna join us for a section of our trip helping navigate the Atlantic [Music] [Applause] [Music] back with Balu how you feeling this morning JP ruff here [Music] [Music] at the city departure to 1904 just they have on out of st. Joseph's 3100 climbing for $9,500 you're less than an hour from Fort Wayne which is where we're gonna stop to refuel and it's kind of like I guess like a halfway point to Boston and we've just been cruised above the clouds the whole way and it just be so beautiful I'm just trying out a new way of recorded that audio straight to my iPhone so now we've got a backup in case the GoPro audio is dodgy we've had a few problems to the connector now we need to make sure that we can show up I just had to bro I saw you host the big so I cut a deal with an issue and they're not really spoiling but it's still oh my gosh that's gonna happen a lot of this Trevor thing when are we going through the cloud left layer uh well we're 140 miles away so I'll probably start a decent about a hundred miles away I'll be a gradual descent so well I'll be cool come in free think now it depends on one of the tower cares us to be decent fit policy and it is like halfway to busted about a third I would say okay yeah I'll Park very quick just a little cheeky luck to redefine yeah it should be a big importer should be able to get a courtesy car and then quickly head off it's weird cuz every time I've flown alone I've got four courtesy cars but with you every time there has been any they look at me yeah they're like let's talk give him a car [Music] remember a zero echo uniform TURN RIGHT heading one one zero for your face I need you in tight you'll be in front of a regional jet about 15 to the north one one zero four tight right there [Music] right sector is zero echo uniform right turn I can contract round have a great day all right Janet Olli to integrated [Music] whoa Fort Wayne hello yeah okay we haven't got long JP says we can stay here like maximum 45 minutes before the weather is gonna get too bad for us to leave here today so I'm gonna run in oh I need my laptop I'm gonna run in charge my laptop and grab some food then yeah then we need to take up for you I've helped people actually brought mine absolutely right we can't stick around for long so just literally got the fuel in okay to 1:03 uniform for departure radar contact turn left on course protocol SPLC left on causing climb to the you requested the tank has no fuel in it right now so it won't really pressure us at no air in it so one really pressurize on its own okay that's the problem with flying alone and Richard actually I mean empty Richard actually recommended we don't fly empty yeah it was so much air in there that's gonna expand and it spoke to the brim right now both hopeful for me and I was a lovely long runway and we're gonna get a lot of those runways on the big departures so what am I really heavy so that's reassuring to know that that's cool [Music] I'm just going down a little bit to see what its gonna do down there yeah if I can see further ahead than we proceed if not I'm gonna go that somewhere okay I like how you observe things them like with a ferry tank you're pretty much on it already in I like it I'm wondering by the end of the trip whether I want to like actually get the pilot thing I I just don't know whether I'd the right kind of person do I made a boo-boo be brutal yeah I don't think you should be a pilot I don't you'll kill yourself very quickly I think I haven't got the character traits for a pilot not even remotely no I agree you're really really physical rough on things you're all over the place all the time like it's not just disorganization but it was a 4-0 beautiful yeah we've got about all miles busier just precip that's about it yeah I think mainly is just being regimented and being very like having systems of control like none of that's part of my lifestyle discipline like that this is less flying as 90% discipline yeah 10% skill are bad only [Music] Hamilton unique are getting Hamilton traffic - technically boatman bound nowhere on a wolf extended right base for three five level to tower up ever - I'm sorry gonna fall final 3 5 . [Music] well it's fun well it wasn't really it got scary towards the end so I decided to rather divert and I've landed in in Hamilton so I'm going to wait here till it clears up it might be a while and this is the problem with flying long distance without weather information on borders you just can't see what's gonna happen but this is what we landed for yesterday and I thought it would be well clear by now by the time we reach you but we've just had a 60 knot tailwind so we've just hammered along and I'll keep you updated with what we do yeah it doesn't look like we're gonna get anywhere today oh so it's it's nice to meet you on the phone Matt it's Louie here looking forward to me meeting you face to face well we're safely on the ground even the storms rolling in we didn't quite get to Boston but we're in Hamilton New York this tiny little town and we're just gonna wait out the storm probably won't be able to fly again until tomorrow morning the weather hasn't been entirely on our side on this trip across the country but it's you know that's just a part of flying that's one of the things that we need to be patient with during our flight around the world there's going to be times where we're gonna be grounded for days probably JP's just tying the plane down in case it gets too windy the rain has calmed down a little bit or at least there's a little break in the rain so we can um walk to the nearest motel which is almost a mile away but it was either that or wait around for a taxi or something you're gonna do it barefoot and we're leaving Balu here tied down hopefully he'll be okay for the night well you're lucky there was a motel like less than a mile away to water right JB's asleep I'm gearing up for a long night of editing I'm just gonna go down and try place some coffee and then yeah on to Boston tomorrow it's it's taking a little bit longer than planned but that's fine as long as we're staying safe catch you guys in the morning peace out enjoy life [Music] you [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys is our second full day in Cairo JP is feeling a little bit else and he's um he's just resting at the hotel but I have kindly been picked up by Mohammed a nun and they are they've offered to show me around a little bit today find some cool stories meet some cool people I think we're heading to a project now is this an NGO yeah I said no NGO that works in orphanages I'll explain we get there but yeah I'm really pumped and excited for today this could be a really good day and we're about to listen to some shall be music which is like a a new music lesson merging out of Egypt is the trend that's been going yeah three years three years okay yeah let's listen [Music] so guys this is omar zip and no and this is the orphanage that we've just arrived that [Music] when I was a kid I wanted someone to guide me to be my mentor and my parents were my mentors but I feel that it's not enough do you know when we were younger when your mom would say something and be like no no no I'm not gonna do it but if your friend says the same thing oh wow this sounds amazing so I want to be for the kids who I wished who I would have when I was younger see what I'm going so yummy I think it's my responsibility because God has given us so many blessings I have a body it's works I have a mind I have a status I have money maybe not that much money but I have the time to do something I don't want to grow old I don't want to be like in my 50s and be like oh why didn't I do this why are like this generation it's so bad and it's all AI corrupted and I didn't do anything I want to be part of this change because later when when history is made and when we are in the books I want to say I was with these people even if I'm not mentioned by name I know that I will be part of this change and then my grandkids and all the other generations oh my god that's a good example let's let's follow her let's be better than her so I want to like set a good example but I want to be this example so that people can surpass me and be much much better than what I tried to be okay I'm doing some interviews we've set the cameras up but we're just having to wait a while because they actually overheated and we're in the shade here as well I don't even feel like it's that hot compared to like being outside yeah this is this is suddenly made me realize the next few countries we visit it's gonna be a challenge like Dubai in the by basically all the hot countries I don't know if we're gonna be able to do long interviews outside in there in the heat [Music] I'm also gonna take us on a tour now we are in the playground kids play here they take they have lunch there in the room this orphanage is called the NY orphanage it's comfort its comfort to English so let's go to the kids the orphanage here is to have the girls and boys but girls were dismissed out of this orphanage because it doesn't have much fun so this is a problem here people trade their clothes they donate money they donate bags push pins that's good [Music] now we're going to the to the place the kids sleep in nice to me Louie these kids are crazy banging of my dreads okay show plan how do you say peace goodbye that was amazing that was cool we are now heading to like is it like the old town yeah okay old Cairo and we're gonna get some lunch and yeah hopefully see some cool buildings old stuff learn a little bit more about okay we're crossing the road Egyptian style here just keep walking just keep walking it's like it's like Dory just keep swimming just keep swimming [Music] so we've been walking through some of the suits in the old town and there's just the most beautiful old building tears I've you must it's a little bit late in the day we could've arrived early I could have gone in them we're gonna go get some food instead I'm like super hungry I'm hoping we can buy some falafel that's my dream right now just saying the girls like this I love this kind of environment where I'm sure I've said this before when we've been in similar market streets and like Morocco stuff oh I just love the color and the vibrancy and the sounds and like all the interest in building [Applause] [Music] [Music] it seems that tonight there's some kind of like international festival thing going on it's it's the Islamic New Year's today but there sees me all these different countries represented so there's like three centers to the green flag and then they'd like Congo Indonesia Bosnia Wow and I guess there's going to be like traditional music playing from each each country Hurley's only happens once a year so the half of the Chan stuff I am here just for one day on this day this is amazing this happens to me more often than you think really yeah just arrived someone LAN it's only Apple towards the air and I'm like randomly go ahead on the right day so also I didn't mention the reason I'm hanging out of these guys is that I asked me and JP were landing I did a little Instagram story just to say if anyone wants to host are sort of hang out and show us around then get in touch so these guys ping me an email this is this is definitely the best way to see a country what did you just tell me okay okay addiction style addiction stuff tell us where we've just arrived and we're gonna get some food here and this is like this is like local this is how the locals eat right yeah okay okay I'm obviously still a tourist but trying to like just be as authentic as possible so instead of like stopping in there and all the tourist cafes you come here this is Egyptian resourcefulness look at that I like it yeah just make it work just make it work that's the kind of attitude you need for everything in life I think that like represents what life is about this is the biggest plate of food I've ever seen look at the size of this plate I reckon I could sit on that this is amazing just eating on the street with these guys this is so so cool and this is the flat oh yeah Kamiya okay an Egyptian falafel is cooked our mayor we're gonna go to a point where the music is playing but before we do I'm getting this traditional gypsy drink it's like sugarcane Lord equaled against shock [Music] yes it's nice I just found out of this drink is only ten P literally like 15 cents back so cheap that's cheap of them that's cheaper than water it is actually do so guide the most to here to be event is saying it's the international sound festival for spiritual woman spiritual music and Johnson international sound festival spiritual music and Charlie and up next it's Greece and Sudan playing together apparently she's going to be pretty crazy [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] guys that was pretty special tonight like I said earlier it wasn't planned at all didn't know this is happening and to find out then it's like this international kind of religious music festival and there's 23 different countries represented tonight and having them on the stage together as well it was just so exactly what I've been trying to demonstrate or trying to communicate share stories about it's this unity around the world and like to have these here these different musics from different cultures and and yeah I don't know it's just it was pretty special very special tonight I'm glad that I managed to make it out and just happen to find this I always think these things on coincidences you know this is what I need in my life get some Turkish coffee and I'm always tiny too and I grew up in Cairo and I think like my most favorite thing is how friendly everyone is I was raised in Saudi Arabia to study in the Union and one of the things that I love most about Egypt I think it's more like it's something about our world not only Egypt how people are close to their family even extra even like it's easy to get in touch with them my biggest struggle is growing up in a semi traditional upbringing but being very westernized in my mind and modernized and I'm not gonna lie being a girl in Egypt with my kind of thinking modernized and broadened and I want to travel I want to go everywhere it's not really easy in this country especially with my family's upbringing so this is my biggest struggle to say one thing anti to overcome the way we've been a case through social media and how you turn ya and YouTube and stuff we don't really think on the same level it's [Music] difficult to explain to people how we feel how you don't get our same views and our dreams and emotions it's difficult and when you don't have enough support from the people that are close to it it makes your path in life a little bit like we've had a lovely couple of hours just chilling drinking Turkish coffee chatting I managed to get another couple of interviews done yeah it's been it's been just a very like enlightening day just very cool making friends I feel like the people that I've been meeting around the world that have been like showing me around hosting me honestly feel like would be it's almost like the friendships are always been there it's like I feel like super connected with people other night it's been really really cool and I'm definitely coming back to Cairo and wanting to explore the rest of Egypt's as well apparently I found this out yesterday that Egypt is of Briers like number one thing on their bucket list number one country to visit and so yeah we got a plan in the trip seemed good okay Mohamed is just give me some more street food this is sweet Lefou this is this looks amazing I love sweet sweet potato bro [Music] we've walked back to the car we've now got 40-minute drive back to the hotel oh yeah oh it's awesome okay guys it's it's gone 1:00 a.m. oh my gosh it's been the most incredible day and thanks again to Mohammed we really now hit the yeah taking a nap on yeah yeah hopefully next time you come come with Brian or something yeah I think next time I come I'm gonna I always say this I always say this but I'm gonna allow more time and I was hoping to get more time thank you so much honestly it's been it's just been incredible and I saying to these guys earlier like I felt like part of the family today it really is been special it's so weird to think we only met this morning yeah but I feel like we've been hanging out like a week yeah it's been incredible I'm gonna head up and crack on with some editing we've got an early start and I think like 7:00 a.m. we're leaving the hotel so yeah I don't know if I'm gonna get any sleep but I'll catch you guys in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys we're in Quebec City we flew in late last night it's the second country on our round-the-world flight and we are about to head off to a very northern part of Canada and then hopefully tomorrow we'll be flying into Greenland so we're just just packing up the plane and we're with Matt he's gonna be joining for the next couple of weeks and I think we're almost ready to leave oh yeah guys I'm in the back by the way yesterday leave these two experts to their to their jobs quick coming on November 2 1 0 here uniform 1003 thousand three four zero remember q-10 uniform terminal D or identified on to seven thousand seven thousand Syrian every month thereafter uniform [Music] my favorite time to go flying is on it 200 overcast and quarter-mile visibility and then you call it the other thing yeah but it's so much fun because you just you can't see anything you're just in the cloud and all of a sudden there's like runway lights and you still can't even see the runway and then all the sudden you can see the runway and then you [Music] remember - 1 0 - PO - a miracle uniform attire Roger number 1 this must be one of the vice people played come into lab hey yeah yeah for sure we have just landed for fuel now we need to fill up the ferry tank as well these wives are just standing in my face the entire day how you feeling for the next flight JP alright we're about to get the suits on mats already yeah this is the first very very serious flight on this trip because we first of all we're flying over just crazy terrain and then we got a pretty solid I wouldn't say an ocean crossing but a water crossing into waters that are just completely unforgiving because the next flight we are crossing a large expanse of water we are getting the safety gear in the front but also getting our dry immersion suits on so we're gonna be sitting in the seats with these wraps around us which I guessing it's gonna get pretty warm in there I don't know if you saw when we were preparing for the whale trip last week we went and tried them on and I as if it were they up to here I don't know if I'm gonna fly that ship to a vector here but um it's very important in case we have to land in the water and then escape these are mine and JP's I feel like your looks a bit cooler than ours yeah much better but I think that you'll have a harder time in the water I don't think you love but how does it stop your feet getting wet socks okay guys we are mounting the GoPro fusion on the wing here this is gonna be the first 360 video film awareness so GoPro I'm very sorry of it it drops in the sea or something yeah we're not just sticking it on with a sticky mount we're screwing it on to a bolted plate don't worry how're you feeling JP [Music] my problem is I've never gettin that heard on bleeding guys I can't believe I just did that we are in we have lots of cameras rolling right now we have three go praise and the GoPro fusion and we've got a few cameras there and iPhones and yeah we're capturing every moment clean you worry alright so we're here suited up mats all suited up Louise all suited up that I have we're about applied to it Collette I think it's a calorie they calo it [Music] [Music] everybody else r-roger now we're flying here we go yeah yeah something going up every to golf helicopter working on the infield will remain west of rotary six at all time we've got every kind of tracking device you just think of we've got this little iridium go for weather and SATCOM tracking and then we've got a spider track for tracking and then we've got a couple in reaches for tracking and messaging it's really awesome to used up here like it's beautiful we got forest trees and mountains it's awesome looking clouds a little bit of light rain oh that's all those vitamins yeah we all are [Music] two-one-zero virus radar services on all terminated which entered one two six two small seven and eight keep out of each other with you can come back one three four five five [Music] so I slept for two hours and we've still got over two hours till we get to our destination probably 20 minutes til the Sun sets and we're just looking down on the most incredible like tundra it's just like the most remote part of Canada with Stephen what the potential like property or dwelling a little building on the side of a lake but other than that no roads no signs of life out here well human life right guys I am checking off fuel level in the fuel tank so I have to just unscrew the cap it might be like a couple of liters at the bottom that I can you need to give me an indication for yeah oh yeah so we'll stop with the ferry tank man [Music] okay that is it's been holding as long as possible but he destroys an hour and forty minutes I'm thinking it's best just to get this over with now before it gets dark before we're in the middle of Game of Thrones so I'm gonna figure out how to open this bag I don't know having to do this that's so hard it's way easier in the Bonanza maybe just turn around loosen your belt take the belt off completely and then I'll just have to turn Iraq this will be like a photo how can you be in this situation I would not be a baby BJP are having to over our eyes like oh the rally's like essentially paying into his seat right now I hope my my suit is out of the way the you it is my thing you don't get States right is it weird that we're like talking to you take a little while okay sure we isolate you no no that's okay I will keep you come for the other of the radio our super figure out how to hold the bottle hold the zippers open the bottle zag just take your time because what you don't want to do is get splash back everyone right I will throw you out of this plane right now cuz that zippers it open I hope the feeders it's about these drugs like it's coming out keep us updated as it goes I don't know I'm gonna go for it I think it's in the bag I don't know how I'm gonna know when this bag is full though I don't know this is working I think the bags leaking all right don't look but think the back of leaking yeah no where's the where's the other stuff because there was toilet paper in there which you can use yeah are you kidding are you girl I'm sure y'all we're gonna want this question back there's a hole in the back there's a hole in the bag I would it be a hole in it and this thing was specifically designed to pant it looks like the edge of the bag is just torn a little bit little ran down onto the cushion I'm gonna see it okay that's your question now I'm just gonna dehydrate myself for the next leg I don't want to do this again way too hard that was a little more excitement than I was hoping for all right just pick right go pros go back up at the back it was on okay well that was an interesting experience now when I desire to have any time soon again [Music] 5,400 few twenty-five thousand few temperature eight 2.3 I've never been anywhere like this neither I beat the ice lifter that kind of did it's all girls all like Scotland but this feels like oh that is chilly my feet is still freezing see that blue I'm gonna be back in the morning this is a kind of strange airport like we just popped down in the middle of live I don't know like just the biggest space there's no other planes around at all but apparently this is where we sister okay so we're gonna head in it's very cold I would love some gloves right now I put my light winter headband on this means I can at least keep my ears warm and I've got my jacket out but this is the extent of my warm weather clothing it's not not gonna cut it this is so bizarre guys there's literally no one at this airport we were speaking to some people in the radio moving parts but other than that I it's like it's closed oh my gosh look yeah guys take me there okay Wow guys what the northern lights are out just as we arrived yeah I think we need to head back to the plane anyway to problems like up there hello I'm never getting out of here I think she said something about a card but I have no idea how we we figured a way out the airport yeah just to get down well that's where the guy in the plane this ain't their radio okay it looks like jp's found a way out we've been probably waiting here for like 45 minutes trying to figure out and get the airport we are freezing and we also don't know where we're staying tonight yeah I'm supposed to get an email or some kind of confirmation that I'm trying to call people now it's a bit difficult we've had some level of success taxis arrive which is a good start at least we're getting out the cold and now we just need to hope that something for us to stay [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this place is so interesting like already we've met people from all over the world like it seems I can't wrap my head around it like obviously the native inuit people are here then we met like Libyan taxi driver there's an Indian girl working behind the desk here and apparently there's a lot of money to be earned here because I guess it's so remote so again I don't know I guess people are spending money to be here I still don't really know why people are living out in Canada this remote lever I'm gonna get to the bottom of it hopefully before we have to leave tomorrow I wish we could stick around longer and and yeah chat to me some people but maybe we all get a better chance see tomorrow morning but who knows Matt is having to watch the piss from his dry emergency right and we're again early in the morning hoping to fly to Greenland if the if the weather is good if not we may be able to rest tomorrow and just chill here either way I'll see in the morning peace out enjoy life live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys we are in Alice Springs Australia which is like dead in the center and we are flying to Sydney today the first obstacle of the day is that we don't have a fuel card to pay for fuel at this place and it's kind of like a an unmanned fuel pump so we're trying to resolve the situation I don't know how we're gonna resolve it but luckily there's a dude here it's just let us in and JP's on the phone to somebody if we figure out the fuel situation number two one zero key uniformity to taxi to the active live temperatures pressures occurred [Applause] would you like today sir is there any cereal bars there are yes of course you need me to do this yeah that'll be $7 it was four dollars fifty four took about the very pretty power and I rip I ate it I was like no way holy crap okay can you put your you know your blinds please sir we're about to land [Applause] imagine if I just treated everybody else I was my god if you have an eyesight I'm so glad you got these headsets they're just effect now let's do a little plug here for Lightspeed like we have to they didn't pay us but they did just hook us up with with with these and what I really like about them is the cops look like I have really big ears and most of the headphones like price for my ears but you can wear these for hours uncomfortable one so the Bluetooth thing is the winner for Bluetooth and the noise cancelling when you put it off it's crazy how loud it gets yeah it would be so fatiguing Apiata set on that the entire fight I know they're good really good you know that they change the pressures inside of can so you can open them up to 9000 feet early the weirdest thing that happens to be one is we had a truly a bottle of still water but I feel like it's still pressurized those with a where they seal them to enter air in them while they don't pressurize them to do it I don't dispense those there's still water out of there there at the top of that were you on the ground yeah whoops leave it on the plane we're just like a road trip with a vehicle right anyway aware you it was shaking the entire time don't worry here at OPM we might have gone over to the minute thousand feet from sea level or make all the difference there was shaking shaking shaking I was like this no there's no carbon dioxide in it I'm just shaking one make a difference anyway so shaky shaky shaky and then it just exploded but is so you would have been climbing an altitude hundred percent and it was like the crazy explosion inside the vehicle I was like what the hell [Applause] Oh Farley but we have 405 miles left oh yeah got it we have we have two and a half hours three hours left [Applause] [Music] this is not because he can really see how far India we already are and it doesn't feel like it yeah this is really rest against the net the others out with you basically what the weather I guess commercially the Australians must have just been like seen the the safety aspect of having high power cellular in the outback I just did it like they did just hop around for years like every other country other save so many lives yeah if I play commercially to Auckland would I be able to give you guys like my little blue suitcase oh yeah we're going to do up with drugs ahead makeup that would be the worst thing you could do just well you could have done that for us going into prolly that would have been the worst day yeah it almost feels like you could walk on clouds if they feel like physical things as a kid I love James of the Giant Peach and where they're like glowing about the clouds they've been to cloud bands and live in the cloud there's proper eye way we've seen since we've been in Australia oh yeah pretty crazy oh yeah for year I think it is what accent I could like slip into if I live but there would be Australia option because I think I'll just be making it all the time and then I just naturally starts to spare with its way I think if I really try can convince people I'm an American I can definitely convince people of German and I can definitely convince people I've South Africa it's really really terrifying he's sending certain out yeah because the blue maps were just behind us and I was literally just I I would no I was fine here but you're so relying on the instrumentation that if it was wrong you would just suddenly see rock in front of you and that be dead like it's definitely very very hard work yeah trying to stay alive I guess you're just totally trusting instrumentation and my ability to read it [Applause] [Music] on November 2 1 0 cute if I'm looking for a parking for a few days over on alpha 6 remember to turn alpha echo uniform thanks down ground tuxedo and life which is your first right and then there's cross parking up there for GI for that via mic and then on the cross parking deck circle looks like that's a bunch of people waiting for us yeah over there yeah should we park there unload then I bring the plane over or what do you also reduce unload it go over there oh wait is there we could bring the plainclothes over there yeah well we can't leave it there yeah ok let's bring it over people get some photos and stuff they won't be able to get to the plane though because of the fence [Applause] ok yeah got a little posse did you see us come in where did we come in from that side nice nice all right we're gonna unpack and then I guess we'll be able to come through and sorry you can't come up to the airplane oh he's a local pilot and he said he can escort people to the airplane awesome [Music] we had so many snacks we could have survived for like a week on the [Music] [Applause] [Music] see you later guys thanks for coming down we we're heading over to where we're staying now which is in Bondi Beach and Lisa and Greg have offered us a lift they are like the most incredible no no I'll go to the back go for a shot see you later bye thank you so we've just checked into our Airbnb dropped our bags off and we've come down to Beach brewery oh I remember this place from I think a few years ago when I was here maybe like three years ago so we're just showing up can we get some Mexican food you up for this whoo they plant cheese as well oh yeah all right we just stopped and got some snacks now we're heading back up to our little apartment you hear that screeching noise that is a massive fruit bat oh I can see it hanging you see it [Music] that is crazy well after a long day of flying we are ready to chill for a few days in Sydney I'm kind of glad that we we can't have bombed it across the whole of Australia we could have taken our time a bit more and explored some of that kind of Outback random little towns but I think there's more going on here that we've got a bunch of friends we want to meet up with and I just think there's more opportunity to chat people out here in Sydney and so yeah we've got this nice little kind of beach hut apartment for the next few days and tomorrow we're meeting up with Rachel which I've realised today and she told me that we haven't seen each other for two years any of you long tech time vlog watches will know who I'm talking about but yeah can't believe it's been two years that's insane so we're gonna catch up with her in the afternoon and grab some dinner and yeah really looking forward to yeah to being here and just yeah I mean isn't this the weather's not incredible but just the vibes are gonna be great and yeah it's gonna be a good few days I'll catch you in the morning peace out enjoy life live the adventure [Music] 
okay it's day two prepping for off flight or you're just north of LA yesterday I arrived Mel with JP we started sorting through our stuff and managed to get an evening flight first time I've been in the plane since we bought it and yeah we're almost there with our gear we've really gone minimal literally with taking barely anything and I put all my clothes in this little bag here and then I'm going to fit all my gear back in this bag - a few items which we're going to store here for three months in LA was where yeah what's for traveling and I didn't want to try and start pinning outcome of the locations we're going to and drawing the room and the map so I spoke to JP this morning and he's suggesting we wait another couple of days because we're still finalizing and the route and where we're going to be and we're doing a bit of research so we want to try and get it as accurate as possible although I'm very aware that as we're flying we're going to have to make some changes and you know there's going to be a lot of last-minute things happening we're now heading down into LA and hopefully we can get everything we need been a bit hardly ever doing the logistics of like dropping packages off I've been getting a lot of things drop to offer and Alex and Marcos house but they're not around right now so I'm not sure exactly how we're going to get it yeah hopefully we can get everything we have our first packages and managed to pick them up what we got there we have a seminar and a seminar to basically me and JP are both going to be rolling with an a7 F 2 and 1/8 of an RC and if you missed a couple of weeks ago we did go to New York and we were contemplating getting a Sony FS 5 that we decided against it just because it's complicated it's not that much better quality and just added weight and we're both already used to using these cameras so we're going to roll with these two the documentary and then this is our kit bag hopefully yeah I think you think this was the guy then sweet bright we just grab lunch and we just actually met with my friend Cameron and Johnny we're looking up my bus right now and we got some really good advice about documentary making to do currently making a pretty big documentary and now we are heading to this place to get all of our and safety gear and emergency light life raft and all that Jamie took us through what we're getting here but what we're hoping to get here open again some personal floatation devices or just for individuals all the way or any hat see we need two more life jackets or the legislate you want to use but there's a suitable one and then the big ones are the dry immersion suits which are a legal requirement but also a good idea and then a four-person life raft so obviously we're going to try and not ditch the plane in the ocean but we need to be prepared if that does happen I think it's not any more likely to happen over the ocean than it is over land but and it is very survivable if it happens with the water if you have all the right gear and you're prepared for it and yet you just follow protocol so that's what we're doing we're preparing to the worst but it's best to be prepared yeah not to be so don't panic too much we're just taking the precaution so we could maybe get two more of those or go with the yellow one for the passengers let's get this let's get this leg up what we need one yeah Eulalie switch I get a little taller than they so we just chatted to the guys behind the counter and they said to get the life raft that we need and the dry seats it's special delivery from like they haven't got any on the west coast in any of the stores that have the shipment from Florida and it would take way longer than we've got so we need to come up with a back-up plan we're thinking I don't know see if we can track something down on the west coast if not we technically don't need this stuff until we do ssin crossings so we could pick them up in the east coast of America when we fly there next week just annoys me is that all allowed play on the students and one by the time we get there it's going to like we're not going to have time to send stuff back if nothing tips that we're going to be yeah we have to get the right stuff and be really lucky with that otherwise we're going to be screwed this is one of the most essential things we need this is like a beacon and emergency beacon that will send out a signal if we do have some kind of emergency or crash landing this will mean that we could get actually get rescued so this like a satellite it sends out like a satellite science is are just releases a frequency a radio cognized certain frequency I just collected the last package here we needed to get today long 45 minutes by wheel even the Wonder bug here it hasn't been the most productive day but we have got the things we needed and now we're hitting that skinny Valley which is just north of LA before we yeah before we head off tomorrow to San Francisco thankfully we have a right that Lindsay's house she's kindly putting us up tonight we stayed at place she was house-sitting last night and now we're in a different place so basically this in the garage I'm gonna be sleeping on this sofa I guess we're going to have to get used to staying somewhere different every night which I'm kind of used to anyway but yeah this is going to be next level just like staying or different people I'm hoping most of the accommodation we have over the next three months is staying with you guys in the different places of stopping occasionally we might need a nice relaxing hotel to like recuperate but yeah it is cool we can probably sort through all our stuff so the plan is we're going to get all the gear restored through and put it in this bag hopefully we fit it all in there and then we'll each have a small bag with our clothes and maybe laptops ah yeah good and then we'll leave all the extra stuff here at Lindsay's house if that's cool that go it's going to be interesting to see how much we have left of this file yeah right time to go to bed catch you guys in the morning peace out on to a knife Olivia Adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys we took the day off yesterday so Lindsay left last night and we have relocated to this beautiful B&amp;B on the edge of town it kind of feels like we're in the middle of a jungle this is like this is so good we just have some delicious breakfast and I'm just chilling out watching these these birds and the bird feeder I'll give you a little tour check this out hey fluffy [Music] yeah this is like a really quaint kind of family-run B&amp;B and it's just what I need right now just a little hideaway just to continue recuperating me and JP have been saying like we're just beyond tired like no matter how much we're sleeping we're just struggling to kind of get our energy back from the last couple of months of traveling but we slowly are we slowly are and this is a good place to do it I think it's Coffee time guys I just found the hot tub I'm gonna have to chill in here later on [Music] it's so peaceful here and very inspiring if I ever get my own plot land would you know I've been talking about for years having like some nice gardens and be able to plant different things and just having a yeah just a space to walk around it's it's quite different from my day-to-day life but yeah I'm really loving it today okay me and JP are heading into town to get a late lunch then we might try find a cool spot or two sons that later I've got the drain [Music] right dis arrived at Denny's Denis has one very good vegan option which I'm sure you know from my blogs but it's just a good go to go in here this cool crowing there's like a rooster in the parking lot of Denny's like what what is going on I'm pretty sure we just landed here as well I'm pretty sure I just heard it like flapping and landed and then started crowing don't know where it came from feel like we're in the middle of town [Music] okay guys we have found this location well we were suggested this location by some guys we met in Denny's last night and called the end of the world and I think it's just like this nice little beach or outcrop where we can watch the sunset this is cool look at all this volcanic rock isn't there yeah this is this is crazy [Music] [Applause] [Music] we have made it down to the end of the world and with these guys I met last night all right guys hey then do an intro yourself meet me my name is Elliott unsane and these guys are living nearby studying here but they were from all over the world I'm gonna be hanging out with him event hopefully the next couple days and yeah they've just invited me down here this is cool if this is earlier in the day and not so choppy maybe we could do some cliff diving here but maybe not right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh that was a very enjoyable sunset stroll are those guys yeah wasn't tempted to jump in the sea but who knows maybe other we can not go and explore those guys I think the current plan is I'm gonna stay in on the big island in Kona for a few more days we've got an interview potentially scheduled for tomorrow and then on the weekend yeah like I said I might go for a little explore these guys either to the lava flies or to check out some waterfalls in the meantime JP needs to fly to Honolulu and get their seats taken out and get a bigger fuel tank put in for the final crossing to California so I'm thinking he's gonna go ahead and I might catch up with him in a few days it means yeah means I can just shoot the interview and hang out with these guys a bit more I don't know there's lots of me to do over there he said he's gonna be just working the aircraft like over at the at the hangar all day so I think this is the best plan so we're that's happening tomorrow morning we're going our separate ways for a few days but yeah I'm looking forward to hanging out this with those other guys some more it was fun it was really nice before I crack on my small editing I'm gonna jump in the hot tub I think this is exciting I can't get enough of hot tubs even out here in this warmer climate I just it's never too hot for a hot tub it's Coffee time coffee and hot tub yes I get this is a pretty cute the hot tub this is pretty smooth I think it'd be a squeeze getting four people in it maybe view just like person the edge this is great for one person though this is pretty cool news guys basically the the guys we were hanging out with tonight who I met the previous night in Denny's I kind of felt a connection with them and I want to hang out with them a bit more they've also found a local Hawaiian person like a guy with Hawaiian heritage that's up for being interviewed for the documentary which is a real win because I've struggled to find someone the last couple of days so that's the first bit of good news secondly they're saying that they have some friends I can just crash with like stay on their sofa or maybe there's a bed for me I don't know but this is something I've really enjoyed in this trip and we haven't done it the entire time we've been staying in a lot of hotels but the times where we've stayed with the locals for me has been the most enjoyable and yeah so I'm really excited as of the night after tomorrow I'm going to be staying for a few days with some guys locally and yeah getting to know this crew as well and going to visit their like campus where they're studying at this like Christian organization called white whale so yeah I'm going to learn a bit about that I've had some friends in the past that I've done a white wine course so it's going to be interesting yeah maybe we'll learn a bit about what they're doing and what they're passionate about and yeah I'll take you guys along on the journey with me it will be we fun fun journey of discovery as this entire trip is right I've seen the morning peace out enjoy life and if the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys I'm in Cape Town again I'm back and this time I'm not leaving for probably a couple of months we are in a place mean Raya and we've just come out for lunch with Bridget and this is a vegan place in Cape Town in C Point I got falafel wrap these are flapjacks this is what they call flap this in England that's not what those are but still that's like it kind of pancakes and then a vegan burger and this is like a really cool place if during Kate time you need to come here we're just going to chill here for a few hours do some laptop Club and there yeah we've got the whole day and it's so nice here because the Sun doesn't set to light after 7 p.m. and it is a beautiful beautiful there big fan of them using the last drawers in there as well I did for a little while thing that I was gonna carry around my own drawer with me everywhere but realistically that's just not gonna happen so I really appreciate places which don't have plastic straws [Music] where we just arrived and I do live music let's have a look look around apparently this is the best hummus in the world yeah [Music] very good hummus immediately in my whole mouth okay let's get something to go [Music] okay we have our hummus we've now walked down to the beach front at sea point that's where we are right see point this is a really cool spot to watch the sunset guys but we're not gonna be here when it's sunset but we're gonna go for a little stroll along the shore now [Music] so all of the see around here has this like kelp forest which is like this big thick green seaweed forest I don't know whether it's just this time of year or it's all year round but although the sea is freezing I am I genuinely tempted to go scuba diving in the kelp forest because it looks incredible like unlike any other kind of scuba diving I've done and yeah I think the marine life is pretty amazing quite unique so yeah you'll see been was been most persuading me last week when I was here so at some point I'm gonna go in [Music] okay we are back home yes that's right we have a home I don't know you saw our video the other day but we did like the little livestream where we talked about how me and Raya moved in together we've been traveling for like two years non-stop but this is the first time in like five years that I've been in one spot where I can like unpack and call my home so we're both really excited and I realized I haven't shown you where we are yet so I'm gonna do a really brief house tour and Raya also did a house tour which you can check below or link below but then I want to show you my office space which I'm excited about so let's start the kitchen this is our kitchen obviously all the usual things I managed to get some vegan protein powder I brought from the UK so we're making smoothies we have a nutribullet and I haven't ventured into cooking yet other than like heating up soup thankfully this ubereats here and there's lots of amazing restaurants with delicious food nearby right let's head through this is our living room area check this out hey so we've been chilling here doing some laptop Club and watching movies and stuff yeah this is where Rhys main workstation is look at that view guys that is spectacular and but yeah what an amazing office space what's your favorite thing about having a place I think just we're both like an entire routine people but being able to wake up and have a smoothie and yes it on my desk yeah productivity what else got my booster board like you saw the other day managed to get this in the country called cheeky little penny board there as well right one thing I haven't touched on yet guys I'm gonna make a whole video on this there few of you have been asking me about it but it's the water shortage in Cape Town so just to show you quickly we're collecting all of the runoff water and we're having showers so this is referred to as grey water and then we use this to flush the toilet when we need to which all stone it sounds gross but after we pee we don't flush in Capetown that is the way to roll you leave pee in and then I've seen you do a number to use this a flush doing the same for the sink more washing our hands today as of today or yesterday the restrictions on personal water user things come down to like 50 or 60 litres of person again I'll touch on all of that and explain the whole situation in a whole independent vlog so I want to make a whole like video just on that right let's move on bedroom obviously this you know nice bedroom space for the first time in since I can remember I've actually got a space for my clothes I don't have many clothes but it's nice to have them all they're accessible right on to my office right this is supposed to be the spare bedroom but as we shared in the livestream the other day one of the problems that we were anticipating about moving in together was how messy I can be now today's an exception because I've cleared the office off and I've made it all neat and organized but generally I'm pretty messy when it comes to my workspace so Rio is panicking I was thinking oh I hope this doesn't like break us apart but thankfully because we've got spare room there's a desk in here I've set this up as my office and this is my space and if it gets messy or I can just close the door and we can keep the rest of the house tidy so that's the plan anyway finally I'm going to show my workspace now talk about what I'm doing out here what I have so yeah so the look ok so I have my macbook pro set up for all of my editing and as you know the reason I'm facing out here in Cape Town is to work on Beyond Borders documentary the world fly me and JP flew around the world for three months and now we need to crack on with creating a masterpiece of a documentary for you guys so good news is a little update we've found a kind of head editor editor who's going to take on the project and they will get out from there and see who else we need whether we need i guess as it is as it progresses we may need someone to score music the sound design a colorist and potentially a writer if we're struggling with the kind of the plot but and yeah that's where we're at and in order to kind of do the handover for him to really start working on that the project that the few things that needed to do so these four terabyte hard drives have been where I've been storing all of the world flight footage so these are quite slow hard drives and obviously there's different files kind of mixed amongst the hard drives and I've been creating various projects of my vlogs over the three months trip and it's all a bit confusing and all those books that you're shooting like these are cameras I'm shooting on so they have the same file names and I forgot to kind of add unique file names so it's all got bit confusing so I spent the last few days sorry I haven't been uploading as much but send a lot few days transferring all of that onto this raid G Drive 3G technologies raid I think this is a twelve terabyte hard drive so this is much faster it's actually a Thunderbolt 2 or USB 3 connection and I've offloaded all of the blog footage onto that then had to go through meticulously reconnecting all of the blog files premier does have an OP kind of searches but anyway I've got to rename them always unique names go through reconnect them all so I've got one project now with every vlog so it's kind of a framework for how we can start building the documentary obviously there's a lot of other footage the interviews and stuff which we're gonna be kind of putting in building the story out but this is this is the the bad boy I'm going to be handing over this is the the work I'm doing this week all going on here and yeah I'm excited I'm really excited about kind of not just the set up and getting it ready but to seeing it come to life and getting a traditional kind of editor on board yeah he's very experienced understands the kind of the the formatting for documentaries and his worked in the TV industry and stuff so hopefully that with my kind of vlogging experience we can kind of come together jps gonna head head out to Cape Town at some point soon and help us start really you know all of us together we're gonna be shaping this so a few other things I'll show you what my self is here what I've managed to get down to Cape Town so got all my camera's a 7s a 7r I'm shooting on another ace of an S we've got the twelve to six twelve to twenty-four lens eighty-five one point four twenty eight two and the 24/7 PG master then groans as usual the other day I've got the Mavic air this is a very exciting drone and then I've got the Matic pro GoPro your GoPro fusion spectacles snapchat spectacles have news these in a while but got all my charging station here big battery pack Mavic Pro batteries got on mice Tony's got another hard drive so I'm gonna duplicate this once I've handed this over to Nick our editor and then a little USB charging port the other thing guys is internet is difficult out here in Cape Town and they haven't really got like fibre cables around the Holika town and we're in an area called Clermont and the Internet's patchi's for the two mobile providers that I've tested out here for data of Vodacom and telecom and both pretty good fast speeds has been great uploading that I found that telecoms a lot cheaper and so we've got two phones so we've got the Samsung essay doing a hot spot and then I've also trying out the new Google pixel - phone which we're just using as a hotspot at the moment but this has got the telecom card in SIM card so that's giving us Internet in here and both are loaded up with a ton of data so we can just use the internet to as much as we want which is really really cool finally got my little cupboard here bunch of audio gears and sign Heiser mics the radio mic you're using in the world trip in case you want to do some more interviews here we're going to need to do some audio of me and JP they're doing and kind of post interviews and narration on the whole documentary site we need to set that up at some point and yeah and some loom cue some lighting oh yeah one last thing guys you probably knows this webcam that I've cut on my macbook pro and basically they don't like the built-in webcam and I'm gonna try out this Logitech one for doing so the live streaming as you know I've been doing kind of will try to do weekly live streams in YouTube just to mix it up a little bit and so yeah it's gonna be fun I hope you enjoyed my brief office tour and I will keep you updated as we make progress and you guys will meet Nick the guy that helping us on the documentary and yeah I'll talk you through different stages there's some exciting news on for those of you interested on the way that we're transcribing all the interviews and being able to search through all the content we have which again on I'll explain in a later blog but anyway there you go guys that is a pretty thorough office tour and yeah I love having a space it's something that you guys probably take for granted but when you travel all the time like me and Riya it's actually an amazing feeling have a base somewhere to base out of and I think that's gonna be hopefully or plan moving forward in our lives is always having some kind of base even if we're still traveling and doing stuff that we you can always come back to so the Sun has just set and the moon has just risen and this is a very very special moon tonight guys this is called the super blue blood moon and those are all three occurrences which happen with the moon a blue moon a Blood Moon and a super moon but to all occur at the same time it is very very rare I don't know when the last one happened but I think it was a long long time ago and the three occurrences are correct me if I'm wrong but the super moon and I think it happens maybe want some once a month where the moon's at its closest point to earth so it's the it looks the biggest a blue moon is when there's two full moons in a calendar month so one of them has to fall on the first of the month and one on the 31st because it the full moon happens every thirty days and then a Blood Moon I think is something to do with the moon passing in front of the Earth shadow from the Sun or something so it gives it an orange of tint which I can't see right now anyway I've set up my camera with this zoom lens check this out so this is what I'm seeing now I'm gonna take some photos but I mean it kind of just looks like a normal moon to me but yeah it's very big okay I just found out actually it isn't a Blood Moon in Cape Town it is in America and Asia and Australia and stuff but we didn't get the blood part so it was just a super blue moon anyway it's still fun shooting there I want to get more into kind of doing time-lapse photography and videos and shooting night staff and just generally up my cinematic game and there's a lot of inspirational people to learn from out here in Cape Town so I'm going to try and do that in between working on the documentary I hope you enjoy today's vlog seeing what I'm up to seeing my space seeing how I'm working now and yeah I'll catch you guys in the morning peace out enjoy life live the adventure

good morning guys it's about half 4:00 in the morning and I actually haven't slept from yesterday yet but I thought I'd pick up from yesterday's vlog where if you didn't watch it had an amazing day and my friend Mike and Elle's wedding filmed it all for them and then whilst dropping them in the hotel stopped to help a hedgehog out of the road and drops the SD card so I am now back out on the hunt to try and find that SD card and hopefully save from losing quite a lot of the wedding footage I filmed so kind of panicking trying to stay calm but also on this mission and I think I found the spot where I saved the Hedgehog this looks familiar so I just pulled over I'm going to a little look around thankfully I've got quite powerful torch so I feel like it's something around here and I feel like an SD card would be quite visible in the road one of the problems is a lot of these roads looks very very similar and it's not there's not much to distinguish them from one another it could be anywhere along here or it could be nowhere near here so the only other place that the SD card could've dropped on my shirt was when I dropped my candles at the hotel okay even though it's almost 5:00 in the morning like I'm tiptoe into the driveway and see this drawer somewhere unfortunately no luck I think at the beginning of things like this with is a problem and I've got a few potential solutions in my head like I'm like yeah it's probably that of that once you've kind of exhausted those potentials that's when it starts dawning on you or familiarly ray that I might not be able to find the solution or solve the problem but and then you give up hope and it's kind of all a bit stack it at the moment I still think my focus line where I say bedrug get the SD dot I stopped off at the next potential spot it all looks so similar good thing is these roads are pretty empty so if I did drop on a road it's probably still on the road after over two hours of searching and slowly crawling along the road shining my torch I've given up - be hard I might have one further look inside the car I guess it dropped out my pocket here but that is okay [Music] Cinda laughing - you guys don't heed lest enlarging your top of it and don't try to rescue hedgehogs when you're storing SD card in little pocket all right let me get some sleep and I'll continue the vlogging in the morning morning sing again okay let's start the day again it's now 10:00 a.m. so I've had like maybe four and a half hours sleep got woken up to someone walking up to the van asking if I lost an SD card last night when I get up and I was like yeah but I thought it drops on the road because it that's why I did that whole mission this morning early try and find it anyway turns out I dropped it here and it's been recovered someone found it like sitting over there somewhere I guess the drops on my pocket earlier so I've got the SD card guys and all of the driving around the missioning I did earlier yeah it's pays off it's paid off I don't even mind I literally own the mind that I wasted hours trying to find it the fact that we found it I'm just so happy so if it's a good start to the day yeah I'm relieved all we need to do now is one of the guys is going to be editing the main video he needs all my footage and I've got probably I reckon least 200 Giga footage to give him so very good chance very good morning Mike you'd enjoy your wedding yesterday okay it's so good right well the best ever yeah yeah right yeah oh that's great that's suck if you do and now all the tents have been taken down pretty much really good and everyone's getting ready to leave I'm just dumping like 300 gigabytes of birds yesterday I think it might be time to head off if they've done a good job of clearing up so far half of the guests have already left and we need to head now because we need to drop the van back in Paris and then jump in with Stephen Alexia in their car back to the UK still let guys congratulations right time to hit the road Paris here we come we're going to join Andy and you just up there can I come by them [Music] this is a really beautiful little town that's net because we just literally poured over mr. lunch and we were debating whether to stop at a service stations or drive into the town centre hope you boys lunch has arrived we managed to find of the Menu key for that medium Danya oh yes happy Baqi oh that looks so good merci beaucoup before we jump back on the road me and naturally are going to go on it will be fillion carousel we're going on this carousel I think it's a little kid but we've been eyeing it up the entire time we've been having lunch so we're going to jump up well-wishing should we go on like one of these like horse up and down horthy okay which one do want to go I want to go on the outside one going to do I hope this one actually goes up and down [Music] you enjoyed that oh but we're actually getting some freezer we go in that little look at your bitmap [Music] Oh oh you're gonna tear a place down on face miss clapping cheers and it will always stress them so we're parting ways with this lot we're going to go meet our Steve and Alexia and hopefully jump in with them need to return this to Paris to let a guy that's about me okay so we've arrived in Paris we've dropped off the rental van and timed it perfectly Steven elective just arrived they were driving up and I think they had some stuff to film to Steve and yes we're just come jumping with them Steve how's your day been very good man I'm a little bit Drive doubt I think throat I was got stuck in some bad traffic feeling it it's um I'm worried about whether we're going to make their crossing or not basically yeah because I think when did you originally built like 9:00 at 9:10 p.m. and the last one is around 11:00 that call Park 11 and currently that nurse is going to get there at 26 minutes got them so they need you to ball it probably like 11 or like act forward to any other problem we've got a shaved half an hour's pointing the rag time like that like that like that like that like that like that like that like that and now we Steve Alexei had a a

adventure 
[Music] good morning guys it's an interesting day today I'm in Vienna in Austria and we flew into I think the place will be known nice that is like 45 minutes away from here last night and we are having to leave the plane in Austria for at least a week and getting some maintenance done on it so it kind of feels like we're putting the whole fly on pause I've left JP and Matt and yeah I'm heading off to I guess do some stuff for my you know on my own this week JP needs to head off and do some paperwork and stuff so we decided to go our separate ways just to get more stuff done I'm heading back to Germany actually near where we were yesterday it's a shame I couldn't stay there yesterday but I needed to complete every leg of the trip to countless flying around the world anyway I'm heading back there today and hopefully get to do some core interviews and I may be traveling to a few other places in Europe this week just to yeah just to capture some good content but it's kind of sad that I'm not with JP I think I'll get excited out the fly again when we when we meet back up next week well I managed to get myself a cheeky little panini and a green juice just about the board it was really strange boarding a commercial flight again after flying halfway across the world in the tiny plane we have to wait another ten minutes and then we allowed to start the entrance again for the actual departure sorry for this Oh sometimes things don't work out as planned but there we are good hope it's worth it I kept going here the next we've woken up super super early to to come out and hang out with Dimond for those of you don't know diamond is an aircraft manufacturer in Austria and they make some really freaking cool airplanes and we were actually gonna fly a da 62 around the world initially but unfortunately diamond could not give us a demo model for the amount of time that we needed just because obviously they're working in aircraft and they they need to get them to a shows etc so that was very disappointing at the time just because I could not think of a better airplane to do it in but we ended up problem-solving and got the loot but yeah nonetheless we thought we'd stop by and come say hello to my friends I think Louie would love this this is actually insane the back first I'm sitting in the back ends it's big they came out of leg room this is better than economy far better [Music] I just landed in Zurich Switzerland this isn't where I'm trying to go into it I'm trying to go to Freiburg in Germany and we actually just landed like super late like maybe even an hour later tonight I think this is betraying yeah all right we have somewhere to work got a power soccer there right just got hope of the by taking the train now in the UK you often get fined for riding trains without it [Music] so this girl meeting she's like yeah get on the train so try to quite tickets to where she is and he said like 350 euros I was like I don't think that's right anyway I couldn't figure out the Machine ran down jumped on the train anyway folks it's the right one lucky it was got the main station Zurich and now I'm trying to find the next train of spacing cash for catching three trains the mission of getting back to where we were literally it was just a little flight in our plane and it's been it's been an uber plane three trains to get back [Music] wire second train ride done of in Basel now and I'm about to be on the third train of today and into the second country so I flew from Austria to Switzerland and Germany I think thankfully I've got about 20 minutes to catch the train and I'm just rendering my vlog for you guys which I hope you built up later on to get to Germany okay we're on our way I'm gonna leave my laptop here guys after 11 hours of traveling to get here I finally met up with tibia she invited me here to hang out and -

Wow awesome well okay guys we're doing a livestream from Cape Town South Africa it's quite late at night we want it to do it bit early but we were out at dinner having an amazing dinner actually but we've got a big announcement kind of we are here for a while three months and we haven't moved in this is gonna be like a test for our relationship hopefully a good one yeah we've moved in together we have an apartment for three months we're unpacked for the first time in three years for me like five years for I have an office space because usually we have a hotel room and I just explode I'm like charging now that reasons up a bride's head basically yeah now we actually have our own space so good like them I was impact probably within 10 minutes of getting in here I just wanted to yeah I have everything hung up and we got a nutribullet so we can make smoothies in the morning and my I set up a desk as well and I have a some amazing view of the mountains it's just I think something you don't really realize but when you travel full-time there's all these decisions that you have to make every day literally you wake up and you're like where do I go to get breakfast and where do I like how do I find wherever I need to do it's like all day every day you're making all these decisions and to be able to be somewhere where my breakfast smoothie is in the freezer already you know I mean like everything's kind of set up for you so you don't have to make all these little decisions and you can just dream big and kind of work on bigger projects I think that's what I'm most excited about for these two months yeah I haven't settled yet I'm looking forward to settling I think one of the reasons I'm not settled and I haven't told anyone online this yet but I'm I have to fly back to London tomorrow night really bad timing but there's a really cool conference happening and it was like either I missed the conference or there's three options either I stay in London for a week and I wouldn't have been in Cape Town now I know who's been waiting around or I come out here get settled in this place see Riya and then knit back to London for three days or I would have had to miss the conference so anyway I'm going away for three days this week then I'm back and I think we're not back oh right we are kind of doing I guess the best format from I found four lives but I'm willing to experiment it's doing a Q&amp;A thing so we can respond live I did a little tweet earlier just to get us going as usual and then we can respond to people in the live chat hi guys why Cape Town don't name a water crisis yes we do about the Walker so they do have a water crisis where sometimes in the next kind of three months basically they might be shutting the water off because it's like the worst drought in history basically and when you're here you have to be super super conscious of that so we literally are showering over a bucket or trying not to shower as often as we may be used to at home some people at home shower like once or twice a day I usually shower once a day but I'm trying to do every other day and even like with flushing you have to be careful so the Buc in the water with the Buffy you have to flush the toilet with it's all these like in everything you do you're trying to keep conscious of that and yeah so the water crisis is definitely real and we're trying to do the best we can to kind of make as little impact as we can and why Cape Town won it's summer here right now it's hot it's beautiful and amazing it's so you Louie is currently working on editing the documentary yeah I see boys night yeah beyond borders and you want to set up a little team down here yeah we're just currently interviewing setting up a team a write a someone to manage the team that kind of producer and yeah like a head editor potentially a couple of other edits so it's coming together JP's coming out in two weeks I think he said so yeah it's gonna be you know so the Liberty adventure office is down here so only as employees and stuff so it kind of makes sense to be here and kind of be next to the adventure team as it's growing try to get the like Beyond Borders team set up down here and just enjoy we have a ton of friends on here as well Louie just hung out with Ben today there's a lot of amazing people that we're gonna get to see and hang out with and be in the sunshine and also Cape Town's an incredible city so all those things yeah it's quite windy right now as well guys I don't know if you can hear you might not be able to hear but our house sounds like it's haunted because the winds whistling through we're quite high up we're on the fifth floor of this light block of flats but I feel like the wind is just like trying to push through our building and it is like whistling in the background so if you hear any with wait weird whistling sounds in the background that's what is should we look on Twitter fest so monument yeah people can hear the wind that's crazy yeah [Music] that's the best deep walk okay what's the biggest challenge this is from Sara what's the biggest challenge we've faced whilst traveling it's not we have face it's like you face what struggling yeah I mean I think I might link it back to what I was just saying but it's it is just like all day every day running around it's like yeah just making all these little incisions that and you're not able to zoom out and dream big and plan kind of bigger things specifically with how quickly we travel last year a lot of times we traveled somewhere for like two or three days and you literally get there you can barely adjust the time different certainly know where you are then you have to leave so a lot of that kind of backed up I feel like time just go so quickly I don't even know where it's gone and you weren't able to like really achieve any of your goals so and I think for me one of the reasons why we are here for so long as well as doing that documentary are kind of neat a big one space but I think it is the whole exactly what you're saying like feeling constantly kind of exhausted and for me when I'm just jumping from spot to spot to spot and traveling like there's a lot of fun in that but after a while it's not like I don't appreciate it but it just restricts other parts of your life and it's like I've always wanted to live in a space of freedom where I am released to kind of live my dream and and not just kind of have travel adventures but kind of adventure life together as well now and it's like sometimes actually the freedom of or the being so spontaneous or often just the speed at which we travel like it actually restricts us so it's the cutters house where design goods travel and you know it's it resembles generally it's it's more about freedom and getting to explore the world but I think for me where I'm at right now we're so I feel like a bit of routine and a space where we can relax and know you know that we can come back to as a little base is actually gonna help me move on and actually get more thing build more things and feel more I think after such a kind of unstable few months especially with the world fly and the lack of sleep and the kind of content constant kind of go-go-go I think having a place to kind of gather myself mentally emotionally like it's gonna be great and I'm really excited about being here and I think that so that ties into the questions I think that is always being the struggle for me traveling is is that that's the struggle it's it's not having a place to feel kind of like okay cool I can get my head straight but I have been kind of on the road for I almost five years and this is been this is gonna be the longest period of time where I'm just gonna pin one spot I'm not making any commitments to schedule this year other than I'm imagining it's gonna be more like every other day so so far in January it's been every other day and there may be periods where we're doing loads of really fun stuff and I'll be vlogging every day but if it's just we're here and we're getting on with stuff and I'm doing the documentary stuff like I think I think every other day is more kind of achievable so much what's my favorite spot in Cape Town I'm excited to find that out because there's so my feel like I've been here twice before for quite a long time each time but still it's like the whole time goes by and I'm like wait I've barely seen it so obviously the the mountains are incredible Table Mountain and lions head and stuff I really want to do a lot of hikes I really love is it called kirstenbosch yeah Kirsten Bush kirstenbosch it's like this Botanic Gardens it's so stunning that's probably one of the most amazing places and also there's this Beach that is covered in penguins which I am kind of blows my mind to be on the beach and there's penguins everywhere but there I love penguins and they're so cute so that's that was one like one of the coolest things when I sat for the first time yeah I think generally the other side of Table Mountain from where we are so we're on the east and then the west where we were just now for dinner the whole coastline is that's where you see the best sunsets and yeah it's literally Beach and then it's just table manners they're like you know I think I prefer that side of the mountain so there's loads of cool spots along there it's just a bit more expensive to stay and we're here for like quite a long time so well and the little adventure offices here in Nick and Ange everyone's around this so it's kind of more residential area sorry someone said what's our fondest memory of one another or together there's a nice question yeah summer said where are we living I think we live in I think this area is called Claremont yeah that's I mean I feel like my mind's like I think I don't know why but what's that movie inside out I can literally visualize like these all these mini risers going through all the files in my head right now I'm trying to find a memory but let's limit it to last year I think last year my favorite time together therefore probably my favorite memory singing back with our time in Greece in Corfu because I think they I think it's rare that we get to switch off and I really felt like we switched off in coffee and that was just so nice and I just remember it being like good quality time together well I was going to say the Maldives it wasn't last year's the year before but it was it was the same thing as well for both of us being able to not film we actually like fully turn our phones off no looking at laptops nothing for a couple days we were only really able to do it I guess once a year but we should dress and try to do it more than that because I feel like our relationship like jumps up a level whenever we do something like that so the Maldives in core those kinds of experiences and yeah just like to get rid of all distractions to just have amazing deep chats and just like long dinners and all that stuff yeah best and someone said tips for long distance relationships and how do we and also set another question but similar how do we keep such a strong relationship going while struggling well ok second question first we've never not traveled together which is actually what's interesting about this is this is our first time I were living together so this is like kind of a big relationship test for us most people it's the other way around we're like traveling together is a relationship test but so yeah I don't know how to answer that second question but the first one tips on long-distance relationships definitely number one is to have an idea of when you're gonna see each other next because I think if we were to say goodbye and be like okay I don't know when I'll see you again I don't really know how that would work yeah but to be like even if it's like a year from now or six book you've even it's a long time no not for us for some people they do have to go really long times not seeing each other but even if it's a long period of time to know that it's coming is I think makes it like tangible and it means that every day you're able to like I love countdowns and there's been times when I've like written out countdowns for stuff so I don't know to be able to know that the days are ticking off and you're getting closer and it's happening and just to have that day it's super important and then also communication is key and everyone communicates differently and it took us a while to figure out like a way for us that worked well for both people but so so people it's like FaceTime do you want to text all day whatever it is for both people make sure that both people are happy and feel like they're getting to communicate enough and like they're being valued and I think it is really long-distance we really trust each other as well it helps I am imagine if you're in like a jealous relationship trying to do long-distance he would be inadmissible yeah so many flying in Willie wait what's that about having impediments do you want any animals there that dog cat iguana well I actually once did have a pet iguana and they are no offense but they had terrible pets why they're just very like my Guana wasn't very friendly and then also like they just sit though whatever you know I'm guessing any reptiles are like this just not very emotional zero emotion just like it's basically like having a pet rock and then there's like it's not like having him like an expressive like kitten cat dog you know I've never had a dog but that's at some point in the future probably I why I imagine us having is a puppy which will then become a dog how did he deal with jet lag I Diamond is getting worse for me I was having discussion with someone today he will see travels a lot and he was like yeah when you as you get older your body becomes less capable of jumping time zones and I think as well with the lack of sleep I often punish my body with not punished but you know like inflicting myself yeah I think it I struggle like I'm still even though I've been in like five days I've not even adjusted even traveling with a two-hour time zone so yeah I don't I I don't know what advice I just say just be aware that there's a high chance as you age and you're traveling or Alaura more you what he might start being like hold up [Music] someone said they just joined what we're talking about a gay little update I don't know how much longer we're gonna stay on 17 I think we'll try and do half an hour which gives us a bit we are talking about the fact that we've moved to Cape Town together we're gonna be here for three months which is a really big deal for us we're gonna be most that time in this apartment Oh probably will probably like an apartment tour and what am i vlog see but I don't like to start showing you guys around now like it's my fault actually on that point we realized on the first day that because I am slightly more disorganized or for me I just like keep my things a bit more chaotically but I know where everything is but Riya obviously and most people kind of like things a bit more you know is that if I can keep my stuff contained in one room which is like the office it's actually a spare room then it's gonna save us a lot of aggro I think you'll save our relationship I don't think we could really live together without you having a space to just explode with all your things because I I'm like I feel super stressed out and on edge when everything's everywhere I kind of need everything to be in its place so if you have a room where you how do you suppose when we travel building like I think when we're only somewhere for like a day or two I'm able to kind of look past it cuz it's just everything's crazy anyway and it's not I don't see the hotel room is like a Haga to just relax here because everything's so crazy but to me this is like my sanctuary and I'm able to just relax and yeah so if you kind of keep your things contained then it means that we can be happy Oh someone told burping Bob exhaust how do we get the funds for travel well okay look we are now both in a very privileged position where we can earn from making YouTube videos do an Instagram whatever social media it's a dream job I'm feel very privileged and thankful that we're in this position but listen up guys you don't have to be doing what we're doing to be able to travel like we're traveling both of us traveled a lot before we started this yeah so I started traveling actually back when I had pretty much zero Monday's name I had lucky I had a lot of other friends that wanted to travel and living in Europe even in the UK like been able to travel and do road trips with friends is extremely cheap and we were even like sleeping in the vehicle so for me it's like how desperately do you want to travel and can you adjust your kind of comfort level down you could go camping like I said road trips you don't need to be staying in swanky hotels and you don't need to be even flying places and even if you do wanna fly places for instance the the trip I was just talking about earlier triptych or Corfu which is one of our my nicest memories of us last year was a last-minute flight that we found on the day and it was 60 quid yeah we were actually didn't know where we wanted to go and we were like let's just see where there's cheap flights from London and you have a 60 pound return I think to go to Corfu and that's literally why we chosen end up being an incredible destination so and I'm sure like you guys could work like a pretty standard job and save 60 quid for a flight take a 10 like the amount of like very like I don't do it so much my vlogs now but before is vlogging I would like fly to Ibiza and live on the beach with no money now just let me let me give advice as a girl over here I have never like slept on the street or in a park or anything like that like Louie has that's not much below like for example I don't think I ever even stayed no-tell before I started travelling with Louie so and I used to travel all the time and the way that was staying in hostels and Europe specifically same with friends so when I was like 15 I went to Jamaica and I met a girl she was my friend who lives in Jamaica and she was going home for spring break and I was like can I come back with you and just hang out with you and I so like the flight was basically my only expense because I was staying with her parents were feeding me so I would just I want to travel so bad that I was just on the constant lookout for any opportunity that I could find and I would just like visit friends and go with like family members to different places so it definitely kept an eye out for all of that and also if travel is a priority for you you can make it happen and you kind of don't realize how much money you spend just on everyday life but literally like a Starbucks coffees like what four or five dollars if you are used to getting Starbucks every day that is so much money that adds up and yeah there's so many little things like that drinking I don't drink and a big reason is why because a table when I was in college drink it was my friends who would drink would spend so much money and I'm like I just wanna save all that money and go traveling to be honest and I did and yeah there's so many ways to save money good questions just I just forgot what they said Oh someone is people are a few people are asking again why we're in Cape Town specifically it's your biggest pet peeves and look Cape Town is already before like the other reasons about that about to explain but for me Cape Town is in my top I'd say it's in my top two favorite cities asking true so I'd say London in the summer I'd say Cape Town in the summer and other times of year it's just amazing and that's they Rio de Janeiro Brazil but yeah so firstly one of my favorite cities secondly we've got a bunch of friends out here thirdly we have I have my live the adventure office out here we've got a team and also getting and because of those reasons I thought this would be a great spot to assemble a team to do the Beyond Borders documentary it's beautiful weather right now being in Europe even being over in LA right now the Sun set in there like five by three here the Sun sets at like 8 p.m. so lots of different reasons so yeah Oh burping blobs that's another question yes from Norway Santander be says biggest pet peeves with each other or in general I would say okay one of mine is when people are really loud in public and aren't aware or don't really seem to care about people around them so I don't know if you've ever experienced like someone getting on a bus and playing music off their phone just loudly and everyone's just like whoa I don't know what's happening so that's one of mine people kind of like don't respect other people's like private space and no no just respect ago in general I think one of mine and I know this isn't people's fault but it's like really loud snoring if I'm in a room with someone that's just like snoring away it really gets to me and but then I found the magic of earplugs and it new lives changed my life it's probably saved a few of my friendships as well the other day I was in a plane and before we even took off a guy is leaning back and just was snoring so loud everyone in the plane was staring game like someone was trying to kick his seat and everything it was just like so bad someone asks a question that I just remember from further on was how do you deal without having a limited wardrobe whilst traveling dresses are a huge help if you guys notice I pretty much only wear dresses which take up less space because it's like a whole outfit in one and I guess just making sure that I bring in a couple of new things like usually once a month or every two months I'll get a couple of new pieces in just to kind of keep it exciting but yeah I don't know I don't really ever feel that bored in my clothes especially what if I the good thing about living out of a carry-on is that you have very few clothing and what that means is you kind of can only have your favorite pieces so you end up just being happy with a lot of the stuff that you have I know I've never really cared much about literally as one pair of jeans and like three shirts I'm learning this right got my camera is got the drones got all the bit you know tripods the batteries on a pattern I pretty much done oh yeah clothes yeah then I'm just like yeah five pairs of socks he's had this huge bag only full of electronics and then like a little carrier bag like a plastic bag from Walmart or something three shirts of it true story yeah well I'd like about three vest tops a t-shirt this is my only teacher yeah and you don't have any like button up here I've got one pair of jeans yeah I've got one pair of shorts swimming trunks literally my clothes could fit in a bag this big yeah granted I do have a few clothes in my parents house his suit and snowboarding gear but anyway i-i've I wonder what traveling if I was really into fashion would be what's one thing you love most about each other thank you [Music] yeah okay bye love I think I love how like kind-hearted you are and I think it's rare thing this yeah I think you're just incredibly kind the way you see others and treat people and just in the way but my favorite thing about Louie by far is just his heart is like just so big and fur for everyone and everything I kind of I used to say this even like before I met you that kind of my dream guy would be someone who is like a strong man that I feel safe with but would also when they see a puppy they just melts and I feel like that's easier yeah you just have a huge heart and you when I like help everyone and love everyone thanks we're twenty eight minutes two minutes guys you're gonna try and wrap this up at half an hour I'm literally with live streams to probably I know it's like an hour and two hours but let's try not keep you guys all night Oh whew people are asking about JEP like I said earlier if you missed it JP is coming down to Cape Town I think hopefully in two weeks we've had a bit of a break since ending the world flight I've needed just to recalibrate and of surety that's - it was it was an amazing feat we're both just super happy and I don't know proud that we managed to achieve it but I think it was definitely we needed a few months just to just a rest and get excited about digging back in with the documentary so he's going to come over we're gonna brainstorm together and help ya compile this what I believe it's going to be an amazing documentary to then kind of get out to you guys and hopefully get bigger than my current audience and JP's current audience and get it out there for the masses and so for those of you that supported us with it all thank you so much for the continuing support we're both yeah we're both super pleased with how it went so far Oh someone said Jax gap can help you jack harries is actually gonna be helping he was one of the executive producers that opted to come and help us like kind of finish up the movie and you know I could pilot a bit together he's even said and I'm not like this isn't confirmed but he's even said he might come down to Cape Town so it'd be fun to get Jack down there so that in which country was your first kiss you know do you remember Oh in New York let's do one more question yeah one more question guys we only read one of the Twitter tweets so I go back to thank you guys so much I feel like we need to just do a lot more yeah yeah what is the hardest part about documenting your relationship on a global platform if you could go back in time would you change anything about how you've done things I really like regret stuff to the point where I'd go back and change it cuz I think often even if there's tough things you go through you learn from those and if you hadn't gone through them maybe you wouldn't learn from stuff yeah so for instance maybe the fact that I was quite adamant to be vlogging every single day until late into the evening every single night probably was harmful to our relationship slow down but I think I wouldn't have known that until it been happening and then we'd have talked about it and you might have not even known that like oh actually this is a big deal like we need to find the right boundaries and we're still kind of constantly in that kind of place of figuring out you know when when to share how much to share and how much our lives should revolve around my vlogging and YouTube channel and it's definitely shifted away from it being for me one of the primary things I'm always thinking about now I want to think beyond YouTube and our relationships a lot more important and my love and I think when we started it honestly was like yeah more level with like this is such a part of who I am that if you can cope with it then like we couldn't be together yeah and I think it shifted now that like I'm quite open to imagining a different future although I still love blogging and still love making videos so this is like I'm making him not blonde or anything like I actually personally think and a lot of other vloggers have talked about this daily vloggers that daily vlogging can be incredibly toxic and damaging to a relationship and I think it's not about like therefore do not daily look but I just think it's about getting a balance getting priorities right and taking days off to be honest you can still even daily vlog but if you even if you like daily thought only till 5:00 every day or something and then just have two things together that it's just hard when Louise spent so used to literally from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep I used to study every vlog in bed yeah like Lily felt for a long time like there was just a third person in the relationship and like anything any experience that we had together we were sharing with someone which on one hand was amazing and I make videos as well so I love sharing everything with you guys but on the other hand there are you just sometimes you need to be alone and you need to be like sharing things the two of you and growing as a couple and it's getting better isn't it yeah definitely I would okay I think my one super quick is that the daily vlogs are on his channel which I find very difficult so with my videos I'm like no I'm super confident and happy with the videos that I put out with his videos when someone else is filming you you might not like look your best feel your best and that kind of stuff and to be on camera always on someone else's channel we're also where the audience doesn't know you that's huge for me because even though my news videos all the time if there's a lot of new viewers all the time and there's I know some people at deaf subscribe to you how many subscribe to you yeah are the people that what my videos subscribe yeah so I'm even aware and feel super defensive like although I hope that most of you guys except Trier and a kind to her there's always people that attack you like in every video in every video that I upload there's someone being mean to Riya like even if just one person but that gets to you and that I've noticed affects the way you behave on any of my vlogs yes you know there's always like one or two people out there digest I feel like there's like a bully on the other side of the camera and so when Louise shows the camera to me it's like there's a bully like in my face and I'm just like no I don't I'm so nervous about it I'm gonna be in front of you because I don't want to get picked on but I know that it's a tiny minority and I'm so grateful to all of you guys that are really really kind to me and honestly thank you so much from the very beginning so many of you have been like so kind to me and you were the reason why I started a channel because so many people were so loving that I wanted to like be a part of this community um but yeah I think that's that's definitely a struggle and it's something just to and I think we're even saying this tonight we met some friends for dinner that like you as a viewer and us as viewers of other people you you often forget that there's real people that when you comment like you might not even think we read comments but we do and like that's a real person it's not a fictional thing so you might say something not realizing how hurtful that could be you kind of need to put yourself in other people's shoes imagine even though you're a complete stranger having someone judged you or say something mean or just like you know it's I've toughened up like I've had to toughen up over the years but i struck definitely struggle when people I love are getting attacked and I'm just like I like the biggest thing is would you say what you're writing to that person's face and most people that write mean things wouldn't because when they see you as a person in your human in front of them they just I know I I can't believe that people those things but yeah it feels like so detached when it's online and it feels almost like a TV show but yeah it's just important to remember that everyone you watch on YouTube is real and they're vulnerable and opening their lives to you and it's something to be grateful for as a viewer that I'm grateful for all the youtubers i watch as well and yeah just keep in mind yeah so in general just be nice guys when you're commenting it means a lot and it makes people's day like the amount of sleep the amount of youtubers I know and it literally makes them there Dave if my comments are the reason I keep creating videos like the comments that I get on my videos keep me going and every time I upload a video that's the first thing I'm like refreshing the comments and reading them and replying and yeah they mean a lot to a youtuber is that cool I think we're gonna wrap up guys one thing I'm seeing pop up a lot is are we gonna do some kind of Meetup walk quickly before we wrap up can you just comment in the comments tree what we should do as a meetup because I don't really just want to meet up and around them location and take selfies I don't have to take selfies but let's do something like should it be like a picnic and Kirsten Bosh or so let us know if you're from Cape Town or if you are not from Cape Town but like the idea of giving more meetups around the world like what kind of stuff Signal Hill and tell us what you think of yeah instead of just like a meet-up like well let's come and I'll take selfies let's I feel like I like the idea of us having meetups where we just do something on the beach - Lions heads hiking lots people resent hiking beachbody cool ok we'll look really guys there's lots flying in great I think we're wrapped for the night and we'll see you next weekend maybe we should do another doing the live stream this is really sweet ok guys thank you saying and have an amazing week there's always peace out enjoy your life and live the adventure 
[Music] good morning guys we are in Calumet I think that's how you pronounce it in northern Canada we arrived late last night we can get out of the airport we had have a bit of fiasco and unfortunately we're gonna have to head out first thing today so we didn't get to explore the area but it is pretty fascinating here it seems like a bit of a melting pot for people from all around the world coming here to kind of work for different things but yeah we're heading to Greenland today yeah I'm super pumped I've never been to bring him before so this is kind of hilarious we don't know how to get to a plane we had the same problem last night we didn't have to get through the terminal or out of the airport so we were trapped outside for like 45 minutes in the cold and now all the security guards like yeah I don't know how you get to the FBI where the planes waiting so he's gone to find out what are the most fascinating things about this place guys is the the written language I think correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is Inuit but look how beautiful that written languages it's amazing [Music] we're just heading over to fuel up and to drive down to the other end of the we need to taxi down together so the next leg we're flying today is over to Greenland to Nick on the west coast and this is probably the riskiest flight we've done yet which is why we're putting on the dry immersion suits like we did yesterday they're like full suits that if we do land in the sea we can get out without freezing to death so we're gonna have to wear those throughout the flight and have the raft the inflatable raft with us as well so we just quickly grab and get on the plane if we need to I've laid out all the foods here this is mats Louise and mine problem with mine is it's not it offers me no text arity in my hands so I might need to get Matt to do the takeoff out of here and then once we're in cruise all I'll consider maybe just take my arms out of the suit so I can do something at least [Music] but yeah the weather's great over here I'm not sure what its gonna be like over there we should get into nuke we wanted to go to our sauce walk or something today that's not happening and nuke is kind of a better place soot to really get to see Greenland so yeah but nervous and isn't how would I say it isn't a normal flight there's a lot of risk involved I'm gonna continue my pre-flight now do everything as thoroughly as I can and should go out the entrance running great no complaints [Music] so one of the questions we've been asking people out here is why are they living out here so remotely so disconnected from the rest of the country and everyone's saying that the money you can earn out here is incredible like even the security guard here was saying that he's earning between 150 and 200 thousand Canadian dollars a year I think he's doing a few different jobs but from what I can gather is something to do with the the government a Canadian government is subsidizing a lot of costs out here to keep towns out this remote in the north apparently this is what the guy said anyway to to make sure that Russia don't take over the Arctic which sounds crazy to me but maybe that was the original reason why they set up towns out here but yeah this is kind of baffling JP how many gallons can be held in total in the plane there 129 usable 132 onboard but only 129 we can actually use and what's the legal amount you want to have weigh in when you learned well the legal amount is 45 minutes well to an alternate plus 45 minutes but that's beyond my comfort zone i i prefer learning with as much reserve as possible so today today we're gonna land with about five hours of reserve which is what we kind of need because if we if we get there and it's below minimums we need to come back here so yeah I'm comfortable with today's flight in terms of reserve I'm not comfortable in terms of the terrain we need to fly over it's frightening if you saw yesterday's video we actually saw a few icebergs as we were flying in just flowing out and see which was kind of amazing also something different we're doing today is we Matt's attaching a camera a GoPro on the tail of the plane so we should get this really epic shot looking kind of over the top of the plane where we're heading guys can you see the angle we've gotten there and the plane how epic is that so you had to buy the fuel by the barrel and we just filled the plane with two barrels of faff gas that's crazy isn't it two whole barrels are in that plane [Music] okay time to get the suit back on hopefully I don't punch myself in the face like I did yesterday when I put in a zipper up [Music] because the water is literally right there as we take off we we have to take off Fuli zips up with our everything like look at my hands the suits are fully ready it just makes it more difficult to do anything yeah yeah where we going back to the stomach I think you did you do this silly is considerably cooler than ours yeah this is the first real overwater leg last night we got a little bit of a taste but today we're seeing actual icebergs gonna be out over the ocean for like three hours so it's really sweet bit of a problem guys we can't find the key anywhere which means we aren't going anywhere until we do we found the key where was it JP in here [Music] I advise that since no warming up crossed my hangers or it looks like they got something hanging off the pilots door there she filter some packet okay thanks Louie you strap was hanging out of the door okay Radio November 2 1 0 after uniform departing runway 3 4 0 uniform Roger contact Montreal center in 1 3 4 5 5 everyone [Music] Montreal Sunday November 2 1 0 actor uniform 1,300 climbing 5000 on the anello it to good she's happy that's good we're getting a good time right today oh it's nice and cold up here yeah most bizarre terrain I've ever seen it's kind of funny because it looks so beautiful but it is dancing right yeah you wouldn't want again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that was interesting yeah well hopefully we get everything back hopefully it was just the pedo thing through this thing for Lu as it will reboot e71 yeah so we the pitot heat that thing on the air that on the wing that takes the the meshes are I'm pressure or rhyme air flow yeah got completely blocked so we lost a speed plus this thing completely blanked both so yeah so basically it's a problem with this Aspen where is the pitot heat is blocked occasionally it just gives up completely that's great which is really really dangerous that's so annoying is that via blog through the ice yeah it was some kind of icing apparently because if we turning on the heat I got it back but it just doesn't make any sense because we haven't flown through any sort of moisture so it's really surprising I guess maybe the humidity is just bright because we are on - once and that humidity just probably little bit I guess immolated yeah that's crazy would have been very difficult to get there without this the weather was down to minimums are possible as we would have had no way of shooting an instrument approach like that can end up being deadly yeah if you have your alternate and everything is yeah it's both of these failed because of that that's that's really pretty crazy [Music] that was an awesome flight officer hello Thank You Louie yes oh so thick beautiful views on when stepping I thought the Canada Line lingos beautiful this is even more FA yeah yeah the airport alone [Music] [Music] guys we've had dinner we've been wandering around town a little bit and I had a Facebook message today from one of my friends who said I should meet one of her friends in Nick and we've met out with her this is Natasha Hey so we've been learning a lot about Greenland tonight I'll fill you in later on and hopefully tomorrow we get to have a proper sit-down interview but I'm gonna go meet some of their friends Matt still deciding whether he's gonna come out with us tonight yeah and we've we've grabbed a few snacks it's super expensive any guys like crazy expensive this is probably gonna cost me like $30 or something but we're only here for a couple of days and he'll be fine so we've only obviously only been here for like half a day but I've just been asking every question possible to everyone I can make mainly Natasha and we found out that there's no roads beyond this city which is the capital the smallest capital in the world by population there's no roads that go beyond it so you can't connect to any other town or city in the country or else there's they speak Greenlandic and Danish and E and English and I speak one language I'm embarrassed by that fact and then what else yeah we're trying to wrap our head around how the government works right now but we it's very confusing but it's very late also directly linked with Denmark and they use the Denmark currency The Crow not I'm just I'm doing it like this you taught us loads of stuff it's like a lesson thanks for a good night bye and Natasha's offered to be interviewed tomorrow for the documentary which is really cool because I feel bad that we've already been to the US and Canada and haven't really done any cool sit-down interviews yet but we can do some in the US when we come back round Bennu yeah we're gonna figure out some cool conversations to capture I guess time is more like a kind of a pre-interview interview so it there lots of lots of mind-blowing facts about Greenland which I'll try and I try to talk about more tomorrow but yeah we should probably head to bed and all the other thing is we may be staying with Natasha and a boyfriend tomorrow night which is why I really hoped for is to be able to stay with local people as we're traveling so if any of you guys want to host us as we're coming around the world that'd be awesome peace out enjoy life a little adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys I am in London which might not make a lot of sense to you because I literally flew to Cape Town a week ago but I just learned about the London for three days to attend the YouTube queries for change summit so I'm not sure exactly how much I'm going to be able to film but there's loads of cool creators from all over all around the world that come in and we're gonna be listening to talks chatting together networking and it's people that are just creating cool content that's doing positive stuff on the platform so yeah I'm excited for today and yeah as usual as usual I need to confine a coffee first [Music] today I did hear from some of the leading social change activists in the world some of the most inspiring figures of our time and some of the most creative individuals in the entertainment industry all of whom are using their platform and place to stand up for what they believe it today is also about recognizing natural ways that you guys made about celebrating your courage and about letting you know that YouTube believes in what you're doing and that YouTube we believe that the world is a better place when we listen share and build community through our stories YouTube creators for change is a critical part of this mission as Amani said in a moment of competing headlines and harmful misrepresentations of people different than us this program is a reminder that none of us are voiceless our stories deserve to be told and anyone has the power to hit record there hasn't been a time in youtube history when your voices were more necessary because your voices are louder and more powerful and that's why we're here today to collectively put our weight on the sides of the scale of empathy and understanding and acceptance that's what [Applause] I didn't think that I was that type of creator do I really create change right I just fangirl about Beyonce and eat chips really loud because I am not consistent what's the price of be great if the cost is to be savaged to ravage billions in damage whatever then it's gonna be more to it than just trying to be the best what all the creators gather together and unite for a purpose you could potentially reach the whole world and it's a little hard because in the low part is if you see something that breaks your heart you can actually do something about it and in their army side is it will come together were super powerful and we're gonna be heroes not only the influencers I am from Damascus from the capital sir which happens to be the oldest city in the world I used to tell stories for a living I was an English teacher and I love my job I felt like I was making a change I was building a generation teaching them incredible stuff about English social studies and and was part of raising situations in a city that well has had a long time of tyranny and dictatorship you guys for politics the Arab Spring waived from Libya through Egypt to Syria Iraq that was successful in Egypt it got really antennas yeah I was successful but I got really ugly in Syria unfortunately and I watched footage of kids who would rights graffitis on their role of the world their school but then they would beat and torture than the fingers we've blocked off so I did not agree without and I I always say that you and you're never born an activist you become one when there's a problem so I said I'm gonna do something about this I started protesting with my fellow Syrian civilians of us would we're down the streets of Damascus and and protest and I saw a camera and I think I could film protests and I can expose what's happening in my country so I can make a change well I got arrested and the men as they arrested me literally that was the minute thing they arrived and they got to us there were 20 minutes of beating Hannah meeting they broke both of my arms I smashed my wrists broke my ribs and electrocuted my leg so I got really damaged I can't really run anymore and then they could be imprisoned for two weeks where I lost 15 kilos and all the physical scars done emotional scars which I still battled with until this present day I couldn't feel safe in my home country anymore and I could have felt safe in my skin anymore so I left I was pissed off by the amount of ignorance on social media that people had when they spoke about refugees refugees and violence coming from everywhere I read the tweets comparing us to swarms cockroaches predators rapists uncivilized I saw so much which infuriated me and I hang on second i am i have my privileges I speak English I can photograph I can film I didn't want to be just a number I wanted to put the face on the crisis so I packed 27 years of my life in a rucksack I packed my PTSD my dreams in my house and I went on a dinghy with sixty other three Syrians from Turkey to Greece I thirteen children 10 women and pregnant woman university professors there was a belly dancer and they were engineered them me the teacher all of Syria was on boats 20 minutes after the boat started sailing it sank but thank God I made that decision of filming it I fixed up a GoPro on my leg I picked up to power backs 5 memory sticks I know if you go I'll show you that will crossing [Music] it's safe to say that expectations of Europe didn't align with reality we we thought that we will be welcomed but we weren't in the Calais jungle have you heard of the jungle which is a makeshift camp in calais northern France I was there for 60 days hiding in lorries jumping on trains and I would get arrested every day I would jump over five fences hide in a lorry get arrested while I'm away back to the port and they'll get sent back 60 days after being in Calais I bring I buy myself a fake Bulgarian passport and then I flew British Airways from Brussels to London I arrive after 87 days in Heathrow and then my line up with other arrivals and that was the moment where you just have to say listen I'm a refugee I want to clear myself and that was the very first woman that I have to admit I'm a refugee now that wasn't gonna claim it and for me it was difficult to put to put 27 years of my life and just one word I'm a refugee because I'm not I'm not just a refugee I'm a brother and a son and a teacher so all that footage I mean these three white men from the BBC and they are making a film wait let's see you so I see them and then we work together and we make a documentary series called Exodus allogeneic syrup it was on BBC 2 the film did so incredibly well it was aired all over the world it is really really well actually I'll show you another clip since we've made this documentary over 10,000 people have died trying to seek refuge in here their largest numbers they're not just fact 60 sticks they are husbands and wives and fathers and mothers and children and they yeah this goes to that it goes to the untold stories see the worst and the best of humanity I almost got killed and assaulted confinement cell and then I'm hearing wit's end doing really well for myself now I have to say I wouldn't have been treated this well without the kindness of people like you like more normal humans who have given me a spare room to live in or people who spoke for me or people who didn't speak for me but people who've given me a platform to speak because I haven't poisoned a platform and what you guys do is that you get platforms to people talk to do that as well but I feel like we should all be role models for the coming generation thank you very much [Music] okay guys we have stopped for lunch it's been a very inspiring but also overwhelming morning like I had a I shed a few tears it's like yeah just powerful stories and it's amazing to think that people that have been here this morning what they've been through and the way they've already impacted the world in such big ways I guess here there's a lot of hope you know often with some of these hard stories and difficult situations around the world we feel a bit helpless but that's not how I feel today this has been super empowering and hopefully some of the snippets I'm able to show in this blog so give you guys hope next time I you poor I guess sharing your voice on a platform like this and finding ways to highlight important issues in the world and change people's minds and situations and be part of a movement for change in the world so yeah we're already halfway through the day I've met some cool people I'm hoping that this is a catalyst to spark some amazing opportunities for me to get more involved with other movements and things happening around the world in [Music] must be no highlight of the day so far who's like a refugee and filmed himself in the book while his booth was sinking oh my god and it's always great to see Louise I just wanna cap gentlemen and so much respected appreciation but I gotta put this in the video yeah right on to the second half of the day everyone's sitted and ready so you are very well now sport you are social activism leader your social media my arm and are also being on the streets protesting so how has social media changed the landscape of protesting both within our perception of protesting and then within the action of protesting there are so many people the way they told the truth the first time it was like online it was a good digital space someone that I think about protest is the idea of telling the truth in public and that's what we do with our bodies as we go along that's powerful [Music] [Applause] Oh [Applause] [Music] the 2017 white supremacy is on the rise the world is tense and racially divided there are millions of people around the world right now struggling with their identity this is reality unfortunately for 65 million people around the world do we you and me here in these videos really create change nothing in this world would change and everybody's sitting here working out their own problems I try my best to change the perception that people have of Muslims they eat weekly be sieved just like everyone else with just a bit area - a new head it's your job to be the change that you wanna see in the world making impossible for them to ignore you and we'll get [Music] he takes a great deal of courage to see the world and always changing glory and still love it [Music] right it's the end of the day like I said earlier lots to process it's been super inspirational we're heading back now I'm gonna try and grab a little nap and then we're heading out for dinner for a party how was your day was it good Dave good thing this guy

usual and these events are difficult to vlog but hopefully from the little snippets you've seen and the conversations are concluded yeah you get a taster it's left me feeling like just really hopeful for YouTube you know I think there's so many things that have happened this year which were recently on YouTube which sometimes makes you feel like ah the platform is just you know it's just become like a bad and toxic place but I feel like seeing YouTube putting so much support behind people from countries all around the world that are wanting to do amazing things and and stand up for equality and women's rights and you know believing that we need to have equality across you know all all walks of walks of life and and wherever in the world with from whatever religion and whatever color you know it's just very yeah it's just very good to see and make it gives me hope again you know anyway before I sign out I have another thing to tell you about so a friend of mine Mario has been doing an

[Music] good morning guys we have cruised over to the other side of the island today and I'm still hanging out these boys from the wine base out here where we head in today what's the place we're going to Narnia yeah apparently some cool waterfalls maybe we can go swimming yeah I'm excited I haven't visited any waterfalls in Hawaii on this trip yet so it's about time okay there's some guava is hanging on the trees here good that's right this is the gates Narnia thank you that is a that's an interesting gate make sure you close it yes [Music] heading over to do most people are just going in there swimming stuff because there's a high chance I'll fall in the river I've got so much gear on me that would be bad that'd be really bad this is is very sketchy we're just walking along this little Ridge here and it's quite a head strong current I can feel it trying to sweep my legs out from below beneath me managed to get across the first obstacle I had to put my cameras away because I needed both my hands now we are trekking through this little bit of undergrowth here to get to the next to the main waterfall where there's like an area to swim and stuff right have to cross this little bit of this little stream before we got up to the big water so this doesn't look super deep it's just dawned on me guys from dipping my feet in and also seeing other people's reactions to the water temperature that is absolutely freezing [Music] guys you're gonna be disappointed in me I chickened out I just decided you know we're going to be doing other things later I don't want to get super cold now you know what like with a cold it's really nice it's chilly in there watching those guys jumping into stuff I think I'll wait until there's like kind of a more like a warm water swimming who I think would be more ideal for me I think even the sea is a lot warmer than this another day another day okay these guys are heading across in this contraption we found it's like a I don't know what this is it looks like a zip line when you go into the middle they just leave you in the middle all right back out of the gate sylia Narnia very very cool [Music] guys this is my favorite plant so beautiful I corrupt with one of these plants in my bedroom it wasn't as big as s so this is like a massive massive block these leaves are insane right back of the car we're gonna go and get some is it lunchtime if I even always be dinnertime I think oh no a spare time or pikes we're heading into this burger joint thankfully they they have vegan options thank you okay we just had a delicious meal we're now we're now making a plan to go and find the lava flow the volcano last time I was in Hawaii they this recent lava flow hasn't started but it's lava flowing into the sea currently and I've seen some of the other guys come and visit it so I'm gonna go and try and find it it's raining right now I'm hoping it's not raining where the lockers so guys we've driven about 45 minutes we've stopped this place I don't know where we are but we are I followed instructions of where to go to walk to the lava in fact we might actually be able to cipher there's like some bike rental place there guys little problem these bikes don't have mud guards and if you can look over here this is what happens when you don't have a mouth guard on your bike this would suck if you had to walk here guys 1.5 miles to go until the lava saying a danger volcano fumes are hazardous to your health and may be life-threatening [Music] getting there wouldn't see little glimpses of lava I'm hoping we just see like a raging torrent of lava into the sea but I don't know maybe maybe we're going tonight any larvae we see basically is a bonus I say into these guys I'm just enjoying this bike ride regardless this is so fun we've parked up a bike's locked him up and we are gonna head down to where the lava meets the scene well we just met someone who said it's this way so as we're walking on check this out this is a this is the ground look at this this is like just ripples of molten lava just I guess well it's not molten anymore I wonder how old this is probably not that old this is really it's just really bizarre and it's like shimmering yeah it feels really light as well as in it like it's like it's full of air it's almost like rope or like Platts like people like head it's so easy to imagine like what this was like when it was molten and like how it formed and like flowed everywhere and we hey guys we have spotted the lava definitely not a torrent definitely not like a massive flow of lava but [Music] do you know what's crazy here is we're watching land form we're watching like the country expand or not the country the state I guess USA is getting bigger right here everywhere you scan here at one point energy Disney's birthday [Music] I can feel the warts again okay with back at the bikes that was quite an adventure as pretty epic seeing new land form like in front of our eyes that was yeah that's pretty special that's the first me [Music] hey sorry we're late we had a we had a bit more fun out there than we time the 2-hour ride home please we are back we're back in Kona it's gone one a.m. I need to go and do some editing now I'm still crashed on the couch it's been really awesome hanging with these guys I've got lots to process and tell you about but it's been it's been a pretty um yeah it's been a pretty significant stop on this trip and yeah I won't go into it all now but it's been like spiritually restorative restorative replenishing I don't know you know I'm trying to say it's been great alright I'll catch in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
three wires cracked at this time usually my coffee okay okay okay guys I think we got it right so welcome to you this is a little coil thing we're trying guys today tell me so today we are doing video I haven't really done one of these before we didn't love advice one but this I've opened up to just any any type of advice I'm not saying that we have the best advice but and righty but yeah I think previous live streams have done they're a bit more like Q&amp;A and stuff so hopefully this all you know we were just try something different hopefully this normally we're like answering questions about ourselves in our lives this way we can like you guys can ask or like right asking and there's a spectrum of questions that we've already kind of got on Twitter at alignment and then we'll start asking something the comments but some pretty deep so I think we should start off a bit lighter and then maybe we can touch them some of the deeper more kind of heaviness subjects which I think it's important to talk about I don't always feel like I had the best advice in certain situations though he tried cool ok so first thing we're being asked was what could you do I'm not gonna make names in case like they're like personal things gates what should you do if you want to discover the world but you have the biggest anxiety to go into the unknown now I've got friends that have anxiety I personally haven't really suffered from it but I feel like something that can help is taking small steps so maybe just going somewhere nearby somewhere very familiar but you know you can try some new things and then once you've kind of bit bill up a bit confidence to do that you can then kind of stretch confidence to the next step so taking small steps don't jump in the deep end even like if you're going to another country choose one that isn't too unknown like if you're from Europe maybe go to another year and country versus like going to Asia thing that's like totally culturally different just yeah yeah something that's not won't would be a huge shock to your system and if you've got friends family try to travel with people that feel familiar to you so it's not just like everything's changing all that one's yeah that's that yeah that's the other bit was just having someone there with you helps a lot it's kind of taking on the burden and there's a lot of amazing youtubers they have talked about things I need that yeah because we don't experience it so we don't really have specific advice on that but Zoe I know there's some really good videos so right the next one so this is someone saying would you know how to help with trying to find a passion for something and they're saying I have things I love but I'm not passionate about anything how do you do it this is tough for me because I think I've always had things I'm passionate about I think because I've moved so much it was like I was always trying new things literally I was always playing different sports and taking different classes and trying new things and I think it's just about embracing that because and I've done a whole video on this as well and there's too much pressure on you have to find one passion that your whole life revolves around and like you're spending you and the rest of your life chasing that one passion and if some people do know today that's amazing but some people will never have that and that's okay as well and it's just about trying new things and finding little things that you like it might not be one thing that you love more than anything else it might be a bunch of little things and trying to figure out how you can do a combination of things as your career is a hobby whatever I don't think everyone has one passion that their whole life revolves around and that's okay I think that adding to that I think start with pursuing things that you are passionate or feel you like you really love doing things one day and that helps you exercise this operating out of the place of what you're you know or your heart saying they'll never be explained myself right I think sometimes we can get so stuck in thinking what we should be doing or often even we passion think or what would be a good thing to be passionate about I'd say don't disqualify you can be passionate about whatever like volleyball or it can be like drawing or be Liebling it could be anything that you find a passionate leader in fashion freaks you out you enjoy makes you happy what you're doing I've got a story from about my friend Rob he's like a bigger role model in my life and he said he had this problem where he felt he was stuck in life and then he kind of some of the advice in just one of your heart what is it saying be the wildest weirdest craziest thing and that will unlock this ability to kind of pursue and he just really wanted to go back to his family home in the UK and swim naked in his family's swimming pool which is like a crazy thing but he said as soon as you went back and did that and that action have actually just finding something you want to do it could be crazy doing it it unlocks this process of like continuing to find things you want to be doing and loving and then I'll also say in terms of fear your passion to be anything I mean hopefully positive hopefully it's not harming other people but it could be anything and just in the just in the way that you live passionately again with your life or what you're doing then that can be contagious of people that can impact people even if they're not do jesting about this you could love doing puzzles people but I feel like that can be contained Center being around one's passionate enthusiastic person has a massive impact on those around you so anyway smooth Dex and just try new things like try tons of new stuff throw yourself into every day doing something new and finding little things that you like okay we're still a twist by the way how many looked in their youtube comment comments yet but it's the lows fly again and then we do a few actually guys if you get a chance to scroll through these people are giving advice as well so someone said here never stop chasing your dreams because sometimes what we need is just one more step use every excuse you can to stay motivating to keep yourself working hard remember failure is not an option and then they might fully agree on the failure not being an option because often failure helps us learn to succeed and I think a lot of my life is based on trial and error where I will don't be scared to fail I think failure it's never ends I guess that's that's what you'll be saying down make sure you can get up again anyway back to Twitter if you on Twitter because it takes too long to read there's so much exists fly Melissa plan to go over to my Twitter and we'll be answering from there so college it's been buzzing with mine for too long I want to make money using my skills online it you guys got anything to say about modern college and know the best way to say like flat-out discourage people from getting education but I'm just saying make sure something that is critical to what you want to be doing don't just do it as like most of my friends didn't know what they wanted to do and they were like I guess let's go to college and maybe I'll figure it out and it's in the UK like gap years are really encouraged awesome it lets you I think if you know what you want to do go to college helps you get there yeah but I think I think going out and taking a year out before potentially going to college and trying different things apply for internships at places it will just I know I need like free work experience and that end up getting me a job somewhere and I'd say just yeah look try really hard at what you feel like you you could if you want to work doing whether you want to do online work basically get paid for online skills what I'll ask what are your skills can you just start small like for instance it is if it's like photography maybe you could get a nice portfolio online you could ask your friends to help you shoots for free and then you slowly build up you might have been offer like a bunch of shoots out a reduced rate as you're building up your kind of portfolio whether it's design work or if it's like consultancy aware like these things I just say slowly build up and then for me I've always found whether I've worked in like before YouTube where the word of mouth really helps like friends of friends that you know you can get work you know I didn't websites and stuff anyway yeah just also if you take a year out and you're able to do internships and try things even if you think you know what you want to do if you do an internship and then actually work in the office or wherever you would be working then you get a taste of whether you'd actually like it or not because so many of our friends are like I did four years of finance and then a real my work in finance so you want to try to avoid that hopefully so testing things out is awesome so this is a pretty deep one but I think I want to skip it just for this deep and someone said here my boyfriend's dad passed away a few weeks ago and he's really depressed and I feel really anxious and don't know what to do is make it feel to make it better and I feel like I'm letting down I would love to get some advice to me now I haven't had a lot of kind of folks people to be died but I've had a few of my friends have debts in the family and stuff I think I think this will be honest and say to boyfriend like I don't know what to do and I know what to say I don't think anyone ever does though I think it's like the hardest situation and I think people people can't relate like if you have another place that you can't be like oh you know I understand that you feel you just say I've never never fathom like how you really feeling but I want to be here yeah sometimes you just they you might not want to have the chats and relive how you're feeling but just have some someone's company or they say be really open to how you are feeling as well just say that I mean obviously if you if you love this person you want to be there for them just say that I love you want to be there how can I be there for you I just sit here and hang out with you and just be feeling empathy to have it been going through stuff and you're not letting them down you can just the fact that you ask this question means that you care and that you're to do what you can to make him like have an easier time through this so do you definitely not let me move down and you're being an awesome girlfriend and yeah just be there for him whatever that means for him and whatever he needs at the time okay finding real people and real relationships my answer to that I personally hate small talk I can't do it so pretty much with the first time I meet someone I get into real conversations asking like deeper questions and that's my way to get real I think a lot of people for some reason is just the small talk is just default some people stayed there for like a whole relationship with friends or whatever even like a romantic relationship but for me just get deep talk about things that really matter to you from the beginning and that's how you'll find people that you like connect with and stuff okay another big one it's pretty pretty heavy but I don't skip it how come I learn to love and respect myself for being the person I am and where every every look into the mirror is a kind of torture and you're unable to believe that others like you I mean honestly I feel like my whole channel is like dedicated to help there I don't think it's like it one easy answer kind of thing but first I'm gonna say it gets better with age which I both kept telling you that any believe it but I'm 25 now and I'm telling you like now versus two years ago even one year ago it's just so much better I think maybe focus on what you're grateful for your life and focus on things that you're proud of you've achieved I think I mean I think that it sounds like maybe you're talking about looking into the mirror I guess which physic to be a reflection or it could be what you see in yourself right now might give you a challenge of look back on 2017 and think of one thing that you did or achieve that you're really proud of I think it's so easy to look and like think about oh I didn't do this or I'm so bad at that but forget all of that and think what's one thing that you're really proud of and focus on that stuff and just go easy on yourself and try to think of yourself okay think of the voice in your head as like a friend like you know you can be mean to yourself think about another friend would you ever talk that way to one of your friends you wouldn't we're all so hard on ourselves and mean sometimes and try to think of it as like a friend friend relationship and try to show a little bit of love and empathy for yourself and another thing is we live in an age where probably more than any time in the history of our entire than the entire human race we live in a day to day obsession of comparison where we're bombarded with like these perfect images and lives of other people and social media and I think that's super toxic and I feel like and I struggle at times you struggle with comparison you look at everyone like I'm not as good looking as them I'm not having as much fun as them on as much money as them it could be all of these different things at the end of the value like we it that's only ever gonna eat us up inside like we've got to stop comparing ourselves to people I'm not saying it's easy to do I don't know how would we do that but I feel like it's so important to realize we're all individual and no one can be like a better rider than Ryan no one can be a better living than living and they'll be a better whatever or whoever is watching them you like we are also individual and so perfect to be us we need to look at how can we pledge the most and I advise no one else can you're hating who you are as a person if you're like I wish I was like this person it's not gonna like you are you and that's the only thing that's the only possibility so just make the most of the you that you are and yeah like finally what makes you flourish and what find your light and spread it and hit is one that I can relate to even today how do you motivate yourself every day even when you have nothing planned I am struggling with this right now because I've slowed down the day looking a little bit which was a just a routine for me we are based up which is also a very new thing for me being in a place you know rather than just going no automatically going week to week to new places and then also I've been kind of had my head for the last week in kind of preparing some footage for this edit anyway motivations load me a moment I what I really get back out there and you know I feel like it's it can be easily swallow up and not being motivated but I would say sometimes just pushing yourself to go outside meet up with friends go leave something new even if it's small I think it's easy to say if you're saying inside the day which I have big last week yeah I'd say even you know saying you do you have nothing clad let's say your plans and stuff like plans me our friends plan to going deuce where your passion is like going to be some photography or you know ever try and get a few plans in I sometimes like struggle to get out of bed in the morning unless I have a reason see and then if I've got something flapping like we've got to get somewhere like early for me early tomorrow morning if that wasn't planned I probably stay up doing it so now I have to be sleeping to lunchtime again but for me that would you know actually getting something in also if I know I'm gonna let someone down then I'm less likely to miss something so if I agree to go to meet someone for something amazing also make sure you I think when your lack of motivation a lot of times people maybe invites are coming in for things but it's so easy to like find random excuse oh I'm not feeling well or oh I can't just try let make an effort to not just find an excuse out of things since I've been go through this as well just make yourself say yes even if you're like oh all I want to do seeing my PJs and watch TV all day I just feel like no this is it I'm saying yes I'm going to dinner or whatever it is just make that effort and on the segments friends that's under saying how you say motivated for exercise I need to get fit for bone life and hiking in general fund ventures by Mesabi potato right now no I am terrible that exercise like we've actually I know this is like a very privileged thing we've actually got personal trainer that we're gonna be next week this isn't a solution because obviously that cost money but maybe it's be not with another friend who also wants to buy a baby I recently like bought an online workout plan kind of thing and when I first bought it I did it for a little while and I think putting money into something motivates you more to do it because there's tons of like free to videos and stuff but if you pay like 50 bucks or whatever you're like I just paid money so I can't just ignore it so maybe something like that could be a little incentive so many good ones guys so disa quit what someone said they want to get corrective eye surgery LASIK which might had a few years ago and is there anything that's changed better or worse since you've got surgery I'd slay say well I got it done it was like insane perfect vision and it's just slightly dull but it hasn't gone back to what it was I think because I've been like staring at a computer screen for like two three years it's like that don't my vision a tiny bit like different tiny bit but I'm a massive fan of LASIK because I wear glasses before to see anything I can watch the TV or cinema or drive-in outdoors as much I'm planning a trip to London in May but I'm really struggling with money I'm so bad at saving with college and everything how do you manage the money stuff when you were younger I had a bit of an extreme where I literally Kyle every expense of my life I didn't drink so that helps me a lot I ain't probably actually unhealthily yeah I literally bought bulk cheap if I can you know I was eating really healthy really cheap that to be honest that's preach me what I cut out me is because me is super expensive like cheese that kind of stuff I was thinking salads come goats like the local market and buy star cheap stuff is like a little bit like it's not the really fancy shiny stuff in the market if you have kind of our local markets I would buy tons of fruit and veg and eat really healthy cheap but like never eat out at restaurants or anything never like get Starbucks all those little expenses add up so try to look at your life and see if there any little expenses going to I don't know if you go to movies all the time whatever little things you do try to cut back on that stuff and yeah make travel the priority yeah yeah just discipline yourself imagine endo like okay I'm not gonna bother myself there's a bag or whatever so I can have like sale you know to you know go traveling we have been going for 24 minutes guys we're gonna do another 10 minutes I think this is coffee everytime before we start movies like Ranger one like 15 minutes thanks to cap cap seven did get donated $10 on the livestream just because thanks I felt bad we didn't break in reading these comments it's loading on Twitter slow refresh guys this help for words it's like do you find there's like good with the nice thing here advice from like us other I'm hoping say exploring new job says and how do I stop a milkshake cravings jobs we love me but we're gonna answer some serious question how do you live your dreams ignore what other people think about this baby I mean it's tough it's so most people are just really trying to fit in and make a Boppy and doing something that people might judge you for whatever seems like the scariest thing we are that age 50 Wow but trying to find someone that believes in your dream even if you've got one friend that can be sparingly one like I think that's what's always I helped me is like some people love that something things that wanted today but I've always have that probably one or two close friends that always believe me so I don't know whether I'm wearing also find people online that might maybe share your dream so if you have something well crazy and everyone around you thinks that you're crazy for wanting to do that maybe you can find even like a youtube channel in the comments people who like feel the same way or an excited about the same thing and have a similar dream just try to find someone that you can bounce off of and you're having a load day they can help you get excited again and yeah definitely having a little support group don't have someone in real life thankfully we're so lucky to other than that and I'm sure you can find people and he's he's a heavy one how do you move on from intense relationship breakup when you really find it so difficult to move on and the other partner has already moved on I would say like breakups one of the hardest things in life like I think I'm not comparing it's like the death of somebody being away it is like somebody that you loved them in close and intimate who is no longer in your life so in some ways it it's on the same level is not the same level but on this towards that spectrum have actually been using somebody new life and I'd say this is such a cliche out of a time really does heal and I think was awake that time to that's people deal with grief in different ways like they might just eat lots of ice cream movies I don't like rob yourself of of having some time just to like cry and like what I'm not saying like I don't know save months and months of lying in bed crying to say allow yourself to work through it but yeah again make sure you've got some good friends around and I just got thrown in there to try to not close your heart after something like that I think especially if you've been hurt by someone it's easy to say like oh I'm done I'm not gonna do this it's not worth it to build like a wall around your heart and that's that's only gonna be tough for you in the future that's never a good thing having your heart open yes it's a risk and every time you go bring your relationship or fall in love with someone you can you'd risk but if it pays off then it's the most incredible thing that could ever happen to you so don't close up off from love I'd say it's worth getting over some advice sometimes think like in if you have this intense feeling of infatuation and love for something you can sometimes forget maybe the things that don't work in the relationship and I think when I've had to when I've been broken up with and I've been trying to get over somebody I think you can bet it's good to them probably focus on and realize actually maybe this isn't the perfect person for me maybe I was kind of fooling myself a little man you start placing those things actually what would the perfect person be like what would the things I mean what are the things that weren't great in that relationship and focus actually maybe you would be better suited or deserve a different type of person in the future so it's yeah it's always hot though I don't know if there's an easy solution okay here we go very deep but what is your opinion on the progression of mental illness awareness maybe YouTube should do something I actually think YouTube is incredible platform for this because personally for me there's so many things around mental health that I wasn't really aware of or anything have anyone in my life that was battling with certain things and watching YouTube videos of people like before I mentioned so easy anxiety video but I lost that video years ago that's the first time I've ever seen anyone talk about that because again no one in my life would really opened up to me about it or struggling with it that I really knew of so YouTube is an incredible place people are so open and vulnerable and I think a lot of people use YouTube and maybe find that they're finding people open up about things that they also are battling with and to have that connection I need it's helping a ton of people so I think it's ever like it's it's always gonna need to be getting better and it's unfortunately it is still a stigma it our society to talk about this stuff but I do think that people are more and more open and opening up more and people are more accepting hopefully yeah I think we're all making great very very um I think it's heading in a good direction okay here's some advice maybe even answer for love advice there's a girl I've liked five years I can't find a way to let em know I like I mean this is like kind of a little more informational minutes but why do I you like good friends and best friends do you like kind of know she has a clearly that if you even if you're good friends if you like someone for five years then that's real it's not sometimes maybe if you have a friend and you like think you like them but then a month later you're like no actually I don't our friendship but it doesn't going for five years I need you have to let them know because it doesn't sound like that's going away anytime soon so even if it's a friend and you're worried that it could affect your friendship it sounds like like if you're good friends you see her all the time then and you and you like that you're not telling them surely that's painful for you so I think whether your friends are not whether that they never even spoken I don't know I think I think it's worth saying something or doing something just like kind of hinted it or yeah just but to be quiet about it seems silly because what if they let you back what if they're also making the same thing and then you're wasting all this time not being with them and what if they don't like you back then maybe that'll tell you that and we've really hard and it'll hurt and be like the worst thing ever but after you eat ice cream to cry for a little while then you can move on from that person because obviously that's not the person for you and sometimes you might have to know if you in the back of your mind you always got this idea that they need to be with that person that they don't want that and it might be helpful but sometimes you can find a place to have the mutual friendship again it's tough but I feel like it's because the other ones like surely then there isn't fear like I could tell them they know friendship so I think yeah yeah yeah but but normally and what I've seen amongst my friends is you needed some kind of periods to pull back and to kind of get used to them by their different scenarios I'm thinking it could work out really well yeah it could it might not work out as we want yeah but either way you should ya know because you not saying something isn't helping you either way whether they like you back and you're going to be happy forever that's obviously an incredible life thing to come out of it or if they don't like you back then it's better to know sooner rather than later because 20 years from you and then I think yeah anyway thanks guys the world and we'll see you next week and yeah hope you some of these things have helped maybe we'll do another one of these you liked it if you didn't like it once yeah anyway we're gonna sign out but yeah so like if you like this kind of thing you know see you next week peace out enjoy life a little bit venture baby 
[Music] fine afternoon guys we had to be able to change in plan today we were supposed to leave shrine conversing in the morning the weather on the flight light of the room basically go really bad overnight so we cancel so in that a super chilled morning and now me and JC are going out for the tuk-tuk is better enjoyed by the temple nearby you know they surround them do joining us as well Sri Lanka is so beautiful meaning the antedates lovely we saw an elephant last time around midnight misleading by the weather the house at the I think Oh Lord which is pretty special so we were right this is the this is the temple here is this a Buddhist temple so I do really love the written language and SriLankan check it out hello so this this monk just met his his house here this is made from a mixture of like dirt and cow dung mixed together quite a few people around the world used after building material must be pretty strong and then I think this is a leaf from a coconut palm guys have you ever seen kitten suckling that's so amazing is this where the elephants drink these little frogs little the little frogs somewhere in this little pond there's a crocodile I don't know whether they're joking or not must be really small cooking ah [Music] right back in the tuk-tuk I'm going to do some follow shots of the dry [Music] we're looking for the elephant's no luck yet [Music] alright time for dinner [Music] [Music] well it's 1:00 a.m. I'm going to be heading to bed soon we have to be up in three hours and hopefully we will be leaving Sri Lanka shortly after that but depends depends on whether the weather behaves itself and this next flight is quite a long flight over the ocean and this area I don't have our saying before but it's part of the world is the weather's like the worst kind of weather you want to be flying through what is the most kind of temperament or storms can pop up out of nowhere so yeah JP is concerned understandably and yeah I've just got to be very wise which is why we didn't fly it this morning it's been a pretty chilled day today I managed to catch up on some sleep from the night before that and manage to get some edits done and yeah I'm really excited for the next week or so I'm excited to get to Bali and that should be a lot of fun right I'll catch you guys in the morning peace out enjoy life live the adventure [Music]

Friday okay worst case we buy this battered a Saturday Sunday I love it because this looks so far yeah but because of the projection of Wow yeah it's so these are this is much shorter actually so the distance we flew across the u.s. now is the same distance that we can apply to [Music] cherien 0xo uniform contact approach one to four point four what do you 4.4 [Music] [Music] guys we found food Dominic's diner JP what is the name of the town we just flew into it's not actually Bosphorus Lawrence okay so we're we're not far from Boston we didn't fly into the main international Boston Airport but we're ready for food this is our breakfast okay guys we have met Matt he's just come to join us the airport he's gonna be flying with us he's gonna be overseeing the flight because he is actually flown around the world before so we're gonna flee with the youngest okay not just everybody the youngest so yeah he's gonna be joining us for the next two weeks three weeks see I'm sick Chrissy we're just gonna convince him to drop out of MIT and he is just finally brought over some stuff we had delivered including this new Garmin tracking device which means you guys hopefully will be able to keep up with our trip that was the plan from the beginning that we had some issues with the other device we were using and I'm sorry if you'd been wanting to track us ever to that as of today or tomorrow we'll get this guy working it's exciting yeah don't touch that bye okay we've finished lunch JP and Matt have had to shoot off in the plane to a nearby airport to get a few final tweaks done just to make the make sure the plane is running as best as it possibly can for the next couple of legs nothing major just some just some tweaking and I've opted to stay behind to catch up with the vlogs so I've just been sitting down editing in this lovely lounge here it was the airport Falcon air and but yeah yeah it's another one of those days kind of sway ting and we're hoping either tomorrow or the next day will be flying up to Goose Bay in Canada and then from there on to Greenland but maybe today or tomorrow I could finally get around to trying to map out the entire journey for you guys I know a lot you've been asking like why didn't you do the map yet but we we have been talking lots about different places and yeah I'll do my best we've still got the map sitting in the plane so yeah I'll pull that out later [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the autopilot is better yeah outlet works Oh what was the problem the actual wire was just the guy was like yeah and these are all claims the actual wire just gets to all and like the internal resistances oh she just had to replace the wire okay we're gonna find somewhere to stay for the night I think pretty much all the little issues with the plane to be sorted Dave here we got mostly issue storage now they're not major not met they aren't like serious thing they're just more we want to get everything perfect yeah the main thing is we can charge our iPhones and iPads now so we can watch an effort sold away yep me too actually perfect so that's the biggest priority and then the autopilot and artificial Rises and stuff that secondary honestly my spirits have lifted about 30% since that's good it is lessens the stress loads significant I'm happy but make me happy man well I'm super bummed so I'm fine you have you do yeah okay we have driven it to Boston after getting a quite nice dinner over in wherever we were I always do this we were in a small airport just outside arrested Lawrence got dinner and now we're staying with Matt he's finally letting us crash in his room we were gonna get our own room here but they haven't got any available so thankfully there's a sofa bed I mean JP again they were spent okay I've just headed out of the hotel because we are trying to activate a new satellite device that we can use on the plane for you guys to track us you know we've been having problems over the last few days trying to get the tracking device working anyway I have this this new Garmin inReach device that we just set up so it needs to acquire a GPS fix and they can't do it from inside the hotel rooms they get outside war open sky is sending activation so guys I've managed to set it up so every two minutes it pings our location so there it's pinged us in the middle of Boston check that out your hair white the boys are asleep I'm gonna get some sleep - it's so exciting to have Matt join us and I'm glad that that's just a leaving a little bit of the pressure on JP tomorrow the plan is we're going to start heading up through Canada and then from there continue onward east around the world so I think we're going to be going to Greenland and Iceland in the UK and yeah that's gonna be joining us for all of those legs also he has a YouTube channel guys which I'm gonna link below so you can check out his videos they're primarily aviation stuff and then he does a bit of travel adventure vlogging as well but yeah go and check him out show him some love he's yeah he's just so valuable to this trip and we can be doing it without him so yeah thanks Matt and yeah we'll catch you tomorrow as we head into Canada peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys it is about 5:30 in the morning I'm getting kind of used to these early mornings got a few hours sleep we are leaving Kuala Lumpur Malaysia today and we're heading to Bali and we've just seen this really posh like departure lounge this is lucky business starflowers vibes they were gonna raid up some of the food for for the flight get snacks for that journey JC how are you feeling about today's flight yeah what about the volcano they okay the volcano in Bali is like just about to blow it's like you know massive plumes of smoke point out everyone's evacuated it's probably a little bit silly that we're gonna be flying in there but apparently it's unlikely they'll ground all air traffic even if the volcano does blow we're having a little McDonald's breakfast on the runway well not the runway not the robot me in the the runways right there on the apron I know I know I should be I'm just checking for water in the fuel so it's a couple hours me to analyse it water is denser than fuel so it'll always be at the bottom and I'm always also able to look for debris in the fuel make sure it's clean you never know whether fuel has been and how old it is it's good to inspect you feeling good about today's flight jaitley yeah excited excited to get there it's just much longer flight thinner I don't know I was just hoping it's gonna be this I guess it is less what's it like six hours yeah yes they was a big flight I did just see a lightning strike over that direction but I feel like is that that's not the direction we're flying is this is very slightly [Music] [Laughter] [Music] thank you have a good day so we've been doing it exactly one hour now no apartment so the we're playing in a port on our roof which is about five hours down the line from and they refuse to clear us because that April doesn't open for another two hours but we're not gonna be there for at least another five it justice anyway it just it's just frustrating because there's a storm on the way I need to get out of here I need to get at least 200 miles away from here ASAP press 2 the weather is fine it's just local and and now we're delayed because of incompetent today traffic control which is just shocking and this is nothing to do with Malaysia this is me this is just Indonesia that's being full of crap anyway ok we'll be yeah it looks like we got about to get our clearance so we've been parked up here for a little bit now so stupid what's up it's so stupid it isn't actually stupid like like why didn't they think where we were departing from didn't they not look at that before saying no they just they just looked at the Department departure time and then the entire flight it's just stupid obviously it takes a while to get places just confirm this possible closer to party time wait I'm confused so I'm able to leave now all right I'll taxi back to kilo I'll just come back later [Music] to zero maintain 4,000 feet and to 6-0 you do know you're vectoring me into storm circumference I got a little surprise sent out to Bali for you the latency I gave another address to air it this way fancy oh you know what I could do it as a hobby boss oh yeah then one three two that's more seven five six you know what the slogan of hobby boys are evil must get there for you know what I mean makes kids happy it makes me very happy [Music] you don't say that vegan but it don't say that don't contain take gelatine baby cow gelatin it's just whale gelatine start pitocin [Music] we are landing in seven minutes we're close yeah I was really hoping we'd see the volcano at the game it [Applause] never in my life but I think I'd fly an aeroplane into this Airport it's big no it's tiny but it's like I've been here numerous times when I do something that I don't usually do want to land without flaps okay there might be a little office I'll try my best what's the advantage of learning without flap there's no advantage it's just landing without collapse as an emergency procedure because it means your flaps have failed so I'm just practicing there's no risk all right give them oh yeah other space landed I wasn't too bad barley so our friend tio has come to pick us up I don't know if you remember when me and Raya in barley last time we work this is that incredible house they had like a little treehouse area and it's like really really beautiful

to get through things all within the plane the next couple of days we're attempting to pick up a life raft and emergency life raft we're going to rent one we were looking at buying one yesterday but

let the air out and when they land at all and while this is amazing - Annette so this is I've already been with that well there is a motor which never fits you anyway like to mention that so I guess

that no not gonna it some tea would be great yeah um a no bite but I'd be tempted to let talk into a survival rations Herbalife micro I'm so hungry you're like don't touch somebody much that's what they always ask me is like flying must be so exciting away yeah I tried very hard to make it not exciting to me that's a very broken zone why I'm so excited and he discussed all perfect and like oh you do this we're in a survival unit and you're like starting to just snack I hate in Nevada biscuits I think that's the biggest thing is the actual insects will have on people that are watching a contact yeah hopefully yeah because I know we're pretty liberal and we're pretty loving of everybody it's more of the other people that were trying to yeah can we can we paint can we like to show shared stories in a way that like gives people empathy that can be done yeah currently feel kind of more protective about like patriotic or let's close the borders build wolves and and with maybe they don't understand that we're like there's more that connected as humans than we realize and I was doing the biggest problem to encounter these people related problems supposed to methodical aviation-related from some people won't get what we're doing and the tourists you often go places and it's like painting really didn't picture and it's like the tourism site but you don't see that necessary like assassinate okay like I said this is a lot of spare equipment it's not Simmons I'm half of a shelf pending sale really the expensive items in there are going to be your a CR p lb that's obviously something that's in Photoshop so saleable for sale and then my life raft those are my biggest one I mean for me I see it as contributing to something very cool I'm pumped I mean maybe we could even put like your leg on the plane as it flies but none of you feel comfortable that is that we've got a few sponsors logo to recall of your leg or knee awesome sure so did you guys leave I'm going to go sit down with my whole company be like hey look what we're being a part of yes we are so we got all the things we need we're now heading to the airport gonna head up sorry that was that big wasn't that we got everything yeah everything related [Music] so here's all our gear laid out there's not a lot more if you've pretty much it for the trip [Music] almost ready fell off they look include to do it event you're not going to do it one-handed you did it one-handed it [Music] [Music] [Applause] that cheese guy let the runway all right oh yeah literally that will pass then that's where we're having our I got it here oh why yes right who died we landed in Tracy that's a nice little flight I enjoyed that a lot annoyingly the wing camera stopped working or turned off something and but yeah this is where we're going to get some stuff fitting on the plane like an extra fuel tank and fix the air ducts stuff so we're we've arrived quite late but we're going to have a chance the guy here and see what we get sorted this is Louis lying around the world with me hello that's me he has to be not stuff man in Paris is used to fly under planet from little years yes we're basically just here to get it tanked and then go whenever whenever we can get a tantric diamond the overlord I made a crab o'clock tonight get this read I know you the tomorrow's okay tomorrow we can work is we want to put our branding stickers on it and stuff so we can do that tomorrow rich it is hopefully going to install the tank on Friday I think we need to get a few bits of paperwork done which hopefully we can get done in time to leave at the moment we were hoping to leave Thursday Friday but I think it's going to be pushed back to Sunday best case in REI I don't know think about worst-case scenario but hopefully that's all good and the plan is we're going to leave the plane here we're going to catch an uber into town find a cheap hotel for the night and then come back in the morning do some paperwork hopefully get some of the vinyls wrap designs done on the plane so we want to get live the adventure done on the tail there and then we've got a few sponsors that we're going to have their logos like total on the side and maybe the YouTube channel oh is this sir this is the fuel tank the big one this is the one that's going to get us across the Pacific elliptic so I hope you mentioned the tooth no no so we're because we intend to make it a bit of a collaborative trip we can't install this one because it requires all the seeds to be out plus when it's fully fueled we're way too heavy to carry passengers so if it was just us to remote over to make it work but I will be will use this but for the for the meantime we're just going to install an aluminum Ram ear type ferry tank in the back it's smaller than this much smaller yeah in place of the very rear seat and then become a permanent installation in extended-range auxilary tank basically with common modification on a 210 and then that'll give us about 30 gallons more fuel which will get us just that a little bit further but also give us enough reserve to get to Australia so basically if we have end up in trouble be able to assign to all the low minimums or any of that we can hold for much longer yeah it's just a better situation to have more fuel on board we could technically fly the surfing as is up to Australia but not across the yeah all right we're just pulling the aeroplane over here because I want to get a few cool photos for the website and my channel banner and stuff so we're just going to position it away from the other planes yeah this is kind of cool [Music] Oh [Music] Oh God we've arrived at our hotel yeah unfortunately I only had a smoking room left I didn't even know that was the thing I thought that was illegal but I think it'll be all right it's just reeks of cigarette smoke we'll try and find somewhere to stay before likely not last minute tomorrow Oh anyway it's been a very successful day I'm pretty happy are you guys happy yeah yeah it was a good day but we're ending in a little bit of a smoky yeah just we'll just have to crack the window I'm sure we'll get I have to get used to interesting places to stay then I will catch you guys in the morning and hopefully we can start work on the final design of the play and get stuff stuck on and get some paperwork done that we need and yeah see you then peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music]

gonna be a short flight like an hour and a half I'm a little bit tired cut about an hour's sleep last night yeah this has been an incredible stay we're just getting the plane ready now if you don't know this is Eddie and he's been helping us with the whole world flight people organizing all of the all of the stops and helping us with planning and yeah checking safety and stuff if any of you are planning to fly around the world I'll link all of Eddie stuff below we're just stickers on the plane now aviation support [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's crazy walking amongst these plane wrecks and just imagining the life they used to have even this like a hot-air balloon basket here it's just yeah it's amazing look at it just left to rot in the sand what's this play brand-new engine granular power and then they're just grounded and they couldn't even just like sell it and get some [Music] [Applause] [Music] don't you guys see lady legend okay a double town of ever 284 we'd like to request the follow me car and request start up November 2 1 as you okay any from startup approved approve November 2 on circuit [Music] finally on the road a gap I always get really excited we we're about to take off even if it's a short flight yeah the problem for me is it doesn't matter how long the flight is the preparation and everything beforehand is just as long so I longer flight yeah because they're ultimately less working there enough oh yeah guys if you did watch the vloggers we flew in but ice was explaining why we're not we have got a wall camera for are flying in Egypt because it just looks a bit suspicious I think there's been problems in the past having a how about the website a kebab just to save ourselves a problem alright your doors are locked yeah your secure secure yeah a heavy takeoff and a shallow one ready to go let's do it fool the live temperatures and pressures anyway and she wants to fly [Music] I just have this suck realization of what we're doing again it's like flying around the world yeah easy to forget I think about what we were planning it's a baby or and stuff but now we're doing it yeah it's crazy I get those moments to where you just forget an American evolve just conserving I'm clear to cross over the field November 2 1 0 a uniform alarm clock gives you 60 0 / 9 34 13 report reaching as there are 6-0 I think they're a little bit optimistic about how quickly this airplane can climb I think they want me to be at 6,000 feet now already barely over 2,500 [Music] I love these pads in the ground they always look like very so much and there may be a very very summer yeah but I feel good as it definitely makes a difference a friend inside it's funny how not nervous but just aware I've become but worth like yeah let the moment up at the airplane I'm just like in my oven and I just this the stress just dissipates and I'm just in like problem-solving focus mode and then there are these moments when I'm just like I'm flying a freaking aeroplane over Egypt yeah is really close that's very good yeah I see why you just want to get at the end soon as possible okay that while your brain is just in that mode it's kind of like it's kind of like preparing for a big competition swimming competition yeah and then you're in the zone and they're like oh wait wait wait no no no you got to wait now and then you're like sitting there just passing 4,000 now they're literally all these roads one by lois especially identity can see it these words have never been used they're brand new and the desert is just a golfing them that's crazy there's so much infrastructure here that is being used like the older housing like it's the oldest leaves when it does occur yeah but it's sickening if you think about it yeah cuz there's so many people that don't have anything that could be living in there it's crazy how the landscapes just changed because of the irrigation for perfect oil like desert field it's literally the heart of this country no there's no a hat that ago prior to keep it cool could begin sir [Music] I'm glad we got away pretty early wasting too much time I heard today yeah and radar November 2 of their get a for flight level 0 9 Lord direct cross me kind of amazing that we just like went to Oklahoma air for plane and just think about it like I was sitting there this airplane felt like the strangest thing in the world what everything cuz of the panel configuration everything was different I might never get the chance to do this again I think got a lot over time I I go to places with the expectation that I'll be back you know like I don't have more time to absorb this but I might never get the chance to do this again look agent or this fly around the world like you know buying these also places there's November to one very acute afore were quite deceptive it's about a thousand each change was either one team whatever that face is resting country to fly to obey they brought me is definitely blowing our brain my brain let there then I was one for me the interesting floor going over the tropical I think it do could be of a pretty amazing it will be amazing but if yeah Thailand Malaysia Indonesia will be the worst stressful for me yeah make a little weather and I think they'll be very hazy and humid it where it won't be like her it won't be like reasonable joke or it yeah that'll be hard work for me the most fun will be Australia yeah especially if we have a bit of time to kill there this idiot is take me so far out now I have my landing gear on but I cool former turn left heading zero-niner-zero business and three two thousand feet left heading sir dancer on a 2003 firm having the runway in sight sir that's affirmative husband our website de barbarac all uniform clear for left hand visual approach on which before let's continue descent circuit my altitude and pushed our 19th is nothing only tower tighty desmos exactly for the visual 3/4 light 3/4 and they've got a ground I've ever - I'm sorry uniform over at Victor 6 Thunder - 104 more get a ground state she has cleared hold short runway 3 4 3 4 follow me car inside which is such a big Airport we can literally do by the time it gets takes us to get there I could literally take off the land oh yeah and these donkeys we're with a fighter jet so yeah yeah cause we're probably winco's there I take the counter downer yep ok always we're signing out we'll catch you on the other side we've made it to her gutter we're just about to jump in the taxi and head to the hotel right as you can see with this pink in the room the whole night ordering room service and I've just had a nice relaxing bath whilst my videos been rendering but unfortunately the overflow of the bath isn't connected properly so I completely flooded our hotel room like the whole bathroom the whole floor out here and this isn't ideal anyway that's been my evening we've got dips lessly early staff we go outside yeah we've got and we've got to get up her five no we've got to leave here at 5:00 a.m. so probably get up like 4:30 and it's JP said the longest flight we have yet yeah we've got a direct flight all the way from Egypt in the East Coast where we are now to the UAE Abu Dhabi we're gonna be flying over Saudi Arabia and we've chosen not to stop there for a fuel break as it's like extra paperwork and landing fees and stuff JP did say however that if if the winds are bad and we get headwind we may have to divert to Bahrain and do a fuel stop there but it's $1,000 to as there like a handling fee or landing for your waiver so hopefully we can avoid that yeah it's it's it's definitely we've definitely entered a whole new phase of the trip and like I was saying earlier today I feel just this sudden sense of excitement again and I think coming through Europe the excitement kind of dropped a little bit from how it was when we first departed but yeah I'm excited again and yeah I cannot wait I feel like this next these next few countries there's so many unknown kind of factors and I think that's what I love about it I think I love that there's yeah there's all this some uncertainty or or I guess kind of unknown stuff right I'll capture a few hours guys peace out enjoy life live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good afternoon guys I have come down today to grab some well we just grab lunch me Alfie and Dave and Dave what is going on today tell us tonight I'm spending my first night in this place it is what you reckon a third of a mile through the trees yeah we are in the middle of nowhere deep into the trees literally I came to visit the old lady that lived there for a whole life called Brenda she lived here for 60 years their kids grew up here and everything just had to move out into homes or on the same estate and then they said look what this place is coming up maybe it would be good for you to come inside so give me a go I feel daunted though isn't it I realized in the first v1 Koko v1 I realized that I was using the pub a lot and I was using the coffee shop a lot because I need you need some indoor time even if you're going to look most of your life outdoor in the trees or whatever or you say an outfit this place is cozy this is cool man literally just in the middle of nowhere it's deep isn't it I'll probably be able to have like cows hairy cows very kappa the big girls I hope so I don't know it depends I might work with the farm because they know what they do with animals so it might be there like a work with the farm and they look after them but we have them here do you know I mean the way I'm collaborative arrangement because the people around here know what they're doing and I'm still learning you got a Silla no sit like a wine cellar oh yeah this guy and I will look but I think this is a good idea boy [Laughter] easy easy simple for those Wow this could be great for a little storage area work could be more how do we make normal houses more eco-friendly more nature friendly more efficient and it breaks that simple living stuff so we're gonna be changing stuff up around it may I'm still proper like boy that's cool man you got a house you ready yeah let's hope the key actually works there's someone trying it's nice not being here on my own pull the pull the thing down right yeah yeah we need to get our shoes off because I think they're muddy and stuffing so just take them off right whoa boy that's the nice guys well it is then Olga it's a Rayburn it's a Rayburn because it's powered you can't see but it's powered by a massive gas canister right so it's uncomplicated because I love it oh it's actually on it's warm is it it won't because the peat you can heat the house of its God yeah oh that's nice it's a hot it's just ticking over yeah I'm conflicted because it's wicked and it's hairy farmhouse saying everything but those fossil fuels but it's gasps its fossil fuels and I'm not into that all the decisions would make it will be about how do you make this house work in a way that suits its environment so obviously around here there's loads of trees so biomass that comes from trees it'll be what we use to power this so it'll be quite a moment when we take this out or you lose and you just chug shutting the logs in and cook up I guess so I know I know I know there's a whole heating sister okay and it does everything I don't really know I don't know the details yeah I don't even know how it works but yes this is the kitchen yeah I'd you know how old this cottage is we should find out yeah it's done is it chained probably not give us a little tinkle Dave yeah it needs I need to get Ronnie this unit down is that another five places and open up yeah the chimney sweep they're gonna open it out hopefully Nick that's the Table Tennis room table tennis room yeah hey it's mad I don't even know what I've done what people just will short back in the day yeah I'm all right I'm still short breath icon I can't stand up I was back yes I was made for this house bro yeah you're like this is prime time today you always want this to be like hot tub [Music] [Laughter] you always want this to be a sunken lounge don't you yeah I think it has to be utilities room yeah Dave just found a metal detector we we need to find some treasure Emma our new garden bet you this why should good it otherwise right we're going upstairs this bathroom is surprisingly massive yeah it is actually huge like you can actually have it as a spare bedroom as well yeah I don't know if the war works or not I don't know if there's any water services oh yeah do it do little tests do it oh yes tonight go on yeah mother I don't reckon the gas is straight bull tear strips straight wait like this will be a savage place to be having a bar we were just saying guys that this is gonna be wet is like the homeliest room so far like this for me this feels like this could be the lounge this could be the communal hangout around bro yeah if we let look at the door David like come in okay this bedrooms yeah the bedrooms and look at these amazing cabinets they left me ocean ice I think that's that's also I think that's the thing like this is Brenda's house at the end of the day like yeah this is in my mind I feel lucky that I get to stay here for a while however long we stay but she is like she sums up the country for me living here working on the farm did I raise the whole family in one house work them wanna stay and so I feel really lucky this year old no like 80 or something yeah at least like nearly 90 she's lovely we sat together and she showed me pictures of what it was like 40 years ago and the kids wearing and everything so it was really sweet yeah left there's some bed so this will be like the guest room I think wow this is the master bedroom I'll be in one of those single beds this is massive walk-in closet well that's what you're gonna do your work that's right see you in a bit is we're gonna edit vlog you can't come out till it's finished oh another bedroom yeah yeah I think I'm gonna set up what music studio arts you do like sounds dude yeah I think this will be sound studio so I think I'll set up like podcast yeah lives in here decent storage oh yes serious I mean you would probably live in there they are I live in there that's pretty big oh yeah easy enough for a bed you have a straight-up house Dave even though they all shed is bigger than my heart do you know I mean Dave what is that chunk of metal this is my first thing I ever designed for the real world I did it with my friend Mike basically the first heart obviously we've just bought that second one built as designed a steel frame and they made it and brought it over and out for you help me bring it in but it's really hard to work with the steel frame because you can't put normal screws into it yeah wood into the steel and then put everything to the wood so this time I thought well what if but you want that rigidity you want that striking structure so I thought what if we just have steel corner pieces and you slide two by fours into them and then basically just then there's that a four by four in there well what that is is this means it's one bracket for every corner sometimes it's that way and sometimes it's that way wedge in the other side yeah yeah and just screw it down and then you just have one corner piece in like in four different ways so that would be like that in that corner you know you choose the height and the length and it's basically two and a half meter cubes is what I'm reckoning so the big heart that I made last year or got most of the way through making would be three of these in a row that would make seven two and a half meter cube times three yeah nice so this isn't on the market so we thought it would make it so I'm really chuffed there I need to play with them but I think they're looking good there and they've been galvanized yeah careful about yeah [Music] right we've just had an idea what's the idea Dave your idea bro that because there is actually 4G signal here which we tell them about the words that what was the deal in the works so in the woods there was no Wi-Fi no phone no bloody tap water there was nothing so it was easy you know you guys would come down and we're all just be off-grid easy peasy but here there is actually 4G which is a good thing and a bad unless you're sitting on your phone all night like me Shona for Instagram exactly so and who he was saying maybe we use this letterbox for a phone box yeah so you come in hey Dave he's like yeah just drop your phone in the box see get it back in 24 hours time yeah nice could be an idea definitely maybe not every day but definitely there should be some it's a nicely some time frames yes I like just the intention alright I'm switching off yeah I'm switching off right we're leaving the cottage for momentarily I'm gonna drop Alfie back oh we're gonna head back to the cottage now Dave's gonna pick up some food for dinner funny story when he first went to the woods that he was staying in last year him our friend Andy wood went to stay the first night I think you made a vlog about this though yeah I did they made a campfire and Dave's choice of food to cook in the camper I was a frozen pizza and apparently well quite obviously that didn't really work out it was going well until I lowered it and then offensive Crispin so I need to impress Andy tonight okay so we're gonna my way let's be fair you've got a bit more to work with now you've got that that agar oven thing yeah you can cook on those hot plates yeah right we're just popping past Dave's old words to pick up a few things like a sauce pan to cook on and maybe a soar to chop some firewood and all that kind of vibes if you haven't seen Dave's documentary you made on this place I'll link it below I don't think I've had a chance to talk about your documentary in a vlog yet Dave I haven't told my viewers up about your documentary yet other than a my Instagram story so guys if you haven't yeah they've it's ready to download you can just click the link below it's um you can choose how much to pay but it shows his whole kind of story of this whole year living in the woods building these huts and yeah what he's learned from it it's pretty cool it's pretty cool and yes now exciting to be here kind of for the second phase is he's learning more and you know getting a cottage and some land her you know dream up other things but yeah let's see if we can go and find the bits we need Dave's spent the whole year kind of making vlogs of this as well if you haven't been watching his channel you see him coming into the woods and building they're very cool the fire is on Dave's just offered to make me a cup of tea show us your Christmas present day yeah my sister's brought me this they're all these lush teas and we found a lemon and ginger that's my guy so and then it's like I this thingy yeah Hebrews it a loose-leaf brewer inside no I think we literally just fill him up shut put the kettle on wait every bro we haven't got kale we can make hot water there yeah I think with a saucepan on this guy well just take the leaves that no that's probably not the nicest thing to put Warren yeah you can't deal okay okay cutting the courgettes looks a bit funny doesn't it look like a funny cause yet no Hooper's no Amazon now no no nothing just just courgette just call right and these are right we're doing a little house tour it's like utility room ah also I get this away and make it like make it like a little lounge or the table tennis room as well as the utility room right dinner's done got the noodles and or the spaghetti in the noodle flips our neighbors in it but it's plenty I'm excited there's so much for evening wait that's all right good that solid five yeah okay I'm leaving these guys to stay the first night in the closet it's warm it's really warm now why we found guys we found the central heating and it's lovely in here this is so much better than I imagined cuz yeah this this place could have been in a lot worse condition yeah I get the expectations low and it needs a it's a blank canvas ready to eat area in the walls but it's it's ready for its new lease of life yeah I can't wait to see weapons unfortunately you know I'm gonna be doing some other things they're not permanently based here but when I'm back in the country I think I'll come down and then try to spend as much fun down here as possible in in the summer and spring months probably in the warmer months although I potentially well we're gonna come back at the end of this week yeah and then I might be back again at the end of the month oh you might be away though he was he's gonna be done it and then Lucy Lucy anyway it's been a pleasure sharing this day with you Dave this the start of something very special oh it's a continuation of something very special is so I've arrived back at my parents house I would have stays down at the cottage with Dave and Andy but I've got my friend Sylvia arrived here early tomorrow morning to fix my dreads because it's been months since I've had my dreads kind of tied it up and yeah I need to I need to do that I'm sure you're aware and I'm like getting trimmed as well actually anyway that's why I'm back Higgs it makes more sense kind of me being here and it's been a really good day guys I haven't really done much other than just been kind of dreaming and spending time with Dave on this quite a special day that is quite a milestone in his journey if you haven't kind of followed his journey like I was saying earlier definitely check out his channel it's so interesting to see him exploring firstly this kind of a guest forest life learning how to spend more time in nature and slow down and and what that experiences be for him and now this new journey of having a space still quite isolated from where me and him both grew up and come of the suburbs and spending time in the city and then yeah looking at different ways to live and and he was saying him and Andy he's going to be living there some of the week I guess they're looking at ways to get the house kind of more sustainable so looking at ways to kind of put solar panels in and yeah you know less reliance on the grid that we're currently used to so yeah lots of experimenting and I'm excited to kind of check in on the house and see you know how they're progressing when I can but and yeah if you want to kind of have regular updates Dave's gonna be posting videos throughout the year so yeah subscribe to his channel also like I said earlier check out his little documentary you made and yeah I'll catch you in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure

big event heading to a festival obviously we've done a few small events from the bus like our Christmas pie and stuff but it's the first time where we've really taken out and get to show it off and yeah I just I couldn't be more pumped this is it's going to be an incredible weekend coming just look at it look at it look at right we stopping for fuel this is actually the first time I think I've build this butter roller on the road but I could get a secret garden party lately tonight intro new to the team so far I think we've got a couple of others joining us there but your gym door obviously got Ben Darcy Toby and Rachel yeah and then Andy and Emily is going to be opening to another stop there we've got from a squad and whilst we're on the way I thought would be kind may use the time so I'm trying to figure out how to use this door DJ mate for the Dodgers got so we can do a busy day so we've run upstairs they've got a bit of a sound system Jim's letting us see sound system or so nice up there look at this I've never been up there through the windows the boombox never had these windows guys I figured out [Music] yes over here we are like less than ten minutes from the super garden party now we're going to do one last fill-up how's the drive Jim good the final two of the scored of a ride and in Emily he could drive yeah probably a little bit faster than us so he left like three hours after boy all right trying to fill the hot tub yeah guys it's been seven minute and the heart and the hot tub half full already I've tidied up a bit and made my bed over here is a cozy little area isn't it we are going for a mission now points of food check out the festival he's pretty late it's yeah I'll plus three in the morning I'm not going to stay out long put some editing to do oh it's definitely slippery [Music] [Music] it's been a very fun night it's good to have a little taster nice to get a bit of dancing in but the next few days are going to be pretty pretty mental and hopefully we'll be able to invite some people to come hang out for ah come hang out on the bus enjoy the hot tub and yeah and then on Sunday Jeremy Luke's is coming in and we're going to get to hang out with him and his his guys it's going to be a yeah jam-pack weekend lots of fun I'm going to head to bed now I guess it's like a lot half full and like I said earlier make sure to check out riah's new jewellery range and they show some love I'll catch in the morning peace out enjoy life a little adventure 
[Music] good morning guys we are four days into our prep to the world flight now we flew into an airport in Tracy California last night where we're going to need to be for a few days whilst we get some stuff fitted on the plane JP and Lindsey have already headed back to the airport we stayed at a little motel last night and yeah we've got lots to do lots to do [Music] alright so I managed to grab some food in town again uber back to the airport and now I'm chilling with JP and Lindsey JB's done an amazing job getting all these seats out so I'm sure you would have seen from Lindsey's footage good job now we just need to figure out how quickly you can get logos put on the back yeah wanted to see one can get the the vector of the logo so we could serious that's interesting yeah that'd be great I'm just on the runaround cool to the designer and then and then we'll house with yeah they'll go on the door but maybe not where the doors let the edges of the enemy and then we'll have follow our journey or follow us at youtube-dot-com forward-slash Ponte Luis and then on the tail thanks Zack thank God yeah oh yeah that can go over the door I guess and then on the tail that will be where we have that we live the adventure you have n problems of the bolts they're just not designed to be taken off after the seatbelt we can take off one Savita that would be a lot easier but basically you're going to run a few line into the collector tank at the bottom the t-junction here and then we're going to have about 50 gallons of fuel extra until Australia when you can relax okay and what I'm thinking is now all the seats are out why don't we just play a big chick easy like the whole back section here if that's not a weight balance you could probably you could is the fuel tank is going to be this wide and it's going to be this high it could essentially just be a hot tub I couldn't imagine you if it in fact I think this is a tubular I think this is genius okay scrap the seat scrap the fuel tank we just put in a hot tub in the back you see if it was a 206 without the retractable gear how you could fit a full-sized mattress in here oh that back bit just for the retractor we'll get ya so this is where the wheels going oh of course yeah you're right it would be so amazing we could do that yeah we're going a lot faster on this one yeah this looks like when I used to fly skydivers because they take them completely out here and I just have one seat there and then everybody's like hunkered here pissing their pants in this plane is smoke yeah well 210 yeah then I scoot to the front like that and actually just open the door well the door is off oh okay you just take up without door we should do that we should let's order some parachutes to see we can get some an Amazon Prime well they're part of our life savings if you like the kind of conversations they're having guys too for flying around the world this is actually 64 gallon tank and we only need 30 the one he already has is able to carry we won't be putting that in so there is about this much space on top of it that we will never use I think we should just get one made my person who hated that I betrayed it over here no I mean everyone's I've done a lot of Prayer pictures from election it's convenient yeah the convenience of being a proper planning is it's very big especially with all the gear we had we was what's the situation break initially we were going to fit ladder tanks into the airplane I personally prefer them for a few reasons they just they're less likely to crack they hold up when you don't use them also the benefits they're lighter but Richard is been doing this so many years and he just recommend going with aluminum tags that are pressurized using ram air they're a lot more reliable because you're not relying on pumps or any anything like that it's purely gravity based but the problem is we don't have a tank that fits right now we have on that fits but it's much bigger so we would just never be using it to the full capacity because we only need and will only use 50 Allen's yeah the issues now is we need to get a tank made and it's going to take a little time probably Monday we really get lucky but I'm guessing it's gonna take longer which is frustrating because we're already seven days behind but we always knew really no I'm going to leave on the day that we were planning to so all right yeah I think I don't feel stressed I think maybe later in the flight when we happen to run not rush but when we're having to maybe like have certain sections shorter than we planned in might be frustrating but right now I feel like it's better to start on a good with everything as good as we can have it and then and yeah it will help further down the line I can imagine like months down the line that we put in the wrong size tank and we're having to like promise everything in we'll be annoying today keep you updated okay I've been sitting out for a few hours just getting the design sorted we still haven't found someone that can get the vinyls printed for the plane anytime soon so we may I may need to do some more research and make some calls tomorrow and plan now is because we're still waiting on approval to get this other tank built tomorrow morning and some paperwork we're actually going to fly out of here tonight to go to Berkeley where we're going to be staying with a friend picking up some other stuff that we need a couple more camera lenses and hopefully we'll be back here tomorrow morning and I think Lindy's leaving us as well today she's going to head back down to LA and that claims the dog can't charlie just get [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hey [Music] note that ground you cannot uniform over sculpt I would like to part with a 1-0 uniform contact CBS dealt a signature these private airport lounges are so good every time free coffee free snacks and particular orange this is the way I roll let the hidden popcorn money be in this on my jet out there and Nick Woodman everybody yeah and we just come in our little things as far as like family wise and friend wise I mean I pretty much hang out was pretty much like I say pretty much almost everything and I don't ever think of you know race as an issue I mean don't know thing I see that that race does is that you know if you're a certain race there's certain things about you that that's going to be there like if you're Asian and if you're old school it's like your parents would beat the out of you you know so you understand how to save I mean you know that that's a common thing you know it means like if you're you met Asian person he has no savings you'd be like dude like I don't know the hell's wrong with you with your parents and that raises right what do you like most about your kind of cultural heritage of from what things growing up where those things about yeah I don't know but see I'm very Americanized yeah so you know you know like because I was adopted my mom's mom was Laos but I speak three languages than my adoptive parents are back in Thailand so I go back and visit every usually every year you know so I haven't added like Europe and stuff like that I'm planning to go out there but um but I mean for me it's more about it's not even about race because it's more about you know what you want to be and who you want to be you know they need to have the integrity and ethics you know and that's where people are respect you for what you do it's not really about you know like oh what bits and pieces because every single culture has a bad bad piece you know I mean like a lot of Asians you know they like to gamble a lot they like to drink a lot you don't even like Tamils I'm good I don't like that stuff you know the name but like I said it's to each his own it you have to see what's going to put your own lifestyle Oh hey guys you ready you know I just arrived at Tom's I'm going to stay here tonight along yeah that was one of the most in-depth amazing discussions I've had as an uber driver yeah very fascinating it just kind of kept going she kept chatting about a lot of world issues and how how he felt in today's society so yeah lots to think about it's going to be excited about interviewing people around the world during our trip we've just had a delivery this is one of the problems of not having a base thankfully Tom let us deliver some stuff in it anyway this is some lens rentals from Sony that hooked us up and this lens is the new 16 to 35 2.8 I've been waiting for it what do you think how it is looking is it looking if you're looking good it's wide which should have a lot of shallow depth let me take it outside as a month model to see a bit more for the shallow depth I stand on the Sun how's this looking guys I'm excited to vlog on this although I'm thinking as well oh let me know in the comments something Riya has said to me and I think a few people have mentioned is that it feels a little bit less personal when it's this white and that maybe I should be coming in back to the back to here is this nicer to chat to you guys at 20 24 rather than rather than 16 obviously 16 you can see a bit more I'm also just so intrigued at how shallow is going to look the depth of field and but yes see if you tell me if you notice the difference of this new lens I got two of them for me to jail for me and JP to shoot some of the documentary in the world flight on but yeah I'm excited what do you prefer you prefer this you prefer me chatting with a bit more of a crop or do you prefer wider let me night Mikey visually guy I think he's but most art cinematic stuff holy crap so beautiful but I had one of those that's what I had when we in Canada by that time we went up to no you didn't I did no I just it I looked it like on that trip I can't vlog at this lens can i slightly cotton you say oh no yeah yeah if your arms fully out like maybe look how the lens here is like going more yeah yeah it's nice it's a nice so this is the certain point one point four I'm probably not gonna vlog on it but I'm really nice hello there chicken tikka masala we're just getting we just ordering in and now is get median right everyone go to bed I'm going to stay up for a few hours just getting it on with my blog edit like I said before I really want to be keeping up with the real-time so you guys know exactly what we're up to and when and can continue following the journey also if you missed it either day and I announce that we've got a website set up sliding boards calm and we've got a real-time tracking map where you can see exactly where we're flying at all times over the three months which is going to be cool as well you guys can see whether we're going to be near where you live and potentially you

excited this is the most excited I've been in in years probably I just yeah anyway we'll catch in the morning yourself during life commit defense ow [Music] 
[Music] good afternoon guys we are in Karachi in Pakistan we with our friend Mars yo he's going to be taking us around today we've only got one day here we've had a bit of a slow morning we just had lunch and now we're going to go to a market place and all the other thing is today that there's this big procession like a religious procession happening which means there's a lot of roadblocks and also the government have have like turned off all the mobile phone networks because you know there's a danger of terrorism or weather so none of our phones work either which is interesting [Music] Mars can you explain to me what's going on here at the moment with the precession and this event very significant Islamic event is taking place right now it happens on the 8th 9th and 10th of air during the month of summer from the Islamic calendar yeah so most of these people will be attending processions and meetings that are known as much Lissa's in which they talk about events that happen in history and they express grief and sorrow over them and there was like two different types of Muslim belief like there's a semisafe of the sheer set it's a sheer sec mostly that commemorates these events or expresses grief during these months although the semi site does feel similar sentiments but then I didn't feel so strongly about them okay easy if there's a general respect amongst the whole population for whatever happened back then to which you can evidently see this is a very busy street most of the shops shut down oh well I'll shut it down yeah so Mercer saying he hasn't seen the street this empty like even at 1:00 in the morning it would be busier than this normally so this is like a very rare occurrence is that only once a year and it happens to be that we are here on this day so random [Music] I love this is people playing cricket in the street here set this up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] good meet up with you guys this coming down [Music] right JP is up next oh thanks pride both Hey yeah how was it playing cricket or the plank of wood like that's a good bit right [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's what these containers for was shipping containers to stop people from entering a certain area that's been cordoned off and you can see police official this you know block the way and make sure nobody comes by so we can't go past there now No ahaha wait photographed oh you know it's good luck it's good luck bro in Namibia when I got done well that in in Namibia in my dad's old hangar oh yeah no I do remember thank you that's so kind a very nice Wow look at that thank you amazing so many people are stopping us and asking for photos with us because I think the truth is that not many white people come there I think because of the apparently since the I guess the early 2000s when there's been a lot of conflict and neighboring countries like Afghanistan a staff and there's been a bit of a bit of boy that's a trouble in Pakistan the tourism is really plummeted and it's meant that this there's really not many people from the West coming here so yeah I guess it's unusual for the locals to see people white people so yeah we've been getting a lot photos I can wipe the smile off my face like it's been like I just realize I have to stop smoking for like you know it's just constant like it's amazing it I can feel kinda bad cuz we don't live in this environment so we're just coming in and like I feel like we're objectifying them a little bit but we're also really connecting with them and like having some real true moment and there's like no hostility so unsafe once I'm walking around with a really expensive camera like no hostility and and even when even when the guys have declined us taking photos it's like really polite it's not like they're getting angry so nice [Music] okay we're back at Martha's house and we just going up into the roof of this house I'm gonna throw the drone up and see them get some cool shots oh yeah where we're trying to fix the drone at the gimbal it says gimbal vibration abnormal and we don't know why [Music] okay we managed to get the drone fixed so we're going to take up the beach in a minute golden hour is just arrived and we are this going to be amazing there's like camels horses every was just chilly and was this beautiful it's the exit Clifton bitch [Music] this dude literally has a snake and Cobra it's coming for us I'm just chilling because you're the one that's giving it I think keep going [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey buddy I hope you doing okay sorry if they work you're too hard you don't see this kind of activity down at beaches in like the US or anything this is like the whole community outfit to have fun yeah it's good fun it's just like an overload to the senses like there's so much going on around you like you know horses camels Beach buggies people people yeah fascinating people snake charmers what the heck we've come out to dinner now and we've met out with mother's sister nibbler hey never actually is the one who reached out to us originally to come and hang out so it's been super cool yeah we just arrived it's like a seaside restaurant right on the beach oh wow this is amazing [Music] [Music] all right we have chicken mohani no chicken handy chicken handy dharma hani vegetable handy chicken tikka masala and we've got some naan bread was it he said it spicy it's 1:00 a.m. we're pretty much there with all the things we're trying to get sorted tonight we we've got a lot of snacks and medication to make sure that we can stay as well as possible in the flight tomorrow I've got a lot of packing and stuff to do and before we do sleep I am gonna try and set up a tripod and do a little interview I think the greatest thing that I see in Pakistan is is the will and design people to go on despite whatever might have happened so I mean there's a saying here in Karachi that the general Karachi attitude is if you fall down on the ground you don't just stay there you get up you dust your clothes off and you walk again and you you're up and running again so I think the greatest thing I feel about Pakistan is despite all the odds the people are still determined I love the fact that I've met people from various backgrounds and I'm able to reflect my own life and listen to their experiences and just I think that gives you a lot of perspective when you look at the world and the problems it has okay so I will see you in a couple of hours guys we're going to get up at 4 a.m. and never wanted to say one last thing [Music] 
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good afternoon guys we've had pretty chilled morning just eating breakfast in the big lounge area trying to make a plan for the day chatting about life we I mean we we've had some good good conversations this morning mainly about just like the future of humanity and changing the world so you know just the typical topics I've also got myself a coffee the Sun has come out as well this is this is just such an epic day this is my kind of weather definitely so yeah I think we've got to drive down to seminar the village that we were the town that we were in yesterday and maybe 20 we rent a boat I think that's the plan today we want to go do some exploring on the scene [Music] [Applause] [Music] we are heading to the car now we've managed to figure out a plan I love all this new stuff that building around here like this this is all new this wasn't hit when I was here with Raya six months ago [Music] [Applause] [Music] ready a little bit of a latest start a plan but that's pretty much how much my days end up [Music] [Applause] [Music] guys we have picked up this dude Ruben and we are heading now isn't your boat you the captain come on okay he's just helping us find this boat where we can go out for a little boat ride for a couple of hours hopefully it we can watch the sunset from the boat that'll be cool but it's like yeah a couple of kilometers away and then yeah it's kind of perfect time yeah I think thumbs out that water looks nice and we just got some snacks as well is it kind of hungry so you just Kate that dude one hundred and fifty dollars and he's just left gone I'm thinking that sorry I'm thinking we're okay just kid not to get scammed you know right we're about to get on the boat we're not sure which boat we're getting on yet the dream would be that we're going on that bigger boat but I think reality is we getting on this small bow here and looking choppy it's choppy around this side than it was that the marina but I think we've fun I was hoping we don't get too wet you guys ready already [Music] thank where do we keep drawing is this the spot in the middle yeah I don't know I've no idea where we can keep dry guys we're having engine problems we've been here I don't know 10 minutes waiting I'm hoping then get it sorted they just seem to be hitting things I'm sure they know what they're doing yeah I think that's a good remedy for most problems just hit it unless it's like a person I wouldn't suggest it in people or an animal either no if you're hitting objects and you and you precisely hit them where they're broken sometimes let's see we're doing a total test now [Music] you going to save the day is the mechanic header mechanics this is so good this is so good helix angle yes bossman right still not go anywhere in another 15 20 minutes I think from what I can understand and I don't speak Spanish though we might be going on this bigger boat behind us which is the one that we wanted to go in anyway so could this this could have worked out very well yeah are we going on this one it's fixed ah the battery are they're stealing the battery out of that boat okay scrap that we're just going to steal their battery either way we're going to be going soon which I'm happy about that makes sense why they were fiddling under there yeah Rob that battery [Music] that's a good sign we have success I think I think so sounds like it yeah it's good that's yes [Music] we are going on an adventure with the funnest things we I don't know what we're doing no idea neither pretty bumpy bumpy by ride we just stop I think we're gonna think we're gonna go diving here I think this is shipwreck underneath us we have masks I don't know how I don't know how we're gonna see underwater it's gonna be pretty dark [Music] that's so close guys [Music] battery fell out well we joined spine it should be cast on the phone - it will be without its still recording right now yeah I push the record but again I wonder if the last one site you're so lucky did it land on the beach oh yeah could it could have just landed in the sea today I cannot believe I crash my drone into a palm tree I probably shouldn't have have it automated spinning when I'm not controlling it I'm hoping the next man bet hat Mavic has collision avoidance detection in every direction like they kind of rushed us back because there's a storm coming in we saw lightning from a distance so we have to get it get out the boat before we get stranded out see the lightning storm lightning and boats are probably not a good combo stunwin they're so much it's an adventure [Music] okay some vegan heats some potato thing these guys need some slacklining it's a fun evening [Music] [Music] it's been another fun evening and yeah good day in the Dominican Republic tomorrow we are actually heading home well I say home these guys are heading home I'm gonna be meeting up with Raya hanging out in LA for a little bit and then having some proper downtime and this has been pretty nice but I need some like full relaxation time just to kind of recover from the world trip and don't worry I'll still be pumping my blogs out I still be editing but I I because I'm so far ahead of myself in terms of vlogs I'm going to take a few days off maybe a few weeks off all right I'll catch you in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure

morning peace out enjoy your life and live the adventure 
good morning guys again another incredible day in Cape Town and I'm with Laura who hasn't been in my books for a while but she works the LTA offices and today we are coming down to this and filing at this place city rock so one of those other fitness things I can do I'm trying to find all the different activities I can do this to get my fitness levels out so this is one of them right got the climbing cheese perfect fit [Music] right we're starting on the bouldering wall this is where you don't need to do with the ropes and stuff and then we'll move on to these like taller sections I'm not very good at these ones I like but we'll drink are though the overhang you're gonna go straight for an overhang [Music] okay now off to a great start just looking at the color clothing hilly and purple is the easiest which is for some reason the blue is purple here but this is the color coding so we're in the blue route but I feel like this starting on that overhang was a bit extreme so we're going to go for these green grips here which I'll say a pair for grade all right guys into the next one how it's good we both did it I'm trying to work on my technique so I'm not using just arm strength which I usually do when I'm climbing and then I just run out of energy after like 20 minutes so I'm trying to like keep my hips close to the wall what's another tips I need to learn yeah you think of creative ways to use it and then I'm trying to put her tits much weight it's possible on my feet okay right I'm gonna do this blue one now [Music] okay okay yeah I just tend to just go for it and then get stuck so before completely exhausting ourselves in the bouldering we're going to move on to top right so we're gonna be harnessed in I haven't done like harness climbing for a while so we're gonna start off easy what do you think the green one okay this is the basic wool green straight up no overhangs just to get back into the swing of it guys I've got a little graze I hit a nut with another one of their like grips oh they're really rough texture for you to grip onto so yeah you don't get friction burn from them okay [Music] [Music] so Laura's been belaying me so she's been like pulling in the slack and then helping me and then loosening it to let me abseil down off for the top rope climbs but I am not qualified or haven't had the belay training from this place because obviously it's my first time so she's doing this one where it's like an automatic belay and this is like some kind of ratchet that I guess is pulling in the slack as she's climbing it seems kind of terrifying to me but I guess you can trust it okay we've come upstairs to this like gym area but they have all these special grips for for like training how to hold and pull your body weight and stuff so these are like free hanging and then these are like little ledges I don't know what the official tempers are got pull-up bars and then look at these different grip sites that's so cool yeah I love how colorful that wall is [Music] thing I'm done guys lost all my strength so one of the things I'm trying to build up again and get my strength back slowly getting there right sorted it's good workout feeling the tension in my forearms back home I'm kicking myself some lunch which as you know this is kind of a rare thing until we based here like it's been impossible to kick also whatever you like cooking but I'm trying you know and also to be fair ryuk cooked and on reheating washi tapes but I did cook some sweet potatoes I put these in the microwave for 10 minutes and they're feeling nice and stops I'm just gonna cut them open put in some vegetable spread and then I'm going to show you how we make smoothies with our nutribullet although our main ingredients bananas we don't have any bananas like a lot from this morning's sake I'm gonna try and make something without bananas this is what just just reheat it right made this a vegetable curry the other day like chickpeas and stuff oh it smells so good guys we've just booked tickets for the Black Panther movie this just just came out yesterday I think and we were gonna go at 8 p.m. but we decided to switch our tickets to 5 p.m. so we can go and hang out with our friends Alex and Mimi you excited to see the movie and the reviews are like amazing literally I have no doubt I'm gonna freak a little of it [Music] smart by design with her I make millions of years ago a meteorite made of vibranium the strong is the substance in the universe struck the continent of Africa toys the movies finished it was pretty incredible I'm not gonna lie that was everything I hoped for amazing action incredible plot I'm not gonna ruin any of it for you because you need to go see it what do you think go to the movie theater stick around till after they're like initial credit just kind of to my little clips and strikes but the first one is really up [Music] oK we've arrived at dinner Thanks we have Bulgarian Tomatoes yeah I made the veggie kabobs and no you're not too big on salads maybe no I'll give her a guy well it was another great night with me me and Alex we're becoming really good friends are those guys and drivers just saying as we were coming in like it already made our trip to Cape Town so far just having them around and yeah it's it's it's been really really cool I don't know if you guys have that with people sometimes they just click and you're like oh I know these guys gonna be really really good friends that's how we feel and yeah if you preach he'll day didn't get to make any smoothies today but I want to show you guys the routine I've gotten to with nutribullet like I was saying earlier we need to go out and get some of the key ingredients that we're missing in a moment but you know I've been good at my kind of kind of upping my calorie intake getting some good routine into like my eating which I've been really bad at in general and yeah getting fitness in working out yesterday getting there climbing in today tomorrow you might even get to do some kayaking I don't know but I'm on it guys don't worry and yeah I'll be updating you on how we're getting on with the Beyond Borders documentary and the Eddie is just you know taking time in the moment and often documentaries I've realized like people spend years on documentaries and we're you know in comparison really putting together stuff pretty quickly but yeah there's lots of conversations going on there's lots of work I'm still assembling a lot of stuff here and sending it over to Nick who's editing it and or starting to compile different bits and we're you know I went over there the other day and had a bit of a brainstorm anyway I'll keep you updated when significant milestones happen but in the meantime yeah I'm just yeah slowing down the vlogging pace like I said and we're trying to do some fun stuff in Cape Town tomorrow we're actually going down to boulders beach to see the Penguins and that should be a lot of fun we're gonna go meet Kyle and some other people in the morning and have an early start so I'll catch you then peace out enjoy life and live the adventure 
[Music] good morning guys it's a beautiful day today we arrived late last night at this stunning desert hotel check this out it's like a castle in the middle of the desert and we're just heading now to get some breakfast and then we're going to explore a bit do a photo shoot throughout the property and then yeah later later this afternoon we're gonna go on a bit of an adventure into the dunes [Music] so the plan today is we need to get some really cool photos of this place we're staying in so we're going on an Instagram mission I've got my tripod got my drone got my a 7r with the 12 to 24 lens my ace of an S with the 24 to 240 give me quite a range of focal lengths I'm not going for any kind of low aperture shallow lenses until later on when it gets dark because it's super sunny right now and also I want to shoot most of the shots wide because this there's so much cool stuff around here architecture sand dunes yeah really a photo by this fountain it's hard with harsh Sun like this but you don't want to have a massive contrast and in shadows if possible you don't want to have to like yeah be hidden in the shadow say we're gonna try point somewhere out in the Sun one thing is if we sit out and one of these little cabañas will get like a little table out with some of these pictures get some tunes in the background and peace even get a palm tree and shot quite a few instagramers have been visiting Abu Dhabi this month as this part of their kind of marketing campaign and Roy has been looking for inspiration from other people's accounts of like locations they shot at which is why we went to and the spot we did last night on the beach overlooking the mosque I like looking for inspiration on other accounts to an extent but don't want to completely replicate photos I think it's good to be inspired but also to try and find unique locations and as we were over there we despite this as a kind of unique location to have some lunch now hopefully they'll let us but this is way cooler than eating in the restaurant there I'm gonna send the drone up to see what this place looks like from the air guys this place looks phenomenal from the air and we've scouted out a few spots to take some photos also bombs into this guy this is Alex he we've been chatting online for like yeah we've been into their friends for years and he just strolled over us I know why so we knew a few people were here this month but um yeah good to meet you yeah and he's vlogging as well I'll link him below how long have you been doing your YouTube folks yeah nice let's climb over here in there hey Ryan this is Alex you [Music] I'm gonna NAB Alex here to take some photos he's he's an incredible photographer so I'm just can you I guess I guess this yes I'll set up a tripod in a sec but maybe you can grab a few first yeah so there's another bit of advice guys always wrangle in your friends to help what thing you guys is me walking up these steps from this angle with these different layers of building so you've got like that balcony the next balcony and then like all those turrets up there and then that'sa little turret thing [Music] alright last location with shooting before on camera right this forum our back garden Vic how cool this is a view of the whole place this is probably going to end up being one of our best photos if you read on such a long mission today love it look the dunes are right there and the building the palm trees right there I just want to get one sitting on this edge guys I wish we were staying here longer this is painful knowing that we're only staying here for one day I think this is one of the coolest places I've ever stayed it's just so impressive and it's just so it's just so crazy where it is that we're in the middle of a desert and then there's this it's absolute luxury hotel and it's nice as well because I've kept in style with a lot of traditional Bedouin stuff like the ornaments and like the architecture and stuff but then obviously it's also a luxury heading on our dogs buggy now go that's gay looks so cool before we head out just get a little iced tea listening to some live music [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay we're here the middle of desert ready to ride camel this is my outfit by the way and if you can properly see it right now but it's like a big flowy skirt so I can get some really cool photos okay what's my camera's name okay I'm just gonna hunker down all right what's my camera's name huh yes the hunt is it a guy or a girl so hon thanks [Music] as we were just told that with these camels they have Beauty competitions here where I think last year the winner well the owner of the winning the most beautiful camel got a new Lexus crazy we just found out an interesting fact about camels guys so apparently in almost every country in the world there's no wild camels I think the only exception from what this guy says is Australia but even those camels were brought in to help with building the railways from Afghanistan and they I guess that was a few hundred years ago but yeah camels in this part of the world haven't been wild for over 2,000 years so all the camels have been owned for either transport milk or meat I guess or I guess like tourist rides nowadays like this which is pretty fascinating I think this is the best photo spot we've had so far with the dunes Sun and then the camels all kind of walking uphill [Music] I think this is the most beautiful camel ride I've ever done and I've done quite a few I've done some in Morocco think yeah Egypt goodbye that's if I don't come right you guys probably know just been watching my vlogs I've done a few but this is never in like area of dunes this big and this impressive and it's all about golden hour as well we made it to the top this is we're gonna stop the sunset this is the best thing we've done in Abu Dhabi in my opinion about Uriah apparently the desert here's the same size as France yeah I think often the desert places I've been to has been like smaller areas but when you when your money like in this sand like miles apparently there the electricity and water to this resort is some bits coming from all the way from Abu Dhabi which is like a - to our two and a half hour drive and the nearest town is eighty kilometers away so we are right in the middle I've got some cool photos of Raya because I was obviously in the camera behind her with the wide with the 12 that looked sick with the guy like leading her camel but she's now gonna hold the camel on her own and we're just trying to figure out the best angle I think this is cool because of the Jews behind but then it's gonna be backlit so we're gonna go for this angle where the sun's kind of coming in from the right perfect yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the shot that is the shot [Music] now rides gonna get some twirly shots with her beautiful skirt oh yeah let's go Louise finding the camels with the drone right now did you find them yeah [Music] thank you mm-hmm right you should try this tea is really good okay we're catching a car back now we're just stopping off for two minutes on the way back and they're gonna re-inflate the tires because as you know I'm sure when you drive and sand you have to deflate the tires so you have more traction anyway we're stopping off as stable so I've come in to have a little look at the horses here hey buddy [Music] look at the view in the back our room this is gonna be pretty spectacular I'm hoping to get some maybe even some star lapses tonight that'd be fun wasn't it right for dinner getting out oh thanks enough food now oh yeah oh thanks yeah look at the size of this roti this is in comparison this is the size of my plate is pakistani righty wow I love that dinner was delicious it's been a really beautiful evening unfortunately I've been too wrapped up with editing to get out and do any style APS's and stuff but I'm gonna be coming back here for sure this is such an epic place and yeah if you ever get the chance I highly recommend it add it to your bucket list it's been an amazing time here in Abu Dhabi and yeah I'll see you guys back in the UK peace out enjoy life and live the adventure okay 
[Music] good afternoon guys we are in wick in Scotland we flew in yesterday and and then me and Matt stayed up all night and editing and trying to catch up with some of the videos we were originally gonna fly it down to England today but we decided to stay another day because this place is so beautiful and one of the things we want to do later this afternoon is go down to this like ruins on the cliff this castle ruins which is like four miles away so we're going to go check that out and yeah just have a nice wander around and also I said this yesterday but flying into Scotland was kind of I don't know I felt this this strong connection with Scotland because I'm half Scottish but it really hit me when we flew in just this kind of I know just how connected I am and then we as we wake up this morning we had bagpipes playing our window and it's just yeah just so typically Scottish so what we're seeing guys is loads of these kind of abandoned buildings here and I'm guessing they're kind of kept on that cause probably they're like I've got some kind of historical significance maybe they're like listed and protected buildings but it's kind of crazy seeing these old stone buildings of no no rubes or anything so we just bumped into some kids that told us that right over here it's the smallest Street in the world so we're gonna go and have a look at it apparently is like officially classified as a smallest rate in the world we're not convinced by this but according to the Guinness World Records this little stretch here from here to here it's like a two meter stretch it's called ever ever knees a place and that's literally just this tiny end of the building by the novi is the street there's no actual road here this is just like pavement so idea I mean I mean I may be this little bit of right here but and I I don't know how about that what you think [Music] so guys yesterday when we landed in WIC I did a little Instagram story asking if anyone was around that could show us around and help us find cool things and Laura and Colin reached out and they have come to pick us up me and Matt are gonna jump in with him and go and check out a cool castle nearby it was one that we wanted to walk to last night but it was like it was like an hour-and-a-half walk so we decided nothing and then JP is just staying here to finish off a few other little bit and which side am I getting it guys thanks so much for offering shirts around oK we've had to stop off on the way to get Toby she's gonna come and join on our adventures hey Toby and also Colin's granny has cooked us oh well this you've done some baking and she insisted we try it so we're just tucking in [Music] me and Matt with I think pretty optimistic and thinking we could have walked here and we were thinking we could get it for sunrise as well I'm kind of glad we didn't stay off on that yeah they would have been an interesting one on that mission well here we go so it's it's Castle Sinclair gonna go is that how you said wow look at that this is what it would have looked like and then we're about to see what it looks like now [Music] oK we've arrived to this out right on the cliffs [Music] [Music] this is really epic guys just trying to imagine kind of like going back in time and what this was like like hundreds of years ago this is yeah this is some mad and it's been yeah I guess just so eroded by being on the cliff and being exposed to high winds and kind of the sea and stuff check this out Wow look at these little rooms when I look at this nice little window hey can you say something I mean I think this is gonna be right a bit further yeah yeah you're just in short now yeah that further that way a bit more a bit more okay you know that's the edge of my shot I was the one that was taking money in the camera and I used it sort of as a way to protect myself so to speak and when I met Colin when I told and he was already taking force by the time I'm a on it sort of showed me how to use the ins and outs of the camera more because before I just used it on automatic and and even when I first met Colin I wouldn't show my photographs I used to wait until his back was turned before I would take a photograph because I don't want to see him seeing me take a photo and like I never showed anyone my foot was either like they were all on my laptop and just for me and but since Colin came along he sort of set up with photography page for me and on Facebook and they helped me come after Michele a lot and like when I was like in a high school there's no way I'd be doing anything and there's but since they and I've been doing photography talks around the local community and I'm not that shy and the cliff's individual that I used to be I'm a mark for a more confident person [Music] you [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] and so Laura and Cullen have kindly invited us out to this Chinese restaurant okay we're sitting down first things first the most Scottish drink you can get iron brie it's it's so Orange it's like more orange than orange juice orange ginger okay let's let's do a little chairs with our iron Bruce no no that's a really bad thanks guys all right we're off Colin and Laura have been amazing thank you so much guys yeah see you next time bye so we're back at the hotel for the night it's almost 2 a.m. I've been upstairs editing and I've just moved back downstairs to this little lounge area because they've had a wedding on here all day and tonight and people have just kind of gone to bed now so there's space to edit probably be up for a few hours JP's message saying 9 a.m. star we're gonna go back to the airport and yeah head down into England which is exciting I'm gonna see my family and friends tomorrow hopefully take a few people up for a flight in the plane but I've really enjoyed visiting wick and yeah just also the hospitality of Laura and Colin today just showing us around taking us out for dinner like honestly it's amazing and I don't know it just gives me hope and humanity you know to meet such a warm hired people that I just yeah just I don't know just passionate about what they love and also keen to to share that so thanks guys have you watching it was awesome hanging out with you today and like I've said before if any one else anywhere in the world roughly on our route that you've seen hopefully you've seen our ruffery wants to yea meet up with us be interviewed just you know hang out share stories all of that kind of stuff please email me below and yeah we'll try and make it work anyway I'm gonna crack on with my edits I'm trying so hard to catch up because I know it's gonna be way more enjoyable for you guys if you're kind of watching the map and seeing the videos from the locations that we've just been out rather than the week behind any one trauma best this is the least off slept in my life I think this helps where you could - and these edits instead of being two or three hours they're like five to eight hour edits so that's why it's difficult for me to keep on top of it but I'm trying my best and I think we get some pretty cool content for the documentary the other last thing is we are going to be flying some people out later in the trip to help us with the documentary shooting but it's just been this first leg with over the Atlantic we couldn't have an extra cameraman or any film crew because of the restrictions on the plane and weight and distance with flying over sea and all that other stuff anyway that will be coming hopefully will ya be creating some even better content than we have been right I'll catch in the morning peace out enjoy life Olivia venture [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys I have come down to Kingston today to meet help my friend Jacob gonna grab a coffee and then I'm heading in for some meetings in London after that I wasn't going to vlog today but as I got in the car I realized it's actually quite a beautiful day and yeah they haven't taken you guys into London with me for a while and also this is my last day in the UK because tonight I'm flying out to Cape Town so yeah it's gonna be a good day nice feeling feeling good ready for coffee though all right here he is Jacob cheers bro having a good catch up eating some avocado on toast and drinking lots of coffee guys Jacob just pointed out the size of this dog outside this is the biggest dog I've seen for years this is you could ride that dog had a really nice catch up with Jacob if you haven't checked him out he's an incredible photographer I'll link his Instagram below and we were just chatting about our plans for 2018 and yeah where we'll be traveling and projects we're doing and hopefully we can do some stuff together yeah looking forward to it actually and another inspiration guy I'm about to go and see now and his name's Sam he was one of the guys who founded unis that I haven't seen him like three years but I'm gonna go and check out his New London offices and yeah as you know whenever I'm back in the UK I try and catch up with as many people as possible so that's not doing guys this is Sam from uni lat and we've just spent a little time just chatting and dreaming together and looking at ways we can work together this year but and he's just give me a little office tour show us around so there's a little bit of a moment because we kind of renovate in the office but as you can see we've got a big guy you have painted sign on the wall sisters ground floor London HQ we have all these kind of meeting rooms starting around which is kind of a sweet salon is the destinations where they kind of they kind of move from Caledonia super like small space probably literally where we are now probably like that like that and it's just mad how much it's grown from a year on here that's like four years ago yeah it's like 11,000 square-foot like whole building in London it's insane Manchester office as well congratulations dude this is this is really inspiring guys because it shows you what you can what kind of empire you can build off just I guess to start with just a Facebook page but we've been chatting the last arrow so about like how can we use our platforms and audience to reach kind of or to do positive things in the world and have positive impact what we're saying this stats were like how you're the Facebook page had the biggest interaction and then any Facebook page so in last year 2017 we had over 1.1 billion people likes commented or shared our content which is the most of any kind of face book publisher yeah and had a forty million video views I had a figurehead probably like 20 million video views so these guys are working on a slot operating a slightly higher level but we're all kind of yeah it's interesting being in the influence of space and imagining the positive impact and I will obviously not that they need me to but I will link what these guys doing down below specially you need ad adventure which I think there's a lot of crossover in what we're doing yeah going like their Facebook page good campaigns sweet sweets right guys as expected that was really really cool meeting with Sam I feel like on a lot of levels even though we haven't chatted in a few years properly just a bit online where yeah we see the world and this in a similar way we're excited about having a positive impact in different ways and yeah I'll keep you guys posted know things we're doing but yeah lots of lots of exciting ideas staring also I didn't mention but he has his own personal Instagram account I wish I think you should go and check out and follow and yeah hopefully your he'll feature in this year and a few modes and as we're finding ways to travel together he might come down to Cape Town and yeah I think he's got a lot of cool projects that I'd love to help support one of which he's looking at doing more kind of documentaries and creating more longer form content and also that's something I'm trying to do as well Beyond Borders hopefully this year if that goes really well and successful that could be a big part of my future so there's a lot of crossover and yeah I always feel inspired seeing people killing it in the industry doing so well having achieved so much but being grounded and having a good heart so yeah don't check Sam out I'm now final thing of the day before I go in pack and fly is gonna go and meet my mum for a coffee she's work she works around here so yeah that's gonna get a quick coffee we've got a little coffee you had a cat chart and this is where my mom works in where are we living for school around Liverpool Street and I'm Lily I get back to work now back it's been great catching up I'll be back in like a week love you but I actually feel quite proud to seeing my mum working and a good job up here in the city she's been kind of working as a contractor freelance for years and years and years and she last year kind of yeah managed to bag herself this very very good job and yeah I've seen her come alive because it's I think even office jobs that are not an office person I think if you're doing stuff you love and you're passionate about it brings you life whatever you're doing so yeah I definitely sense that for my mum and yeah that's good right I'm slightly against the clock now to get back pack and to the airport in time but it's hope fake it I have all my things I've just packed quickly well not like regular to me about 40 minutes meaning we're running oh how half an hour late I think yeah only my dad who's a gonna connect to the airport [Music] rious bag I'm taking down to Cape Town as well dad's drop me off see ya yep it's weird checking in luggage Ryan's got all this summer clothes in there I think or something guys I want to pick up Emirates for being very understanding about my insanely overweight and luggage I normally don't go near the counter so they can't weigh it but because I checked and Rhys bag they insisted on weighing it and told me yeah I was supposed to have seven kilograms with the limit I had 25 kilograms that I ever triple the weight limit I managed to explain its own fragile electronics and they they have had they had some sympathy and let me through which is nice [Music] [Music] I arrived in Dubai I didn't sleep so I had entered the blog yet but when I get on the next flight to Cape Town I'm going to try to sleep most a flight and I did describe some breakfast hour till I thought [Music] that was a very long bus drive from the terminal to the aeroplane I think that's like 20 minutes driving through the airport I felt like we were driving in circles but we got here I think I fell asleep on the bus and I think I might fall asleep before we even take off so you're on the sign out here guys look forward to the beginning of some exciting times in Cape Town the vlogs are gonna get fun at summary we could have been hanging out with Nick and Ange and Jesse their baby we haven't met Jesse yet he's awesome and yeah like I said we're gonna be working on the documentary getting a team together hopefully JP's gonna make it out pretty soon and yeah exciting times exciting times alright I'll catch in Capetown peace out into her life and in the adventure 
hey guys I've got a very special video for you today taking a little break from the world trip vlogs which I hope you're enjoying but this is a vlog that I actually filmed before all of that back at the beginning of August where I went and visited the Ubisoft headquarters in the UK and got to try out the new Assassin's Creed game which is out now it's released but back then this was all top secret so yeah I hope you enjoy it's a little bit of a different video but yeah check it out so today I'm meeting up with the Ubisoft team to see the latest on Assassin's Creed origins as you remember a couple of months ago I went to the e3 gaming convention when they announced Assassin's Creed and got to see it then it's still before release date now but I'm getting to see a little sneak peek of how they're getting on and chat to some of the developers and the team and stuff and I'm pretty excited guys this is Sam one of the guys at Ubisoft he's shown me this collection of they're not toys are they're like models collectible okay so I'll tell was the first assassin the game has got to meet after outs highear there's several statues of this guy he's a big fan favorite this is Ezio Auditore where we get old man Ezio bit sexy with a beard and this is also where the story moved to Constantinople Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag took the Assassin's through to the water and the Pirates of the Caribbean the significance of Black Flag aside from being my personal favorite Assassin's Creed game is this is the team who the development team who are making Assassin's Creed origin yeah one of the amazing things about Assassin's Creed one of the things that makes the franchise so popular is the the cities that the developers are recreating are you know they're pretty much inch for inch stone for stone as those cities were and then they bring them to life with you know the AI and the NPC characters in them we work very very closely with historians to ensure that everything is you know as close to reality as it could be and there was an instance with syndicate where one of the historians we've been working with came in to see the game running for the first time and he was shown this Victorian England living and breathing and apparently was very very close to tears at the time because reading sort of moved by this because it was something he'd spent his entire life studying brought to life in front of him and that's I think is something that's been behind the entire series from our tyre at the beginning all the way up to biock who you met briefly in LA is wanting to really you know really put gamers and fans in these locations in these time periods and you know on top of a twisting thrilling sort of story that you get to play out also just to show you really how these how these cities worked back then so that was a little rundown of the history of Assassin's Creed and now we're going to go and check out biak and Assassin's Creed origins oh this is a serious gaming room okay guys I have sat down now I've been dropped in Alexandria the city in ancient Egypt and I'm just gonna have a little explore also I'm in discovery mode so this isn't the mode where I'll get missions and I fight people this is just purely to walk around and view it and I think this is like potentially for people just to look at the history of the place and there's like information so it's like an educational version of a game which it actually is more interesting to me just to be able to look around you and learn about it I'm at the gates the gates of Alexandria also seems to be the middle of the night it's cool that it's nighttime all the lot all the lanterns are lit up or the fire okay I don't know where I'm going we're just gonna walk up these stairs and check out some of these big temples and stuff I'm gonna try and get as high as possible okay I'm just gonna keep I'm gonna go up every staircase I can to get a view of the highest point I'd love to know what how much of this map is still there we're there any of its still there or whether it's all from dis old like historical records of the place some of these must be like ancient ruins now some of these buildings I love the kind of like haze through this I guess we're in a temple this is like incense burning down there check it and then like all the lights diffusing through it it's so cool I look up all the offerings as well food offerings ha to this god oh what's his name oh it's in Greek does anyone read Greek then all that says a little wonder oh wow check that out look at the pyramids yeah guys if you remember when I was at e3 I was on the boat and we were like having fun in the water I think I feel that it's gonna be crocodiles in there again it's so good like the war the water war and all this stuff well let me try and get in the boat oh yeah boy I like that I'm just gonna borrow your boat okay sweet yes sailing into golden hour quickly the Sun through the sail imagine it's sailing was this easy you could just lean back flying are there he's like over the motorboat spinning around the camera mode is like I've got a drain I think I could just spend hours running around discovering this place must have taken so long to like find out all the information about like the statues and the designs of the intricacy and all the buildings is mad if these the pyramids the modern pyramids that you can see that you can visit from Cairo right now yeah yeah the Great Pyramid of Giza so I just don't remember this mountain range and I was there in the game do you get to meet like the Pharaohs and stuff yes so there's there's we've got our own cast of characters in the game with BAE and his family and the order of the ancients who are the sort of the proto Templars oh yeah this is this is incredible whoa yeah there you go that was the Tower so that's Alexandria that was where we were where we first decided to come up the pyramids and then we finally made it and then this is the little pyramid I tried to climb I was the one before it was the big one yeah so these are the three the main three pyramids and then the Sphinx should be down there somewhere just there so then it's got bit of sand on it there's the Sphinx though and then one of these fries yeah and this must be the ones I climbed and then this mount all of this terrain has changed in real life but I guess because it was thousands of years ago it's well it's yeah at the time of the game you concede all this area around all the pyramids would have been temples and it would have been where priests live and you know people who weren't able to be buried within the pyramids would have been buried around here because they're deeply religious area is very sacred yeah but you can see how the desert starting to reclaim it already yeah so all the the Nile with the droughts and and you know and the weathering of the area that when it dried up more and the desert came in it started to claim all these areas here which is why they've become more abandoned I said guys I'm gonna leave it there I've had a fun I could like I said I could spend days just exploring this and I'm sure people will so today you've seen Alexandria and sees that the area around the pyramids and that accounts for maybe twenty percent of the total map Wow and creates a lot more cities and and places to go and check out brilliant incredible yes so hopefully enjoyed that video guys like I said something a little bit different and check out the link below if you want to go and download assassins creed origins and yeah we'll be back to the normal upload schedule tomorrow on the world trip videos I think we are currently flying across Australia and yeah I'll catch you tomorrow peace out enjoy life and live the adventure 
[Music] good morning guys we're in Germany in a town called baden baden it's kind of in there I guess the southwest corner of Germany quite near the French border we flew in last night from Brighton in the UK and we're just about to meet up with my friend Felix a lot of you know him he originally had the expedition happiness the big school bus that I now have in the US and yeah I came and visited him I think earlier in the year but he lives nearby so he's going to take us out for lunch we're gonna hang out maybe chat a little bit about the documentary because he's had quite a bit of experience he's just released his own documentary about the school bus but yeah and then I think later this afternoon we're gonna be heading to Austria I was contemplating staying in Germany and shooting some stuff for the documentary but I think the plan now is just so I can say I've officially done every leg of the journey is yeah stick with these guys and then tomorrow when we need to put the plane in for maintenance I'll come back to Germany and apparently there's some cool opportunities here to interview people and some Syrian refugees that have come into Germany so that's the plan guys we met up with Felix yes bro Felix kindly got the place to stay last night now we're heading out for lunch oh yeah this is Dima as well have you didn't watch yesterday's vlog he's randomly like tagged along from the UK with more countries than me as well which is pretty impressive right is she tending our flowers hit the women sending her flowers on the bridge Felix that's quite fast car and we were just talking like theoretically could we race these guys to Austria to be just outside Vienna over they were really good what do you reckon do you think we could be a pen somewhere in Austria but I would say being a nice step is that sort of spin yeah but if we get out of hotel all together yeah by the time they take a cab by the time they prepare on JP spook Harry but he probably takes like 45 minutes just to do a lot of pre check on the flight zone okay another 45 to get to the airport another two hours until takeoff because they are not allowed to take off whatever I'm positive I would take the bet I mean like 10000 or whatever at least like a 10 hour drive but you could probably do in five eight but in theory this is cool this is like I feel like this is an episode of top getting in the making we can be like would have to be a night time because in daytime you cannot drive more than like 200 ok so we're saying clear roads and you don't have to worry about it you don't have to worry about getting pulled over by the police stacking every hour drive it's an eight hour drive but we can do it for I've been pleasantly surprised by this town never heard of it before we came here today but apparently it's like because it's in the south of Germany it's really nice weather here most the time and Felix likes it because of the nature as well who's saying how actually hate cities and I I can kind of relate to that like I don't have a hatred towards cities but I do enjoy less of that kind of chaos and noise and stuff and having somewhere to chill yeah I don't know if I could live permanently in a real hustle-bustle of a city but then I would what do you guys feel do you like that kind of that kind of energy do you thrive from that or does that drain you I guess that's the question is a bit like whether you're an extrovert or an introvert it's great Greece and Egypt Felix is thinking about joining us when you when you get to join us bro I think Austria increase such as like Greece yeah I'll put my shorts on and my dad body and then drink what are you drinking now an increase I don't know but I think we've got a different idea of where in Greece I'm thinking they're going to like refugee camps you just he can hit in the Greece I agree silence Gemma nee I'm gonna be back the platanus I don't know if I was saying earlier but we're gonna drop the plane in Austria for some maintenance it needs to be there for quite a while like more than a week unfortunately but I'm gonna be on a mission at that point first stop is coming back to quite near here and yeah hopefully get to do some interviews and and meet some Syrian refugees and some local Germans and kind of just kind of get my head around the whole dynamic going on there and then yeah off to explore some other areas possibly Greece and I don't know we're on to Egypt after that but yeah I'm gonna meet these guys back or JP back next weekend Austria baby let's do this oh yeah there's that front over the river yeah does anyone like ginger and chocolate I have some amazing dark chocolate ginger in it trial bearable but it's definitely going strong to taste last place that I'm joining for all the way to Austria it's like Q&amp;A hey you guys ready yeah okay okay first question what is the most frustrating or difficult part about traveling the world this way there's all the red tape and bureaucracy I'd say now that says like permit long lead times for filing plate plans that sort of thing baby don't baby don't being able to land too definitely because things could change last second rare you definitely need a be flexible and open it and patient I guess yeah have you bought the aeroplane or is it rented really cool series by the way Louie owns the airplane he bought it yep it was just played a lot more sense up top I'm not planning on on keeping it and it was kind of like at its best but well planning on keeping it yet I don't know how I would be able to do but it makes sense to be able to sell it and it should hold its value and if we'd rented it would have been a waste aboard up in 120-130 sales dollars down the drain yeah we're renting thanks though ok are you ok JP I'm fine another question about JP I said I saw you speaking German on Instagram how many languages do you speak you're being played there's a video by you channel you can check out if you want to do that it's called how many languages do I speak who really how many languages do you speak I speak five what is the funniest thing that has happened to you recently Matt peeing in the plane that was a that was a lariat guys I get it if you didn't see that floki means go check out it was like I think I left like a six minute section of the blog with your lay like Matt trying to pee unsuccessfully and I feel like I should address this a little bit it is actually quite challenging just in this plane in general especially in those suits because there's just a lot of layers you're working with like you got to turn around you gotta get like the theme problem one of the biggest problems is gravity because like the seats are angled backwards you got to make sure that stuff like that I said what I thought more than anything though it's just a number of let the sheer number of layers I think I was okay I was my baby how much do you sleep on average per day and also will you ever visit Sweden after your trip for who is that everybody I guess but mostly last night I reckon I got like three and a half and then have another 20 minutes down so yeah at that some days I'll get bored antisense but I'm not courage 'never II won - like trying to survive on a little amount of sleep but on this trip I'm willing to sacrifice a bit sleep to try and get the vlogs edited and uploaded and I way underestimated how long these vlogs are gonna take to edit I need there gonna be a challenge but this is like next-level I kind of I kind of like that either so almost to the airport I think this is probably good one to end on what so far isn't something you remember the most about this trip flying over the Greenland ice cap blowing a great little general way was just like you know that I think they were gonna keep landing we hadn't greenery like the bounce head of the iceberg great and also just like I mean I would say like the whole of northern Canada going to Greenland cuz you just get like so remote there's no one out there you're like some of the only people in the world that stuff a set like we did that the Sun was saying like three hours right and it just felt so epic it felt like we were just something breaker uniform you can expect if you like typically would have we dropped out [Music] I love getting to see these interesting places loads flow like this just looking out the window we've landed an Austrian there's like a restaurant right next to the runway awesome I'm gonna dump our bags out here well I think we've also managed to book ourselves into the chief you know hotel nearby so funny people are not to use to no odor staring what was your name again make a hello hello Mickey's come to say hello to us he's been following the adventure yeah so we've got a relatively nice room tonight I'm sharing with Matt because we're both night hours so we both stay up very late and and the other boys you know probably go to bed earlier than us so it makes make sense and we've spent most the evening so far just trying to figure out a bunch of stuff which I'm not gonna bore you with but turns out yeah a lot of the things we're trying to do is flying around the world and you know filming stuff and finding interesting stories it doesn't always fall into place as planned it gets bit more complicated so currently I'm trying to figure out whether to to drive or fly back to near where we just were this morning in Germany to trying them to do some filming and capture some kind of documentary footage and men from there whilst the planes getting maintenance and JP needs to shoot off for some stuff whether I then fly elsewhere but it's just a bit tricky tricky trying to figure it all out say and I solved it I just hate getting up super early and flying places on budget airlines they probably won't let me take my bag on that scary anyway I'm not gonna bore you with any more but and it's been a fun day it's nice doing our final flight together with Matt it's been it's been a good time bro yeah yeah I feel like this isn't the last adventure we're gonna have to get away I'm pretty confident about here but you've been you've been a good help for this trip thank you so much for your for your wisdom yeah and if you haven't guys definitely going to subscribe to Matt and he can take you on these adventures from his perspective a lot of more like a lot all the flights we've been doing Matt's been kind of narrating and taking you on his own journey in his own style so yeah be sure to go and subscribe and wait for those videos and yeah let them know let us know where we could do some future adventures as well but yeah I'm gonna sign out here try and do some editing try and get a little tiny bit sleep and then I'll catch you in the morning peace out enjoy life live the Adventure Bay [Music] 
[Music] [Music] good morning guys it's bright and early we're in Crete having had a short stopover here we flew in like late last night and you know we're heading to Egypt today we have to wear these very official looking shirts when we arrive late great I like it you do look good guys it doesn't debut look good no sir I'm gonna I'm gonna have to put mine on like as we're coming into lands I don't really feel like wearing it in the plane son yeah let's cool it's very official but yeah before we go and get the plane and take off it's fine for a chewed-up coffee [Music] cool alright I'm gonna put this somewhere easily accessible for when we land in Egypt the shoulder things baby and November 2 1 0 kind of already detecting watching 2 to 5 3 in surrogate for weekday - then it's flying to Africa Egypt pretty crazy continent alright November 2 1 0 holding short of - 7 ready to go it all closed you're strapped in yeah starts in alright here we go alright how's that temperatures pressures are good [Music] our speeds alive [Music] so guys you might be wondering why we haven't got any cameras on the outside of the plane today reason being is that Egypt's are very key of places flying in with cameras on the outside in case you're spying or something other day so if we had to take them all off there's no nice wing shots today I'm afraid the beach is just looks so beautiful down there [Music] [Music] dude so Africa man we're there in ten minutes oh yeah okay oh yeah I don't know what's up isn't maintaining the charge or what is it doing I think it won't seem exciting the charge that's good oh I ever cook it oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yeah oh yeah and the pepper 2 1 0 I can have up to five miles all right so with 24 miles away and I think that that's the continent there but it's so hazy I can't see it it has to be because 25 miles is not far so that has to be it for these food again epi less Capulets now like a real real pirate does [Applause] yeah that's because I see a town [Applause] [Music] at 7,500 feet it's 20 degrees Celsius oh that is actually insane oh I feel so legit they can eat it holy this is awesome Wow this is fiber Africa the continent I was born on and lived for 17 years Wow I flew here okay that that is actually and it's same Egypt Wow I've never been here so obviously you can hear them all unique you just head south of that you're about to sleep I'm about to land break it Egypt that is cool oh sorry Cobra 1:08 Co uniform on February 3 inside three three inside sir a jet baby yeah oh my gosh we have touchdown [Laughter] okay guys I've taken the GoPros off the front further down the back here just because like I saying earlier Egypt are particularly keen on cameras rolling because although I'm sure a lot of private pilot's do use cameras at their planes and this film they're just not used to private pilot's out here and it's all a bit strange today I'm going to tell my camera off now and we'll see you when we get through to the other side guys we successfully got through customs and Egypt's we have a stump in our passport we're now sitting just waiting for clearance to take off and then we're heading to another Airport where we're gonna be staying for a few days with create epicness a moment ago two fighter jets took off in the same runway about a very positive is this taking a while and we're trying to be covert just because it's quite military round this week are nomadic see alpha also to an away treaty disregarding for me taxiway alpha hot shot three three you ready yep yeah air ball [Music] it's crazy to me to think we left Austria yesterday morning like it doesn't feel real this is so different and like taking a commercial flight you would think much of it yeah but you're seeing everything progress and change here it's like being on a road trip it feels more like I'm in a car than [Music] I've had a decent yellow with 7 minutes away [Music] two ones there at uniform I'd like to do over for communication October 3rd why are they keeping me so high I am literally over the airport hey we're strapping cuz it might get pretty really gonna get copy yeah oh yeah yeah yeah this is gonna be here interesting landing t10 uniform just confirming at the left downwind 4:01 I become one way v1 [Music] yeah and it took Tovar I'll get these old airplanes just covered in dust well that's crazy well look what the hell along with him sitting there no idea oh my gosh it's like a airplane graveyard is Eddie yep all right turn to grab our bags this is where we're parking up a few days [Music] I've just put a little cover around the windows just to protect it from any sand damage or a wind damage and maybe the heat as well stop things cooking inside before we head off to our hotel and check in we're gonna go and check out some of these these planes it's kind of like playing graveyard they're surrounding us but what was he saying it was so many planes abandoned here the general aviation industry God can't like close down pretty much it became illegal to to fly general aviation here in 2013 so overnight it's pretty crazy yeah oh by the way guys this is Eddie he's been helping us with our trip around the world he's like a master at global trip organizing serve any of you want to fly around the world you need to give him a call he's like the ultimate support guy with a committed partner and Eddie helped Matt with his trip back in whenever it was two dozen so skinny how are you producing milk for babies oh my gosh we're getting attacked by puppies hey you're bold one check this out [Music] look at all this day I got its rust I guess they've just been sitting here for four years and untouched all right we'll be back here in a few days [Music] we are settled our hotel it's been a lot of air flying but I feel pretty pumped to be in Egypt it was yeah it was a really special moment with JP as we arrived in Africa having flown here all the way from North America like California heading up through Canada Greenland Iceland Scotland and Ruth to England Germany Austria and then just hammering it from from Austria to pray and then Crete this morning all the way to Egypt has been the most insane trip so far just been a whirlwind absolute whirlwind and I'm struggling just to like keep up not just with the vlogs but just processing it always been yeah I thought three months would feel like would have you know plenty of time just to kind of take it all in but not at all I think we should have done this trip over a year in all honesty and ever use helping his planet as said today he just thinks the fact that we see ourselves an end date and we're trying to have an end baby just says it's not what you want for a round-the-world trip ideally which is a shame but anyway it's planned now and yeah it's gonna be cool the next few days needed to be really cool I guess that's why I have to do is just focus on where we are and what we're doing that day so tomorrow we are gonna go out and see the pyramids if you've been a long-term deal you would've remembered back in 2013 I think I went to Egypt with my family I came here so the pyramids and bread and camels and those are cool things of that so we're going to be doing the kind of classic touristy stuff JP wants to see the pyramids tomorrow and then there hopefully before we fly out of here we'll get some to meet some locals and you know have a good chat and fill up some clips and interviews for the documentary yeah I'm feeling I'm feeling really happy I'm really happy to be here and I'll catch you guys in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
good morning guys today is the day I'm getting my dreads fixed up we're Sylvia it has been we figured out over six months right yeah it's been I think a July last year before way before I went on the world flight anyway over that time obviously what I created become a little bit tangled kind of loose at the top at the roots and yeah we're gonna show you how she can transform them from the kind of the mess they are at the moment to like super neat as you I'm sure you've seen before but yeah I think this is must be one of the longest times I've left it yeah so yeah let's get cracking it's gonna take a few hours we're gonna time-lapse it I've got my coffee ready and yeah see we can give you some updates throughout just to show you how again you'll see it looks like it looks okay to be honest listen doesn't look too bad um I'll see ful but hey nothing that can't be fixed before we start can you run through the technique you're gonna use their hundreds the main tool is 0.75 millimeter crochet hook we might need some scissors to cut like the edges and I have one of those bad boys have a few sizes finally got my hand thing again they all go around the edges amend but main thing is crusher can hands yeah okay so fixed this area so far fix the dreads all along was that they're kind of the most matted yeah I think that side is gonna be more mattered so yet to do that but so this how it looks the roots at least looks fixed and this is how it looks I'm fixed are you feeling okay is not painful yeah sweet we're almost halfway I think and I just got some lunch tomato soup got another coffee gonna crap on with some editing how we getting on good good like Oh what have we done yes so what's this technique here where you rub where you're rubbing it against yeah well people just say like palm rolling really but it's just like route rolling between your fingers and then you do palm running but mainly focus on these bits of my palm so really like I roll up the dread get all the heads in it crusher sounds super simple like I'll just wrap the hair around the hook and pull it out just repeat but there's definitely like techniques to that each individual dreadlock needs to be done like differently according to the route and like denseness of your dread and all that stuff so yeah you make you make it feel like it's quite easy but then when I really pay attention to what you're doing I'm like I don't know you have to do that yeah a lot of people said that but some people pick it up quicker than there was as well like guys all of the dreads have been tightened and crocheted and stuff and now it's time to neaten around I don't have you were watching at some point last year we took the step of starting to shave the sides all kind of trim the sides because that my hair is thinning quite badly here so she's gonna shave here I tried I tried to do this over Christmas but it didn't really work too well I think I shaved the wrong bit anyway she's gonna neaten this up and then around the back that I don't know if you can show oh yeah like all of this needs meaning right mm-hmm wow they look so much better now already yeah then I guess all of this needs yeah we'll just trim a little bit like cut in shape the rest okay we are now cutting some lengths off the dreads this is like I think this is a good amount this is like two or three inches of dr. Edelin last time yeah that's more than that's lucky yeah that's the coffee is great for something there but anyway Becca it's getting quite long and and no more just straggly so it's trying to get rid of that struggling this it's always weird seeing my dreads like this alright sylvia's off thanks so much oh she she did a fantastic job I wasn't gonna wear my headband and she was even suggesting I could wear my hair down tonight but it's a little bit chilly outside still so this is keeping my head warm and if it gets super cold I can just tuck my ears in but yeah I'm ready to roll now I'm ready for a few more months at least and yeah maybe when I get back and do a little spin and show you how good it really is but extremely happy I'm gonna get some dinner now it's a long day six hours okay I'll show you the dreads finished this is them down don't off the web my dreads down the guides as you know and I only really would unlike dancing or swimming or maybe I should wear them down more I feel like they're gonna get in the way I'm like you know differently to my hc5 say yeah I'll choose my moments better yeah and then if I uh I tie them up to be this way yeah way that up this is waiting that's just way need up and then yeah that's not too messy that's pretty good good job Silvia thank you so it's been a very non eventful day I thought I'd give you guys a little insight into my ritual kind of bye and your ritual of getting my hair sorted I'm sure you've seen my other videos well it's been a pretty non eventful day but I thought I'd include you guys on my kind of dread repair ritual that happens a couple of times a year I'm sure you've seen the other videos but yeah this is a part of kind of maintaining this hairstyle which I'm not planning to get rid of it anytime soon I still very much enjoying and feel connected to my dreadlocks but yeah tomorrow I'm heading to London for some adventures so I will catch you in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure

copy incredible Oh [Music] today is the day that I am handling over the big 12 terabyte hard drive to the head editor Nick who's going to start shaping the documentary and yeah it's been I haven't been uploading a lot recently because I've been sitting in my office just like sorting through files connecting interviews with the audio files anyway it's all done now and yeah it's an exciting day it's a big step towards get the documentary done okay guys I've arrived at Nick's house he happens to live in Manon Berg which has a bad reputation and historically there's been a lot of violence here and it's it's not the safest place in Cape Town I came a few years ago and I don't know if you remember that vlog but there was some gangs and I was in a bit of risk because I had all my cameras out anyway that uber driver has like got in he was a little bit wary about driving me here but it's all good and Nick and his wife had doing some cool projects here what you guys doing here what called you out here to live in Memphis the long story but I guess I realized I had a lot of privilege and people were really struggling and I thought I basically used my skill which is video editing video making and kind of make it part of mana burg and say like do you want me I'm part of the team man and beg so and my wife's running a crash for like local kids who were like whose parents the drug addicts and that kind of stuff who were just really struggling wow that's cool so I'll do a whole vlog where we kind of on a shine a light and the project Nick is involved with here and and but for now we're just gonna get because he's in a bit of a rush today and we're just gonna check this drive and see if we can get the edit start affairs and make some sellotape so we can put all our brainstorming yeah yeah like it guys this this little room the next bill is like perfectly soundproof so we're going to do a lot of hopefully I'll voiceover stuff you said he got a bit obsessed he

got these little squares of paper smella tape it's like storyboarding sweet okay with left mix house and we've come down to a little church group this is the project that they're involved with in mellenburg Tree of Life and yeah it's I'm not sure what to expect but I'm having to meet some cool people see what they're doing in this area and yeah just just tagging along really but this is cool and I also found out I don't know if you guys remember like I think that last year when I was in Cape Town I went to a project in yong-go and that's like actually the housing district like opposite Manon Berg so it's quite near that and they were doing the group I was visiting them were doing some similar projects as these guys are doing here so it's cool to see good things happening [Music] so

and to take you guys on the journey as well one of the big things that's going to be happening I'm gonna talk more about it and do a big announcement but we are doing an influencer a trip which is happening next month in writing some people down and we're doing yeah a bunch of cool things anyway I'll let you know more about that I'll let you know details but that's one of the things I'm planning and yeah I guess I will catch you tomorrow peace out enjoy life and live the adventure but 
so we the first thing carpet 360 were doing and it with the new fusion from from GoPro video we've got a few wing shots but this is the first proper 360 you should have probably done some earlier but we have the problem anyway look around right now guys it is like three big golden hour the Sun is saying we're ten thousand feet above the Pacific Ocean we are so far right now it's gonna get worse when we get to there it's gonna so what's in the apartment that's the furthest you can ever be from any land point that is her caught whatever that X's so I feel you guys we would have left early in the morning leaving us as much flight time it day like that because of paperwork delays I mean we are so grateful that we got to leave today at all but we left I don't know what was it woke me up 2 p.m. 3 p.m. we've got 1724 those coupons till we get to California - laughs 12 hours 12 hours that'll realistically come down we have realistically about 11 maybe 10 and a half hours left and both of that now is going to be flying through the night so it's a if the team I'm going to help keep JP awake if he needs to have a little naps I'll keep it on the extra bit but yeah I have like really excited we've been saying this whole time like it's like this it's like I don't know if it's like this open well make sense of excitement but then it there's like it kind of comes it goes and there's like this act feeling of anxiousness I can't even imagine how JP feeling right now like this is yeah it's a mix of emotion I feel very bipolar right now up and down like I have like these things sticking out of my ear cuz that's connected to the high frequency radio we have so that messes with my noise can't say and I keep hearing things and I keep thinking is something wrong but the airplane is actually running beautifully and also guys if you haven't watched any of the vlogs or you haven't seen what we've been up to this entire series firstly with luck with flying around the world this is the final leg to California secondly this dual tank was only just for head normally this plane has like another four seats right here but to fake this distance yeah we just had to fill the entire back of the flavored bill that's a lot of deal see my paranoia just kicked in [Laughter] when you when you like when you quantify what we're doing it gets crazy and then I need to like step back and run the calculations in my head again and be like it's totally doable this is so nice because I think because we have a bloated belly sunsets who don't like what free beginning we did a bunch but we have done it in a while [Applause] that's that your reflection I have so many shots off just water out of the window so where this time last night I was flying commercial rub-rub Koda Honolulu and I was just so like I had no idea all right I don't know whether we're gonna face likely but I know we're gonna bake it I was half expecting us to like be trying all day and only find out like last minute like find out this I was expecting me to push until 4:00 p.m. and it no girl and then we're running to the airport to catch a commercial play yeah guys it was like 7:00 a.m. we got the call the inspector had done their final bits of paperwork that would be wakeful for the last couple of days and it was like JP got the photos like yes I was like oh a sense of relief I don't know the cameras picking this up guys but the sky is just heard a whole sorts of amazing colors yeah my entire life when I've dreamt around about flying around the world I always dreamt about all the sunsets we'd see here we didn't really get many on this trip there it's definitely different I don't know why yeah it's the other side of the sky but it is different it is definitely enough and maybe it it feels like it the timings different by the way the time bit I think all those changes yeah I thought so think it's the temperature because it's always bomber yeah and then maybe has a bit of a happiness effect as well oh it's just so pink purple and the height does it's like orange yellow turquoise Wow [Applause] I just imagining the focus that we learn to California and I yeah you don't you shouldn't do hired we have five hours left it well realistically about ten and a half it just so it's really fills me with excitement like I feel like it's gonna be the Vice overwhelming focus of both of our lives definitely yours especially over like over over wealth like to the point where like you know we're not gonna know what's going on like is this gonna be your just overload our bodies it's gonna overload which would be like for what they I think make a peach is oh yeah I'm already tearing up I'm not kidding oh yeah it's very emotional to me yeah [Applause] 
[Music] [Applause] [Music] good morning guys is another beautiful day in Cape Town we have quite a cool day plan today basically we are teaming up with an organization called African impact and we're heading into one of the townships or communities and yeah seeing one of the projects they're running there so you're about to head off with the volunteers [Music] okay guys we have arrived in a Township called pi Lita and I am here with this is Olivia this is Liz and this is sandy who drove us here and my lecture is the biggest Township in Cape Town I think there's like 2.2 million people living here the only other bigger Township in South Africa is sureto in new Janice Bay and we've just arrived at this place some Sun where Billy save some knobby lay this is a like a play school and we're gonna be hanging out and seeing this project we have just met new Monday who runs this children's kind of play center and she was talking about how she's fostering a number of kids that have been abandoned as babies and through difficult kind of family situations and yeah it's just very powerful to hear what she's doing here you can see this she's very passionate about it and yeah we're just looking around this little building and seeing what's happening they're doing she's saying they also host like little after-school study sessions for the high school nearby and yeah she's just an amazing person and it's so cool that African impact has partnered with her to serve this community and to [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] Lancia Noir sound very similar sounds different so we've been playing some games and now we're doing this really cool exercise where the kids are cutting out words about themselves like positive words out this magazine is sticking them on these CDs like mirrors so you're kind of looking back and it's kind of representing who you are [Music] [Music] okay we we started doing clapping rhythms and now we're gonna turn the whole classroom into a dance boy shows your best dancing best dancing [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] had enough thank you ma'am [Music] okay guys we have just arrived at lions head and we're gonna hike up hope hoping to catch sunset but we might not we're back here with Alex and friend UJ and yeah I haven't been exercising at all yet we've got tomorrow we've got a first personal trainer appointment which it's quite a privileged position to have a personal trainer but I think I need that to get me in the routine anyway I think I'm gonna be sore after this hike and then after exercising for the first time in months tomorrow I'm already out of breath this is embarrassing yeah that is nice guys I probably mentioned this a million times but the Sun sets and Cape Town are in my eyes pretty unbeatable so we're just gonna enjoy the Sun for a bit we might make up in time yeah we've got we're getting top of that yeah what time's the sunset and it's gonna be very dark we're coming back down so I brought some that's gonna be the interesting part yeah [Music] we've still got a long way to go we're just about to leave the sunshine and head around this corner and like I said we might not make it to the top and time but this is still epic can't believe this is the first time I'm doing this [Music] you [Music] okay I've seen the first signs then use ladders chains and staples at your own risk so I think it's going to become a bit more of a crime than a hike at this point but I'm ready I'm actually surprised I'm feeling less out of breath than I thought would be our first step on the ladder that was such a fail guys I am useless I think so cool guys check out this view the clouds are rolling in Oh looks amazing okay there's a pretty constant stream of people coming down so it's gonna take a while for us to get to the top but I'm trying to find a little side route to scurry up the side so I don't need the ladders and stuff I was just thinking us arriving at the summit after sunset kind of sums me up really like there's no way well it's gonna be very rare that I'd do this for sunrise maybe I'll do it at once I'm often a big fan of sunset missions but knowing me as well I can't even do those properly and I often miss the sunset because my punctuality isn't perfect I think that's not ways a bad thing putting cases like this would have been pretty cool to see the sunset probably oh well there's always more opportunities to climb up again we made it yeah [Music] and those Instagram shots topping up our Instagram bank we've needed to yeah we've been inside in our apartment for most of last week's I haven't got many instagrams yeah [Music] it's mad innit I know this isn't even a big city compared to some of the metropolis of the world it's cool seeing it on the light as a backdrop to like an amazing mountain kind of thing this is such a good spot right we are heading back down yeah it's pitch black but we have we have torches so it's good I can imagine people have serious accidents coming back there [Laughter] [Music] all right it is dinnertime we have worked up an appetite for sure guys we just got sitting at like the best table here so it's out this is this is really really nice yeah this is like a magical kind of fairy garden we have actually been here before when we came before we had that table inside but this is this is an awesome table eart check it guys Mimi's shown up it's so good I start as arrived I've got some tomato soup this big steak I completely forgot to vlog like main course but the the desserts come out we're just sharing this chocolate program we're having very big courses we are we all have right back home guys it's been an amazing day it was so good to go see the projects entirely teacher and it was so good to get up lions head I can't believe it's my first time and then such good chats over dinner I'm buzzing and I'm really thriving here guys I just want you to know I'm feeling very good and I'm feeling very alive and very rested I'm looking after myself and something something else I haven't told you guys yet but I'm gonna I might mentioned it I'm gonna get into a healthy routine of fitness as well as like doing hikes up lions head and stuff tomorrow we're going kayaking with Ben's Atlantic outlook kayaking business that he started unfortunately he can't join cuz he broke his elbow but we're gonna be doing there we're gonna we're getting a personal trainer to help us kind of just get fit and yeah I'm seeing this time here it's just overall just very good for my well-being in general so a lot of you've been

cool spot so there's that cinnamon some cows okay first thing we need to do is find a cool spot to do the interviews if you don't know and you haven't been following the vlogs where I'm currently a third of the way through our flight around the world in our small plane believe the plane is getting some maintenance done in Austria right now so I'm just taking a few days out traveling around some neighboring countries and finding some cool stories and some cool things going on so yeah just about to hear some cool stories from Alaska and Melanie and yeah I think this is a good spot I just hope

a 10-hour boat to the island of Lesbos where I'm going to be visiting a refugee camp I think mainly Syrian refugees and get to meet people there it was amazing hearing a lot of Alaska's stories today and just kind of experience he's had and I think going to Greece and seeing kind of what's going on next I think that's probably one of the the biggest kind of countries for the refugees that the first place they're coming into anyway it's gonna be pretty incredible week I'm looking forward to it it's been an amazing time here as well and just after I sign out Mila Lascaux gonna film his first video on his YouTube channel which he's set up and you guys need to head over to that video now I'll link at the end of this video and basically in the comments what we're gonna ask is any questions you have to ask him as a refugee anything anything you want to know I think it would be fascinating so then he's gonna set up a Q&amp;A and he'll do that when I've left like he'll do that in the next couple of days and then you guys can also give him ideas of what kind of videos you love yeah would be tough so questions so I think he's I think I'm ready to answer anything yeah he's ready he's really nice he's not sure I asked away not in this video though head over to his video and then respond in his comments subscribe to him I'm just new and I'm gonna be coaching him and helping him with his channel and stuff also I'll link his Instagram below as well we can go and follow him there and yeah I'll catch you first thing in the morning it's interesting because I would love I would like to know what the people are thinking about what what kind of question then yeah he's interested I'm like sweet I'll catch in the morning guys peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys it's my second day here in Barcelona if you missed yesterday's vlog I flew here just for the weekend for the Mobile World Congress I've been invited here by Nokia mobile who are sponsoring today's vlog and I'm about to head into the main arena here and check out the setup they have they launched some phones yesterday that launched it's all very exciting and yes now I'm going to go look around see what other things are happening and yeah check out their there Nakia village which is like a big yourself they have no guys I got my badge we're heading in [Music] this convention is absolutely humongous probably took us like 20 minutes just walking through the convention system just to get here okay we found Eduardo and yeah this is the outside village right i've dropped my bag off and i'm going on the hunt for a bit food now antigen just to check out the conference to see some of the other things going on Sam Evans is here guys and I haven't seen him in ages so we trying to meet up with each other it's just like a billion people here feel like he's around here somewhere I can see him I can see him he's stealthy he's coming through the crowds yes Longman right I've taken sound to the nokia behind the scenes this is the this is the this is the coffee this is the best part yeah gods are hold off we didn't go for the Nespresso stuff I'm showing Sam some of the phones that and no key release yesterday and we were just saying with the banana phone either yellow or black but these phones are cool for like going away for the weekend if you don't want to be on Instagram the whole time short and sweet but we both gotta go and do some work now but we just been wandering around having a nice cat shot we're trying to find a time to hang out in the next like month or two and not leave it like it's over six months I don't know do you know who anyone laughs was LA I can't figure out when we lost or each other of it yeah to London good bye see you later yeah bro actually come here enjoy the rest of the week guys go and check out Sam he's making content for the rest of the weeks love you bro okay right back on it I think that's the funny thing with this industry when you're running around the world doing things and jobs and travels and stuff it's sometimes don't get to see each other because it doesn't quite you don't just you don't have that overlap of travel but we're gonna try and make an effort the next couple of hunts guys I'm doing a little tape over on the Nokia mobile Instagram account I think they're taking a funny photo of me holding up like the banana phone in the banana this is silly fun hey Louie aka Louis and I'm doing an Instagram story tape over the Nokia mobile account let's have a look around guys who just having a little look at the photo shoot we did that looks that looks legit I look like a model kind of maybe not [Music] guys it's really funny to me that because of Instagram stories and other social medias that like snapchat where people are consuming vertical video I know a few people now we're like they're filming everything in in vertical rather than landscape which irritates me a little bit because I think I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to like video stuff like I really think it should be consumed landscape but because everyone's like viewing videos and mobiles now I guess in a lot of ways this is unfortunately where we're heading with the video content is some of it will be in portrait so I don't think I'm going to be doing any time soon other than my Instagram stories on my phone I don't think I'm going to stop the filming on DSLRs and mirrorless cameras vertically but I do understand I do understand the need this is the CMO Pekka and I interviewed yesterday just want to show you how stylish is check out his new shoes going on a little hunt for some food I don't know if I've told you yet but because I've been concentrating my fitness and diet and stuff in Capetown my personal trainer you're very privileged to have a personal trainer but is there any way I'm gonna get any exercise any routine in my life anyway personal trainer who's also vegan gave me some advice to eat a lot more than I currently am saying that I need to be really eating like five meals a day not free and just consuming way more calories because I've got such a high metabolism and and also kind of vegan diets at typically less calorie high diets so I'm just yeah anyway point is I just need to eat all the time so do my best and I have spied to the blackboard which is exciting to me yes falafel guys this is so yesterday I did a couple of interviews I'm getting into the swing of it I'm about to interview Oliver from Zeiss and Zeiss make the lot of the camera lenses in the new Nokia phones and yeah we're going to talk about it now so guys this is pretty fascinating just trying to Oliver from Zeiss and he's showing you these little camera modules that go into the nokia six single lens and then the dual lens dual lens modules are going to be knocking seven plus and then the nokia a Scirocco and I can't believe it compact so much cool technology into just such a little module yes it's nice crazy it's like the ultimate spy camera yeah like imagine when we were kids and they're like yeah you can basically get like incredible 4k video footage from like a device is small finally getting to tuck into my falafel wrap oh so good I've got some Kabul a and some fruit as well we're trying to think of some fun clips we can make for the Nokia Instagram story have asked me to think of a thunder meringue so I came up the idea of taking three of the Nokia one handsets and trying to juggle them which might be a terrible [Music] doesn't be embarrassing I think I managed one like full completed juggle with the finds bucket dropping them here got told off I think the security guards are a little bit concerned yeah the lady was saying like the drop test is typically from kind of like like shoulder height but if I'm throwing them up in the air and they break then already meant for that it's as I did a bit of a thorough rundown of all the phones that Nokia released in yesterday's vlog I thought I wouldn't go back through all the phones today but I'd like to focus on the nokia 8 Scirocco it's their flagship and I've been hanging out with them today and just trying to figure out a way to do something for you guys so I convinced them to let me do a giveaway of one of these phones and just for those of you that are interested the specs are pretty high it's the 128 gig of on-board storage 6 gig of ram which is flippin massive at 12 and 13 megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel front camera and that's 4k video and 1080 on the front and then yeah like 2k display a Snapdragon 805 and yeah it's just an incredible piece of technology and guys just to give you a closer look this is made from stainless steel it's pretty beautiful with this form factor out it doesn't have a headphone jack it's bluetooth it's USB see it's yes it's it's definitely the most beautiful phone that not be released in my opinion and yes worth about $900 so I am going to post an Instagram so head over to that Instagram or link below and go and comment hashtag vlog giveaway then make sure you're following my account at fun flurry and Nokia mobile and then in the following week I'm going to select a winner this is a global competition and I will send you one of these new Nokia 8 siroccos so there you go guys I've managed to pull off something called for you guys as well okay

good morning guys me and Raya flying to Abu Dhabi today we have a 30 hour flight but thankfully because we're going there for work we're flying business class which I'm very excited about and we're flying via Tokyo so we're boarding our first right now and then we have a short layover and then we're heading on already been handed some orange juice before we take off managed to get a window seat unfortunately this is where I are sitting far away from me I'm literally all the way down there why we say putt for par okay and I guess we can get loads of work done this flight say okay you comfy [Music] and amazingly Phoenix a riotous like me there's a lady sitting here before I guess again she goes we're so much closer there's still another way but first thing we like really pathetic but we've just really enjoyed being back together after their wealth like this something about safe we're really enjoying it so Roya is having a deal with that have been editing the entire flight snap [Music] well flight log which is like a big deal like these logs take up to 10 hours then is there like lots of these to go through pretty happy and when we land I would have to show you how cool the toilets are in business boss okay so firstly they have a window louver the view it's pretty cool isn't it and then secondly check this out I've never seen this in a plane before this is like a bday I think ok I won't be able to demonstrate on the vlog but the options are a front wash for the women a soft wash or a backwash and then you've got different precious [Music] quite finished rendering on the fly so I'm carrying my laptop with me whilst we go through security of customs and checking in my next flight I'm hoping that upload once we're here at the airport good guys I'm pretty proud of myself I managed to convince them to let me take my laptop through the scanner it was still open she kept telling me to close yeah I was like really almost closed it cuz I don't want to like crash my render anyway I got your three still rendering we're just gonna find our gate now how was your flight protip you should try to sleep at the like time of your destination so I think it's like 10:00 a.m. and Abu Dhabi right now so it's kind of like I slept through the night yeah alright guys this is our flight I can't read Japanese but this is it the yh7 one gate 23 abu dhabi well that was quite the fiasco we've just been running around for lost hours two different lounges managed to upload my vlog thankfully I feel a lot calmer than I did an hour ago anyway um think we're boarding soon briar and me just got our names cooled out I think they need to check our passes or something and then I might grab a bite to eat before we head off in the next leg I think this is quite a long flight I think this might be like a 12-hour flight we are about to board I just want to show you guys these incredibly Japanese vending machines these are everywhere in Tokyo even like on the street they do ones which serve hot drinks which I'm sure I showed on my my last vlog in Japan thank you thank you very much thank you hello okay okay we're singing a little bit closer together to this flight still not as close as we could yeah I thinking we can watch some shows together I found out they have internet on the flight which is handli exciting to do some work famously I should probably sleep in this place I'll trying to get a couple of hours sleep what's this what the heck is this the table I love how different airlines have different ways of doing the table well that is a chunky table okay so Riya has suggested I do a review of the Etihad business class what do we think so far amazing service very pillows it's a massage thing have you found it it's not really muscles just like it's like a thing that's likely to pumping like pulsing my back which is pretty good [Music] this is the competition blanket [Music] [Music] it's nothing which is quite louder than I set up my iphone to record the audio hopefully that's a bit better than the camera audio that was capturing yeah so I've got my dad now nice little freak shutter to pass the dish I was impressed with a little quick basic math good flavor and yeah the thing I love the most now the bill is the coffee is like tropical thank you right I got six hours left to the flight I've been working pretty hard I did watch a movie I watched em come Island skull skull island King Kong some of us it was pretty epic it was pretty epic anyway to continue my review again I'm very new to this so they really know I'm doing but I thought I'd check out the the bathroom it's a little bit different from bathrooms in economy class which might normally fly this is an exception this business class flight anyway the main thing I noticed two things right firstly same as the other plane were in there's a window I already see anything because it's nighttime anyway again nice view unlike the other plane there's a few more things this toilet has it has some alcohol antibacterial gel I guess this is just so some hand cream and my favorite it has facial mist now I'm gonna be honest here I've never tried a facial mist before in my entire life so give us a guy I've decided I'm gonna try the bed out I'm gonna try and get a few hours sleep gonna have a little look in the toiletry bag that I requested this wasn't given out as a standard thing what we got here we have oh pretty nice face mask this feels like really soft material I'm gonna put that on pair of sleeping silks travel socks are they they're gonna wear those that's it there is a pair of slippers as well that all I'll show you when I wake up nice right now I'm just gonna reply the chair Oh let me just shuffle up a little bit Oh are the ghosts completely flat come on come on baby but the light goes off as well that's pretty cool I also be sitting on the pillow very comfy pillow as I was saying earlier and yeah facemask time right see you in a couple of hours might wake up I guess to have some breakfast or something Abu Dhabi we've arrived it's Matthew that's me I'm just waiting for my girlfriend she's is coming you've arrived to our hotel and then we have a little car a little golf cart this is cool I don't know where we go in [Music] well this is epic we have our own pool and the beach is right there that it's very cool [Music] yeah I had one of those chairs [Music] we have one of those chants so that has got to be one of the longest days of travel I think I've ever done it it seems like we left were Bryant I said actually we we are going to bed he'll at 5:00 a.m. and she just checked her fiber she set an alarm for 5:00 a.m. before this morning where it was actually two days ago whenever we left whenever we left to go into the airport to come amidst these couple of flights to get here it was 5:00 a.m. technically two days ago anyway I'm confused we're gonna have an amazing few days in Abu Dhabi we're gonna be yeah seeing the sights doing a lot more than that I did it last time when I was here on the world flight by the way we haven't seen that video if you haven't seen that collection of videos I think they've blown you can click at the end or whatever and yeah we're gonna be doing a lot more and seeing a lot more and I'm excited to take you guys along for the journey all right see in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure 
[Music] good afternoon guys it's a very late start to the day's vlog I don't even know if I'm gonna have to film an inside look today because the Sun is kind of already saying but we have come all the way to Abu Dhabi we were in Dubai this morning as you know we've delayed our flight to India for another day in fact we may be flying to Pakistan now I think that's the current plan well you have also met with JC he has come from France to join us to help film which is gonna help with the documentary stuff because now like if it's gonna be a bit more accurately I don't know that what we want is that this is a journey of me and JP traveling around the world and it's been difficult so far because either me or JP have been filming other than when we got the GoPros rolling but I think this will be a lot better for that kind of capturing the this real spirit of what we're doing and and also upping the cinematography game anyway we have just arrived at just an insane architectural spec spectacle which is the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi check this out this is absolutely insane so I didn't have the appropriate attire on so they've given me a cloak I don't know they call these in in Morocco they call these Gela birds but I don't know they called here anyway I've got my own cloak to cover up my arms and legs JP was Oh cozy he had trousers and a t-shirt on say he was very respectful wait I think we've lost jay-z I don't know what they're making him wear yes for her are we twins so good so good we've managed to find a way to the entrance like I said before this is incredibly extravagant oh this is the photo [Music] I love how clean it is it's so satisfying it's like literally squeaky clean it reassures me that you appreciate it because it means that we have some connection imagine it was like now that I live it it's good it's like minimal but also beautiful like it's still ornate and yeah it's like the perfect very pure I even like things like how the pattern is just on the borders but in the middle of the floor is just completely white tiles it's like not too cluttered but just a little bit alright I've just had to take my shoes off to go into the next section so guys someone told me that the top of these pillars is coated in real gold and that's pretty impressive because there are a lot of pillars here [Music] the [Music] this is mind-blowing the the decoration look at all the world if that chandeliers are as epic [Music] this chandelier is is quite something so colorful all of this is just so so impressive what dragon JC I find even more impressive than these big fancy chandeliers is if you look behind the chandeliers is this incredible like marble carvings on these um oh these like ceiling panels whoever they are I know on the dome up there like that it looks just as cool at night [Music] back at the hotel or we're doing there we're doing a room service party yeah you're doing a room service dinner party oh I need to hit there I need to hit the jacuzzi as well thank you oh hello you brought us all the food fantastic it's time for a dinner party would you like to stay and eat with us [Laughter] wow this is good fantastic I should have got fries in all honesty ot fight oh wait did this level come with flat price Oh perfect no makes me so happy oh that's a small portion yeah plenty of food confuse those confuse his deceit like FFA the Leno suit comes in an extra drug but that's just old that's all the mushrooms wait which is which they it's very similar color isn't it odd that's mushroom and that's little this is Linda okay perfect okay nice nice JP is just getting fries and milkshakes well today's been a pretty short vlog but it's been important for us to rest up and for JP to do all the intricate planning he's needed to do for the next couple of flights I don't know I was saying earlier or yesterday but it's been pretty complicated trying to fly into India one of the things JP was telling me today is that because there's not many planes that take the fuel that we need called F gas in India it means they now have that fuel anywhere so some of the airports we wanted to fly into we can't because we wouldn't be able to refuel so yeah quite complicated stuff that I would just never think about and hopefully we've started resolving some of those problems and like I said earlier the the first way that we've sold some of them is actually stopping him Pakistan first which was something we were planning from the beginning of the trip and I'm so glad we've managed to make it happen yeah I cannot wait for tomorrow even though it's a super early start my god only gonna get like two hours sleep or something but yeah I'm really really pumped and yeah I don't know I think there's a slight worry because I've heard Pakistan is in the safest place especially certain areas but I think the area we're going into these preach Hill I'm hoping we can connect with some of you guys anyone washing from Pakistan obviously these vlogs are simplistic behind but I'm gonna do it all we Instagram story tonight see if we can connect with anyone and hopefully get to explore and connect with and experience some of the culture there even though I think we're gonna be there for two days but it'd be really nice to - yeah to experience a new country this would be somewhere on the trip I haven't been before most of the places I have yeah like I said I'm really pumped this could be great and it's also great to have Jacy joining us he was getting some awesome shots today I hope you enjoyed those he's got the 1dx most of stuck with shootings on this ad but he said please can I bring my 1px and the the main advantage of the Canon 1dx is that you can shoot 4k at 60 frames a second so you can get that smooth slow by high res super high res so I'm happy about that and as I say it's gonna bring the extra element and dynamic cinematic element to to the documentary he's very talented on the link of stuff below you can check him out and it's good to have him part the team for the next couple of weeks so these those guys are asleep I'm gonna go and grab some sleep as well and we will see you very very early in the morning peace out enjoy life Olivia Adventure [Music]

a.m. we've been working all night at Ang's thanks for staying up so late in helping us Ange and Bridget and Amanda and the whole LTA team just to get this trip sorted there's so many things you don't think about and which one I like relaunch the whole live the adventure website tomorrow we're trying to just liaised with people who are still kind of flying in and over the next couple of days it is crazy guys and yeah I just I think I've slightly underestimated how much work it is to put on an influencer trip and like I'm saying earlier yeah 10 big influences I'm gonna show you a little bit of the kind of packs that we sent out to people and then I'll tell you who's actually coming tomorrow and then yeah you can just get a bit of a vibe of what sir what we're trying to do so here's this pack I sent out last month so they live the adventure for good trip and I'm gonna read a bit of this to you now just to let you know a bit of the vision behind what I want to be doing so live the adventure is not only a great attitude towards life but a growing community of passionate creators in addition to inspiring others to travel and explore the vision of live the adventure is to create a support system for influences to pursue their dreams and to be a force for social change this is very important space being at the heart of a sometimes toxic industry which can be hard to navigate through this community has become a safe space to share and courage and dream together about how we can impact the world in incredible ways we have hosted trips with creators through you through the United States and Europe and held international events this March right now we are planning our most exciting trip yet 10 of the world's biggest influencers are joining us on an incredible journey for Africa we search for as we search for adventure discover amazing social good projects and discuss ways to support each other's future goals and to make the world a bit better place together so there you go that's kind of my dream for these trips that we're doing as you know we've held a couple of summits and we've done a few trips in the past kind of after VidCon a couple years we did some cool road trips through California then we did this Sylvania trip and Italy and stuff at the beginning of last year but for me I want to just scale everything do bigger things connect with new people so some of the influences coming over the next couple of days as we start this this whole trip I haven't actually met before but I've been talking online and that's the great thing about having this big online community as well we're kind of connecting with people all around the world and through YouTube or Instagram or whatever social networks anyway so I'm super excited and I'm about to show you guys now who who's coming so on this trip we have me riah Sam colder if you don't know Sam colder get to know him incredible cinematographer make some of the most visually stunning stuff on YouTube Helen Owen Aggie these are some of Rhys friend she's made this year tour instagram nash grier absolute legend we've never met but we've talked a lot online his girlfriend Taylor Chelsea Zac and Michael I think actually yeah I think we've got couples here are basically we've got a bit of a couples trip going on so yeah we're gonna be meeting with most of the people tomorrow there has been some delays with the snowstorm in Europe so a few people have been stranded and a few last-minute flights booked but yeah tomorrow is the beginning of this epic trip guys and I cannot wait to have a whole series on the channel it's been a bit of a slow start to the year as you know with my vlogs it's been a bit of random it's been a bit kind of you know Chris chilling but as of tomorrow buckling in it's gonna be a crazy crazy time and also everyone else is gonna be making awesome content as well I'm gonna link everyone's stuff below so you can check them out know them and yeah I yeah I would love to know what you think guys about this idea of doing these influencer trips and putting a deeper meaning into it all obviously we're doing it with we're having incredible experiences doing this beautiful trip bol so this is deeper meaning and purpose to it all as well so let me know what you think below guys and also let me know what you think we could be doing as they live the adventure team beyond these trips the summit's I've been doing and if you don't know we're also managing other influences as the agency in in this kind of online space but I want to be doing so much more and we've got a great team down here in Cape Town and yeah I'm just very excited and it's been so good bonding being down here in Cape Town over the last kind of six weeks - yeah just to kind of really work on that and yeah I just want you to guys to know there's a lot of exciting things happening and this is the most exciting thing right now anyway I better get some sleep it's gonna be a lot of early mornings a lot of late night vlog edits so I will catch you in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure 
[Music] good morning guys it's bright and early is 7:30 a.m. I woke up and left Vienna about an hour ago and I'm back in being a noise stat which is where the plane has been for the last week getting some maintenance done I'm sure if you've been watching my vlogs you've probably forgotten that we're flying around the world but we are playing around the world and today we head off on the next leg now I think the plan is we're gonna be getting to Crete and Greece which is fun except just been in Greece but we're heading back to Greece and then tomorrow heading all the way to Egypt which is pretty exciting so I'm I've just been dropped off and I'm walking to go and find JP who's with the plane just getting ready yeah we're gonna set up pretty excited to be back in the air and continuing our trip and she is a fan of Louie yeah and we're back with Balu she's looking pretty clean they clean her nicely and I'm gonna take the cowling off in a second but one of the big things I need to do is update the database on the GPS we've settled up yeah I need to go and get Balu fueled and ready this is cool there's some amazing planes there okay guys when we flew in here last week Micky joined us he's a pilot here your training here right yes and he's also come to see yourself which is very kind of him and we brought us some snacks to take with us that apparently these are traditional Austrian snacks so there's this wafer kind of chocolate wafer thing Mahesh Newton which man Manish Newton which is vegan apparently and also this string which we haven't tasted yet but this looks incredibly Austrian look at those two it's finally time to depart thanks bro yeah yeah we've got a six-hour flight too wait JP tell us tell us the plan what's the plan today classified a Crete in Greece 6-hour flight probably one of the most intense IFR routes I've ever done yeah it's gonna be a long day and we know nice ground November two one zero gain your phone request taxi to the active all right you ready yeah let's do that breeze bro yeah power set temperatures and pressures are good and she's fine dear later Austria in real this is exciting feedback that's good to see again is up all right so we're we're just able an out of vino nice step and still on a VFR flight plan right now they got me climbing to a waypoint and then I'll pick up my life are there that was easier than I expected within the uniform are you ready for your clearance zurich uniform we're already coming back uniform kirisaki unbiased as well flight plan truth climbed nine thousand feet and - start passing extensity [Music] a uniform pieces hands 9,000 feet now down at 9,000 pounds Erick this autopilot 9400 yeah I'm not a supporter now my autopilot isn't working sir about that well it's pretty healthy tonight of those are you able to do that yeah currently down in that house now they screwed up at the Python I think that the altitude hold which is what what would swell or anything good on this airplane that's not working altitude control it was I they just disconnected that I don't know Odie this is gonna make my trip so much or art I can't believe it like that is so aggravating if they like take it apart to try and think then I just did put it back together or something I don't know what they did but they troubleshot out to find the problem which cost so much more heroes and then now they must have not put it back together properly [Music] me and autopilot is a big safety tool and for most single pilot I far single I of our pilots this wonderful place that we were that for charging 300 euros to clean the plane which is insane they didn't put this thing back together because the altitude Hall does not work which means I need to know how to fly this airplane [Music] I've got a cupcake if you want it I'm good with food I got to do vegan cupcakes you can have the two vegan companies okay guys we have been grounded for a week into maintenance done but we're finally back on our trip and with JP we are currently flying over Serbia heading towards Greece today and it's so good to be back I can't believe I'm flying over Serbia never in my life did I think I would be highlighting an airplane over Serbia so many memories here cruising along at 9,000 we're not a top flight level today I believe we've changed over to another country god I'm not sure which one [Music] wow this is the fascinating border do we have a suitable piadina I have a bag here okay but if you need to go well somebody might have to crawl to the back to grab another bag no I do I can hold it how long do we go two hours yeah well that fountain there is high yeah that's big that's gonna throw us around the point is coming to record that looks the same height as up it's higher well not gonna show red on the radar oh yeah you're actually right I've seen the wrong implications here it does look it does look higher oh yeah [Applause] at my hotel I didn't know Greece have such big mountains wait oh yeah we Greece now yeah oh my gosh I'm having the best time today I don't know why like that what a pilot situation the socks are you still pretty happy yeah I'm enjoying my flight and I'm enjoying like the scenery and everything that's good and you fly for a bit and then I'm gonna try and pee yeah all right follow me let's just finish this pop okay okay so just keeping it more or less in that direction that's not too serious what's more important is the altitude okay if we get bad two months now there's pee everywhere oh it's kinda tempted just to like another me like I'll be so bad II just climb really quickly so what we were actually like going down really quickly then because they're not happy in my face [Laughter] [Music] while I wait to pick line right yep yeah but that that isn't too accurate you're trying to keep the desire track the same as the true track all right that that's kind of pretty way off then a little bit you did okay I'm more impressed with the altitude think it are just full of everything right but now that's what precise enamel though I need to go way right then right yeah oh crap I'm surprised like I did the whole piece maybe you should become a pilot I think you can be a pilot as long as it's like local fine yeah but if you if you had wanted to do long-distance serious flying it I think that anybody can change you might you might become really discipline for flying I just keep the rest of your life as it is who knows I'm just having a really good flight today I don't know why it's just really good yeah I think it's nice because we're flying the wards war warps as well maybe but I think I think a part of me is awesome it's cool that it's back to the team [Music] Wow so cool imagine just sailing and just sailing into all these round of little phase yeah that would be fun I think I would enjoy is love sailing trip we haven't had a lot of like really clear days yet a lot of days have been hazy and it will just get worse from out yeah like the Middle Eastern Star and East Asia humid Indonesia well it's pollution as well I mean India for example apparently like people were five in India the reason why you need an instrument rating over India is because it's a great weather it's just that it's like it's its instrument conditions which is the same though on our left here guys is one of the most famous Greek pilots it's very popular at the moment with tourists stopped already I think that's pretty cool they're just cruising by Santorini that's venting doing its thing that's off we're on the left tank I'll keep that open let's start strapping in here in Iraq in town I've ever - I'm very careful with you on the aren't have to 7 all this kayak isn't cliff jumpers and oh my god this water looks so good there's a cave holy you don't want to up the shoe this rough I do know you have no little friction hurt a lot of how you have the terminology down dude yeah undershoot let's look perfect word all righty come on I can do better than that I'm just flying it all the way oh nice directly on that's cool I'm stoked to be here whoo good job that was a good fight really good yeah now I'm glad I stayed awake after like it's nice just to do that first flight again together yeah definitely made it less lonely how you feeling bro her increase stoked it's warm very wanna be like short ads and channels and go and jump in the water everywhere like massive airliners guys alright just landed in the Arachne on Greece beautiful the epic arrival into here was beautiful planning with but shitty work on that and yeah we're here I'm stoked I'm actually so freaking happy like to the core which is happiness right now we're gonna go grab a hotel which is like an a B&amp;B I think just over there 7f minutes 7-minute drive yeah Park up the 210 and tomorrow itself to Egypt [Music] we've arrived we're so close yeah look we literally flew past our hotel so just throwing our bags in our room and we're just coming down to jump in a sea before the Sun Goes Down kind of perfect timing really and me and JP like interest in the best mood ever I just I couldn't be happier right now so good yeah literally that's what we flew [Music] it's actually just like chillin look at it it's even like looking at you like just rest its head look you're sassy it's been yeah it's been a good day and tomorrow we are flying to Egypt which is gonna be interesting I think that's gonna be the first country where we could potentially run into challenges getting in or you know explaining why we're flying into Egypt in this tiny plane so hopefully all go smoothly catch you guys in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys welcome to corfu greece we got here yesterday it's a very spontaneous trip and tomorrow we're taking a couple of days off by thought I'd show you a little bit of the island

to paradise oh my gosh freshen up a little bit and now we're going for a bit of explore around the island I'm glad we've got a car because I think that quite a zombie island we're going to want to talk we have found our way to the main town and coffee is that this big thought up there and we're just going to have a little scroll through the streets maybe find a little coffee Oh basically lovely is very warm such good temperature isn't it yeah I can't believe it's 6:30 and it's like hot like I feel like midday this is where we just parked up the old port square and this is where we've just walked in plus the venetian barracks and the new fortress and we're heading into old town [Music] so we've heard rumors of a bakery that does quite be vegan option and it's not quite dinner time they have dinner very late here in in Greece but we are going to go and have a little snack though coffee I this is like a tiny little church power oh I said that so many times but I just loved building that kind of slightly you know you can tell they're kind of not pristine and tell they're quite old and they're like maybe falling apart a little bit like all the plaster and the side falling down I love that exposed brickwork so beautiful correct me if I'm wrong but I think this may be the first proper time I've been in Greece on my vlogs so hello to all my Greek viewers that you enjoy our experience in Corfu obviously is a lot of Greek island and the mainland and I'm guest every was a little bit different but and this place is already looking pretty fascinating and I've heard that some gems around the islands we need to go to some like secret beaches and stuff well we only just got here in time but we managed to get a cheeky little apple pie thing from starry neo bakery and heels it said they have like eight different types of savory vegan pies so maybe we'll have to come back another day as well and check those out alright we're going to sit down now chill sweat [Music] happening but they're attacking my drain really badly like it won't even move it's saying like obstacle avoidance no way oh I've got pretty hot to go you're going to talk like you like glass through the bed we're getting into it I think so yeah it's darling they're going to it why is it [Music] [Applause] all right we're going to see if we can get a table with this roof garden for dinner and I only get my coffee and get a cup here they're not having me going in with my best top my tank top so I'm walking down to buy a t-shirt from somewhere and they've said if I have a t-shirt with sleeve then I'll be allowed in fact this does happen occasionally to me Spitz is trading all right I've decided to go for a white long-sleeved kind of canvas t-shirt kind of summery should should work quite well what do you think guys good choice I don't often do white shirts because they get dirty so easily but I feel like holidaying on a Greek island you kind of need to have these kind of clothes also I feel like this will be a bit more Aries and a normal like dress shirt so I shouldn't get too crazy hot yeah I can out like a look do you think hey you like my shirt [Music] we could get this kind of like our anniversary dinner oh yeah Oh perfect timing Jenna is arriving oh yes please thank you good as I mentioned this is our anniversary holiday and this is our first proper anniversary dinner so I feels like it cuz it's so like nice this is pretty romantic location like I can't even believe it also right we thought is going to be in theme excitement like 10 Europe yeah that is crazy they shorts abishek caught me 40 years just to get in to have image they kind of balance is that right we're just having our does they're having a nice little vegan chocolate souffle and I ordered sorbet and it came out on a glass like a smoothie and how's that oh it's just a smoothie but it's not it's actually just saw back in a massive glass as a destroyer this is try to obey but it's not like it's moving it's just like whoa Wow okay in Greece if you're going to order sorbet this is what it's going to look like right head back to my head Indy we just parked up look what car is parked next to us isn't it glorious they stand next set Bowie I'm telling you and not fit in this is not the car it would if you were significantly smaller it was just funny no your head would have liked it would you'd have to have the convertible down because you had to go there I'm going to get his : day no good I think it's a fear I think it's a Fiat 100 that Fiat 100 we are back at our Airbnb and I am really looking forward to taking a couple of day in dot skies I know I've been taking the odd day off I'm not vlogging every single day but it's rare that I will switch off completely and like turn my phone off but we're going to take a couple of days off completely off the grid no phones no internet and just to have some quality time together and I think that's quite an important thing to do and I want to make more space in my life for that more regularly and hopefully I'll feel a little bit more rejuvenated and refreshed and ready this month is has already been a bit relaxed I mean I was ill for a few days but I mean I want to just keep things calm this month because obviously next month we're leaving on the world flight it's going to be crazy and I'm not going to see much of riot either whilst and traveling around the world so yeah I'm going to try and make as much space this month this month as I can for that and yeah we're going to have some pretty crazy adventures soon don't worry I'll catch you soon guys peace out enjoy life the adventure but 
hey guys I am filming a very exciting video today i am doing a collaboration with ancestry DNA they are sponsoring this video and for those of you that haven't heard them they are a service which take a DNA sample and then they use kind of advanced science i don't really know how it works but they predict your genetic ethnicity and they tell you where you're from essentially so I'm really excited it takes a few weeks it takes like six to eight weeks for the process to happen so conveniently six to eight weeks ago me and my dad sat down and you can see us doing the test you have to spit in a little vial but anyway yeah this is what happened oh there's quite an intensive instructing my instructions there's a big tube that's the black line it's you're gonna have to sit every 10 minutes like generating spit oh here we go do not eat drink smoke or chew gum for 30 minutes or we did just have a cup of tea what about a chocolate I'll just take another look guns in it oh oh oh good so here's the black line that's the level we have to spit up to there's a lot of spin that's quite a lot hell over it it's this thing boy I think we're going to put that in it and on it we're all a sterilizing lick fluid so it doesn't go off oh wow okay all right so we spin it first and then we add the stabilizing fluid Lois I'm nearly there because it's not the talking get on with it yeah all of it in one deposited Oh what how do you do that also now or something look how far over the line that I managed you know this with how did I spell or something so simple respecting the vials we've shaken them up a vial on mate and there's an important code on you yeah and now we're going to go on punching the code they can track that this is my spit nobody else's and then we're going to put them in these boxes send them off and then you'll find out we'll all find out where are where we're from where do you think you are from there I mean what's your guess okay so I'm guessing I'm guessing a good shot guy Scottish UK so I don't know whether there's a breakdown alright a Scottish line yet England UK Scotland I think that then I think a bit a tiny bit Irish maybe there is are I think I'm about and eight Irish so my dad has done a lot of researching into our family history he's probably he's probably got a bit more of an idea of where our ancestors came from but I heard a bit of Sweden maybe we in my have swedish we've yet to connect with Sweden but I think the Swedish a bit of German or Russian Russian I think that's on your mum's side okay so you're going to have you know the good make so let put these in the bags now and then you have to write your name you have to get the code on the yeah and then we'll we'll find out we'll find out shortly okay done alright you can send these off now so it's pretty easy we just sent off that little bottle with a saliva sample ancestry DNA ran it through their systems analyzed it they actually have over four million other DNA samples millions of family trees and billions of historical records and yet they have this advanced kind of DNA science that they used to send me back hopefully a pretty accurate prediction of where I'm from and I've seen a few other videos but people do this it's pretty exciting to be able to do it now with you guys as well I'm hoping to do it my dad as well he's not with me here but when I get back to the UK and I'm sitting down in my dad I would do this with him as well I had asked him not to check his his like results yet so we're going to do that together in a vlog like in the future okay here we go oh I can do my DNA matches as well what maybe I can find relatives I never knew ahead oh my gosh this is amazing okay so 58% Europe West thirty percent Irish and four percent British what four percent Scandinavian Sweden Norway and Denmark that's the Viking and great-great-great-grandmother from Swindon four percent Iberian Peninsula no way that's like now Spain Spain and Portugal what and there is the tiniest bit zero percent Finland Northwest Russia but there must be like maybe that just means less than one percent it's saying only four percent Great Britain so there's these regions here if you can see on the image here that covers Great Britain but also found in Ireland France Germany Denmark Belgium Netherlands Switzerland Austria Italy but then it seems to put most my DNA kind of genetic heritage to Europe West which I think there is this overlap okay let's little bit further down so we've got 30 percent island okay there you go that's why thirds you San Island also includes Wales and Scotland so as you can see this is like big rings around the kind of regions that it is a text and I guess the more that people that log on and submit their DNA the more accurate they'll be able to get a because the database is going to be a lot bigger so I guess my DNA links with a lot of these orange dots here this is where my mum Tyler the family's from I'm actually a McGregor while not on a Gregor but my mom's side of the family is McGregor as much as my clan this is the ring I'm confused about the 4% from Spain and Portugal I guess this doesn't make sense it's overlapping Western Europe England all of this and then this I knew about knew I had this connection in Norway and Sweden so this is a complete puzzle I honestly came into this been a bit coffee thinking yeah I've got a pretty good breakdown I know where from my parents give me a lot of information about my kind of relatives but this is mind blowing like there's just whole regions and it just didn't know us from like folks from Spain and stuff that's mad let's go back to my mum and dad and say we're your family history is a Spanish for Portugal connections so cool I cannot wait to sit down my dad and look at his because it's I want to know whether the the Spanish cultural connections and my dad's side or my mum's side I guess we'll be able to find out there you go guys my ancestry DNA results that was actually really fascinating to find out about my genetic heritage and I would highly recommend you go and do it yourself and see where you're from even if you're confident like me that you know you probably don't know so yeah check out ancestry.com forward slash Louie Cole and that'll get your 10% discount I think it's $99 to do and yeah like you saw it's pretty easy to spit in that little bottle send it off six to eight weeks later you'll be able to check your results too and if you want to post videos and share your results like I have include like hash tag my ancestry and tweet years up I'll try and check out some of your guys and you post them and yeah hopefully the more of us that do this the more accurately we can see where we're from and also maybe find distant relatives we didn't we have so you can click my link in the description or on the end screen here and yeah hopefully we'll be making another video similar to this in a few weeks time with my dad and who knows maybe we'll find some other fascinating things about our genetic history alright catch go see peace out enjoy life and live the adventure the 
[Music] good morning guys I'm in New York I'm heading out tonight before I do I've got to do things to stall out and collect from B&amp;H if you didn't see yesterday's vlog we were doing some training with pH cameras on yeah just some different cameras and filming styles and techniques and stuff with any of you into some camera stuff you might have enjoyed those if you are so you might not but yeah and if you don't click do you think one of the big things I'm getting today which is quite a big deal is I'm actually going back to using a MacBook Pro if you saw my vlog from about a month ago or six weeks ago I traded in my macbook for a Dell XPS 15 because I heard it was a lot more powerful and better specs and I bit the bullet was like yeah I'm going back to PC but I really regret my choice and I'll explain why later but yeah the tough call but I yeah going back to Mac so I'm going to go pick up a macbook pro a few other little things i need for the trip and yeah or just chill to the peopling really haven't made many plans okay then right I picked up some MD filters for the Mavic for those of you that don't know nd fillers are no no the exact science behind it but it means I won't get like crazy overexposure and lose the the right you know in the bright things I don't have you see some white blobs would have been like in really sunny condition quality luckily the quality in the white could have blown out - grab two of these they were there black and blue so I've got some little portable drive this is the the kind of thing I need like a big rage systems like 810 massive hard drives which could potentially go up to like 80 terabytes of a long-term on utilities okay this picks up a little bag my laptop just burning around coffee shops on a day powered and now I am going to fire a dongle to give me all these cool that Apple took away from the new mother price guys before I am open the laptop get excited I'm just checking out some of the other gear that B&amp;H are loaning us for the well flight including as you saw the other day I was talking about there the 12 to 24 Sony lens this is going to be incredible for the for the wide views in the cockpit and stuff JPS got an a7 r2 so at the moment I think the cameras are going to be bringing is - a7 s T's and 287 artis for some photography as well obviously one of the things with the Kickstarter when we raise money for the world flight was print and eBooks that photo that were going to be taking along the journey so piece of an ST doesn't always cut it for regulation so this should be pretty awesome and then we've got an rx100 mark 5 for covert filming and to be honest quite a lot filming we could do on it so you can film 4k 4 think of five-minute period and also ultra slow mode so it's gonna be fun playing with that again and also we've got 2 x converter for the 70 to 200 gmask the lens that we have with JC's taken with him oh yeah I might have forgotten to mention JP left early this morning to drive back to Toronto so I'm going to take some of this stuff with me and then this is our big bag for equipment on the plane and maybe this will ship to California so we cannot pick it up when we get there here we go nope or is it luckily I've got I've got a few centuries including this guy this gives you three standard USB HDMI Ethernet USB C micro SD and SD card and that's now just like that so it's resolved a lot of the problems and criticisms I had when I slept when it first came out it looks like a lot slimmer than the old one that I Lisa got a headphone jack nice yeah much bigger trackpad isn't it oh it's going to be nicely back on a Mac I've missed it okay so I've got this little bag that I just bought it's like a cheap little laptop bag for running around it's nice you may think that there's nothing else no I don't think so I'll take that's it minimal cool right go the bag I don't know so just a son are throwing the 12 to 24 and my camera just to blog Watson's game at the hotel a little look at the different a real-world test I think I would call for like any boarding around and stuff any themes where I want to show a bit of the environment on it obviously the wider kind of the wider the better and this is the same aperture is my current 15 to 35 I've actually weirdly met chemicals is a convenient way to get around [Music] I don't really think of New York having held but there are road with joy England ignite though thankfully the whole way back to my hotel is down here some disproved so I think which is going to be my little workstation for the next few hours it's in the lobby of the hotel that I was doing in last night it's pretty nice pretty cool spot power Internet and so one of the things about being the Malick is I don't have an address to get things posted to occasionally I can get some closure to my parents if I'm in the UK but right now and I needed a few items so I got them I went on Amazon yesterday got Amazon Prime delivery overnight to the hotel and you're going to last one of the things I got deliver so I'm just opening one of the books is now a typical double XL motorbike helmet and this is for the jet boarding the Jets des boarding that we're doing across the English Channel in a couple of weeks and you know one of the big things I had a problem with was that I couldn't find a helmet that fitted so I'm really hoping that xxx Delphis me oh yeah this is a perfect fit I have to thing under phyto-drip what event love it break your head thank you I just jumped in the ego and are there Brooklyn I sit back you know I like that and and you know like a nice fight to them where other people try to hit you you know hit was he let him hit what you make sure you know the back step and then you hit you know like the identity then come back didn't come back tried right and Jane I didn't have like one of the most interesting overrides in my life I guess met that guy the driver from the porn Emily died she couldn't be the whole time we have incredible conversation about his life and he grew up in a little village Nepal commandement safer maybe we'll get to hang out and like ether Development Manager to Portland oh so we corner check it out final call oh my god probably how long that theory so guys I've been trying to find a space full day to tell you about the del and why I'm going back to the Mac so I've jotted down little little things that irritate me all that I just straight out problem with either windows or the Dell machine some of them I'm not sure what the problem is and these are these all the reasons why I'm going back to the Mac paper plates firstly with the old machine or Windows is crazy saturated like the screen I can't edit photos on as you enter the color profile at the try and like I spent probably two hours trying to either color profile to look like a Mac monitor or my iPhone or any you know it's look normal and then when I restore the machine it resets the color profile every time because I think the dark again that's why it's number one happy okay so secondly previewing files in on a mattress though you just hit pay for and you can just hit the down here wherever you can just go through a whole folder of whoever songs or video and you can play the song whole for free and skip to the next look windows doesn't have a built-in function to do that does have a quick preview function like that download some kind of plugin and even then I have to like it often crashes I have reload it and you can preview files in a similar way but then you can't scroll down what lifting off it or it's done so it just made my whole process a lot lengthier even though maybe the render time was faster maybe maybe it had more power more RAM but the process was just adding so much time on do everyday I had stopped we're constantly crushing on the Mac that's very rare again I don't know why it was crushing that I probably reached on my machine every couple of day and would think going back to rendering video is when I mean on perfecting on rendering at the intros I would render them in Pro res and I didn't point out until let me quit out and then point out until I got the PP that you can't render in Pro res from a beauty which again I was struggling point an alternative way of rendering with low enough file sizes with filter quality video I can find an alternative though I ended up today do they care having to explore from artifact and Adobe Media encoder at h.t.t.h the physics full MPEG anyway the whole thing they'll appoint so many ways to deal with my problem and I found the Latian both of them but very convoluted and unnecessary another thing this is definitely with a dowel machine somehow from listening to a movie I managed to blow the internal speaker in the in the laptop I don't know how it was allowed scene of explosions but a laptop should never be built with the ability to blow the internal speaker there should be some kind of ability to limit the audio going into those likely a boolean or whether the game I just shot though I'm out the blows so it just makes farting noise now whenever I listen to another simple problem with just being up the drag files from Windows Explorer into the software I want if they whether it's a picture into a very light room or videos you know whatever it was it's not as easier than a Mac you can just drag it in to the taskbar and it was loads of software you have to hold it and make sure it's in the right place to lay others it beings differently and then finally I found that just playing the video files whether in YouTube or you know with web video software like DLC we would pitch it would have little glitches around try and play back the video knuckle laughing I'm going to mention and though though the reasons why although the new Magna Pro might not be as powerful the process and the fluid kind of used into place and the speed at which I can things that makes up for the fact that it doesn't have as much RAM and might not be as helpful there you go guys buckle down filtration anyway as of tomorrow there's no more geek towards no more cameras or I'm going to be landing in Paris being a liar gang a campervan and we are road tripping down to Mike my friend Mike laws wedding where we're going to be having an amazing week and we looked familiar faces and yeah going to be epic going to be awesome hope you the weather's give it well I would have to very land in if thou enjoys eyes and they did that job 
[Music] good morning guys it's just gone 8 a.m. we are in Nuuk in Greenland and we are about to head off hoping if everything goes well to land in rec Vic Iceland later this afternoon but that's weather dependent and we have multiple backup options of other places to land if we can't get all the way over there but I'm leaving all of that to JP and Matt to figure out yeah I'm just doing my best to be helpful but I kind of feel like I can't be much to be honest I'm excited though it's going to be another interesting day of flying and potentially dangerous but we have prepared as much as we can safety wise so should be a good flight okay we've just been sitting in the main departures lounge at the airport Matt and JP have gone in to file the flight plan and Natasha and JJ who we've been staying with just left Jamie's just told me that we are clear to leave even though the fog is still in I think we can fly out of the fog and they've been chatting to some other pilots who are giving him info on on our on our roof and I think we're from the understand we're flying over the ice caps in Greenland which is quite exciting to hit the skies so just to feel the plane and where they come out to the towers pavers [Music] are you ready for today's flight interesting flight got some challenging weather today but I think we're gonna get some awesome sights and we're gonna make it probably all the way to Iceland yeah I'm gonna go back and get my camera [Music] the guys those of you that haven't seen the other vlogs of our ocean crossings reason we're wearing these ridiculous outfits it's because if we do have to land in the sea which hopefully we don't but in an emergency we do these will keep us alive in cold water these are dry emergencies [Music] yeah we have to play with these on when we're doing ocean crossings they're actually quite warm I'm warming up already let's do this Iceland here we come the Creator number two one zero after you know putting runway two three [Music] and out of it [Music] this is just fantastic this goes beyond we're gonna fly down now it is gonna be in vain [Music] if you want to do that if when we're just climbing 360 thousand [Music] yeah this kind of captures it it doesn't capture this no it's very good like yesterday the the camera improves and all the night [Music] look straight ahead Bell hey absurd had a food critic cutters in there's like just I co2 everywhere and then I met continent I think this is between America that bad luck I've ever seen and definitely the coolest place I've ever had lunch [Music] wow that looks so cool I think we need to wake me up to get a shot of that look at Ali's like over all of this now and I am ever D if these snowy icy mountains was going to this icy water at the ocean looks like a big fluffy I think I think that Mary enormous they're gonna fall we 6 miles out on a slanted left face with your night [Music] Oh [Music] how's it fun day so we're in the tower this little airport what's this netbook called please police say and looks like we've got the go-ahead to fly all the way to record it in Iceland today I think the weather's gonna be good for us so Matt's just fired our flight plan I just got a cheeky little coffee and we're just admiring these incredible scenic views this is by far one of the most remote places are born on earth I think Greenland is my god honestly guys that flight we just did I think I'll be hard to beat I'll be that's the hard flight to beat your net for these scenery and that's saying a lot because you've done a lot of light I thought I'd seen the whole yeah did you enjoy that flight Davey yeah best bite on my life but it's a so it's more really nervous so it was just smooth sailing and yeah the scenery out of the window was just amazing and the 20 what was a 28 polar bear yeah I think 28 28 21 is amazing so big we could see them from right Iceland here we come back in dry mesh and suit the basis every time over 28 is to the surface and 8,000 so we should be good at 7000 and icing from the freezing level of date like 15 or 18 holy crap music oh cool thank you super number two one zero our uniform I actually won 2-0 miles to the east now [Music] give me snacks you're willing to share [Applause] is that okay for you through the bag [Music] chocolate milk in the world Rises the best chocolate milk in the world simply because I'm able to have it right now okay I think littering where we are this is America [Music] [Music] meda to either hi welcome to reco Vick Iceland I last time I came here I think it was the night April last year maybe and it was under slightly different circumstances so I flew in from Greenland like on the most epic flight of done in my life oh yeah it's pretty beautiful flying engineer as well actually I'm looking forward to spending a few days here exploring meet some locals and then and then the plan is at some point don't know exactly when yet we'll be flying from here to the UK possibly into Scotland yeah and then onwards down through Europe but yeah next couple of days we're gonna be exploring Iceland how did you find the flight JP beautiful yeah without any issues we we're a little worried about the weather's warning Badou we couldn't have asked for anything better nice as good as it can get it's nice to be back in Iceland I'm looking forward to this have you been in Iceland before so guys as we came in to land Peter here saw that we were about to land and came out with his camera and got the the landing and he's kindly offered to give us a lift to our place we're staying tonight he's also pilot and has been following our adventure a little bit so yeah thanks thanks for giving us right so it's 2:30 in the morning me and Matt have been having a bit of laptop Club getting sorted trying to catch up with edits problem is because we're traveling east and we're going through time zones we've actually added I think two hours onto our time from Greenland so we're losing time and we're losing sleep time we've decided the best plan is tomorrow probably just take the day off doing anything and just catch over there that's and rest and stuff like that and just so we can recuperate a bit for the rest of the trip and yeah we would already contacted a few people and a few people have reached out to us to hang out whilst we're here in Iceland I'm gonna go and get some rest though I did not sleep a lot last night and I'll catch in the morning peace out enjoy life and live the adventure [Music] 
[Music] good morning guys these early at 6 a.m. for at LAX and we are about to leave on another adventure with three new friends David Durham and Paul and yeah we're heading to the Dominican Republic today I think like five days or something it's gonna be pretty epic and yeah quick explanation these guys have supposed to join for a leg of the world flight that we just completed on the weekend we just had an amazing celebration Liberty Deventer summit anyway because of multiple reasons it was impossible for them to join but now we have organized a separate adventure and yes we pretty epic they seem to wake up a little bit so early [Music] okay we have got through security that was pretty fast we've got 45 minutes till we board so we're gonna sit down and get some breakfast okay my peach sir has come out it's quite a nice little breakfast here Pete's bowl of through obviously coffee we still have 15 minutes so we need to board so all good all good [Music] right flight number one done got like an editing done on that flight I always struggle to vlog flights when I'm not by a window because you can't really visually show the journey I was trying to film out this tiny little porthole in the right anyway yeah Miami which landed different climate it's actually pretty chilly in LA so warmer weather guys this has never happened to me before we've got off the plane and gate D 42 and then our sinking our we're gonna have to go out finding the other terminal I guess go into international departures thinking it's gonna be this long process anyway then I just looked at my boarding pass and it said gate D 42 is where we were boarding and we just found out it's the exact same plane we just have to wait here wait for them to clean the plane and then get back on I yeah as never happens to people that's amazing thank you how crazy zero do you know this is the same gate we live in from is there weird I know I've never had that guys this is my favorite thing about the Miami Airport it's kind of like flower arrangement spelling out peace and love it's a great message to see when you land wherever you are in the world I don't know how long this flight is it's gonna be a long evening because when we arrive after get rental car and drive like three or four hours lots of editing time now though as a man [Music] [Music] welcome to the dominican republic again I think this is my second time this year yeah I'm ready for a drive now I'm ready for some warm weather now we're just waiting for the bags that some of the guys let's check in and let's see where the bags are apparently the screen where you see where your bags are unable to connect to the internet so that's not very helpful is it [Music] [Music] we have our rental car sources friendly that took a long time before we leave the airport we've decided to get some food luckily all of these food places just still open so we got certainly lettuce ran the place and I'm getting a burrito a veggie burrito which I think should be good okay this is our car for the for the week [Music] look at the other side that it's like okay this is the this is the radar I remember for last time with me up right over here but I feel it there's been some heavy rain because the bridge is intact but we're in the jungle guys welcome to the jungle it's cool arriving at night because it's you hear all the night creatures have you ever been some of these kind of sounds it's so gonna be quite sounds of nature [Music] [Applause] [Music] awesome we are all in our own separate tree houses and yeah I guess it's probably time to sleep soon I've just realized that look at the time it's 1:00 a.m. and we woke up at like 5:00 so we've been traveling for 20 hours so right except mine is my maths correct and which seems seems like a long way well we haven't been traveling 20 hours because we actually went three hours ahead in the time zone but anyway my point is we've been traveling all day it's been fun though it's been good chance of the guys getting to know them a little bit and I'm sure we'll get to know each other a fair bit more the next few days yeah it's been really interesting actually I guess it's kind of like although they all know me a little bit for my vlogs it's kind of I don't think they know each other too well other than spending time at the the lived adventures summit but it's kind of throwing four strangers together and getting to know each other from you know straight from kind of going you know going on a trip which I don't often do I guess it's the same as if you went on one of the kind of and organized kind of trip where you meet up with other people or maybe kind of back to when you do like camps as a kid I like it though it's called doing something with some brand new friends that you've just you know friendships you just made and yeah we it's pretty relaxed I think we we haven't got any big expectations the next couple of days other than I guess they were sharing yesterday just the things they really want to get out of this trip is just time to time to do a few activities and and kind of explore and have adventures but also just sit down and chat about life and dream together and hopefully find a bit of purpose I guess getting away like this and be know it's reflecting your life and just have some positive encouragement help you find a bit of direction so I should be called exploring that with them and yes it's a bit weird being back here without Riya really because yes I was here last time with her and I desperately desperately need to be spending time with her right now like I'm I'm so craving quality quality time and after this three months it into you know in dispersed time you know we just I'm really looking forward to getting away after this trip anyway I guess I'm gonna fool asleep now to the beautiful sound of the jungle I was telling the guys on the way in I used to have a like a CD with these kind of sounds on in my jungle bedroom when I was a kid but you need to see do you and you can have in real life right you see in the morning peace out enjoy life and live adventure 
[Music] good morning guys we arrived late last night at this beautiful hotel we're here on an awesome trip sponsored by visit Abu Dhabi we've just come down for breakfast we have some exciting plans for later in the day but for starters I need two cups of coffee because we are where we came from is currently like 9 p.m. in the evening first thing we're doing today we've stopped at this beach clubs sadly a beach club and never going to go and show them one of the cabanas how beautiful is this place I love that they've got a DJ she is just jamming out [Applause] start off with we just got some fresh coconuts Cheers this is this is paradise this is so awesome this is just what I wanted right now whoa we have relocated down to the beach right saying beach is always better there's something please 81 okay without you guys who wins beaches or swimming pools I think in depends if there's a hot tub by the serene pool I could be tempted yeah yeah it's pretty amazing and we have this amazing food fruit platter as well all star fruit [Music] [Music] right we are grabbing some lunch I got a veggie burger with some spicy sauce and truffle fries this is this is pretty bun this is great fun are y'all playing some cheese today the live saxophone as well [Music] we're back in the car and we're now heading to the ground musk if you remember last time I was here I'll only here for one day and we did get to go check out the lost I'm a little bit Brooke better prepared this time I was just in the shorts and like tanga top last time so I've got a shirt on I've got my trousers on and yeah we're gonna try and get there a bit earlier so we get some cool photos and Roy has never been before [Music] it's gonna be epic it's gonna be able alright we've arrived at the Sheikh Saeed musk and I'm hoping that we can get a tour today so we can find out a bit more information about like the size I don't know how long it took I think it's one of the biggest mosques in the world from what I remember yeah this is this is quite spectacular I managed to get in with some normal place Raya had to put on this robe to be respectful right taking the shoes off I need to try and find dryer now [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's always fun revisiting places I've been before and trying to figure out new and creative kind of angles I can shoot and take photos of of the place yeah this is this is an incredibly photogenic building though this is I could spend all day here taking photographs and this is perfect lighting Golden Hour I want to kind of cruise it on this side though because Suns obviously sitting over there I've just found out some cool things about this mosque guys firstly this big courtyard is a hundred and eighty thousand square feet and as you can see it's a marble mosaic and it's the biggest marble mosaic in the entire world [Music] who say guys these minarets as four of them they are a hundred meters high each one it's a pretty impressive feat of architecture just learn some fascinating facts out about this massive carpet so this carpet is in nine different sections it was woven together in a factory and then shipped here it weighs 35 tons and it's made from wool that they brought in from New Zealand and it took two years to make we've just been allowed through the the cordoned off tourist area this dudes giving us a little tour wow how many people can this room hold 8,000 and is it ever full of people the court knows okay I'm in the middle of the room I love the chandelier above me woah that is trippy so cool the security guard knows me and Louie he recognized us from YouTube so he let us come in even though there's like a gated off part we were able to come into the middle I'm standing under the chandelier which weighs 12 tons and something I think all the chandeliers in this room altogether have like forty thousand Swarovski crystals and crazy amounts of gold and incredible Amis is the biggest carpet in the world so yeah you can definitely see where the mosque gets his name of grand mosque because it's extremely grand beautiful and the detail I think one of the coolest things about this is just the detail that's got into it like every single pillar and ceilings chandeliers everything you can just tell I mean look at this carpet even yeah where we're heading now is to go and see an exhibition that's been put up for the 10th anniversary of this place so this place was completed in 2007 I think on the 20th of December so we're like almost exactly I think we're like 15 days away from the exact kind of yeah 10 year anniversary but this is it's quite privileged being able to walk across this main courtyard because most of the tourists and visitors have to stick to its kind of outer path [Music] all right heading to the exhibition [Music] Thanks [Music] whoa what is this guys this little 10 thing is called a man apparently and it's from 1648 or between sixty forty eight and 1687 and was it belonged to an ottoman sultan but I'm struggling to believe this is that old it's looks immaculate it must have been restored looks so good it looks like these tents were on the back of camels and I'm guessing important people would be inside I think one of the things I love most about walking around here is seeing so much history which you don't usually see but other times I've been in the United Arab Emirates but you don't see the really like ancient stuff because obviously there's a lot of modern building here it's a lot of new cities but this is yeah fascinating looking into the past and seeing some of the artifacts from around the world that's very educational pretty fascinating ah we're heading to dinner now [Music] so you've come out to dinner to this restaurant called the age of the Cuba Asia to Cuba and it's basically a fusion of Asian and Cuban food and looks amazing it's right on the beach and we just got our food I got this eggplant ragout it looks amazing truffle mashed sweet potato fries and we got some roses spicy coconut curry yeah and I've got some green tea because the jet lag is so real guys we flew from Hawaii which is 10 hours or 14 hours different something basically it's like morning there right now and night here and repealing it so keep that caffeine and this food I can edit I'm pretty excited about these sweet potato fries I got a Thai curry noodle thing as well because this is awesome Cheers [Music] guys it's been an amazing first day in Abu Dhabi I cannot wait to show you what we get up to the next couple of days thanks again to visit Abu Dhabi for having us and yeah I'll catch you in the morning peace out enjoy life a little adventure
