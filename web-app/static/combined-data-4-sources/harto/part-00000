family and a big part of our future anyway today's video is actually about me it's about showcasing the talents of an amazing youtuber named Ryder as he made a brief history of Hannah Hart if you guys not familiar with his channel he makes brief histories all the time they're really fascinating and interesting and he made one about me so I wanted to share it with you writers actually made a brief history of Hannah Hart before but he made a new one because so much has happened let's take a look hello and welcome to another episode of a brief history today's episode Hannah Hart ready set go Brooklyn New York 2011 25 year old Hannah Hart spends her days working as a proofreader at a translation firm mining through document after document searching for even the smallest of errors and at this time Hannah was still pretty new to New York so after work one day she hopped on the video chat with one of her hometown friends who coincidentally was also named Hannah so to avoid confusion let's flip that name around and call her Hannah so during this video chat Hannah and Hannah began reminiscing about the time they spend together back home in San Francisco particularly times when Hannah would get drunk and start cooking and in response to this Hannah decided to pull up photo booth and from a drunk cooking video to send to her friends so she grabbed her laptop and a bottle of wine and proceeded to film herself getting drunk saying hello over and over again and attempting to cook a grilled cheese sandwich she that is until about halfway through when she realized she didn't have any cheese never said she was prepared anyway once this video was filmed and edited together Hanna uploaded it to her YouTube channel myharto to send to her friends but what came next was completely unexpected this video which was simply known as my drunk kitchen actually started gaining a surprising amount of traction Hanna's charming personality and drunken antics struck a chord with the YouTube community with her drunk kitchen video having gained over 500,000 views by June of 2011 and over a million by December of the same year and the comments were pouring in with people begging Hanna to make more and hey she had a ton of fun with the first one so she saw no reason not to continue and thus my drunk kitchen became my drunk kitchen episode 1 as Hanna began creating and uploading more and more episodes of the show with many of them performing just as well if not better than Episode one the unexpected explosion of my drunk kitchen suddenly found Hannah holding all this potential in her hands and she got to decide what she wanted to do with it so while my drunk kitchen was definitely the focus of my heart so moving forward hannah was very adamant about taking this pretty much once-in-a-lifetime opportunity she was given to try and build a strong community and thus it didn't take long for Hannah to begin dipping her toes into the waters of things like Q&amp;A advice videos and blogs however the interesting thing was at this point in her burgeoning career Hannah was still kind of an outsider on YouTube mostly unaware of the massive communities that have been growing on the site since the beginning that was until the summer of 2011 when Hannah was invited to this little thing called VidCon yep in one fell swoop panel was taken from her kitchen and suddenly plunked right into the epicenter of all things online video surrounded by all these people that she had never heard of in her life at this time all she knew was that she loved what she was seeing and following big-gun 2011 Hannah decided it was time to try and take this YouTube thing to the next level she moved out to Los Angeles in February of 2012 and began meeting and collaborating with all sorts of prominent youtubers such as Shane Dawson jenna Marbles and grace Helbig among other but while her YouTube channel was doing well Hannah herself was kind of struggling she wasn't necessarily enjoying her life in LA the opportunity she had been before weren't exactly working out and she was beginning to consider packing her things moving back to New York and maybe getting a job in social media but the idea of simply abandoning the community she had spent the last two years growing on YouTube was just something she could not get behind so she went in the complete opposite direction in come January of 2013 a hannah and her friend pearl Weibull teamed up to crowdfund a national tour which they named hello harto originally hello harto would see hannah and a few of her friends touring too around ten places across the country and filming episodes of Mikron kitchen in the homes of fans although out vlogging there on the road experience and hannah was asking for $50,000 to make it all happen however the hello harto IndieGoGo ended up raising over four times this amounts clocking in at more than two hundred and twenty thousand dollars and so the tour was expanded from ten to twenty two stops across the US and now Canada the on the road vlogs were transformed into a full-on mockumentary series and on top of all this rather than having typical fan meetups each stop on the hello harto tour would feature a volunteer charity event the hello harto tour was a massive success eventually extending to places like New Zealand and Australia and all of this only scratches the surface of the sheer number of things Hanna accomplished in 2013 on top of hello harto on february 2nd 2013 hannah teamed up with her friends and fellow youtubers grace Helbig and the totally unrelated mamrie Hart to put on a 75 minute comedy show known as the no filter show and after gaining popularity online the trio decided to take this show on the road alongside certain hello harto dates but even then we aren't done for come August of 2013 the Trinity took to the main stage of VidCon to announce that they were working on their first-ever feature-length film known as Camp Takota which was then released online on February 14th 2014 and for the sake of time I'm not going to go too much deeper into this but let's just say camp Takota definitely wasn't Hannah's last foray into more traditional high budget productions so by the start of 2014 Hannah was riding high having finally hit her stride in the last year but throughout all of this and even going back to before she started YouTube there was one thing that Hannah had always wanted to do and had never really been given the opportunity to do Hannah wanted to write a book and jumping back a bit to Hannah's moved to LA in 2012 one of the things she had been pitching over and over that year had been a parody cookbook based off my drunk kitchen but for one reason or another no one wanted it that was until January 30th 2014 when Hanna announced that she was teaming up with dey Street Books to publish my drunk kitchen a guide to eating drinking and going with your gut released in August of 2014 my drunk kitchen was both a parody cookbook with each recipe serving as its own little mini episode of my drunk kitchen as well as a self helpful complete with a foreword written by one of those strangers she met at her first VidCon John Green and unsurprisingly the my drunk kitchen book was incredibly well-received earning critical acclaim and climbing the New York Times bestseller list in various categories after years and years of working and pitching concepts Hannah had finally achieved her dream of becoming an author but Hannah was not about to stop there as she was already itching to write her next book and as safe as it would have been for Hannah to just write on my drunk kitchen - she once again decided to go in a completely different direction and thus on August 8 2016 Hannah released her second book buffering unshared tales of a life fully loaded you see where Hannah's first book was essentially an amalgamation of everything my heart oh and my drunk kitchen buffering aimed instead to represent everything that is Hannah Hart it was a far more personal project a full-fledged memoir of Hannah's life diving far deeper than any one YouTube video ever could you know it's basically like this video but longer more detailed more personal and just like better in general I made that exact same joke talking about binge in my Tyler Oakley episode and I'm not even sorry and much like its predecessor buffering was very well received becoming Hannah's second New York Times bestseller so by this point six years into a career hannah has created a hugely popular web series toured around the u.s. and several other countries collaborated with a nearly endless number of youtubers and celebrities taken part in several bigger budget productions and written to New York Times bestselling books and is she slowing down for even a second and 2017 no for later this year hannah has a 6 episode travel and food series coming to Food Network and in February it was announced that she's actually struck up a deal with the film studio Lionsgate to produce an original LGBT themed romantic comedy and to think pretty much everything I just mentioned spawned from a homesick Hannah Hart making a silly drunk cooking video on a whim back in 2011 back then Hannah knew absolutely nothing about the world of YouTube but quickly fell in love with it and wanted nothing more than to build a strong community like those who came before her someone in her position could have easily just gone for quick cash outs and soaked in the fame but instead Hannah chose to use her newfound popularity to form connections with people help others organize charity work and put her all into everything she's made and whether she's making youtube videos writing books or producing feature film Hannah's passion for helping others has always shown through a passion that has no doubt inspired thousands of people over the last six years and if the upcoming year is any indication

so if you don't feel good about yourself it's not because of the way you look it's because of the way you think Scott Chuck's getting a little too real Wow hello welcome to the eighties hey guys so this week on Scotch doc the show where I have some scotch and we talk I want to talk to you guys about something that I get asked quite a bit a next question is how do I build confidence or how I stay confidence or what should remain confidential in this file ma'am no nobody has ever asked me that as far as you guys know um oh that's smooth and yet hairy I believe confidence is a lie I don't think it's true and real I think that everyone has something they feel insecure about some doubts that they have about themselves or their objectives in life for the goals they think they should have but maybe they don't want that goal maybe they want I'd ever call a point being everyone has flaws everyone has insecurities and everyone has doubts so when you see someone who's being quote-unquote confident they're you know kind of lying they're just putting their best foot forward so what we label and perceive is confidence like oh look at that confident person it's just us saying you know looking at the way they're acting and talking to them I can't tell what it is about themselves that they feel crippling insecurity about now so there should be a new word for that like oh that's what I got a good show today that's good that's not to say there aren't things you feel just Gemma Diddley that's not to say that there aren't things you feel genuinely confident about for instance I feel pretty confident in my ability to listen while burrowing my eyebrows and just like really just like listening so hard through my face you know but there's a lot about myself that I don't have that much confidence in there of with who our school that was a roller coaster from start to finish so when you look at me you might see old Hannah she's such a confident person but the fact of the matter is is that I'm actually just using a different value to get ahead of my own insecurities and fears like doing a panel or a meet-and-greet or speaking I get so nervous but I am just an idiot Apple who has nothing worthwhile today and I push past those feelings because I think to myself well this is what I want to say and what I need to say and maybe that's enough and then I say it and then people are like well honey Oh too confident and I'm like no no no not confident at all oh I'm super insecure I made a whole video about how insecure I am I get nervous before every party I could never be alone with another person I'm like oh my god that being said I have worked actively to do confidence for instance like sitting with good strong body posture making eye contact and working on just genuinely my inherent sense of self-worth the more I built that up a little bit piece by piece the more confident I may seem but maybe it's not so much confidence is more present us distracted by worry worry is not productive you know it is trixie what makes you think you're being productive because you're worrying about it but you're not actually getting anywhere you're just taking up time with worry worry is the procrastination of Prabhas ah-ha-ha-ha-ha worry is the procrastination problem-solving you know you're like oh this will be effective if I just freak out for a while and to be fair sometimes it is mm-hmm other ways to build confidence pump up jams have you ever listened to a pump up Jam yeah it helps you're like oh listen this music I'm going into it yes yes I'm gonna drown out that crippling sense of doubt with this music yeah music you not music by me you know music by unreal musician there are many many many musicians out there so good body posture pump up Jam and positive reinforcement a lot of times we people that we think are friends and then they're just kind of shitty and you're like buddies will mean a lot of times we surround ourselves with people that are negative or critical and you know they can really kind of like dig into your brain after a while so make sure that you're surrounded by an uplifting and supportive group not someone that's kind of trying to take each other down it happens it's crazy they call them frenemies I think I don't know probably some ABC drama about it I could watch is that what this is us is a DK a big pro tips for building confidence is to stop comparing yourself to other people other people are other people the only person you can really compare yourself with is yourself are you closer to who you want to be now than you were last year are you working on the things that you want to be working on you cannot use someone else's scale to weigh your worth period you ever hear this way to somebody that's like somebody's talking about some insecurity they have and some other people like what do they have to be insecure about look at them blah blah blah blah it doesn't matter how they look or how they seem on the outside self-confidence is a consciousness or self-consciousness somebody could be the stereotypical standard of beauty fit and tan and tall or whatever but it doesn't matter if they don't feel it you can see how someone feels about themselves so if you don't feel good about yourself it's not because of the way you look it's because of the way you think Scott Chuck's getting a little too real Wow Oh positivity positive is gloomy huh okay let's go back to that left hmm wow this guy intense as per usual so I'm thinking probably just going to wrap it up here with some handy tips and tricks for feeling more self-confident it makes the trick is to stop thinking of it as confidence maybe it's thinking of it as how can I remind myself of my worth when I'm nervous maybe that's what confidence is who's to say I haven't felt very confident about making videos lately I don't know why I'm in a real read about it I'm overthinking it I think to myself is making a scotch talk where we

everybody I am very excited science tracted where is he Darius Roscoe good ball and D what a tease anyway I'm very excited to show you guys the first ever sneak peek of I heart food my new show debuting on Food Network I'll be 40 but 10 p.m. again at mark your calendars please do and yeah okay get ready to see me being cheesy and making a commercial so here come sing hey YouTube I'm Hannah Hart and I've got a new show on Food Network called I heart food I'm super excited about it how excited you mask Wow let's take a look so let's explore New Mexico's fiery fixation oh wow that smells incredible what I know are you good morning I'm great I'm here at the Santa Fe farmers market with Matt Romero a former chef turned farmer who's made picking peppers his life obsession so first things first what exactly is a chili pepper chili is the Spanish word for pepper so technically all peppers are chilies what type of chili is that this is what green chili becomes when you let it mature on the vine it becomes red chili so when they say red or green it's the same plant it's the same peppers it's a different stage of maturity it red chili is basically hung up to dry and then you clean it and you puree it or you grind it before you make red chili now for green chili you need to roast a pepper peel the skin off and that resulting flesh is what green chili is what makes the pepper hot genetics so it's going to be a hot pepper it's going to be is going to be because its parents were hot peppers which of these hotties are hot these are hot most of the New Mexico are considered hot peppers these are a lot hotter than these none of them are as hot as you are thanks for peppering me with compliments I'm used to getting roasted sitting day so the heat is on but which Pepper's pack the biggest punch let's find out Chili Peppers are rated on what's called the Scoville scale this scale ranges from zero to 15 million units take your bell pepper they are sweet and delicious and entirely not spicy that means they have a rating of zero also the habanero this is a hundred thousand to three hundred and fifty thousand units by far the spiciest pepper on this table oh just looking at it's making me sweat what's the hottest chilli on record right now the Carolina Reaper this little guy actually packs the most powerful punch of spice at 2.2 million Scoville units so remember just as you would never judge a book by its cover never judge a pepper by its side so what do we do with all that heat what we do here is we use this machine this is a chili roaster this produces an incredible amount of heat very intense and it's going to sear that chili on the outside and caramelized and intensify the flavor all right here we go time to roast Wow all right now you're hearing how they're making noise in there that popping noise is the skin blistering with the intense heat this is so cool home I want to cook everything this way this chili looks like it's perfect they're starting to do the peeling job on their own this is exactly where you want it there we go hiding here comes the chili everybody out of the pool now here's that big one you were showing off earlier this is exactly what you want this is the way you want those skins coming off so what does a true chili obsesses do with that freshly roasted green chili how about making a new Mexican classic you can take these covers stuffed them with a little bit of cheese and make what they call a chile relleno you said the magic words cheese anything that involves cheese I just think we need to make right away I thought the credit rotors yeah okay so what you do is you make a little slice on the side of the chili here and you basically put this little wedge of cheese inside here you can do this one okay a little hole there at this guy in here enjoy welcome to the chili this is your new home we're in we're perfect all these are going to be so good so we're going to add a little bit of garlic oil in the batter so that the chilies will have that garlic flavor yeah so we're going to start off with four eggs separated and we're going to beat them to a double peak stage the flour lets the egg batter adhere to it and you know our egg whites should be getting close now we're gonna take the holding the yolks now and we're gonna add them to the whites but a little bit of tiny bit of flour in that and a tiny bit of cornstarch and that's it okay now we're gonna blend this in real gently here okay look at that that beautiful that looks amazing that'll stick to the chiles really beautiful so we've already pre dusted our chilies you basically dump them all the way in you take this Riano and you put it right on the batter and you turn it all the way up til you see it start to bubble up turning them over is going to be the trick let's see how this goes oh there's your lightly fried crispy chili Riano and see what these taste like I am so excited to try to do what I see I see what you think you got cheese oozing out of there you see that oh really light then batter around it [Music] what do you think I love it thank you so much very welcome new series I heart food premieres Monday August

crushes when you give your full heart to someone and they walk away with it in their hands as if it meant nothing to them this is crushing but then again maybe in the place where your heart once was a new stronger heart will form forever you today what's the Shakespearean line is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all I feel like lasting love is two people growing increasingly more platonic yeah so we just have to break up okay it's not you it's me just kidding it's amazing and they're really salty about that hair very salty oh thank you so much man thank you

Oh got through my nose mistake number one is the most common drinking mistake which is not having any way to open up your drink recently I got these badass cast iron drinking tools look at this I mean wow how cool are you and look at this bottle opener like ah you guys hear this this is the business industry right here also a shot glass because it turns out a big part of drinking is measuring yeah well I live Willa Bree this is how much you get when you ask for a single serving a whiskey your Scotch at a bar they give you this and then you accuse them trying to rip you off and then they say madam please is a fifth time this week and I say I'll show you the fifth time this week that's not true I'm act I'm really non-confrontational I'm always like oh thank you thank you so much that's a perfect amount and this is drinking mistake number two which is actually the absence of this turns out there's these beautiful things called like whiskey tumblers that is to say it's not just a whisky lover's blog where it ships different whiskeys with other spirits and then maybe theorizes about whether or not that whiskeys in a relationship right now or what get it whiskey tumbler haha it's also very keen on social justice I'm sorry sure it's love long story short soit's ok mmm good kid you can stay number three if you want to like make cocktails and stuff people have these things called like shakers or mixers or whatever and you can I guess you can use like a mason jar and I put a little on it and then just shake stuff around or you can use something like this yes it is a maraca shaped shaker device it looks like a maraca drink pour and everything in and of course I measured then I put ice in or something maybe and then I shake shake shake shake shake shake margarita margarita then you take off this part and you can pour it out into a cup but I put it put it rip see oh my god so classy everyone's like you're so responsible but also so hip speaking of being hip what's hipper than a hip flask I'll tell you again drinking responsibly you know guys I have a lot of fun drinking but I promise you I have made my fair share of terrible terrible mistakes some of them have ended up on my body forever it's beautiful to me mmm beautiful the beach mmm beautiful the beach mmm beautiful the right well drinking mistake numbers on it now you may be like whoa I'm going out but I don't have any way to secretly drink which I don't really know if you should do well what's hipper than a hip flask look at this you know how everything's like in mason jars now and everyone's like oh I'm using twine is it Jitsu Aussie well this is that version of that look at this flask Wow looks like there should be milk in here but you know what there's not milk this is vodka well this one nothing yet and if this is too daunting a size for you there's also a smaller size which is great because everybody's bought is different like I know that I'm pi/3 I am a lightweight I get drunk pretty quick and I make so many decisions based off of impulsion anyway let's talk about that ah unless the not least drinking mistake number this one um is what your drink is kind of warm that sucks you know sometimes you want like it nice unless it's like a hot toddy which is like whiskey and honey and tea oh I love a hot toddy and winter oh so good unless your drink is supposed to be warm you want ice in it and ice it's hard to get I mean like I have an ice maker but I don't trust it I'm like where's Boris is coming from so what better than having a cup that has a designated ice shape for itself that way you know I just need to make this one thing ice I'm gonna put this ice diamond into my beautiful cup and then drink out of it Wow look at this it's so geometric like what is it trying to teach me about art right now that is stunning this looks like a crystal gem of drinking boom hey my kids long story short I hope that some of those items are helpful to you for not making any of my drinking mistakes if you guys want to get some of your own can go ahead and go to kik : comm slash heart dome or or you can use the coupon code heart 215 for 15% off of your orders yay saving money saving money that's what being an adult's all about you got a plan for the future to ensure you have one or not anyway that's it for me for now subscribe to my channel if you want to check out more videos and turn on notifications if you want to know when I post them because you know that's good notifications subscribe mwah have a great day

Each of the Try Guys are gonna make their own layer in a pizza cake but at the end of the day, it's not going to be cake It's gonna be pizza. H: So this is my home..

N: Okay H: Once you've made the dough you have to set it into a little cube. We're making a pizza cake. This is next-level N: What? I thought we were just making individual pizzas and then dumping sugar on them H: No 'cause then the cake would bleed together And it would just be a mess. My Drunk Kitchen is about aiming for success N: When can I put this in? H: *exhales* H: And you guys do this? Like as a team? N: Ohh these are just cubes no. We don't need this *cat meows* (Everyone) OH MY GOD NED Oh no cat H: He's probably fine H: So we're gonna put the pizza in this later N: "laughing" Oh okay H: Alright N: Oh were making a sheet pan pizza H: No no no H: We're making literally just circles N: Four little circles H: Yes N: all right, easy H: That's correct easy N: Will we need to cut that into four? *Laughter* H: I think I understand what mansplaining is *More laughter* N: I'm just trying to help H: Will someone open that white wine for Ned?

Four H: So why don't you do your best to make it shaped like that and we'll put them on here H: Heads up if you want to make a pizza cake of your own what you need to do is take each layer and bake it individually for eight minutes at 400 degrees sooo *singing* H: Wow Ned! N: WOAH! N: What? How'd I get here? H: You know you seem like a pretty wacky guy H: What kind of pizza do you like to eat?

um looks at it oh hey everybody this week on whoa serving look I heard into this you know he has an Instagram you'll never be a star sibling rivalry put that down back in your mouth this is the internet Maggie the dangerous place okay this week on adventures in personal grooming I mean seriously my last video was about waxing you just wanted a spa day you just you're like ice to make videos oh I know what I'll do I know what I'll do my areas today we are joined by the wonderful beautiful Maggie you may remember her from such moments as this oh you suck at this challenge don't fall and also this baggie released the G it comes in one like a little fish when you first get at the top core and then say John and also this Maggie yes it seems like there's a finger sized dollop taken out of it Wow what crazy and now but my sister does my makeup because I love you guys can tell but Maggie Maggie do you like makeup I do like makeup yeah oh oh yeah ever since Eddie kept you start you can be busting all your shots right so maybe you're pretty good doing your makeup like I feel like every time I see your makeup is great thank you how did you want to make up so sometimes when I'm really freaked out at like 11 p.m. I just go into the bathroom and do my makeup for like 45 minutes and I have a lot of freaked out and it's been good I thought would be fun if you did my makeup there is um you know okay is this enough layer yes so you are radiant so I'm just gonna prime your skin with the no brand good the video is not sponsored but it's blue you should say the products forget discus people want to know okay so this would be perfect beauty Inc skin perfection gel which I found in a plastic bin while you were moving and took see that guy you see oh we turned off auto so we did okay let's get translucent goo is enough yeah oh here I'll use my phone cause it looks like a night shot a little boy D it does look a little bit pretty more like Andy do me candy dirty Oh candy isn't scheduled it do you want to it was erase that well everybody like reverie shot yeah like this what's this some allow me to clip it oh yeah do you feel like drinking more water is help sure stoom so I had really really really I'm not going to say bad skin because like I've been shaving no skin shaving now I did have a lot of skin texture trouble skin buh-buh-buh-buh processes thank you I feel beautiful yay my skin really get good until like three or four months ago because for a long time I was using a face wash with salicylic acid which is one type of acne medication and I switched over to one that uses benzoyl peroxide which is the other kind and the benzoyl peroxide really really worked for me and so I think that combines with like eating better and hydration like what you put into your body is going to show out of your body so yeah uh-huh that's right when you're a kid you should be able to eat whatever you want to this I think kids can eat pizza cookies chocolate so what's the next step next step is now going to be your foundation because also from bare minerals it's called prime time and it is also primer but it's a BB primer cream broad-spectrum SPF 30 cool that way your it sounds small way for sunscreen okay slap it on my face yes let's get to the silence and fair give it a bit bit dad best give it a bit better and get it at that I doubt now for the fun part as a makeup I was really excited for this is my look that's going to be born now yay I am but to panic us it up East this is the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer approach it in minor spin I like it because it's shimmery that's why I like it doing up man everyone's allowed make up the game likes a game fun talk about having trouble with your skin the more makeup you put on it the harder it's going to be for your skin to heal because then you get a three yeah it's going to get respectable clogs box eye stuff and it's really hard not wearing makeup when your skin isn't where you want it to be but it's like part of the process of getting your skin to that point in my experience yes I am NOT a beauty anything that could be all wrong all right should move closer to cameras people see we're moving hi viewers at home with me so right now I'm going to do an orange monochrome it's going to be like very peachy very fun very spring/summer so just like fall but like it's hot spill man I'm going to put down a layer of like a sort of ivory beige color from the urban decay once the fawning thing looks like this lots of nice color and so I'm going to use skin which is this kind of beige ivory color I want a lot of makeup tutorials comes I really appreciate when they don't tell me the name of the color from the palette when they just tell me what the color is because that way also helps describe what you're going for yeah and that way the tutorial feels more like a tutorial instead of an advertisement it can still be an advertisement but I don't want it to feel like an advertisement I want them to trick me but as siblings probably our I shape is their biggest difference I agree and also knows though and off yep we look so like but then it's like we have a totally different mouth because your mouth is like well part and then I think she ever knew I think we look alike because our faces move the patient yeah now we have a nice beige Foundation Bell falls what's next first we're going to do is we're going to take this each these are really pigmented and that's why I'm going in with a small brush and going in little layers so this could take a second at editing Hannah but that way you have a lot of control of where your product is being deposited whoo all right now we are putting on this Revlon raspberry sherbert color just really commit to blending it out because it looks Pat it might look patchy like oh my god I've made a horrible mistake but you'll be able to diffuse it and make it so you can kind of fix what you did don't wipe it off blend it in um I feel like I was making a point no I so into my art I feel like it really makes your eyes pop oh like the color yeah I love it alright so here's the thing every makeup person now seems like they're winging their eyes shadow out and I don't know how do I also don't know how to contour that that's what up a particle now we to spring the peach under the I dunno it's kind of an intense look I'm not intense person you are you definitely are now I'm going to take the urban decay Sagan and using this shade here called 1987 why you tell me Gwen Stefani stands like a dark holes yeah and I think it's going to make a really cool highlight for the inner corner we're going to get kind of close to your eyeballs don't freak out because this is my channel now has line of waterslide and this is my plan all along their goal right there she's a pretty goal go Oh No I'm Marisol hey I'm just checking checking the next step is we are going to use this law really minute base is a primer for mascara and it I feel like it makes it not much so much this is really interesting and everyone s Carolina presence um look shirt here oh oh it's like there's a frosty snow on my eyelashes you guys see here I see the white what let me go let the brush lover I say I can see you see I see I feel really beautiful you are yo I'm gonna highlight your nose with my cool fun surprise highlighter ya decided for you and then you'll be all finished really so no you always have to put on blush no no no now we are using the Urban Decay eyeshadow in fireball Wow is it I shall oh I oh I don't use highlighter use eyeshadow with highlight so where are we applying the highlighter first English my nose I'm the tip mmm really yeah it's like a cute thing tip of my nose I always have it's dim - OH noses suppose it all right yeah so right here you see Hannah's natural lip line which is the pink one and then this kind of Ridge here is where I'm trying to put the highlight goal oh this is a lip thing this is my color pop it's the ultra blotted lips this is the shades uma I feel like I've seen a rock this color and it's matte and it's transfer proof so you can like kiss or eat or do whatever and it won't get on your so they're going to look at the camera you can do whatever you want and it won't get on anything transfer proof boy hahahaha it kind of goes on more like a lip stain you feel soft that is so soft oh wow Maggie that's

hey guys it's National Coming Out Day and in honor of National Coming Out Day I decided to make this video answering the question does it actually get better quick sidebar today is the peek low of my monthly depressed downswing so I could not bring myself to set up a camera or shower yet but I could bring myself to hold my phone because I really want to talk about National Coming Out Day so this is the best I can do speaking of the best you can do what an excellent segue into talking about coming out and the question does it actually get better and the answer is yes it does get better but then it gets worse then it gets better again I think is worse again I think it's better again and life continues in these herbs and flows and cycles throughout your years if we are blessed enough to continue to age and get older so the answer is yes but that doesn't mean that's better is forever and let me put let me put this another way let me put it this way if you're somebody that's considering coming out or even somebody that's questioning your sexuality at all talking about it with someone you love a close friend or a trusted unbiased third party as a therapist is going to make the experience better some of my favorite things to say some of my favorite things to say when talking about the subject of coming-out include do it at your own pace you don't need to do this for anybody else you do this for yourself make sure you're safe physically safe emotionally safe have a support system in place and three labels are just labels you might call yourself gay right now and then later realize you're bi or pan or whatever labels are just there as a part of the journey they're not the entire journey love is the journey man and love is crazy anyway yes point being it does definitely get better but remember it's not going to be a hundred percent better a hundred percent of the time but that doesn't mean it's not worth it there's always something that makes it worth it right I have to take a walk I've got a also shower I got a shower and force myself to go outside this is what I have to do anyway guys I just want to make this video short and sweet as always every National Coming Out Day I feel that there is more that people can come out with rather than just their sexual preference obviously it's the honor the lgbtq+ community but if you're somebody who is battling anxiety or hates their job feel free to come out about that same subject and start talking to people about it communication is key if you're stuck in your feelings or you find yourself in this mental emotional rut you got to start talking about it or journaling it out or writing down questions or handing questions on a piece of paper to your friend that they can ask you I should do that that's good be like hey can you ask me these five questions so I can verbally process this take like ten minutes that's a great idea Wow Wow okay guys it'll be so much I hope you're having a beautiful wonderful fantastic National Coming Out Day oh and if you're wondering why my lips are blue it's because I used a suction cup with candy Johnson this week to turn myself into Jon Snow Papapa Papapa Papapa the White Walkers are coming it's such an amazing video I can't wait for you to see it but yeah I I I bruised my lips a little bit and I'll be fine I'll be fine I really I gotta go on a walk I gotta gonna walk if you're also feeling depressed today hang in there kiddo it's so helpful for me to know that I feel this way at this time every month and it's not that my life is wrong or needs to be altered in some way it's just the way I feel in my soul anyway happy National Coming Out Day May everything in your life be covered and rainbows and joy mm1 have a great day

protip a lot of people say they don't know whether or not they've had an orgasm in my personal opinion if you doing it for long enough I think you're gonna find out hey guys it's me Hannah and I'm here this week to talk to you about sex yeah why not you knows about sex that's a great question mainly I'm here because I have heard very very often from people I know friends family well not family I'm here because I've heard time and time again from a lot of my female friends that they've never had an orgasm I know it's shocking but also not that shocking considering society doesn't teach women about their bodies at all haha right guys this video will probably be demonetised I'm saying words like woman orgasm neutral exchange of pleasure vagina clitoris etc in all seriousness women aren't really educated about how to pleasure themselves or how to know their bodies you know I mean I can tell you that when I was in middle school i 100% knew how a guy jacked off you know I feel weird saying these words on my channel masturbated but in middle school I had absolutely no idea how a win would masturbate and in high school I had no idea how a woman her vast debate and it wasn't until I don't know I was like twenty maybe twenty one that I ever did it successfully and had my first orgasm and that was only because I lived in a super sex positive co-op and they educated me about my body and myself and it was through the acceptance that I was able to achieve nerve onna like nerve because the clitoris is covered a lot of nurse than that and then at night now this video is not the be-all end-all but here are some tips and tricks about how you can achieve orgasm and get to know your body better ready let's go step number one acceptance hey there's nothing wrong with you you're not broken you're doing great if you haven't had an orgasm yet that's just because he hasn't had an orgasm it there's plenty of time to figure it out don't give up on yourself accept things for us they are and move forward step number two guess what medications can affect how easy it is for you to have an orgasm turns out antidepressants anti-anxiety meds these are all things like have a direct effect on your ability to achieve orgasm whoa I wish that my psychiatrist have told me that before I started taking antidepressants instead I just kind of noticed it and believe me I noticed right away so if you found that lately or suddenly or having even more difficulty having an orgasm it might be the drugs you're on talk to your psychiatrist about it talk to your medical doctor and talk to yourself or your partner and build that communication that you're gonna need to get off step number three literally just buy a vibrator and go home and then diddle yourself until you come multiple vibrators they can be really expensive and they're all different types and shapes and sizes and vibrations and rumbles and patterns and etcetera etcetera etcetera so my advice to you is go get like your basic pocket bullet bag and that's it and then try a bunch of different directions and see which one starts to feel good you know and then kind of operate in that space until things get crazy protip a lot of people say they don't know whether or not they've had an orgasm in my personal opinion if you're doing it for long enough I think you're gonna find out step number three see I don't know now you guys might be thinking if I hand out what if I'm just not in the mood what if I'm not at all aroused if I'm not horny at all I'm bored just vibrating something against myself it's not turning me on Hey look as someone who read a lot of very pornographic fanfiction at an early age I'm talking like 11 it's okay to go find yourself some indulgent reading material or like videos or whatever it is you want to see you know to start to generate those feelings think back to times in your life where you've been like oh and go with it you can also get such reading materials as buffering unshare tales of a life fully loaded now available in paperback now available in signed paper back at buffering book calm guys if this doesn't get you in the mood something else will don't give up on yourself step number four I don't know if this is a case for everyone but let's say it's the case that you don't ever have an orgasm and you've done all this stuff and you just never will that's fine at least you're still over dr. white that's not fine you can't live without that go to a doctor make sure there's not a medical reason why you're not having an orgasm go to your ob/gyn fight for your patients rights of attention I know doctors rush you in and out of the waiting rooms but you deserve the attention and expertise that you are paying for boom soapbox blammo number five this applies if you're experimenting with a partner ask questions ask them questions and ask them to ask you questions you know be like does that feel good or whatever I don't know maybe not questions like that because I can do a lot of pressure you have your own language with your partner so I'm going to leave this whole question section up to you guys but don't be afraid to ask questions don't be afraid to keep trying for like I don't know an hour two hours maybe I just had too much free time on my hands when I was in college and that's why I was able to do it but I'm so glad that I did because I had men orgasm free for the first 21 years of my life and now for the last nine I haven't been and I want this for you guys you deserve pleasure and positive experiences don't self-sacrifice don't self-sabotage don't be sitting there martyring yourself in the bedroom you deserve it too so boom and grant I had to talk about this today because I felt compelled to and I hope that it was insightful in some way or maybe just provided you guys a little advice now I know you guys are so much smarter than me so please leave comments in the comment section below share your own experiences share your own advice and maybe even other resources I would love that you guys are a great community you educate me educate each other it makes my life great so yeah that's my video for today I hope

we we were building schools and working with children out there he literally got off a plane and came here from Kenya guy this with an hour ago I was at the airport you know I'm a busy person but you really want up to me dude I tried to never deal wants to meet one-upper again god dammit and because he's such a good busy person I've actually taken the time to pre-boil these so take your soft pre boiled potatoes cut them and put them in a ricer for those of you that don't know this is a race that's the potato in eraser and then no it's right that's one way of doing it this is my way of doing it it's not quite as thin but after you brace your potatoes you're gonna go ahead and let them chill or get to like a cooler temperature that takes about an hour so an hour has passed was amazing wasn't the best hours of my life can't you just like put it in the freezer for five minutes that I guess it would ruin the texture the potatoes and also I don't know let's add six tablespoons of flour to our potatoes keeping yeah he thinks great - Wow 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons cornstarch that is definitely a teaspoon all we need now is salt bit yeah laughs I know the recipe but I just thought welcome to you sitting over here we could grate the cheese right here salt that looks like enough and lastly half a cup Parmesan Reggiano cheese this is getting a lot Messier at that's shredding this is grating oh oh I'm gonna lay it on the bowl yeah that's messy this way oh I've never thought of that this has changed my life last but not least stir this all together take one large egg beat it add it to your mix and then you have it take your dough let it rest for 15 minutes because frankly don't we all need rest we do let's talk about it drew how many TV shows are you affiliated with I have five that I'm in you know that we produce and then we also produce other Talent for all different channels food home shows and travels we're a busy production company so let's talk about the importance of rest how are you rest I don't typically I love sleep I mean I love a full night's sleep but I don't typically hit a lot because of our schedule how many hours of sleep do you get a night I guess I'd like to do four and then I wake up for like an hour and a half just for no reason it's my life I like more sleep than that I'm someone who's just making their first entrance into television how do I make sure that I keep my life I guess imbalance you know I mean you're already a busy person so on top of that you're adding a whole new thing with TV I would say for peace and serenity and this is still something I'm working on you need to learn to schedule your downtime and you have to schedule your work time schedule your downtime schedule your downtime Wow well drew thank you for this 15 minutes of therapy it needs a second okay so I have to wait for this to boil before we can do our final moves I like your boil test hmm if it was boiling that would feel not too good yeah it wouldn't feel that bad I get my finger out yeah are you like the Dragon Queen from Game of Thrones and you can dip into hot water and it's not going to affect you it's not I knew it huzi see the next step is super super exciting now I like this step because it reminds me of physiotherapy I got a thing I got stuff to say about stuff to say about this next sentence why is this empty felissa full service thank you drew cheers Cheers here's what we're gonna do we're gonna put these gnocchi through a fully therapeutic experience by dunking them in some hot / boiling water and then immediately thrusting them into an ice bath look I'll turn talk about a circulation listen just get the blood flow going and then this slows it down so you don't get any swelling in your gnocchi yeah that was a personal trainer for many years let me talk to you about this disc I have in my back hold on yeah Wow thanks for fixing my back let's keep making gnocchi so I have stopped referring to the recipe and going off what I remember but you're also for drinks and I am so I don't think your memory be so good okay first of all I'm a solid three look I practice at home in anticipation of your arrival because I want to do a good job ready and top let's go great okay I think we're ready to drop that in there and then I'll get the defrag there just pick it up yeah one at a time uh-huh and then drop it in the nice ones your nail key flow and I should have -

saying it look how great viral okay boom hi guys this week I'm joined by the wonderful miles for Canada so - and let's do the basics bring it from I was born in Los Angeles but like my childhood was Las Vegas 10 years Orange County so always like a West Coast boy okay cool I love the West Coast when did you get started on YouTube um I started when I was 11 years old so I'm 21 now so you've been on YouTube the full decade Oh like this year is the 10 years and a 2015 that started being like a thing where it's like oh now people are watching how would you describe your channel uh uh people look at that and I'll just be like you know I make lgbtq+ content but also try to be funny like everyone else cuz like that's what that's what we do here sure like there's that yeah like in my teen years oh it's a place where I can just be myself and know a my school knows and then it turned into you know finding like queer people like you and then like trans people like other people and then just being like oh I'm myself growing from that so nobody in your high school knew about your channel it came out like before I came out that came out those who don't know what would you sum up is your coming-out journey transitioning journey yeah when someone asks like how was our coming-out process I'm like I've had multiple and the thing is with me the first thing I ever came out was as was gay I always say like if I was in a safe space and had the Delaine which is put how I felt at a young age I would been going back he him from the get-go but that wasn't a thing and the only things I knew about trans were it was bad and like this isn't OK from the immediate people around me environment is such a big factor I watched this documentary on Vice the other day and I'll put the link in the description below but it was talking about how in Sweden one of the s countries in preschool they don't they don't use gender pronouns for the children at all the gender pronoun that they use is hen we don't have an equivalent for in the English language then when they get older the kids start you deciding what pronoun to use and that's amazing isn't that great wait yeah in preschool guys preschool so did you internally realize your sexuality and your gender identity around I was really gender identity first when I was a kid it was like really early things where it's like I wanted you know to cut my hair I was always on the boys sports teams and then you know I'd get kicked off because I was like the girl I never even felt like I was different I was just me and like this was just me like all my friends were guys I liked everything the guys did remember when I was eight years old I was like singled out and was told that I couldn't like play some game we're like a bunch of boys because I was a girl I remember having hit my stomach being like wait like what and what my friends actually stood up for me we're eight years old and he goes oh no he's cool she's just a boy stuck in a girl's body literally said that as an angel we never had a conversation and everyone's like oh okay and I was allowed to play the coming-out process for me was bad it wasn't good it was all bad so I remember like literally the first time it was like the worst thing ever thinking well now I can never explore my gender identity because this was bad I don't do this again so I just kind of like ate that for a long time and then was thrown it's like you know like the lesbian community and I never won't use the word lesbian I always used gay I always say gay because that's just I always thought of it you know blanket term same-sex attraction we need to separate the terms and even still like I love to operate in a space where I don't like to necessarily identify as one thing or another like I know I'm a guy like I'm just like a boy and like that's what it is but with my sexuality I don't like to necessarily define it like if someone asks I'm gonna have to know like I'll say queer because like I've been with girls I am currently with someone who doesn't identify with a gender or sexuality it's like gender neutrality I love and it's like well that's not gay and that's not straight we just are people and do what you want to do here's the shocker what if we just say I'm with and then say their name it's not about their gender it's not about your gender we can just say I'm so-and-so and I'm in love with this person you know a label is just a word that like pretty pretty packages you up and gives it another person yeah labels have their pros in there one they create community so in areas where you're marginalized and you don't have the ability you don't know who is going through a similar experience that's a benefit of the label because you can find community but then again they create categories that really kind of put boundaries between us so that's a private title life and I'm sorry that the coming-out experience didn't go well it sucks yeah that was the best to keep that the coming-out experience accent yeah it's hard it's it's a thing it really be sucky it's so vulnerable and there's so much put on the moment of like coming out and I feel like when you're at the moment and you come out to everyone it's kind of weird like well now what what advice would you give to people coming out based off of what happened in your experience I would say to come out to yourself first before anyone else at the end of the day you want to make sure you like you and then after that the good people will start coming out the Woodworks I love that it's so easy to be a sad teenager and I always say this and I can't stress it enough it's so easy I was that it's so easy to be stuck in your bubble of home which is really small in your school which is a little bigger but still smaller and then your community the world is much bigger it's so much bigger than that plus or you live in a time where we have the internet but for the first time in all of history you can communicate with someone on the other side of the world that feels exactly the same that you do and you can grow from that yeah and even just watching youtubers it's like watching your coming-out videos helped me so much in my process because it's like cool someone else out there gets it alright I'll be fine gets better and then words and then better it does genuinely get better would you say gets better Oh a million four seven I first one three my coming-out process so many bad things happen I was the kid who has a self Harmer I was the kid who had to sleep in their car some nights because that's that's all that they could do and this year I went on tour and I made safe spaces across the country talking to young kids who are like queer and trans and their parents I got a text from my mom saying hey like break a leg today I please make a difference and that's something I never would never would have expected you know two years ago miles and remember I tweeted I was like this sounds so cliche but I put the date I'm like it gets better because I was the kid who literally tweeted after I first came out saying do not come out because it was so much easier being silent my boy was than having everyone hate me I'm done and now I'm like oh my gosh if I hadn't gone through that I wouldn't be me it's more familiar to hide this secret in my body mm-hmm but it will be easier for you to live the rest of your life holy you know maybe not right away but on the long-term yeah you want to start that journey do you have any advice for people who are nervous about coming out to their parents especially given that you had a negative experiences beginning yeah I found a lot of solace and having empathy for others and I think a big misconception is that you know your parents are evil and they're misgendering you because they hate you and they want you to feel bad it's like no everyone thinks that they're the superhero no and everything's of the villain of like their story everyone thinks that they're the good guy and that lgbtq+ is evil and it's taking away their kid they just wanna help you people react poorly to things because they're afraid of that I'll have all the information so giving people time and being strong enough in yourself knowing who you are to be like I'm gonna sit back I'm not gonna engage that much I'm gonna let them do their thing but I'm sure as hell gonna do my thing Wow yeah double light comes up I totally agree like this video if you agree in a way and this is gonna sound different from how I mean it in a way you almost have to be patient with their ignorance as long as they're trying to learn back from the day they didn't have social media where everyone could be friends the kids that were gay were outcasts the kids that were trans were super underground about it and they're like oh no I don't want that for my kid yeah which miles is why you know thank you so much for making your channel and being so open about your journey because this this is representation and this goes for you guys at home to just being yourself is an act of resistance right it's an act of putting yourself out there and being like look I mean when people come out it's like you know and they speak out about things they're coming after those that can't right now because there's so many kids that would love to but just don't have the words to put to it yet you don't know who you are right now that's also so fine life's all about growth just keep doing your thing yeah be around people that you want to be around and just spread love there's only one rule just be kind yeah because yeah boo Boop okay thank you guys so much for watching my thank you so much for being here thank you so much she is pretty good you guys want to check out more of

Morgan one of my favorite teachers a man whose approach and dedication to education and his students had saved many lives including mine being admitted to Berkeley was not only great because of its academic reputation but also because it was in the Bay Area I wouldn't have to leave my mother or my sister behind they would only be a bart ride away I was also provided with financial aid assistance in the form of work study life was looking up everything was falling into place and I was determined not to screw it up and to do better than I ever had academically I had been blessed and I would not squander the gifts the Lord had provided so freshman year I was a good Christian girl who wore a cross and lived in Freeborn Hall the substance-free dorm on campus that year I didn't party much and I went around to Christian Church groups trying to find the one that was liberal enough for my political views and had a man that I could marry despite dabbling and dating in high school I had yet to fall in love or experience that head-over-heels feeling I was determined to find a partner so my real life could begin at that time I also chose a major communications specializing in advertising which eventually switched to English Lit at that time I also continued my studies of French which eventually switched to Japanese and at that time I was also bullshitting myself a lot which actually no that stuck around for quite a bit I read more of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter fanfic than was healthy and kept my mind as tightly locked in a fantasy as I could sure maybe I was avoiding something but what about Draco and Harry huh what were they avoiding their love for each other I shipped that shiz when the holidays arrived I would stay on campus and continued to work my financial aid provided me with meal points but when classes were out of session the dining halls were all closed I remember one rainy week must have been just before spring break walking across the campus carrying boxes of instant mac and cheese that I had planned to make in the microwave I'd live on that all week pasta never let you down and if I wanted a real hot meal I could take the train an hour and a half south to visit my father or back across the peninsula to visit Maggie and her adoptive family the holidays were lonely but when school was back in session I was happy as a clam I loved being in the dorms because I loved being surrounded by people all studying different things during that first year at school I met one of my to this day closest friends Becca I don't know why we were so instantly fond of each other on paper we were totally different Becca had a very ride dry outlook on the world bordering on pessimistic yet she was supportive and delightful and hilarious once I invited her to go check out some church event with me and her deadpan reply was Jesus on a weekday needless to say I never did find a church that was quite the right fit Jehovah's Witnesses were against all other forms of religion no matter how Christian they seemed I knew I didn't want to be a witness because that shit was crazy but I still love Jesus and God and I wanted to continue my worship I just couldn't figure out how as freshman year was coming to a close and despite efforts to convince myself that I had crushes on the guys around me I could never maintain my interest or find a spark still no boyfriend / future husband I figured it was because my childhood had screwed me up I was damaged goods and capable of loving anyone romantically possibly ever becoming a nun was starting to seem like an option but instead of moving to a nunnery I did the next best thing and moved into a 60 person all-female co-op a co-op is an off-campus public house open to anyone attending a school nearby Hoyt Hall had 60 other girls living in it and was sure to keep me chaste and safe from the devil's fornications I moved to avoid boys so I could avoid being so tempted yep nothing but me and the ladies safe from all physical desires yep yep yep oh the lies we tell ourselves that first of all at Whitehall was very full and fast our co-op operated on communal labor everyone had work shifts and there were management positions along with those shifts we each pulled our weight to maintain our home together I shared a double room with a girl named Lanna who was so brilliant and strong that we did push-up contest as study breaks and I meant so many other wonderfully strong and interesting people in that house transfer students five-year graduates women from differing racial and socio-economic genomic backgrounds women who like to have open and frank discussions about mental health women who knew how to cook women who knew how to eat women with different abilities and talents women who struggled and triumphed they all challenged and inspired me in every possible way oh and I met lesbians they're bona fide out-and-proud lesbians obviously I avoided them like the plague but I flirted with all the straight girls but not like in a gay way of course because being gay was gross oh I was just flirting with girls who am i had tingly feelings for because you know friendship part of me believed I was exploring the freedom being flirtatious on girls to prep for the boys because anytime I flirtations with a straight identifying girl led to a quiet confessions of feelings on her behalf I would reject her and tell her that she had been misinterpreting my intentions all along then at night before bed I would read my Bible and pray pray for a husband as I did every night prayed for Jehovah to bring me a husband late in the semester before winter break crept up I found out I'd be getting a single room in the spring someone joked that it would be the year I would for sure get some lovin and I'm sure I gave them a thumbs up in return the single room was available because it was the smallest in the house the width of a large walk-in closet but it was the first time in my life I would have a room all to myself so I was thrilled a bedroom of my own design how blessed these new beginnings were sure to be the first night I spent in that room I read a scripture that struck me when you asked you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures James 4:3 I remember to talk in the kingdom hall that my father had given about how we could not pray for specific things because it might not be in God's plan for us to have them instead we must pray for the strength behind those things for the meaning behind them I'd spent more than a year-and-a-half praying for God to help me find a husband but maybe I hadn't found him because I hadn't been capable of it that night instead of my usual prayers for a man to sweep me off my feet I prayed lord please help me to understand my heart please guide me towards love oh shit and then I met my first girlfriend and there was lots of trouble if you guys

yay perfect back together again if we don't love ourselves you want to be a part of the family hey guys this week we are going to be discussing love Oh Katie thank you so much for being here I wanted to talk to you about something that happened a couple weeks ago on my twitter which was this I was having some thoughts about like self-love and the struggle to like make sure you're not over prioritizing other people's needs over your needs something I really struggle with and so I was tweeting out you can't love somebody until you love yourself it's a good message that's what I thought I was really surprised to find that there was a lot of had hearse reactions to this statement people thought I was attacking people with mental illnesses and I myself as someone who has been very open talking about my own struggles and my family struggles with mental illness I was really taken aback by their feelings of being attacked I'm sorry to anyone who was hurt by my tweet I Juliette anyway I want to talk to you about it Katie do you have to love yourself first before you can love somebody else the real answer is no you there's no pressure to love yourself before loving someone else absolutely and I feel like this sentence is perpetuated a lot like you can't love somebody until you love yourself but maybe can't is way too strong a word you absolutely can but it's important to remember to prioritize your own journey of self-love we're all striving for healthy relationships right we all want things to go well we want to feel good we want to feel connected and I think that's where the miscommunication is is because we can love someone else even if we feel really terrible about who we are what we're going through however a healthy relationship is born out of both people coming from a self-love place cause if I don't let myself I've been in these relationships trust me I'm not loving on myself I'm not taking care of myself I feel really shitty about Who I am then when I'm going out looking for someone else I found in my life I'm looking for them to like fill that void and to make me happy which isn't the role that someone can play conversely as someone who also really struggled with feelings of self worth and self love and going away from self-harm I wasn't looking for someone to fill my void because I didn't even care about my void it was more like I would just give and give and give and love and love and love because that's all I was good enough to do and hey look this good person is happy and they're with me so therefore I'm doing something right but it was actually coming from a really toxic place and I think that's a great point to make because the reason the message I hope you hear from me is that yes we can love people when we don't love ourselves but often we find ourselves in unhealthy relationships as a result and that doesn't make us less able to give the love but we want to make sure it's coming out of a healthy happy place even if you're in a healthy relationship it is really hard when you don't have a natural kind of setting like I am worthy it's easy to default until your feelings of self-loathing which unfortunately manifests not negatively towards your partner but your partner is someone who loves you doesn't like to see you hurting yeah it's not that you can't love someone else it's that because of your love for them you also have to remember that they love you and they want you to love you yeah we're using this big broad term love but I think also the thing to remember is that we're all works in progress right like we're gonna have good days bad days there's gonna be times when I am looking to Shawn to make me feel better cuz I'm feeling terrible but that shouldn't be the whole rhythm of your relationship what we're really getting at is that a healthy relationship is give and take and if we aren't coming from a place of some self love and some self-care I always talk about how important self-care is if we're not able to do that for ourselves we honestly can't verbalize and can't ask for what we need from the person who loves us and be able to give them what they need when they ask from us Kati does anyone love themselves a hundred percent a hundred percent of the time all of us have like I said we go in and out we can have really bad days and we gonna really great days and that's why relationships are give and take and that's why you both have to have your like love Wells full yeah so you have stuff to give out I really want to make clear that I don't believe that someone who has struggles with self-love is incapable of loving another person rather I want to remind those of us who have overcome feelings of severe self-loathing that you have to remember to keep loving yourself even after you've got into a safe and healthy place in a relationship we just have to get up every day and try to sure solve some love show those in our lives in love and overall we'll all feel better and it's a mutual exchange between you and your partner Oh Katie had one more question and this is something that I saw a lot in this people were saying so neurotypical what is neurotypical mean the term neurotypical itself is that's of interesting cuz it's actually a term used in the autism spectrum it's a way to describe people who aren't on the spectrum at all they about two yes/no developmental issues okay neurotypical individuals often assume that their experience of the world is the only one or the only correct one so if someone left a comment about that it might be like you don't understand cuz you don't feel what I feel which we can't feel what other people feel we're only speaking from our own experience and our own expertise maybe they're trying to call me basic and frankly I also have basic C yeah look at that spice latte here we come hey guys thank you so much for watching JD Lauren and thank you for being yours thanks for hangin on of course if you

H: HaaAAAh! What a disturbing intimacy! Z: Yeah, yeah! She may have worn this while you guys came over together. (NOO and car skkrrting sound effect) (glass breaking sound effect) H: You know, once I saw at this video on the internet. It was called "Why Aren't We Dating?" H: I don't know when or where that was made, so I thought like, H: Maybe a couple months in! Z: I've known your girlfriend for so long; we went to college together, we knew each other after college, Z: She got me my job. H: I hope that's the only kind... (Try Guys in background: WHOAAA) H: GUYS, IT'S A SPICY SHOW!!! K: I gotta hand it to ya! Z: We've always gotten along.  H: You and me? Z: Yeah H: Yeah! Don't worry! Z: Been waiting to get me on camera to be like "Hey, you want to date my f***in girlfriend??" K: Holy shit, Ella's back! H: My love yayyy H: I know that you have quite a handful of food allergies? Z: It's like, "What /can/ I eat?" is the real question. Can't eat dairy, red pepper just like, rushes through me. H: I like that feeling, clean me out. Z: Beets randomly feels like a little man is just stabbing me in the stomach. H: Really? (Z: mhmm.) Wait a minute, am I allergic to beets? Are you Ashkenazi? Z: Yes. Z: We're a resilient but weak people. H: My stomach often is upset. Z: Do you eat cheese? Or dairy? H: I eat all sorts of things, yeah, but I feel like, like i have a knife in my body periodically, every day. Z: How are the poops? H: The boobs? Z: The poops. H: Well, you know. Give or take. Z: They're not good. H: They're not great. Z: You know, a thing - that we don't talk about how we poop, if I can use this platform for a moment, and so you don't realize your poops aren't normal 'till you stop and think about it (H: That's right.), you shouldn't be in pain when you poop every single day. Z: Pay attention to what you're eatin. H: So how did you figure this stuff out? Z: I did a lot of blood tests, I had to do a ton of elimination diets, so I had a month where I just couldn't eat anything! And then I - and then I'm talking like couldn't eat chicken, couldn't eat eggs, couldn't eat soy, couldn't eat dairy, couldn't eat nuts? Like, like, only specific types of nuts! Z: It was like, every single food in the world I couldn't eat, and then I slowly reintroduced them, and then any time one of them made me feel like I wanted to curl over and die, I'm like, "Oh, that one I can't eat!" H: What a brave journey you've taken. Z: It's - it's really uhh... H: But good for you! Does it - H: Do you feel like you have more life in you now that you don't hurt every day? Z: Yeah, cutting out dairy has been one of the best things I've ever done, so let's make a four-layer pizza so I have no choice but to eat the dairy! H: Well you do always have a choice. I don't want you to hurt. Z: I wasn't comforted until you put both your hands on my hand, and I'm like yeah, (H: I could -) she's taking care of me. H: Yeah, I take care. H: There it is. H: So, pizza sauce! Will it kill you? Yeah. Z: Uh, no. Pizza sauce, I can do. H: Great, love it! Z: Just lather it on. Z: O-Oh, I should tell you, I am, uh, the worst cook ever. I don't cook anything. H: You know, I do recall a certain video about bread? Z: Yeah, oh, you hate it! H: Let's take a look, via this card! Z: I'm so sorry about that, by the way. Z: What's happening here? Did you forget to pam spray? H: No, I forgot nothing. H: Here's what I've found in pizza cake making (Z: uh-huh), take the bottom part that you have ripped from the parchment paper - see how this is textured? - and flip it over! So effectively, you're using the top of the bagel as the bottom! Z: Steppings are important! H: Mhmm! *Hannah and Zach hitting the dough* Z: Okay. H: Yeah! *more dough hitting* H: Ah, I love it! Okay, so next we do pizza sauce. Put a little bit right there. *Zach and Try Guys in background laughing* H: You see, grab this spoon, take this spoon, and then - Z: Ohhhh, my loooooveeee (Try Guys giggling), my daaarling! Z: That was good! H: I huuuuunger fooor our lunch! That won't! (Z: by the way -) Hurt my stomach! Z: 70% of my time with Hannah is spent at karaoke.

I love what you're doing with the pizza, I love the style (Z: I love ciiircleees), I love the spread, it's good it's good it's good! Z: You know, I got a low bar set, and I am going to hop it! H: I have to say, Zach, that for someone who has so many severe allergies, (Z: I don't let it stop me!) you are not a wet blanket at all. H: It's like, oh my God, what an unexpected delight! You have significantly improved my evening! Z: Thank you! H: Yes!!! Own that, dude!!! H: Do you know how many people out there are like "Hey everybody, here's my discomfort"? Z: Tons. H: Tons!!!

Z: I love turkey pepperoni! Z: I just wanna say this (H: yo, bruh!), on the record? (Hannah beatboxing) Z: Turkeys are dumb, and we should eat all of them. Z: Because they're dumber than other animals, and they're delicious. (Ned making airhorn noises) (Airhorn sound effect) Z: They'll take a wooden turkey head - just the head! - and they'll levitate it, and male turkeys will try and f**k the invisible turkey K: Yeahhh... Z: Let's eat them all! K: I've been there. H: Dude, I am - that's why - (All laughing) H: Sadly, there's no broccoli. Z: Hey, there's broccoli right here! H: Just kidding! H: Let's rinse it, so here, you can grab - Z: Do we have to wash it? Z: I - I love the taste of uh, uh, K: Penis H: E-coli?? Z: Yeah, E-coli! H: Broccoli! Z: What a cute colander! H: Yeah! Z: It's like a little sunflower. H: Yeah! Z: You know, I was going to apologize for Ned, but now I feel like I gotta apologize for myself. H: Yeah, we all feel that way after a My Drunk Kitchen.

saying it look how great viral okay boom hi guys this week I'm joined by the wonderful miles for Canada so - and let's do the basics bring it from I was born in Los Angeles but like my childhood was Las Vegas 10 years Orange County so always like a West Coast boy okay cool I love the West Coast when did you get started on YouTube um I started when I was 11 years old so I'm 21 now so you've been on YouTube the full decade Oh like this year is the 10 years and a 2015 that started being like a thing where it's like oh now people are watching how would you describe your channel uh uh people look at that and I'll just be like you know I make lgbtq+ content but also try to be funny like everyone else cuz like that's what that's what we do here sure like there's that yeah like in my teen years oh it's a place where I can just be myself and know a my school knows and then it turned into you know finding like queer people like you and then like trans people like other people and then just being like oh I'm myself growing from that so nobody in your high school knew about your channel it came out like before I came out that came out those who don't know what would you sum up is your coming-out journey transitioning journey yeah when someone asks like how was our coming-out process I'm like I've had multiple and the thing is with me the first thing I ever came out was as was gay I always say like if I was in a safe space and had the Delaine which is put how I felt at a young age I would been going back he him from the get-go but that wasn't a thing and the only things I knew about trans were it was bad and like this isn't OK from the immediate people around me environment is such a big factor I watched this documentary on Vice the other day and I'll put the link in the description below but it was talking about how in Sweden one of the s countries in preschool they don't they don't use gender pronouns for the children at all the gender pronoun that they use is hen we don't have an equivalent for in the English language then when they get older the kids start you deciding what pronoun to use and that's amazing isn't that great wait yeah in preschool guys preschool so did you internally realize your sexuality and your gender identity around I was really gender identity first when I was a kid it was like really early things where it's like I wanted you know to cut my hair I was always on the boys sports teams and then you know I'd get kicked off because I was like the girl I never even felt like I was different I was just me and like this was just me like all my friends were guys I liked everything the guys did remember when I was eight years old I was like singled out and was told that I couldn't like play some game we're like a bunch of boys because I was a girl I remember having hit my stomach being like wait like what and what my friends actually stood up for me we're eight years old and he goes oh no he's cool she's just a boy stuck in a girl's body literally said that as an angel we never had a conversation and everyone's like oh okay and I was allowed to play the coming-out process for me was bad it wasn't good it was all bad so I remember like literally the first time it was like the worst thing ever thinking well now I can never explore my gender identity because this was bad I don't do this again so I just kind of like ate that for a long time and then was thrown it's like you know like the lesbian community and I never won't use the word lesbian I always used gay I always say gay because that's just I always thought of it you know blanket term same-sex attraction we need to separate the terms and even still like I love to operate in a space where I don't like to necessarily identify as one thing or another like I know I'm a guy like I'm just like a boy and like that's what it is but with my sexuality I don't like to necessarily define it like if someone asks I'm gonna have to know like I'll say queer because like I've been with girls I am currently with someone who doesn't identify with a gender or sexuality it's like gender neutrality I love and it's like well that's not gay and that's not straight we just are people and do what you want to do here's the shocker what if we just say I'm with and then say their name it's not about their gender it's not about your gender we can just say I'm so-and-so and I'm in love with this person you know a label is just a word that like pretty pretty packages you up and gives it another person yeah labels have their pros in there one they create community so in areas where you're marginalized and you don't have the ability you don't know who is going through a similar experience that's a benefit of the label because you can find community but then again they create categories that really kind of put boundaries between us so that's a private title life and I'm sorry that the coming-out experience didn't go well it sucks yeah that was the best to keep that the coming-out experience accent yeah it's hard it's it's a thing it really be sucky it's so vulnerable and there's so much put on the moment of like coming out and I feel like when you're at the moment and you come out to everyone it's kind of weird like well now what what advice would you give to people coming out based off of what happened in your experience I would say to come out to yourself first before anyone else at the end of the day you want to make sure you like you and then after that the good people will start coming out the Woodworks I love that it's so easy to be a sad teenager and I always say this and I can't stress it enough it's so easy I was that it's so easy to be stuck in your bubble of home which is really small in your school which is a little bigger but still smaller and then your community the world is much bigger it's so much bigger than that plus or you live in a time where we have the internet but for the first time in all of history you can communicate with someone on the other side of the world that feels exactly the same that you do and you can grow from that yeah and even just watching youtubers it's like watching your coming-out videos helped me so much in my process because it's like cool someone else out there gets it alright I'll be fine gets better and then words and then better it does genuinely get better would you say gets better Oh a million four seven I first one three my coming-out process so many bad things happen I was the kid who has a self Harmer I was the kid who had to sleep in their car some nights because that's that's all that they could do and this year I went on tour and I made safe spaces across the country talking to young kids who are like queer and trans and their parents I got a text from my mom saying hey like break a leg today I please make a difference and that's something I never would never would have expected you know two years ago miles and remember I tweeted I was like this sounds so cliche but I put the date I'm like it gets better because I was the kid who literally tweeted after I first came out saying do not come out because it was so much easier being silent my boy was than having everyone hate me I'm done and now I'm like oh my gosh if I hadn't gone through that I wouldn't be me it's more familiar to hide this secret in my body mm-hmm but it will be easier for you to live the rest of your life holy you know maybe not right away but on the long-term yeah you want to start that journey do you have any advice for people who are nervous about coming out to their parents especially given that you had a negative experiences beginning yeah I found a lot of solace and having empathy for others and I think a big misconception is that you know your parents are evil and they're misgendering you because they hate you and they want you to feel bad it's like no everyone thinks that they're the superhero no and everything's of the villain of like their story everyone thinks that they're the good guy and that lgbtq+ is evil and it's taking away their kid they just wanna help you people react poorly to things because they're afraid of that I'll have all the information so giving people time and being strong enough in yourself knowing who you are to be like I'm gonna sit back I'm not gonna engage that much I'm gonna let them do their thing but I'm sure as hell gonna do my thing Wow yeah double light comes up I totally agree like this video if you agree in a way and this is gonna sound different from how I mean it in a way you almost have to be patient with their ignorance as long as they're trying to learn back from the day they didn't have social media where everyone could be friends the kids that were gay were outcasts the kids that were trans were super underground about it and they're like oh no I don't want that for my kid yeah which miles is why you know thank you so much for making your channel and being so open about your journey because this this is representation and this goes for you guys at home to just being yourself is an act of resistance right it's an act of putting yourself out there and being like look I mean when people come out it's like you know and they speak out about things they're coming after those that can't right now because there's so many kids that would love to but just don't have the words to put to it yet you don't know who you are right now that's also so fine life's all about growth just keep doing your thing yeah be around people that you want to be around and just spread love there's only one rule just be kind yeah because yeah boo Boop okay thank you guys so much for watching my thank you so much for being here thank you so much she is pretty good you guys want to check out more of miles go over to his channel I put the links in the description below and you can find more of me here online by clicking like subscribe notifications and watching me Mondays at 10 p.m. only on the Food Network Mama have a great day yeah 
oh this is totally awesome oh don't do that at home kids oh I love this room she's nervous it's their first time on camera hey guys today is an extra special day for multiple reasons one I'm joined by Mayim Bialik and two we're gonna talk about cats three mine is a neuroscientist did you guys know that when you went for your masters or when you decided to go make the decision to go to college did you have difficulty giving your life prior fame I think that because my time on blossom was in such formative years I was 14 to 19 on that show I was really ready to have more of a normal life I really craved the world of academia I did a PhD which is seven extra years on top of your undergrads I was in school for 12 years it's a long time but I really liked that environment like I never had to wear makeup or worry about anybody looking at me like it was really fun and all some of those years but did you feel like people when you went in I got a knock up in my cup do you feel like if you feel like it into a recognizable figure did that impact your social life I mean I was always kind of a weird kid I was a weird teenager I'm a weird adult so I don't think that my social life was helped by being on television but I think also like it's important to remember that like even though blossom was was popular with young people it was never like the number one show in America like Big Bang Theory is so my fame was actually kind of different whose manage I was very recognizable and you know all the boys in college when they have beers at parties yelling you know like why did you choose neuroscience I wanted to understand really the smallest unit of our understanding and that is the neuron and the electrical impulses that create all those sensations that we experience that's neuroscience 101 for those of you that need your finished version now since your nose just I'm going to pick your brain get up Oh pick your brain pick your brain yes about cats that was super smooth here comes the man of the yeah so here's a question I've got Charles sometimes Charles likes to get up on my shoulders a lot yes and sometimes when he's up there at first I think he's just trying to like figure out his balance but he'll be up here making biscuits turn up a storm yeah it's like amazing he's needing my shoulder he's just like this and anyway he's happy and he's soft and quiet but why why do you that's it that's a very particular oh that's a very particular feline behavior and what it's designed to do is to push milk out of a teat so when when kittens or other mammals I mean even humans do this when they're nursing they want to get the milk to come out faster it's like thumbs up one of my friends has a cat that actually sucks their own nipple is that weird this is the doctor's opinion that's weird I'll like be licking and then all of a sudden he'll be like no here's another question doctor when I first took Charles to my office which I sometimes shoot out of I just brought like a cardboard box and I dumped his litter in it I picked him up I showed him where it was and he's never had an accident I don't know that I have like a doctor explanation of this but I think it's one of the amazing things about cats which is not true dogs and I know that there are people who love dogs but you don't have to take a cat outside and tell it go peepee they just know where the boxes and they use it that's amazing to only go outside the box cuz they're marking territory out of insecurity either they don't feel like they've established themselves in the space which might be because they don't have anything that belongs to them correct you know imagine if you were a human living in a cat world and nobody gave you I don't know YouTube the access to the Internet what would you do you'd be on out of anger now do you love all God's creatures I'm vegan so one of the ways I show that all God's creatures is I don't eat this is very faint I'd spite rusty I totally fake I know I do it but cats are really kind of my things yeah I am especially heroes boys okay I had a pop quiz quiz featuring Mayim Bialik yes perfect what is on the surface of a cat's tongue little barbs little barbs is right okay bonus question one of the little barbs made of unicorn fairy dust very close the same material as your cuticles why mm-hmm a cat's tongue is covered with cuticles that are facing the opposite direction I never knew it so that when they're licking that's why the opponent that's what it does or your skin their or your skin and you're like oh okay next question why does Charles have this Fupa um you know I would guess just for good looks it's true you have a beautiful body so this part of this soft baby belly this part right here is actually it helps him balance when he runs smell so good too sorry he helps to balance when you run it helps you like outside he's just he's intoxicated he is yeah it helps in balance when he runs so when cats run they actually have their stomach that that area of their body goes back and forth to help them run faster that looks like a cow it looks like a nutter it is like a nutter and I mean that I'm not utter shaming you tale language do you know that cat tail language tail puffy means mad tail puppy means mad tail whipping back and forth means like some hunter instinct has been hit right what else what about tail straight up scared nope taffy mm-hmm tell Serena it means confident because when a cat is not feeling and their killer cover the specialty bring their tails down on a covered or special but they're all special cards I'm doing this is curious exploring when they're like this like if you come home that's running at you like this that means that they're happy confident I use I like to know that yes they're always showing you their buttholes yep it's really an act of trust as always in it always I have a question for the cat quiz yes can you make a boy into a girl cats is touching on some transgender issues I'd like to a boy my my cat was converted from a male to a female he was getting repeated kidney stones in his urethra and they converted his urethra to a female opening when he was about three years old Wow did you know cats lower your blood pressure that's sure what it feels like when I hold my cats yeah it's not just a feeling it's a fact it's true they actually are really good for people with high blood pressure they're really good for people with anxiety or depression I think all pets are really yes you know for their in particular pets licked touch like Charles wait what was your field of specialty psycho neuroendocrinology obsessive compulsive disorder oh oh yeah so do cats have OCD cats do have OCD behaviors and actually a lot of what we know about obsessive-compulsive disorder in humans it's the same set of hormones in all other primates and and other mammals as well so actually a lot of the grooming behaviors that cats participate in our bonding behaviors which if kind of let go out of control can look a lot like OCD so skin picking and things like that even nail biting cats will do those things to cats will pick up their fur those are things that are on the spectrum of obsessive compulsive disorder in all animals speaking of grooming look at head mean it's a little grooming that they've got so little hair did you know why cats groom themselves so much do you know why they're always cleaning themselves off because it feels good because if he is getting hit was there prey animals also so editors and price if you kill a bird yes and you're covered in blood it is attractive to other things yes right and then there's the the head bunting thing you know that one no I know the rub all the whiskers are connected to hormones that feel good the barrel of the cat's mouth which usually has whiskers and all sorts of receptors for good things when they rub up against things it releases feel-good hormones that's why when cats want to bond and feel close to they will rub their faces up against oh oh that's nice it works for you instead of my own thank you so much for being here thank you I am so happy that we got to do this we're gonna keep playing with Charles next because really frankly it's that's all she wants to date why I'm here I have to say you were the best person to ever come and greet Charles because she just

this year on my drunk Christmas kitchen I've decided to make a gingerbread house bet Dana any gingerbread house a savory gingerbread house of my own design earlier today good morning everybody it's a bright and beautiful Christmas day happy Christmas to you and yours I am in Big Bear ooh at a cabin we're gonna go skiing a little later on but before we do I'm going to begin construction of my savory gingerbread house server the structure of the house I'm gonna use ricotta instead of frosting and these wheat flour crackers that taste like their building material anyway frankly so here we go [Music] okay so I've done the initial base layer here I've got my little garlic garlic posts that are gonna make the structure I'm gonna go stick this in the freezer and return to it in a couple hours hopefully it'll be good okay let's see there we go okay it's working I I have a lot of faith in myself but I also can't believe this is working knock on wood we're gonna do the roof because our foundation is set but before I do the roof I think I've earned a little treat okay maybe we do like a little wabi-sabi indoor-outdoor look check this out okay now ours is a humble abode but it's home look at that unfortunately though we are now out of crackers ah there's lots we don't know why and now this many hours later so as I was saying Christmas is the season of giving giving what you mask a damn about anything at all scared a second wow talk about a shower oh that's uh more like it oh so what makes a house a home let's ask each other hi oh thank God I didn't knock over this thing I spent so long making so what's the first element of making a house a home no idea getting inside it probably just kidding I'm not gonna ruin this yet so we're gonna start from the outside in by doing some general landscaping I'm using ricotta instead of frosting as you can tell it's working really well and this is perfect Wow so I think now this is a very snowy scene but what those snowy scene without more snow so I'm taking some mashed potatoes and adding it all around the bottom of the home whoa we're snowed in how romantic what a great plot for an erotic fan fiction but winter isn't just about the freezing cold there's also life that survives so here's a tiny tiny Oh God so here's a tiny bush look at you springing through the bitter bitter broken up Wow beautiful I'm tired oh the best part about making a savory gingerbread house is that you can eat as you go oh thank you just a light does he not know that a Christmas time no ok so let's actually we're gonna put a little snow also on top of this bush oh my god oh my god in bed oh we're gonna do oh but despite that there's some things blossoming out oh wow this is really precious okay good yeah wow this is really good we got a weird chant Pokemon looking creature so the next things in this house needs it's probably a front doors okay so this is a front door which means everything beneath it that's now the basement because again because according to HGTV having a house with an unfinished basement is a common problem okay now for some good luck we're gonna make this a red door okay great so now we have a red door and a windowless house I think we're done oh geez Oh Louise oh you know what they taught me it's not okay some windows eyes are the windows to the soul so let's give this house some although it's cute oh my god no it's like a little dog let's just add some more bushes being here we go go let me get chimney there's a chimney now the chimney okay yeah sounds like a chimney yeah very chimney not just like a head wound singing about peppers which are the worst all right this Christmas house is cutest what else does it mean Christmas lights brightly colored bell pepper babies do do do do do do do do [Music] [Applause] Wow yeah there you have a totally savory gingerbread house made with nothing but delicious tasty ingredients we got potato broccoli cherry tomato ricotta cheese nasty crackers bell peppers which are fine so what and olives and olives but why should we do now it feels like it's over too soon I haven't felt a sense of completion from this project you know what they say the bake it till you make it [Music] have yourself a merry little Christmas make the Yuletide yay I can't thank you so much for watching and you loved as of yet unnamed tinyface creation thank you so much for being here I'm so used to having a guest I have to build one from cheese if you guys enjoyed this video please click like and subscribe but more importantly than that please have a Merry Christmas enjoy the time spent with people that you love even if that person you love is just you and spending time alone that wouldn't be bad you can make new friends and then destroy the Reds Happy Holidays everybody Merry Christmas move on and have a great New Year kiss me soon I will haunt your dreams 
and so the other day I was scrolling through the Internet's endless web full of uh web I get it full of information etc etc and I saw the title of an article that said are we ready for a gay president and I didn't even click on it because in my mind my natural response was well there's probably already been a gay president he just wasn't out like for sure out of 45 presidents one of them was gay potentially a lot more of them I still my answer - are we ready for a gay president is this we've probably already had one in fact a lot of people believe that America's 15th President James Buchanan was in fact a closeted homosexual who had a relationship with the senator from Alabama Rufus King why however Buchanan was not a great dude pro-slavery not the best president definitely not someone I would have voted for in being gay even if you had been like running on like I'm an out gay man agenda I would not have voted for this guy because his politics do not correspond with mine which leads me to this someone sexuality or gender identity is totally irrelevant to me as a voter I don't care who you love or don't love maybe you're asexual I don't care I care about where you stand for on policies and issues so here we are in 2018 with a huge huge huge midterm election coming around the corner and I just asked you guys to pay attention to the issues that matter to you not every single issue out there on the planet just think of things that matter to you and follow the candidates that support the thinking that you have so yes guess what this video is asking you to make sure you're registered to vote registered to vote what register to vote registered oh okay ready it's up to you register to vote register to vote why what register oh you know do some basic research just fix buddy who seems nice are we ready for a gay president we've probably already had one are we ready for a gay president doesn't matter to me are we ready to take America into a better brighter future that's hopefully safer and then hey maybe we can focus on that to things like renewable energy or maybe even getting to space I really felt Star Trek would have happened by now at the end of the day if we ever have an openly gay candidate that runs for president I just hope that they've lived a life that they're proud of and the proud of the decisions that they've made and they haven't had to harbor too much shame and secrecy surrounding it that stuff is toxic dude that stuff is toxic point being find issues that are important to you think about those issues and make sure you're registered to vote and vote for someone based on the issues that matter view the most benefit that that obviously it's a lot more complicated in there's a lot more research you can do however it's important to just get started participating in politics because this has a direct effect on the lives of safety and love of the people in your life and yourself my babies please register to vote and then vote for people who stand for you America I really love this country I don't know what to say I love it I love it here that's it for me guys have your President's Day have you enjoyed your three-day weekend let me know in the comments below do you believe every weekend should be three days long me too wouldn't that be great why aren't the weeks four and three wouldn't that just be better for everyone Dave do your laundry do whatever you need to do click like subscribe and make sure you watch another video you know cuz it's fun here you're welcome to be here not like you're welcome but like you're welcome ok ok have a great day 
protip a lot of people say they don't know whether or not they've had an orgasm in my personal opinion if you doing it for long enough I think you're gonna find out hey guys it's me Hannah and I'm here this week to talk to you about sex yeah why not you knows about sex that's a great question mainly I'm here because I have heard very very often from people I know friends family well not family I'm here because I've heard time and time again from a lot of my female friends that they've never had an orgasm I know it's shocking but also not that shocking considering society doesn't teach women about their bodies at all haha right guys this video will probably be demonetised I'm saying words like woman orgasm neutral exchange of pleasure vagina clitoris etc in all seriousness women aren't really educated about how to pleasure themselves or how to know their bodies you know I mean I can tell you that when I was in middle school i 100% knew how a guy jacked off you know I feel weird saying these words on my channel masturbated but in middle school I had absolutely no idea how a win would masturbate and in high school I had no idea how a woman her vast debate and it wasn't until I don't know I was like twenty maybe twenty one that I ever did it successfully and had my first orgasm and that was only because I lived in a super sex positive co-op and they educated me about my body and myself and it was through the acceptance that I was able to achieve nerve onna like nerve because the clitoris is covered a lot of nurse than that and then at night now this video is not the be-all end-all but here are some tips and tricks about how you can achieve orgasm and get to know your body better ready let's go step number one acceptance hey there's nothing wrong with you you're not broken you're doing great if you haven't had an orgasm yet that's just because he hasn't had an orgasm it there's plenty of time to figure it out don't give up on yourself accept things for us they are and move forward step number two guess what medications can affect how easy it is for you to have an orgasm turns out antidepressants anti-anxiety meds these are all things like have a direct effect on your ability to achieve orgasm whoa I wish that my psychiatrist have told me that before I started taking antidepressants instead I just kind of noticed it and believe me I noticed right away so if you found that lately or suddenly or having even more difficulty having an orgasm it might be the drugs you're on talk to your psychiatrist about it talk to your medical doctor and talk to yourself or your partner and build that communication that you're gonna need to get off step number three literally just buy a vibrator and go home and then diddle yourself until you come multiple vibrators they can be really expensive and they're all different types and shapes and sizes and vibrations and rumbles and patterns and etcetera etcetera etcetera so my advice to you is go get like your basic pocket bullet bag and that's it and then try a bunch of different directions and see which one starts to feel good you know and then kind of operate in that space until things get crazy protip a lot of people say they don't know whether or not they've had an orgasm in my personal opinion if you're doing it for long enough I think you're gonna find out step number three see I don't know now you guys might be thinking if I hand out what if I'm just not in the mood what if I'm not at all aroused if I'm not horny at all I'm bored just vibrating something against myself it's not turning me on Hey look as someone who read a lot of very pornographic fanfiction at an early age I'm talking like 11 it's okay to go find yourself some indulgent reading material or like videos or whatever it is you want to see you know to start to generate those feelings think back to times in your life where you've been like oh and go with it you can also get such reading materials as buffering unshare tales of a life fully loaded now available in paperback now available in signed paper back at buffering book calm guys if this doesn't get you in the mood something else will don't give up on yourself step number four I don't know if this is a case for everyone but let's say it's the case that you don't ever have an orgasm and you've done all this stuff and you just never will that's fine at least you're still over dr. white that's not fine you can't live without that go to a doctor make sure there's not a medical reason why you're not having an orgasm go to your ob/gyn fight for your patients rights of attention I know doctors rush you in and out of the waiting rooms but you deserve the attention and expertise that you are paying for boom soapbox blammo number five this applies if you're experimenting with a partner ask questions ask them questions and ask them to ask you questions you know be like does that feel good or whatever I don't know maybe not questions like that because I can do a lot of pressure you have your own language with your partner so I'm going to leave this whole question section up to you guys but don't be afraid to ask questions don't be afraid to keep trying for like I don't know an hour two hours maybe I just had too much free time on my hands when I was in college and that's why I was able to do it but I'm so glad that I did because I had men orgasm free for the first 21 years of my life and now for the last nine I haven't been and I want this for you guys you deserve pleasure and positive experiences don't self-sacrifice don't self-sabotage don't be sitting there martyring yourself in the bedroom you deserve it too so boom and grant I had to talk about this today because I felt compelled to and I hope that it was insightful in some way or maybe just provided you guys a little advice now I know you guys are so much smarter than me so please leave comments in the comment section below share your own experiences share your own advice and maybe even other resources I would love that you guys are a great community you educate me educate each other it makes my life great so yeah that's my video for today I hope

what's not to love about fermented soybeans that look and taste like snot it's great hey guys it's me Hannah Wow today in honor of it being the last episode of I heart food Monday nights at 10/9 central last episode for now I'm gonna talk about some of my favorite foods now there may be some debate that comes with this go ahead and leave a comment in the comments below if you feel like you like it or you don't but here are some of my favorite foods that I've noticed people don't really seem to like that much but let's get started number one Brussels sprouts Brussels sprouts are great Brussels sprouts are really really good if you roast them and make them kind of crunchy with like a little olive oil some salt and pepper I think Brussels sprouts are great do they smell like feet if you boil them yes do they taste gross then - probably but Brussels sprouts on a whole are pretty good number two olives I love olives what's not to love about an olive its fleshy its salty you can chew around the pit it's just so satisfying it's both an activity and a snack 3 anchovies anchovies are good they're tiny fish full of omegas you can add them maybe I just like salt what's not to love about a tiny salty fish you know and its really take it or leave it if you have anchovies in something you can just like pull it off will it still taste like anchovies yes but that taste is delicious number four steal and throw now cilantro okay okay I gotta give it I gotta give some people a little credit here some people actually get the taste of soap in their mouth when they taste cilantro is that any of you guys let me know I don't I like cilantro I like to put it in everything but some people were really strong adverse reaction so I don't really know if this is controversial so much as to some people it tastes like soap next pickles I love pickles when I was a kid I really really didn't like pickles also I don't like soft pickles soggy squishy pickles I like good crunchy pickles I like tiny pickles I like pickled things in general ie last week when I learned to make pickled onions so yeah pickles serve are really for me next onions I could eat an onion raw I love the taste of red onion I think red onion tastes sweet I love white onion / yellow onion is there a difference rewind yellow onion you know I just eat food I don't know food I just heart food I don't smart food no no no no kombucha some people think it's gross and weird I think it's very satisfying for an upset stomach now it is grown from something called a mother but start we all anything in the gourd family really I'm a big fan of squash you know just in general both the sport and the food I've never played the sport I take it back other good stuff mustard some people don't like mustard fish some people don't like fish I love fish I love mustard I love everything we're talking about here oh here's a good one I also like Oh Halloween's coming up so this is gonna be kind of polarizing guys get ready malt balls I like them those little like whopper candy mothballs I like it I like malt maybe I'm just an old man inside that's okay I gotta live my best life for me granny bread daikon radish almond butter stinky cheeses of any sort oh if you don't if it doesn't make your eyes water it's your approach then should you be eating it probably not I like to have a full face experience when I eat I also want talking about eggplant I love eggplant one of my favorite foods of all time is eggplant parmesan I think eggplants great yes it's really hard to cook without it getting like soggy and squishy or undercooking it and it gets just really tough and chewy but if you can find that sweet spot call me let me know I'll come over and eat your food and last but not least I want to talk about one of my favorite foods of all time something called nut dough now I will admit not though does sound gross in theory it is fermented soybeans that kind of become this pasty snot like consistency and yes they do taste like they've been rotting for some time because guess what they have been but hey it's delicious rice a little seaweed no no mmmm I love not though what's not though love huh okay and last but not least well I was gonna say avocado but you know to be totally honest I'm a little bit over off akkad Oh avocados gotten uh it's gotten overplayed I'm over it Wow speaking of things

that you can evolve hello I got the game literally yesterday and I'm already on level 34 look you can change all your little fiends look at all these fiends I had left to unlock so this is the level I'm on sage a little boom boom see a little bit of this that uh plus it's also different challenges daily challenges monthly challenges themed challenges this month is Valentine's month Oh ships it I got that I got it Ella present biggest bonus of all you can play without Wi-Fi hello that's amazing one of the things I find most frustrating about three puzzle games is that you can't play them when you're not online anyway guys if you wanna check out the game check the links in the description you'll download it for free and you'll get five dollars worth of diamonds and gold which you can use to do things in the game okay and put this away because otherwise it will I will be too distracted moving right along video games I am obsessed with The Last of Us Last of Us is the best game I've ever played now here's the thing it's violent and so I really didn't think I was gonna like it cuz hey guess what I don't like violence I don't like violent things but the Last of Us I love the character the journey the plot it was like watching a movie it was so good so the Last of Us is one of my favorite games of all time I love that game I love I love it have you guys played it let me know in the comments below do you want to play it give it a shot warning violence I also really into the Assassin's Creed series but I'll talk about that another time number three card games okay two card games I want to show you one of them is sushi go this is a great super fast paced game that you can play in a group of up to how many people two to five players you're summing all these different sushi rolls it's a really fun game but it kind of makes you hungry for sushi but still when are you not hungry for sushi you know sorry the oceans I really like this game I take it with me every time I go camping it's just a great game to play with the group it takes a little bit to like get used to it and getting the rhythm of it but if you are someone that enjoys playing card games in a group and if you like playing games that you can like just play in 15 minutes because you want to kill some time recommend this big time guys big time Big Time it is a great game I love sushi go I love it I love it if you have a games that you want to recommend to me let me know comments below next number for the box but it's monopoly deal guys if you ever played Monopoly deal it's like playing Monopoly except not for the rest of your life did you know when monopoly is only supposed to last 90 minutes nobody plays that rule but you have to stop after like 90 minutes you have to stop not really deal it's like a fast portable version of Monopoly and it is so freaking fine and it teaches you the value of real estate which is something that I'm learning about right now I'm getting older is boring but not when you have games and last time at least I want to show you a game I played all the time as a kid I love this game I saw it recently online and I ordered it and I bought it and it's called crack the case this is the best party group whatever game you can play if you like solving mysteries if you like working all is like a big team this is so much fun so basically cracker chase works like this you have one person who's the case manager case worker basically crack the case works like this you have one person who knows the case in the mystery right so you read it aloud to the group for instance a man is found unconscious on the floor his clothing is scorched the mystery what happened to him the next step is that the person who's like the you know person holding this reads the story reads the clue and solve and find out all the information then the group asks them questions to determine the answer so they can solve the mystery the best part is as the person holding this thing you can only reply in seven different ways yes no yes and no irrelevant I don't know define what you mean by and rephrase your question if you guys really need a new game in your life to like play amongst your friends get crack the case and let me know if you get it cuz I think it's a great game that would make me so happy anyway that's it for me a happy Saturday I hope you guys are relaxing lounging it's the

Hey Guys happy valentines week, the week where whether you like it or not you are thinking about love But love can mean many different things. It can mean self love It can mean love between you and your friends.  It can mean love between you and your pets. It could be love between your two pets and each other. But today I'm here to talk about the many many perks of love Specifically, the many perks of being in a lesbian relationship Also big thank you to Google and Team Pixel for this paid promotion. See how many times you guys can spot my phone! Let's begin. First and most obviously, sharing clothes! Shoes, accessorizing, outfits, outfits choices, trying on different looks honestly the second you move in with your girlfriend your wardrobe doubles. "Music playing" You are zero percent likely to get a pregnancy scare In fact your period becomes double the fun And by fun I mean mood swings.   The odds of having a tampon has doubled You can talk endlessly about your celebrity crushes and by crushes I mean who would make a great donor daddy and by donor daddy I mean men that I would like to procreate with Not physically or  sexually but genetically I feel like Will Smith could totally do it You guys can talk honestly about different things you wanna try you know what I mean I'm k to try it I've never had bangs before Nobody corrects your driving. Just kidding back seat driving is apart of any loving, healthy relationship Same sex or otherwise I'm guilty of back seat driving well I'm driving uhh I just wanted to say one thing which is I was right that we should of left an hour earlier and for me the absolute best perk of all you have now doubled your chances for having a hair-tie   Hey guys! Thank you so much for watching and again a big thanks to Google and team Pixel for sponsoring this video If you guys got other perks of being in a relationship or other types of un-filtered love that you'd like to share leave a comment in the comments below and let me know what your thoughts Click  like if you liked this video Subscribe if you want to subscribe and hit notification if you want to be notified when this video goes up Happy Valentines week everybody! I'm posting even more content this week with an incredibility exciting announcement tomorrow so make sure you're there I cannot wait. Love ya. See ya Have a great day I'm working out my arms 
Why did I want to try out the pixel? For the following reasons. One: every app I use is Google based - my mail, my calendar, my drive, my maps etc So I wanted to see if Google based apps would work better on a Google based product. Two: I got one for free. That was a huge, huge help. Three: Frankly, I'm just into trying different things now. I've been an iPhone user for a long time, which is great. It's lovely, I like it. It's a great product, woohoo go iPhone, but it's also not the only thing out there And who am I to say that it's the best when I haven't even tried the rest? So without further ado I'm gonna give you my review. Hey, hey rhyming. Of the Google pixel 2! - oh my god it continued to rhyme. For starters let's talk about what comes in the box. The box includes the phone, the charger, a headset adapter and Another adapter so you can automatically transfer your data from a different phone, how cool is that? Wow they love each other I don't know if they love each other Which I think is really really cool because I hate having to go into like the phone provider store or the Apple Store and have them do this thing that seems like I should be able to do it at home. You know? I don't like that I just want to be able to set it up myself. Which leads me to the next part, which is so cool! The box also comes with a SIM key. I love the packaging. See? Comes with a SIM key. This is the SIM key See? Oh my god. Boom, baby! Push on it Ding! All you do is you take the SIM card out of its little slot, put it in your new phone And that's it dude. You're set up, you're good to go. I feel like with this Google phone They just gave me the ability to do all the work myself, so I could get started using it. Thanks for believing in me pixel. So this is the phone. This is the Google pixel 2 XL. It feels pretty great I got a nice like matted case so that doesn't slip out of my hands because I am prone to dropping things. Something I really enjoy about the pixels that I didn't know was a feature is that the way you unlock it, Ding, ding! You tap this little sensor on the back. Crazy right? I find that it works faster, better, smoother, but that also might just be the newness of the product, you know, who am I to say that it is genuinely faster better and smoother than the brand-new Apple stuff? Yada yada yada, but I just really also hate facial recognition. Why would they do that? A $1000 phone? The first thing I like to do when I set up a new phone is set up my wallpaper. Now look at all these crazy, amazing options that came with it. We've got lots of different arts, Oh my god And then, also look at this. These backgrounds are moving! If I wasn't prone to motion sickness, I would enjoy that. The next thing I really enjoy, is the fact that you can take your apps and organize them to be exactly where you'd like them to be. Anywhere on the screen. So I put all my work related apps here on the right-hand side and then all my for fun apps on The left hand side just cause that's the way I like it! I like that it's really intuitive and colorful, look at all these different programs. Oh, what? They're listed in alphabetical order? It's different in the way you use it. When you pull down from top, this is how you get to your settings. You've got all your regular stuff, lalala. I love that you can search settings Let's say I want to set up my bitmoji keyboard, Bada Bing, Bada Boom, BAM! I can just do all that goodness right there. Now, I know this doesn't seem that different from Apple's so far, but here's where there's a major difference. My girlfriend And I took the same photo of the same drink at night, and here is how it turned out. She's got the 7 plus? 6 plus? Something like that. Here's how my picture looked. Bling! And here's how her picture looked (screaming) Something I will say is that I don't really know how to use the photo system yet. There's lots of different albums for things, and it's not,  I don't really know what the album's mean sometimes I can't find something there, but that's probably again my own ignorance not necessarily the products fault This is all learning curve stuff. Speaking of learning curve, let's talk about texting. Let's get this out of the way: iMessage does not work on Android operating systems. I'm not receiving imessages I only get text/SMS messages I am now the green bar that is the great source of aggravation in any of your Android based friendships. However that being said there's a really simple fix for that. You just ask your friend to delete your old prior text thread and then every time you text you're gonna get every message going through. I really feel like the whole iMessage thing It's just Apple's desperate bid to try and keep people from experimenting with different phones. Something I really, really like about the texting system is that you can actually set up every person in your Conversations to have a different contact color. Look I can make this conversation any color. So let's say I've been having a conversation with my friend Grace, ooh Grace I want her color to be, I don't know orange, now our conversation's all orange I know that might seem like a lame little plus But I actually as someone whose very colors based, really like the fact that I can do different colors for different people I don't know. It just makes it colorful and bright and fun. Okay, I've said a bunch of good stuff and before I tell you my favorite, favorite part of the phone, I'm gonna tell you about some of the cons. Con #1: It doesn't come with an adapter that allows you to plug it into your computer. Why isn't that included? Why isn't that included? It doesn't come with the USB adapter that you can just plug into your computer. That sucks. I am frustrated by that. I hate having to, like, email myself Or share things to drive or etc etc to try and get things to try and get videos and photos onto my computer. Speaking of videos and photos here is the major, major, major, flaw in my opinion. It's a known issue that Google is aware of but I'll just show you how it works. Okay, so here I am recording a video. Hey, how is that? That's pretty great? What? The audio sounds horrible? I know! Yeah, but the video quality is, (kiss) magnifique You could take a selfie in portrait mode! I'll never have to ask someone to take a photo for me again! Last, but not least I'm going to tell you guys my favorite, favorite, favorite feature of all. When your map is open on your phone and you're getting directions, if you get a text message or an email or who's the whatsits or something, something, the map Automatically shrinks down and sits in one of the corners of your phone. You can move that around, etc, etc, so you can read your article But you still have the map up open in the corner! How brilliant is that?  I just think that's genius! That way you're not having to switch back and forth between the Maps app and your other app that you're using you just always have The map open. So, if you're giving someone directions And they're driving and they're like "How far away's the next turn?" You can be reading something on Twitter and look up at the corner of your screen and say "Oh, it's to the right." I think that's so brilliant! I love that feature more than anything! So in summation. I like it,  I'm into it I'm Happy to be experimenting with something new and for those of you wondering, No, Google Absolutely did not pay me to do this, at all. I wish they had. Hey guys, hit me up. You know? Apparently, I'm a big pixel fan. So is Charles. Oh man, the photo shoots We're gonna have... guys the photo shoots! Wow! Do you like... what, what, where you going? Do you like the pixel? (Meow) Yeah? You into it? Oh. Wait, what'd you find up there buddy? Is it your time to shine? Okay, forgive me. I'll just, I'll to get out of your way. You know? Okay, hey guys. Thank you so much for watching I hope that you enjoyed this video and let me know if you want me to do more tech reviews. I'm just a consumer I'm not an expert at all I just really like Futzing with things and I like learning about how things are different from other things and basically all I'm saying is I love objects? Anyway, Let me know if you want me to do more tech type reviews and leave a comment in the comments below. Click like if you liked This video and also would you try out the pixel? Does that something you would want to do? Let's find out. I will say, it is a pain in the butt with the texting thing, you know? That's a pain in the butt, but then again first world problems am I right. Oh too many devices! Okay, okay, That's it. I hope you guys enjoyed this video! (Kisses) Have a great day! 
okay I'm just gonna cut to the chase because I don't want to prolong this because I don't like thinking about it frankly a couple of years ago my friend Grace and I went to comic-con to promote this series we'd worked on called Electra woman and Dyna girl also available to watch as a full-length feature film the trip started with Grace and I getting picked up by a driver that the company we are working with legendary had set up you know to take us to San Diego it's like a two-hour drive from LA it's not really worth the flight so somebody drove us down that night as we pull up to the hotel where we're staying the driver begins to tell us about how the Hotel del Coronado is the most haunted hotel in San Diego now grace and I both are really and to go so this was fun and scary to hear about I personally have had a myriad of ghostly paranormal esque encounters which I'll tell you guys about another day because this one is just it deserves its own little place in time so we check in to the hotel we sleep yeah the hotel looks a little creepy but there's not much to make of it and we have a full day of doing Comic Con in the morning so we high-five and go to bed that morning I wake up and get dressed putting on these sunglasses that I had just gotten and were super super rad and proud of these sunglasses weren't really anything special I was excited about them because they were ray-bans with like the gold rim and the black frame pretty standard looking stuff then we do comic-con we do a bunch of interviews throughout the day moving from location to location and somehow in the midst of all of that at the very end of the day I realized that I've lost my glasses maybe I'd left them after a photo shoot or in one of the conference rooms it don't really know but what I do know is that I for a fact had my sunglasses with me that whole day as you can see in this picture here that's them those are my sunglasses they're with me they're in San Diego a legendary is super freaked out because they don't want me being unhappy as talent I really don't care so much but they go and they look and they're searching everywhere and it becomes this big thing and they're like we can't find your sunglasses and I'm like that is okay we go out to the parties at night hang out in San Diego etc come back sleep wake up and head back to LA the next morning grace is kind enough to let me borrow her sunglasses as we make our way up in a new car with a new driver heading back to our respective homes we get home I waved bye to grace in the driver I drop my stuff off inside and get my car to run errands as I sit in my car I think to myself okay maybe I've got a spare maybe I've got an extra pair of like aviators or something up in the little sunglasses compartment so I go and I tap it and you know that feeling when you're about to wake up that feeling like you're in a dream and you suddenly have a conscious thought and your dream ends you know the feeling of oh I'm dreaming which means and then you wake up back in your real reality so as I tap this sunglasses compartment and this thing slowly shifts down I get the feeling like I'm about to wake up this was all a dream but it wasn't I was actually sitting in my car and so were the sunglasses now I know this may not seem like really freaky and scary to you if you're expecting some sort of like headless creature scary noise or a vision of doom and gloom etc but the reality is is that those sunglasses were in San Diego and I hadn't been in my car in three days and I know for a fact that they were in San Diego because I have photographic evidence of it so how did they get to the car and I know what you're thinking oh it was a different pair of sunglasses Hannah just forgot I didn't own Ray Bans I didn't own other sunglasses I just owned that one pair or maybe someone put them in your car for you while you were in San Diego so that doesn't work on two levels one they the sunglasses were with me in San Diego as were my keys to my car the only set of keys that exist for my car so unless legendary worked some super duper magic and somehow got to my home ahead of me and broke into my car and put the sunglasses in there which doesn't really work out like why wouldn't they just tell me so I texted grace and I said I just found my sunglasses and she was like oh dude we're thinking I had found them in my bag or my backpack or something and then I wrote back in my car and she was like shut the up anyway so that's a freakiest thing that's ever happened to me because that really happened every moment of that was real and I still don't have an explanation for it anyway guys that's the scariest thing that's ever happened to me what is a scary thing that has happened to you have you had an object suddenly reappear I don't know leave a comment in the comments below and let me know so I could find some solace in our solidarity man whoa freaky deaky I've got chills I gave myself chills

ha no hat hat no hat ha ha ha ha yeah that's good stuff no hat hey guys it's me Hannah bet you didn't know that now you probably did I am exhausted I am so tired today I flew home to Los Angeles from Chicago I was in the Windy City yesterday working with a really cool farm that video is coming later this week it was just a really fun trip and it was good to volunteer and be in nature and I liked it a lot I'm just so tired right now my period is like t-minus I don't know 12 hours have you ever been so tired that you're sweating anyway I don't have that footage of this really cool trip and I was planning on putting that video up today so instead I thought I would just do a Q&amp;A now let me cue a like DNA let me preface this Q&amp;A by saying two things one I'm not an expert and two I'm delirious right now so take everything with a grain of salt I have salt I could do tan we just cleaned let's begin question number 1 sam asks how has your morning flush daily routine changed now that you have a son Charles finished a cat dad everything about my life has changed now that I have Charles mainly because everything has gotten better and by gotten better I mean has revolved around Charles I'm completely obsessed with my cat he's in my waking thoughts I wish I could text him I think about and want to wear a part I'm looking at it right now and every time I come home there's like a countdown in my head until this moment [Music] am I gonna cry question number two Hennig Roth asks what's your favorite part about working on / creating LGBT movies oh I would say that truly honestly my favorite part is this is gonna sound so cheesy but literally my favorite part making movies is being able to open up opportunities for other people to either work on the movie I'm working on or generate some kind of buzz around that style of content so that other people want to make it so that's studio why why ow shooting stomach pain oh good I might dying a little bit every day anyway yes it's generating opportunity for the set that I'm on or the project I'm working on and also kind of generating more interest in mainstream media for LGBT storytelling which will follow you know long after I just completely mom out oh my baby we've got like five years left in me I think question number three comes from Aubrey if you could live with only one cheese or mustard that's impossible that's an impossible question to answer that's no no like mustard is the cheese of condiments to me and cheese is the mustard of dairy what I can't guys I can't I can i I can't I would live without either I would say take them both because having to pick one would ruin the other so I just rather not have any think out this is not really happening my biggest fear Black toast intolerance stana asks do you think that queer and firm could ever be reclaimed by the lgbtq+ community we I kind of think queer is already reclaimed um yeah absolutely I mean I think I think well I kind of want to separate the two of God am i walking into muddy waters I hope not please forgive me please don't get mad at me I don't know the right answer I'm just saying my answer am I gonna cry anyway I think people have really reclaimed the word queer I'm personally not comfortable saying the word because it's not my aspect themself for community and yes I'm not gonna say that word but you know I think queer is on its way to pretty much reclaimed I mean people say LGBTQ right and that Q stands for queer so even rent man please don't come mad at me okay next question what was that was that for next question women's health provider I have patients of the LGBTQ community what is something I could do to help better care for them oh my god Lauren you sound like a great women's health provider um I don't really know that's in their pronouns when they walk in the room I'm not a doctor but I think that's really wonderful I mean the very virtue of the fact that you're thinking to ask that's a good time so yeah cool Wow lucky your neighborhood is lucky to have you lucky your neighborhood okay guys I got to do it one more one more and then I'm gonna take a bath and here's last question from dapper insomniac I love that name how can you help yourself deal with your family not accepting your chosen name okay so first and foremost that's hard that sucks I'm sorry as someone who feels really comfortable with their gender they were identified with the birth and my name I was identified with birth I want you to take a giant grain of salt with my answer because I am NOT an expert there's lots of experts online well experts meaning people who are going through that experience right now have you seen miles miles is a great channel we just did it collab the other day anyway this is something that I'm really like a big kick I'm really on lately which is that you have to be as patient with the people in your life on their road to acceptance as you were with yourself on your road to coming out I hope that they come around I can't say like I promise they'll come around because I don't know if that's true but I really think it is you seem lovely they love you they love you they're just adjusting I think it's just an adjustment period you know that might last forever but you guys will have to figure out what your normal is the important part is that you will also have a found family and your chosen family and they will all know and love you by your name your name that you're like this is my name about yeah good job team putting the T in team am i right everybody Oh Ana alright guys that's it for me I am weirdly out of it do you ever feel like you're missing frames from your brain I think I'm gonna drink a lot of water and tea tonight I think I'm gonna cook food

yes factors all week for your boo-boo yeah did you really boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo okay ready ring-a-ding-ding hey did you get my drunk kitchen I am joined by returning extra-special guest Bulldogs returns yet again this October because I think you were here last October so told ya there's a date and in October at mundo and I like to get together because International pasta money's Wow and did you guys know that there are over 600 different shapes of pasta that many do you know I love that every different pasta shape as a different pasta purpose a different pasta purpose well with the help of Barilla pasta because they are my Emilia we are going to explore different pasta shapes and their different pasta purposes I will tell you at moldos been here for one hour and I'm going to say 55 minutes of that have been him playing with Charles do you blame me now I don't I really don't Edmundo name this pasta shape Farfalla does purple mean bowtie in Italian yeah he also means butterfly but in this sense is bowtie here although the idea of eating butterflies knots of it a day the only thing a bowtie is delicious here's my first pasta question do you call anything you put on pasta sauce Wow right yeah so if you put a little olive oil and capers and tomatoes can you call that a sauce so you name the ingredient you don't say pasta with oil oil and garlic garlic oil and cheese you see a yo yo yo yo yo yo the your hunger when we made this packet data I love time to this pocket Italia on you let's look back what was approaching say why are you so beautiful and I said because you drink too much okay so now every pasta is paired necessarily with a sauce let's talk about Farfalla what about this for fala is generally used with a light sauce you don't generally serve it with tomato sauce because it takes a little bit too much of it you see how much how much space there is in the pasta here so if you do a sort is row too thick of tomato sauce all this farfalle will get stuck together so there's really not a rule on what sauce goes with what shape is more of an artistry so the more you do it and the more you get comfortable with whatever pasta you wanna use speed round rotini protein it's a fun shape is usually what I make for my kids because they're great for a pasta salad and my favorite way to make rotini truthful is with tomato sauce and came to much with marine are in terrible so why the rotini the why the routine because the Farfalla is too gentle is too delicate for the for the thick sauce while the rotini you can take a little more weight and all the tuna gets stuck in between the little rim and it's just delicious oh you gotta try tell me about this one hotshot elbow baby oh these are baby elbow pasta the way I would end of these pop here is with the cheese sauce should you come as a puppy it's puppies the way I would endow this okay I have to tell you not drinking for the last like two and a half weeks I have a really high collar not right now we do have more wine coming okay let's move on one sec tell me about tortellini I got a story about that thing I can't wait the legend says the Venus she went to this him in Italy they oz was taken by a beauty he followed her any peeped he to the keel and you soil named belly buddy yeah he was so intrigued by a naval and a beauty that he went I was there and he created this pasta to resemble a belly button Wow I think this totally looks like navel and you know everybody's navel is shaped differently looks different but all navels are beautiful exactly as they are we're talking about belly buttons so what those would you put with the turtle Ennis I'd like to think that when I cook a tortellini I cook it well enough that it provides its own that's nice because you know what you totally right totally answer in broth there the meat inside and everything is just putting in broth and you tell me that they're delicious Wow cheers to your genius my friend thank you mmm Jin yes drinking gin okay mo you show me what I thought work for pretty challenging pasta shapes I have even more of a challenge for you using rapid fire asking you sauce for each of these pasta shapes all right order I love orzo with garlic spinach chopped tomatoes served as a sign or a kid I know what it means little your little ear yes like little finger [Music] garlic and sausage as a cider as a main doesn't mean fettuccine I would say I like you to admit sauce meat linguini linguini pesto basil pesto put your best in their best spaghetti tomato sauce my eyes what about this oh my favorite

petty we dig our heels in we're very stubborn people like you just see two people I'm sorry mending their ground very different us rebels like to argue we do it's like an inherent thing like oh I don't say that we like to argue I think that we both like to I like to argue fundamentally I think you know angrily but like I love a good discussion I love a good debate and then the issue is we debate different ways that's what the issue is that's what the issue is we do how you like it you like this freeform like I can pull from anywhere anytime I can bring up anything at any moment arguing style you like I like it Barry's your linear past it I like to be like excuse me what are we talking about we're talking about this moment yes I do this a lot you do I don't rot oh crap I drop raps in argument yeah yes I do and you like to be like feeling a music thing yeah you know so petty or teachers to think there's users what I've learned is rich inclusive excellent the best way to settle a petty argument it's just not argue over petty things whoa stop oh yeah I'm being paid I'm being shitty and I think what we both have learning on good at is to recommend that yeah it'll be petty for maybe one beat yeah it's like be like for one and then turn around do it you know what I'm sorry that I did that Ellis is genius the best way to solve a pity argument is not to argue over petty things yeah like let it be like ah which I love to do I don't even get me sir she does love to just I love really just mix it and hey she likes like oh and then it's like this is not I cannot tell you guys how many hours into an argument I have said literally this statement ha ha ha I go on and I wore this black strip people need to hear when I say like I say this is what we're focusing on oh yeah yeah

yourself is have you been working so high for last twelve years I invited you here to do something relaxing today yeah get ready what is it we're gonna put this stuff on our faces what what is this it's a carbonated bubble clammer bubble plant it has a pig with a clay mask on yeah that's how you know it's a good good yeah hey do you mind this is that I guess it kind of carbonates on your skin what does that mean we're gonna find out [Music] it feels like there's something gently tickling my face I feel like bugs are crawling on my face right it's not firm enough yeah to be something you can ignore it like comes in and out mm-hmm I do not like this feeling at all distract ourselves from the itching product review is too pitchy we're gonna play would you rather and maybe because we're kind of in a sense of discovery even we're honest yeah we're gonna do would you rather dating would you rather date someone who you really really liked with the knowledge that your relationship would end soon because they were going away to like a distant country with no Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi yeah I like also I think that the bubbles are just flying off of our faces huh or Dave someone who you feel just okay about but they're you know super convenient I just want someone to be around because I'm lonely no of course I think that would be dating someone that you have a really strong personal connection with even if they're going to leave I'd rather have a little bit of amazing than a lot of what do you are you like an anime guy or you're like a video game guy I was really a big fan of like all things than Tendo growing up okay got it okay nope next would you rather Charles someone's just using the bathrooms someone's just pooping yeah somebody's just pooping back they know would you rather date someone who hates video games I can't stand to talk about it or date someone who is so obsessed with video games it's actually kind of ruining it for you right that's a good one thank you that's a good one um oh man I really like videogames but I feel like if someone's just too obsessed I'd rather just not have anything to do you guys are just me like that's just not bad yeah yeah I'd rather just play video games on my own I'd like to play single-player games more anyway you know I'd say I'd rather date someone that hated video games okay have you ever played The Last of Us yes I love oh my god I can see the last ones to trailer yeah I'm bonus I'm so exciting you show you have your beautiful thick eyelashes you have a little flex of this bubble stuff such long eyelashes thank you would you rather date someone would you rather date someone prettier than you know for your first date would you rather do it at a quiet romantic yet expensive restaurant or a place it's really really loud but super good and super cheap quiet and romantic have you been on a bad day not really I don't really date I look like a really really shitty Santa Claus you do like we look like a really bad special effects makeup yeah this is a low-budget movie it looks like you're wearing really bad gladiator armor yeah we want to see Tony would you rather go to a beach type setting and like spend a week you know sipping drinks by the ocean or to like a fun cabin type setting where you can like horseback ride and shoot bows and arrows for first day first trip first trip yeah yeah I'd say I'd say somewhere like the cabin where we just chill and shoot well it's not really chilly it's like shooting bows and arrows or soccer I would rather do the activities because I think that says a lot more about a person and I feel like when you're going on that first big trip you kind of wanna get to know 100 I could not agree more I completely agree when you're first going on a trip with someone things can get tense get delayed people have forget items at home and you spend every waking moment together so it's probably pretty good to have some items planned yeah and it kind of gives you a sense of that person for the first time with their guard down you're so stressed nothing teaches you about a person like how they are at baggage claim yeah would you rather date someone you're in love you have met the most amazing person in the world who this person is the one okay this is the one perfect would you rather they have six cats or one human child oh wow [Music] oh you've never met anyone like this person you guarantee a lifetime together you love you've never loved me it depends it okay there's a lot of things that that this is weighing on here it's like is the kid a good kid or is he just a complete asshole I mean there's someone I think they're just a child they're just a child the question is are you ready to be a father well I said a father to want human child for six times yeah either cat daddy times six six cats I'd say I'd say the child I'd say a child yeah yeah I think I'm at the point my life where I'd rather just be a father than have six cats running around the house at all times you know what I think that that's really fair what would you say me I mean you're a cat the cat would you choose this thanks guys I don't know sorry I guess I would take one you mature oh my god don't happy that's not real gonna ask what do you think the most amount of cats is before it becomes a little excessive I think that the most amount of cats before it becomes excessive to to anything more than - it's like a lot of cats at that point it's kathleen companion and and they each need their own litter boxes cats do better when you have a second cat in the house that's that's true and a human child and you use the same toilets you don't have to I don't know to me I'm like I just wanted that I've used the same toilet as that did he / dear on parenting I would use the same toilet as a human child yeah okay thank you so much for being here are you so ready to wipe that I'm sober you know let's wipe it and then do the end car oh there's someone I feel like is

20 minutes gamma light a candle way yeah just wait you know I mean this is our first time wait till the second turn yeah yeah I know I was an itchy process I didn't love it I didn't like the process I middle of the problem I do kind of feel like you can taste it in my mouth mm-hmm this it doesn't it doesn't taste or smell bad but it's just like chemicals just like chemicals but at the same time my

yeah well I'm gonna let you go do that bye guys have a great day 
I I tried to make a croissant from scratch like so dumb hey guys this week on my drunk kitchen we're going to have on accomplishments and BOM blemish mints what's that word what's the word up against for the a this like a bad a bad thing abomination no actually this is that either hey guys this week on my drunk kitchen is more of like a what just happen to story so here here here we go it all began as a very Eat Pray Love kind of moment I thought to myself I love croissants and I just then with such strictness so if I am worthy of such a judgement then maybe I should try and make them from scratch and that is why I did this to myself step number one you have to list a yeast to activate this is a horrible step and it was difficult for me to do and it took an hour so step number one wait an hour step number two since you do not have enough counter space to actually accomplish this task take the giant box of pots and pans that you have in the corner and then just start doing things on top of that okay then here okay and then this is what happens now so apparently a big part of making a croissant from this recipe which I roll on name because heads up this recipe consult I found it on Google it was in the top five your pick anyway in this recipe I have to look it didn't suck it just wasn't for me so none of us truly okay so in this next step at the recipe I can make a butter square and the butter square means eight inches by eight inches of measurement so I have to use measuring tape you know you're trying too hard to bake when you need to use measuring tape measuring tape that's not even a kitchen tool you just stop man just back away I don't want to do that but I did and now well you'll see sidebar after kneading the measuring tape I decided to just make chicken nuggets but here we go this is me trying my best and the instructions provide no offering success ascends make a square make a square that's a step us on instruction we did yeah it's much better if I do it like this okay yeah there we go Hey right look at this yeah oh my god now I know why all chefs have really buff forearms and tattoos for arm from cheffing or baking Baker's tattoos because of the pain in their heart after make a square thanks frankly just went from bad to worse I forgot an ingredient what did you forget milk in what I'm in a container from a cow I need milk for the dough and I don't have it and I only have almond milk because I am bougie and then I did this using my residual nuggets heat method I was unable to melt the butter to finish making the dough because guess what everybody we don't even have dough yet mmm if you guys are wondering what I'm drinking it's green tea gin tears and I also some seltzer because you know the tongue the tongue tongue frankly I really love croissants I'm just trying to make your good one so after all of this measuring tape blah blah blah continue to make flour blah blah blah some things in the fridge now two things are in the fridge nonsense I would like to say this there are too many pauses there are too many pauses in this recipe wait 1 hour 2 hours 20 minutes 10 I can't pause I'm gonna life in the fast lane if the fast lane does that have any precise phenomena I want to switch lanes I really love croissants 9 by 18 inches who in their right mind would ever measure that 9 by 18 min nice by 18 inches that's not a real measurement nothing on this planet is bad no no no no no thank you but give me your croissants are the same this says 400% which I assume only could mean 400 degrees which must be how hot the oven needs to be and then I stopped reading the directions wage is probably what held me back my whole life well thank you drunk ten minutes ago Hannah for that reminder instructions aren't for everyone some of us like to suffer here's a fun side bar here are some things I've learned from my cat one desire is greater than satisfaction what number two second thing I've ever learned for my cat anticipation is greater than achievement I don't know that's the case but then again we are taking trips term somebody who next note just says croissant shape so there is a period of a lot of kneading there was a whole second turn fiasco apparently they asked you to do all sorts of things then wait a long time 1 hour 2 hours is how long am I supposed to wait for the things I want hold up maybe I should fill that period of waiting with focusing on other goals you know you might think the thing you want is the only thing you need but turns out you need for 10 minutes a long time anyway long story short I made a bunch of different croissant shape and then I put them in the oven and then there is now and so glad I switched from gin tequila said no one now let me just address the elephant in the room okay like I'll just talk about it it's not hard I forgot the egg wash okay that's what makes them a shiny but like baby steps guys let me just make one normal and then not even normal cuz no more than cook big look what is normal anyway who cares about an egg wash I do I really do I love a shiny croissant but we are just practicing the basics because basics are for beginners and we are beginners we are all beginners we're all such new souls on this earth anyway long story short here's the best croissant that came out hey okay okay good first step look okay so it may look okay so not entirely shiny maybe a little flat bunch let's see if it even has tape [Music] weird because like it's like a lot more like it's a lot more like loud anyway guys long story short croissants are really hard some people have skills the people have talent some people have years and years and years of experience if only there were a place to learn those things you know from the people themselves this is where I tell you about my TV show yes that's right ladies and gentlemen I heart food which is the name of my television show premiering on Food Network August 14th at 10:00 p.m. is going to be live

okay well let's just stick our fingers in to see what happens step number one is to set up your camera angle like this because that's the way people do it these days step number one is to get 4x what the hell is 4x nobody actually knows until recently when find again cool step number 2 is to fight glue not this kind of glue you want Elmer's white glue but I can't find any anywhere because it's sold out because this line step number three get glitter glue because you think Oh sign me moving right along you'll need half a cup of warm water adds like so and there it is very great then add equal parts or name 1 tablespoon of borax stir it up and hopefully it will dissolve soon the next step is usually adding Elmer's white glue by squeezing it out into half a cup but since I don't have any cuz everybody's making slime I did this yes I cut it up into chunks and put it on a frying pan I don't know if those waves of steam are toxic or not but let's hope not we are going to take our attempt that soft gooey gooey glue and gently pour it into another half cup warm water clearly this is going very well can you mixing it together until you realize that it's totally not at all dissolving and potentially you need to try and put it into a microwave hold on here it is Wow too hot for human touch also everyone that towel great job okay try mixing this up and see if you can get what would be like a gluey watery Matt I think that is what we're going from here you'll need to add the borax solution oh no no no from here I'm actually just putting it in a new dish because that one's too hot and I think that that would mess it up because clearly what I care about is accuracy anyway add your totally melted borax solution into your glue bath then this is normally where slime happens but unbeknownst to me I've already totally missed them now operating on sheer blind ambition take your glitter glue and make a beautiful heart design on there because why not wow this is surely going to turn out great so then I put it in the freezer for longer oh this surely is going to become slime now look at that look at that density look at the gentle ripple and it's not at all slime so this is where we have to just stick our fingers in and see what happened yep it's up guys it's not good it didn't work okay but good news is is that the heart shape I made inside of it actually kind of dead look I have a fun slime rope maybe that will be what my DIY channel is all about slime rope with Hana because it's better than saying it's just a failure making a failure we've learned from our mistakes and are now going to try and make a slime entirely based off of real gooey gooey glue because guess what melting the glue sticks shocker didn't work at all and maybe add just like a little bit of warm water to help it dissolve I guess create a new solution I don't know we're looking for solutions but all I see a problem just kidding I think that this is actually turning out to be really really pretty you guys Wow it's like we're gazing deep into the cosmos look at that texture that shape but millions millions of first as light as if they are among the burst of lights that live within all of us it's stunning quickly make another tiny borax solution and dissolve the borax in the warm water by stirring it with an adorable adorable with that you surely will forget was used in this oak but have a drink Panna okay here we go we're in we're doing the borax we've mixed the Florrick's into the glue guys I think we're forming some sort of mass sticking together this is so satisfying to watch and was also even more satisfying to actually do behold the glory of a semi-decent slime attempt doesn't this look like a ball of this bar beautiful squeeze a pulp breaking into little pieces oh well that sucked anyway moral the story is take out the flan you made earlier that actually didn't turn out to be too horrible and thus we can begin my personal favorite part of flying videos the part where I just play music and show you squishy squish squish click like and subscribe if you want to see me do more things and be sure to put notifications on so you don't miss out on anything as wonderful as [Music] [Music] [Music] well I got weird

hey this casual set decorating can really only mean one thing it's time to get seasonal folks happy holidays now we all know the holidays can be pretty stressful so I want to share with you guys some hacks to keep your holidays hassle-free let's begin seasonal item number one ornaments these little bastards are fragile ass just like your emotional state so it's important to store them in a structured environment to keep their fragile little selves safe and a great way to do this is with a very common household item the solo cup you simply place the ornament inside place the solo cup into a box and there you have it look at this great storage guys they're so safe and secure Wow what that's genius Wow now you go back right there don't fall that would really defeat the point holiday hack number two also has to do with storage how to store the things wrapping paper now things you just shove them in a closet or put them in a stack somewhere or just forget they exist entirely sometimes I'd like to put things under my bed or you can put them into a beverage box which keeps them standing upright and super organized and super safe for instance wow that looks so good here's yet another way to maximize your holiday bliss wrap everything no matter how small a gift may be just wrap it you know people like to put things in bags and whatnot but how fun is it to unwrap things like look at these little delights what could they be let's open and find out literally a cookie a Christmas cookie that came in a box filled with other Christmas cookies but guess what it's an adorable gesture really good for your office mates so everyone gets a personal little bit of sweetness number four is to wear a super cool holiday chain made out of a garland was once over there but then you were like hey why have you get all the look so I'm gonna put this around me so this really displays just like a super cool casual Christmas kind of person yo yo number five also has to do with your holiday appearance just in case you didn't get the dope part though limited edition Christmas sweater see they're seasoning season's greetings fear not you can look extra cool by donning these you may see a tiny little candy cane but I see oh wow some fashion choices look at this these are earrings Wow and they look at these dangly little bastards tell me this doesn't look cute tell me this doesn't look like a cute Christmas earring you can't you can't say that because it is sometimes I impressed myself plus if you get hungry it's a snack there's plastic number six actually goes back to the wrapping concept but it is custom wrapping for instance look at this have a heart Day themed notebook that someone gave me they made the copper of this notebook themselves by giving it a cute little design personalizing it making it so sweet folding it taping it and boom there you go you have a really thoughtful gift that's also been made to the individual you're giving it to I think notebooks are a really great present for everyone all the time anyway but I especially think they're an important gift around the holidays why because of happy number seven which are a variety of ways to avoid getting sad over the holiday season and by sad I don't mean the feeling I mean seasonal affective disorder which largely stems from low vitamin D so get yourself some supplements I take them daily and give yourself that little extra boost of sunshine that you're not getting from nature because nature is covered in clouds except for here in Los Angeles i although i and beg for rain i beg for rain please please let it rain in california if you don't have access to vitamin d get yourself a special holidays notebook where you get to write down all the things that you're bummed out about this holiday season get a tier system journal out the feelings oh also during the holidays people have a tendency to eat food they don't normally eat drink more than they normally drink and exercise less which has a direct effect on your mood so if you like me have to take care of your mental health on a pretty regular basis remember this don't drop your habits just cuz it's the holidays okay and then immediately start taking care of that christmas shopping list that you have long-neglected if you need any thoughts ideas or suggestions I can think of a couple things that are pretty cool hey guys thank you so much for watching I hope that these hacks were a little bit helpful in getting you to a hassle-free holiday I really especially like that last one continue to take care of yourself you got this you got this you got this Christmas a lot of stuff but you can make new memories be present with the presents and you open up nice gift this was a great outro one sub great day [Music] 
these are the jokes that we make instead of crying boobers welcome to today but that's not the point this is this is the point everyone no okay you know sometimes you try so hard to get things right that you actually get them wrong hey guys since we got my drunk kitchen we're going to talk about what it's like to feel embarrassed and make a mistake that you didn't think was the something that was about to happen the minute happens to the new how do you not dwell on it kind of stuff which is why we're going to be making whoopie pies we're going to take a whoopsie and make it a whoopie it's not really so much of a whoopie as it is just you know just continuing forward so here's my reality Gemma's thinking about transgender issues in light of recent current events hannah has to announce paperback going live for pre-order what Hannah should have done posted two videos in one day a myriad of other things lots of things why Hannah should have done here's what Hannah did Hannah tried to talk about both and it did not go well a lot of marginalized communities like the trans community are oftentimes exploited and that huh and thus that's why I took the video down because people felt that this video was exploitation and whatever I don't even want to touch that I want to be nowhere near it so it's easy for me to delete it and take it down what's hard for me if you at all let go and forgive myself or whatever but like Oh hates making mistakes even though I know my intentions it just doesn't ever feel good to make a mistake it's embarrassing and it lingers and it also somehow reinforces every negative idea you've ever had about yourself which is why we're baking now because we need to eat some chocolate and frosting Cheers let's talk about what we find that's great so the first part is making the top and the bottom of the pie is into this sandwich this basic whoopie pie is pretty easy I'm actually already prepared the dough at home because the frosting is the more daunting part basically it's chocolate cake mix eggs and shortening combined together it looked like that's all the dough I have I'm just gonna clean this up really quick because I don't wanna step in it and also I really have step did it enough lately haven't I mm-hmm okay we still got plenty we're still doing great we have this it's fine the next step is to make your tops and bottoms basically it calls for a quarter cup of dough but I left the quarter cup measuring device at home huh cuz this is where I say in my head because I can't do anything right but instead I'm going to say forgot anyway is DVD DVD trick a series of tiny goals put them in the oven and bake them now on to the frosting oh I'm hungry also quick Charlotte or Nathan did you give me the shirt at VidCon and today I really appreciate it so thank you Nathan pretty shirt very good and now we move on to making the frosting let's keep talking about our feelings this is how I process verbally not to drinking I process verbally just really fun make that clear I mean frosting doesn't sound right because I always really frosting something to put on top but they call it a frosting but it's a sandwich it always cleans up that's right I know to make the frosting you combine all the ingredients all the ingredients which include 8 ounces of cream cheese [Music] half a cup of butter and four cups of powdered sugar vanilla extract can't shut up at a pinch of salt and it doesn't look as appealing as I hoped it was to look and then half a cup of butter please and four cups of powdered sugar gonna do yum yum Wow Wow it occurs to me now that cream cheese powdered sugar and butter in a white bowl don't really look like much but I've done rest assured it's in there is probably where the vanilla extract could have come in okay we'll talk sugars in the air it's so sweet it's so sharp whoa combining effortlessly as you can see I've decided to use my hands to try and combine everything I don't know if that was a good move but it's the move I made and that's all I can do is own up to it for what it is oh it's working take your amazing cream frosting and put in a ziploc bag you're still going to eat this right just give it a second figure out how to make into one of those really cool frosting bags you see on the internet like it's got all of it is very good that this looks legitimate well look at this with your freshly baked tops and bottoms you are going to flip it all over and then start making your sandwich shape so the best way to do this is to cut a hole in the bottom and the best way to cut a hole is a beauty oh my god the and then we do it thank you and there you have it oh I'll be by or at least the basic concept of a whoopie pie made by someone who is an amateur and is trying to do the right thing so let's see how the cake well there's like a lot of sugar and butter it's lacking a little substance although I'm not it all evenly spaced hmm and oil Pleasant my body is not physically allowing me to follow away and so what did we learn we learned that that's a great question an important question it's important to ask yourself in the light of making mistakes what should I learn because it is so hard to let go of mistakes you want to use them like a whip you want to be like yes see you're bad but that's not what you got to do you got to realize that you're human and by virtue of the fact that you're human you're going to occasionally make mistakes that's so being honest is anyone that tells you they're perfect is lying to you and themselves at the very least we should have same goals in the same understanding and we can practice having these difficult conversations or correcting each other in a respectful mutually compassionate way honestly sometimes I feel like it's harder to talk to a like-minded individual than somebody who doesn't share my beliefs at all because I know how to be patient with somebody that doesn't share my beliefs but somebody who does I just want to be like oh my god no no no that's not what I meant but instead you grow and that's all I know so long story short I dam not that good to make you whoopie pies but I am that good at making whoopsy tries guys thank you so much for watching thank you so much for the support through viewers I hope that you enjoyed watching this video I appreciate that and I am compelled to tell you about I am a show on Food Network called I heart food it's premiering August 14th at 10 p.m. please watch it if you would enjoy watching that no pressure I hope that you have a really great day one how is it

can I ask you a question yes you having just met me today yes yes you love your cats yes a hundred percent I can tell you love your cats is it the people are wandering and tweeting the mess does she love her cats yes is it weird yet hey guys this we got a very exciting Tuesday I am joined by the incredible Rob you thank you for having me yeah thank you for being here right off the bat people are wondering Hannah how the hell did you get this guy on your channel so let's just be frank Rob please tell us a little bit about your show oh I should point my show plug it now so nice I have a new show on YouTube red it's called do you want to see a dead body yeah I think that explains everything you need to know if you don't want to see a dead body don't go and watch this show it's a comedy show I take famous people to go see a dead body with me it's really fucked up hilarious real bodies no no but we pretend that they're real oh yes it's a scripted comedy show yeah it's more just like a creepy way of hanging out with someone like do you want to go see a dead body there's something under this bridge over yes exactly yeah to see it to believe it you gotta see it to believe gotta see it to believe it speaking of dead bodies sounds a weird transition you know what not my best fake way now Rob do you know what Tuesday is all about I do and I will say I'm not gonna be great at this but I will be great at this so Rob you're going numero uno oh this is making me nervous yeah I'm not nervous actually I'm not gonna lie I mean yes and I'm nervous for you but you're gonna be an expert at this mm-hmm we'll see about that wouldn't it be great if I set up a thing where I just look good every time yes that would be a really smart move our first question comes from Joe Joe they asked Rob how to get over a completely hopeless crush people always ask me how do I get over a crush that I'm hopeless about and I tell them that it's super easy just don't gush about your crush what you need to know is that there's plenty of fish in the sea don't you see look at all the fish in the sea go get a new fish forget your crush that was really good that was terrible but not bad advice not bad advice I think that there were some real nuggets of wisdom there you know if you have a completely hopeless crush well here's the thing if it's hopeless first of all nothing's hopeless second of all if you're not getting anything back from that person you think you just gotta move yeah I mean if you already recognize that you have a hopeless crush then just let it go and you now also they don't deserve you they're not into it move on there are so many other people out there that are just waiting to be found yeah there's someone for you oh gosh I mean really great right yeah that's good okay next one at snow Clark asks what is one thing that makes you happy just one I feel happiest when I'm not my snappiest I like to wake up on the right side of the bed so something that we happy is when you just let me sleep I don't want to wake up until I wake up so if you have to get up early please just get up early and go out and let me see oh I just love to sleep is that that was amazing okay listen here's the thing I just you know I wake up and I can be really grumpy sometimes me to i wake up and i'm just instantly in a bad mood and I I wish I could figure out why it's like I was in the middle of an argument in a dream and if somebody wakes me up it's like hey I'm like yeah yeah in the whole day is ruined cuz you're still in that mindset my girlfriend's gonna actually kill me because this is something that we're trying to work on getting into it's not fair to her but she's like hey good morning I'm like cute wouldíve good morning did you see my eyes are closed yeah that's not right what do I get you kids yeah okay do I have a baby and she's one year old and so I'm not getting much sleep I have not had sleep in about a year's this baby was born and I love you to death you're great but he's gonna sleep it's good to sleep yeah it's really hard because I waited til I'm this old I'm very old to have a baby and so I'm used to doing my thing and sleeping and now I'm not sleeping and so I am a maniac that's what I'm gonna be wearing glasses oh yeah yeah please do you need to get glasses yeah per month oh you look good really good Nick rogue's asks how often you try to and I'm hoping you understand what this question is asking mm-hmm okay how did you try to commit to the bit and the other party just refuses to pick up on it is there a way to gracefully dismount Wow okay that's that's private are you ready so this folks let me just art of it and here we go rob can I to swear yes okay all right ready and Bo come in come in people always ask me do I commit to the bit don't be a shit just commit you deck to the bit don't be a shit how often do I commit to the bed 100% to the bit never bail on the bit you little twit you must come in to the beds don't give a shit about the shit's good sake don't commit to the bitch that was pretty that was pretty bad that was very bad I mean an improv like the song that I did is specific to improv and comedy which is about committing like because you don't want to you don't want to start an improv scene and then bail on it you know like if we're like driving a car and you're driving and then all of a sudden I go and we're not driving a car we're doctors then you're confused it's like no you don't want to do that dr. Madren as impossible doctors don't drive they take limos so maybe it is specific to improv in that case go buy the lyrics of my song a hundred percent commit to the bit don't be a shit whatever else I said it was all comedy gold but commit to it yes in that instance yes 100 percent commit but if you're hanging out with your friends and you're doing like hey let's do a funny bit and let's let's let's push this pick this car over and enroll this car over that's not funny like now you're vandalize you know okay next question acoustic Chrissie asks how does an introvert survive in an extroverted world well this is a very great this is a doozy [Music] shaking transporation when introverted the world seems really big makes you feel like you aren't maybe that big so what you do is you just gotta fake it all the time I'm a really short person but not in my mind just get yourself a little tiny lie that you say every day hey you'll get mine this is not a good message necessarily for you but maybe there's someone out there who will benefit too introverts you get it that's a hard song that's a hard that's a hard so hard song and also a hard question a deep question deep question what do you do you consider yourself an introvert and extrovert um I think I'm an extrovert but here's what I would say this is my theory on this if this makes you feel better acoustic Christie I agree that it's not necessarily an extroverted world it just seems like that to an introvert the world I think is neither good nor bad it is what we make it I think but as an extrovert I will tell you that a lot of it is bullshit you know a lot of it is just like you do it because you get acceptance or laughs from people but really we're all kind of introverts yeah so you just you'll find your level of of extraversion extraversion yeah you'll find you'll find a level of that and until you do just find people that you cook with yes yes it's almost like reframe the question not how does an introvert survive an extroverted world more like how do I take care of my introverted self in a world in the in this world you know my mom used to always tell me I don't know why she told me this I think she thought I was an introvert she would say still waters run deep which I thought was so good it's just like you know if you're a quiet person that means because you're like thinking and you're feeling yeah yeah validate yourself man mister last one oh my goodness your glasses okay put him back on I think you look great I looked like a murderer bbbbbb okay I have a quote okay this one's good Michele Wallace asks how do you move on from losing a friend who like a friend a breakup yeah well that doesn't mean someone died right no no let's not go to the death row you got discovered you betcha [Music] so you lost your friend she was your friend and now you miss her but guess what she was more than just a friend now what you must do is don't pooh-pooh but leave on a choo-choo to a new situation where you take care of you that was not my best I would just like to say I am really bad at singing no oh it's okay I know that that's not one of my gifts we've had a couple instances here with the advice you give is a move up get out of town there are too many great people out there that that are dying to meet you so I get don't think that's a recurring theme I guess then my great great songs yeah don't don't hold on to the past there I'm a big fan of moving on if someone doesn't love you they don't deserve you and they weren't going to love you that doesn't mean that they're a bad person that you're unlovable or that you're unlovable it just means that like you are so special why waste your time on them yeah yes yes I totally agree but what a terrible singer right yeah I mean really really bad don't the more you say no it makes me think that you are a liar you know why you're not Taylor singer because you're singing at all isn't that sweet it's ah isn't that sweet at miss mass asks how do you get your work done when you have a dog slash cat on your lap here we go yeah got a dog okay boom and they really love to sit on your lap but you got lots

bye madam hello physica my drunk kitchen we still early sitting in my drunk kitchen we use power tools never meet your heroes why do people cook for fun holy guacamole I'm having fun for you well people they make you play as hard ice Mabel ass drunk this week on my drunk kitchen we are going to talk about challenges and no I don't mean the various challenges you see online he's a brief interaction here's a brief interaction here's my brief and trying to combine interaction and enactment here's my brief interactive n't in action is that reenactment that's the word I'm thinking of here's a brief reenactment of all of them over there oh I'm desperate for Constance too much I agree I like challenges anyway guys this week we're talking about challenges why because I'm getting older and you can tell because I'm drinking something called fondling Chardonnay if you guys want to try your own bottle trifling Chardonnay you should have a head of a crime ring flash bar so we can get $22 on your first order that four bottles of wine a month for the price of three but this very first daughter has $22 off so try wait calm Suharto whoo anyway guys this we got my truck kitchen we're talking about challenges and getting older because when you get older life gets more and more boring and redundant and monotonous but let's have to stay interesting so how are you going to keep life interesting challenging yourself and for me what could be more challenging than putting any effort at all into cooking which is why I'm going to make a souffle there you go okay and boiler alerts kids being a result is amazing at first like when you're in your 20s and you have so much freedom and slightly more money than you've ever had before but then you get your 30 and you realize just same thing over and over again until you die project how dare you imagine me by type of need sparkling Chardonnay free make your oven to 375 Hey so frothy milk chocolate generously butter souffle dish and sprinkle with sugar knocking out put butter inside your ceramic or glass to play dishes I'm using these ramekins and I hope it's right I think it's right I'm genuinely trying not to scrub this recipe because we need to get older screwing things up isn't nearly as fun why you may ask because you're running out of time [Music] do you liver in kidneys to you what do you get old like me you need to enjoy the simple things like incredibly fancy butter for absolutely no reason you told me this butter doesn't have something to prove butter your addition enjoyed this off-camera bling-bling-bling 1/3 cup sugar ok just sugar regular ol sugar huh oh so buttery and sugary if you like it to dessert already it's not drink has a reward for all of your efforts be sure to grip the cup with the towel because your hands are now too slick with butter to hold it on your up oh you know when I first started the show I was being a parody of the person I'm slowly becoming sincerely sparkling schattenjager milk chocolate in the middle bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water stirring occasionally until smooth removable from heat and stir in yolks wait yolks do I just do something oh my god I need to separate yolks of wife Oh God why would they put that any ingredients or not the steps why would you put that in the ingratiate student hustle step so go back to invisible steps number zero here's an important step the key to making a good souffle is making sure your eggs are room temperature not buy eggs these eggs are warmish they don't feel as good as your standard freezing cold spa egg wow they're still free good not gonna lie I'm still enjoying this oh maybe I have TMJ okay wash off all the throw chicken and period hmm next take 500 you know when I was young I never needed a new pool but out this bittersweet chocolate here we go how many ounces with it this is 12 ounces [Applause] [Music] it's like they're having a parade not really give me just one moment when I get the broom a quick sweeping fun no he hit chocolate goddess we did it look at this look at this we melted chocolate the next step is to stir in the yolks go quickly quicky just just drop em in here we got a stir in the yolk yes okay now the instructions say the mixture will stiffen so kids going this looks different oh no says B wife with a pinch of salt in there large mexic this is my only mixing bowl so we're in a bit of an impasse so instead of giving up I'm simply going to transfer the chocolate into this ceramic bowl before you embark on any new challenger task make sure you have the proper resources at hand for the inevitable bumps along the way both that could be 100% foreseen like meeting to mixing bowls this is all a metaphor actually it has some meaning to it which is that this the older you get it doesn't mean challenges unexpected challenges won't come out you just make sure you have the right resources for you in place in my case for instance two mixing bowls wouldn't that be nice oh no my mom fun isn't it fun let's do plenty started out technically what about the other bosses in school they're gonna have such good look at it goal-based plays instead of cupcakes that's the question beat life with a pinch of salt in a large bowl of an electric mixer at medium speed until soft peaks this is exhausting okay the egg whites with a pinch of salt and a large bowl of an electric mixer at medium speed let's go oh you're the expert these be oh my god I think it's doing it we got it now be very nervous and hesitant about this because you're so scared fucking up that's what a challenge is is something you're not very confident about at this moment I built the crippling sense of doubt [Applause] [Music] you pour wine into my mouth why does it look like that is that the way it's supposed to be day six of making the souffle we have not had firm peaks but I'm just going to mix it all together and then bake it anyway because this this is how we learn a trying and failing they don't know if it's a failure yet guys here's where we stand right now these are supposed to be fluffy it's always been and then we bake it it's clearly your disaster but I want to see how it turns out so let's keep going okay now stir that in there it all together look at this oh just like 15 is very souffle key maybe there were too many a twist effect morning here's your breakup once it turned out perfectly and that be neat [Music] okay nicely enough trying is fun okay this is the most dangerous part of a souffle finishing last the wine Kerch oh Jesus mmm okay here we go ah okay watch oh wait come on it's so beautiful Jessie slowly coming to focus oh my god holy shit pull guys 20 foot so it turned out beautiful looking it says serve immediately but also I'm too scared to touch it I didn't think that it would turn out like this but let's try it anyway guys what a sister's place turns out okay oh my god is this hope is this feeling called hope it didn't sink in or anything it looks like kind of East right if anybody here knows anything about your place maybe you're shaking your head down so let's just test food I think this is an opportune time for me to say I've never had a through play I also don't know how it's supposed to turn out so with that in mind buon appetito [Music] Oh baby oh my god oh my god I don't know anything to find me to say I'm really proud of myself right now I hope you got something out of this video I got a lot out of this video unexpected so 
while I was shooting I heart food I actually filmed a video that I've never posted called my nighttime travel routine I was worried there wasn't enough in there you know it was a little too real like real funny real funny who knows um but uh let me know you guys just take a look check it out hey guys it just wrapped up filming yet another episode of my Food Network TV show coming later this year anyway now that I'm so famous and glamorous I thought I'd show you guys what my nighttime routine is like so here we go after getting started at 6:45 this morning and working until 7:00 p.m. I need to take a little mental break so I get on my phone go on snapchat and bask in my own FOMO oh I also favored a bunch of tweets then when my face starts to itch I remember that I'm wearing a ton of makeup but then I remember that I need to get up at 5:30 in the morning and head to my next flight to head to my next city stare at yourself in the bathroom mirror just long enough to muster up the energy to maybe wash your face or sleep with your false eyelashes on but then remember the time you startled yourself because they fell out of your eyeballs while you were sleeping and they look like little spiders on your pillow no time to wash your base that will be better always wash your hands before washing your face and remember to put on a towel to hide your boobies from the Internet wet your hands to get your glorious hair out of your face because you hate the feeling of that like wet brow line when you start to wash your face you know what it means like that's the worst part to me is the feeling of like water dripping down your forehead anyway this is just now a video of me washing my face should we skip ahead I mean I think metal that's probably better oh but don't forget to moisturize because you're aging and your body is not only a temple but also a tool tweeze off all signs of socially perceived masculinity last but not least be sure to take all your vitamins that make you feel better every day placebo or not it works for me finally tuck yourself into bed for some restful and contemplative journaling but not too contemplative because you don't want to get caught up in a thought cycle that you can't control especially not right before you try and sleep oops too late or maybe tonight's other night for journaling after all an hour later restless and still awake briefly contemplate masturbation but then you're just not really in the mood wait I wonder if my antidepressants are lowering my sex drive no that's probably not the case I'm just tired wait did I hear something weird huh nope I'm just in a hotel filled with strangers that's fine just go to sleep in it 30 sleep free minutes later just give up on sleeping and decide to put your restless energy to better use you know maybe try journaling again or oh my god you could pack or clean your entire room you have to be on a flight in four and a half hours I mean you could just get ready now right maybe who knows and that's the end of the video that's where I ended it yeah I have a lot of trouble sleeping when I have a flight early the next day and also it's hard to like keep your energy at like a 10 or rather for television like 15 all day long and then get home and unwind perhaps I should exercise perhaps I should meditate there's a series of things I could try to do but in this instance the farthest thing I got done was cleaning my face and body and you know what that's good enough for me anyway happy Friday everybody I'll see you Monday night at 10 p.m. for I heart food and again later this weekend for a new my drunk kitchen we're just rolling out the vids guys mwah have a great evening day night have a great existence for in the moment present one that's too long an outro bye bye

this is my impression of a Thanksgiving dinner table ready here we go hey guys hello oh it's messy chery chery quite contrary i'm wrong that's why I'm drinking champagne or that Hector call it morning wine okay I have to poop I think it looks like oh it smells like butter hey guys this week on my drunk kitchen we're going to be making a cherry pie from scratch why you ask well it's not as if the holidays are complicated enough why not just make it harder on yourself Cheers oh the first step in making any baked good from scratch is of course questioning why you decided to do this in the first place then realizing you only have an hour to you have to be at your sister's house that's no joke this is live basically I'm filling it in the morning mmm step number fun get a little dizzy step number one preheat your oven to 450 that is very important Oh actually can you check that I just made that up for 25 step number two take all of these fresh cherries and shhh step number two take all these fresh cherries and unpick them oh my god that's gonna take forever how do you even on Pitt a cherry now if you like any normal human being don't have a cherry pitter and don't even know what a cherry pitter is it turns out you can actually use a chopstick to get the pits out of your cherries thank you my hammer take out this down get the pit out by pushing oh my god it looks so gross oh the about a day it's actually really really sad now the cherry pitting instructions actually call for an empty glass bottle and at first I was like why not how many empty glass bottle laying around but then I realized I do have an empty bottle a wine bottle leftovers place it on top of your wine bottle and pull the pin out [Music] so efficient or mush it with your fingers and pluck the cherry out and toss it in the sink Wow so easy this is a great activity to do with kids because kids are what I like to think of as free labor and like forever later look you have deep pitted all of your cherries in not nice because these cherries had pits because guess what that's natural hmm next step take all of your beautifully pitted cherries and put them in a new bowl wow you guys want on my trick to getting through the holidays flower for baked goods get it ha ha ha you thought it was a drug joke hey it for the filling with sugar cornstarch and salt in a medium bowl stir and cherries lemon juice some vanilla but he doesn't ask for flour okay if Beyonce it taught us anything is when you have lemons make lemonade and a really hot visual album Bob story short I don't have cornstarch and I barely have flour because I actually borrowed this from my sister's house so I'm staying in a mostly empty air B&amp;B completely empty anyway given that I have to bring this pie in 45 minutes I'm just gonna go ahead and add all the ingredients I do have while telling you guys the ingredients that are missing cornstarch don't have that vanilla don't have that salt don't have that dignity oh but I do have magic powers but I do have magic powers flour one cup of sugar roughly lemon juice oh this is really coming together and two sticks of butter but I only have one this pie is gonna turn out great you know making a pie is a lot like ham pose or paper in this it's a lot like having a family you don't ask for the ingredients you're provided is there more paper Jesus Christ but you make best with the ingredients that you've got and you gently ignore the way that the lemon juice and sugar have made an exfoliant against the cuts in your hands for all you overachieving mothers out there it's important to ask for help will you pour champagne into my mouth mm at your filling to your pie wow this looks like a pie already now many of your classic cherry pie recipes call for a lattice crust but I'm like look this is a perfectly good giant circle of dough what if we just place it on top wow you should do for real though is just slice a little bit in the top yes this looks like a real pie I think this is for ventilation maybe I don't know can you guys see how does it look so different to you than it does to me whoa that's a message we should all try and remember this Thanksgiving Oh put the pie in the oven for 15 minutes at 425 and then drop it down to 375 and leave it in for remaining 45 Jesus Christ this is a like a full hood is a commitment oh wow look at this like an hour later is it just me or does this just this is like a real I think it looks like for me oh it smells like butter now you have to let your pie cool because it's molten hot but if you like me are impatient and feeling and ever-increasing anxiety to get to your sister's house ASAP take a bite very nice whoa this looks really good albeit only slightly undercooked [Music] oddly earthy I don't know that's the word one wants to use when describing cherry pie mmm fresh but the point of Thanksgiving is not how a delicious food turns out me you know like just cuz this pie is not the best pie doesn't mean I didn't put a lot of love and time and effort to it so try to remember that guys when you're having maybe less than delicious conversations over the Thanksgiving dinner table think about a love and time and effort your family has put in to you or fuck them happy Thanksgiving guys I love you very much I hope you guys have a wonderful safe happy holiday good luck talking your families of differing beliefs remember as always show people the respect that you deserve go in with an open heart and also there's always the Internet Oh blessed blessed internet subscribe to my channel for new videos in general mmm have a great day have a great holiday 
Hey Hannah. I traveled through time and space because it seems like we missed my boop boop because we got too drunk in your kitchen, so I saved it for the best place imaginable right here on top of the London Eye so without further ado, Boop boop Did someone say straight white man?  *gasp* -So Eugene, I love you. -I love you too. -This makes me feel safe But also... free. -We first like closely hung out at Ned's Super Bowl party then when Gaga came on and we sort of like emotionally came together yeah, yeah, okay, witnessed. -Or came. Two different perspectives. -Yaas, girl. I've loved Hannah since she started Drunk Kitchen. There's a certain, uh, idea around people who work in viral content that maybe they're not, like, truly authentic or maybe they're not, um, really great people, but you've always been amazing. Last time I met you, we were at a gay club, and we were sitting in a corner, and we were holding each other's faces going, "Gah. We should hang out more." -Yeah. I actually think I said to you, "Eugene, whatever it is you want, you can have. You just have to say that you want it." -And I said, "Yes. I really want to order the nachos." You started with this concept of Drunk Kitchen, you're here in your apartment. There's like one camera. This is Hannah doing her s**t, she's f**king killing it. You have always been your authentic self and I think that's really important. Wow, I'm getting very touchy-feely. *Incoherent shouting* -I appreciate you saying that because I think people forget what the word viral means and, at its core, viral means ever-changing, ever-adapting, so I don't believe I could make viral content today because I have already gotten what I wanted. I have inhabited the host, and then- (musical interlude) I met you. So here, on this channel, right now Eugene, I'm gonna do what everybody wants to do. Let's get nipple piercings.  -Make out hardcore.  -Okay. -Um, so my nipples are really sensitive, so that's why I can't... -Me too!  -Yeah, same!  -Nobody should touch them! Don't play with them!  -It's really fun for a second, and then you're like, "Whoa. Too much." Oh my god! Yeah, there, yeah- -G*d d***it, Zach! -Can I list the Try Guys in the order of how much I despise them?  -No! *laughs* -Ned, you are actually not at the top. *gasp* Zach is at the top. *gasp* Zach and I know. -Oh, ok.  -We're too similar; he's Jewish, I'm Asian. Are you... Jewish?  -Yeah!  -I didn't know that!  -And gay! And, so white looking! It's been a burden my whole life. Just kidding, huge advantage. *ding* Eugene, my brother-in-law is also Korean,  -Mmm  -and, he gave me this gift of something I think is a lot. Can I give it to you?  -Yes. -Wait, do you actually have a gift for Eugene? -No, it's not a gift, it's a burden. -Korean ginseng liquor.  -This Korean ginseng liquor which, by the way camera, I don't know if you guys can see this f**king mandrake inside this bottle. -No, that's ginseng.  -That's Harry Potter. -Oh, wait. What's your house?  -Gryffindor.  -Whoo! -What's yours? Slytherin?  -Mmhmm. -Do you have more white wine? I'm asking for a friend. -I honestly have never met anyone who likes and wants white wine so much.  -That's terrible. -I like white wine a lot. -Okay, so, we are going to take a shot. Ready?  -So in Korea, we say "gonbae". -Gonbae!  -Gonbae.  -Gonbae? Gonbae? Wait, what are we gonbae-ing to? -To just the Korean-American children watching right now. -F**k yes!  -Yeah. May Ell-, may Ella and the Try Guys and Hannah Hart and Eugene enjoy this ginseng Korean liquor. Here we go.  -Gonbae!  -Gonbae. -F**ck yeah.  -I like it because I drink all liquor, but it does taste like dirt. What liquor gets you going?  -I actually don't have it in this house.  -Are you serious?  -Yeah. 100%. -Is it gin? -It's a single malt scotch. I can't have it because I drink it. All.  -Mmhmm. Mmhmm. -And you know I love a single malt, baby! -So, we're gonna put this on top of that.  -Ok. -Are you drunker than I am right now? -No... I am more drunk.  -Oh... ok... great. We're gonna put the layer of starch on top of the other starch, meats, and dairy.  -Uh. Just put it away like it never happened.  -Now the one thing that we have that we had to be aware of is, as the last layer, we have the, um, aesthetic- *gasp* responsibility. Yeah. -Oh my god! Thank god you're the last layer, because you're absolutely right. The last layer is the layer people see, i.e. the self you project onto others. -Even if you might be trash on the inside, you can be classy on the outside. And everyone's gonna taste you. -Alright, it's not trash. *laughter* -Gettin' saucy. I love eggplant parmesan. -I... love... fungi. -You know you don't leave mush-room for argument. *laughter* Portobello! -What's something that you've never told your audience? It could be small, like...  -*gasp* I know what it is.  -Ok. -I have perfect teeth. I do! I've never...  -never had corrective...  -I lucked out on the genetic gene pool, that's why I can never take credit for anything. I'm, like, so smart... and mentally stable... and, like, cute and compact. -Ok, so, I have mushroom, *gasp* basil,...  -Oh my god! What happened while I was talking about my teeth? *laughter* -mushroom, basil,... and then also, I know I asked for prosciutto, but I don't think...  -Oh, b*tch! -So I think I have the best layer. -And now we're on the last step, ladies and gentlemen. We're gonna smush this thing down, slather it in cheese,... and then,... we're gonna... eat this.  -Charles really wants prosciutto. Two of the Try Guys can't handle dairy... This is dairy... Hannah,  -Yeah?  -What should I do with this dairy? -Sprinkle it all over the top.  -Ok. -*Gasp* Different from what I thought. -It's perfect. *ding* -Let's just put it in the oven...  -Yeah!  -and hope for the best. Are you Try Guys or are you Try Men? -Well...  -We're Try Guys.  -Yeah, we're guys. -You know what it is, is called the "tri-mes-ter", Let's talk about pregnancy.  -Hey! -Well, there's three of 'em. That's why they call 'em tri-mesters. There's three months in every mester. -Everybody! Eugene, are you here?  -Mmhmm. -I'm gonna need you to stop staring just at Keith. *laughter* Is this a wine cooler? -I mixed, uh, Chardonnay with your Vermate. -Everybody, what we made here today, is a combination of all of us, and regardless of the outcome, it's about the effort. -That's a nice way of saying our pizza's gonna suck. -You really don't know that. It might be very tasty. -No... OH! *incoherent shouting* -We are pizza gods! -I can't believe it worked! Guys...  -It's like a really tall Lunchable, you know.  -I gotta be honest, I did not think this was gonna work.  -Oh!... Ooh!... Yeah! Aah!  -Aah!  -Jk, b*tches! This is a prank channel now! -Oh!  -Look at the bottom! We got some pink! Why is there nothing but meat on the bottom? In fact, let me get a little more pepperoni in here. *whistles* -Cheers!...  -Ok... Mmmm... *moaning* I love the crunch of the uncooked broccoli.  -Uh huh *laughs*  -Oh, the broccoli is a real winner here. -Not when it's gonna be what makes you fart. -And the sweetness of the funfetti, just coming through at the end.  -That's just pure melted sprinkles. -The center is nice and cool... like a medium-rare steak. *laughter* -I wanna say I hate this, and I can.  -It's really terrible. -Some of your pepperoni fell in your wine. -Where did that cat come from?! Aah! -Everybody! I think what matters here today is the following: "Combined efforts might not always be good, but they are always great."  -Wow.  -Wow.  -That's really smart. -B*tch!  *laughter*  -Wow. -Have you ever stacked four bagels together and just smashed it down with a bunch of meat?  *laughter* -I keep saying I don't like this, but I can't stop eating it. I literally can't stop eating this. Oh my god. -Hey guys, thank you...  -Boop boop! *laughter* Sorry. -Oh my f**king god. Ned is still here. Guys, thank you so much for watching, and... big shout-out to the Try Guys! Each...  -Woo! -...with individual names: Eugene, Ned, Zach, and Keith. Thank you guys so much for being here and taking the chance on "My Drunk Kitchen". -Well, thanks for having us, Hannah!  -Thank you, Hannah.  -No, thank you, Ned. *laughter*  -Muah! Have a great day!  -Happy birthday!  -Make sure you subscribe! 
did you oh wow this is not the appropriate cup for this also who drank all the champagne hello as too many syllables they don't just make you cry because you want them to I think we put too much sugar and almost everything you know get into pickling hello everyone welcome to this week on my drunk kitchen this is a very very special episode because I'm going to try and do something that we did on our food based entirely off of memory alone and also conveniently all the ingredients I need are here we're not setting up for failure no we're trying mmm what is this daring event you may ask well it is none other than one of my favorite things are no not mustard but pickling things pick up things things that have been pickled cuz tickle is a verb who knew all this and more on I heart food Wow okay great the first step in pickling things is having a thing to pickle they got amount of pickles today is this red onion why you may ask they don't just make you cry cuz you want them to right a slice so we were taking our onion and we are going to chop it into pieces that vaguely resemble pickled red onion on top of things that you like you get to pick because you're doing the pickling okay hold on say mmm which lies oh yes yes yes yes for those of you who have been here since the beginning of my drunk kitchen you know I had a strict no sharp knife policy well that was before I realized that when you cook things you have to use a sharp knife quite a bit so my new policy is have a healthy sense of danger great done nothing of the beginnings of what you need to pickle just appreciate it in its natural form the next step is put this in the jar or do I make the pickle structure first I mean you just give me a hint the hint is like you have to make the sauce first and then slowly put it slowly yeah because it's over I didn't put the burn all right but it's over medium heat so they don't just put things in the drugs no you have it you heat the you heat that up you put it in that you do one by one loop you cook the onions you know take the base of your pickling goodness and then surprise you don't just put it in a jar you're gonna actually have to heat some stuff up in a saucepan before jars even come into question I know it's crazy right I've definitely thought pickling meant putting things in a jar I'm not changed just like it's changing focus that I am here [Music] this is what happens when you place robots with humans I mean humans with robots it's a lot faster but not good okay so we are going to take full Redwine vinegar and apple cider vinegar and heat it up on a sauce pan to medium high heat adding sugar and then eventually another step red wine vinegar apple cider vinegar why I have two vinegars mmm things I wish I hadn't done surprise ingredient sugar Wow an undetermined amount now if you're me which you're not but you could be if you like me are wondering why sugar I don't know actually it's something for the bacteria to eat that sounds like a sugar thing it's crazy because when I think of the taste of red onion raw red onion to me it tastes sweet but that's why I named it it really is it really is I love it do okay pieces add soul I mean I feel like we're adding so many tastes here once the sugar and the salt have dissolved remove the pan from the heat and then you're going to add the red pepper flakes I know I bet you didn't see this coming allspice should do so I'm diverting from the recipe it asks for allspice and garlic but after sniffing both I don't want to do it I don't want to do it here we are we have our basin of hot important liquid which frankly isn't that the origin of all life and now we're gonna put on your jar this isn't a jar oh it's somebody push it up mmm and finally oh I'm adding my onions and putting them in our power sauce it's not really Assad now that you've added your onions oh I wish you guys could see what this looks like now that you've added your onions you're gonna want to stir them in you know kind of like Pat them a little forever and then wait until it's cooled completely before adding it in your jar for the purposes of this video I'm just gonna add them into the jar and pretend like they're cooled Wow now that my onions in their goo sauce have cooled completely I'm gonna add them to this jar or did I look I just want to take a moment to address the elephant in the room yes the jars are this they're purple I can't even I don't know if you guys can even see they're purple I like it but it's different and because it's different it makes me a little uncomfortable that is amazing work that doesn't mean it's not gonna work cuz you don't want to call it a purple onion there's too many syllables take all your stuff put it in your place call it a day and now you have it we didn't ladies and gentlemen we have pickled something yes it looks like a Dark Void on camera to you but to me it looks like onions that are on route to becoming onions that will last longer it tastes different you know if you ever find yourself in an uncomfortable situation or dare I say in a bit of a pickle thinks to yourself you know sometimes people really try to be here preservatives hey you guys thank you so much for watching also I'm goo for bearing with me eating raw onion I can't help it I really like it tastes great if you guys haven't yet please click like and subscribe if you

Charles mommy's barking okay you're good dude I forgot I didn't know you were pooping sorry man talking to my cat hello Matt vert bad day in honor of bisexual plus visibility week I want to share with you guys some of my experiences dating bisexual women my girlfriend is bisexual or rather when forced to label and categories of sexuality for other people's benefit she will use the term bisexual now I myself had prior experiences dating bisexual women for instance in college my opinion of dating a bisexual was a lot like this but if she doesn't love me if I to be attractive at all and that was rooted frankly in my own self-hating homophobia and some prejudices and insecurities against other people I had this idea that if she had loved and been with men then I somehow was Hanan against all of mankind I didn't consider other women a threat but I considered every single man we encountered to be a potentially huge threat probably because they possessed the one thing that I myself would never have male privilege I felt really insecure and like I was in constant competition with every man rien countered I didn't feel this way about other women in fact I thought to myself that if she was gonna cheat on me with a woman it wouldn't really hurt as bad if she cheated on me with a man now this had nothing to do with her this was a fear that I was placing on her stemming from my own crippling lack of self-respect and self-worth a lot of people in college use that time to experiment and that is a okay I really want to let you know that if you have the inclination to get drunk and kiss somebody of the same gender don't worry you don't have to start labeling yourself as anything labels are for other people you can call yourself whatever you want something else you might encounter when dating a bisexual is that people are like how do you know it's not a phase or they immediately ask you well has she ever been with another woman and then somehow you're placed in this position of trying to defend your partner's sexuality to the masses is that or not no it was a Chuck being put in that position can get in your head it can make you wonder is there something more you should be wearing now of all times you're just gonna yeah thank you presently I've learned that my prior questioning of my partner's sexuality might have just really made them feel terrible think of it this way if you were somebody who's bisexual and you're out there in the world being out and proud you're constantly getting questioned about whether or not it's just a phase or you should pick one already and that really sucks I have nothing but compassion for people who are bisexual because frankly I think we're all on a spectrum and they're the ones brave enough to admit it boom lastly people make assumptions about other people just right out the gate but we should live in a world where we can be ourselves and authentically express our sexuality without being questioned about it and if you do have questions ask them from a place of curiosity not insecurity so if you like me are dating someone who's bisexual here's some unasked-for advice your relationship is just between the two of you so focus on that more than anything else okay okay last but not least I have a lot to learn as always please leave a comment in the comments below letting me know your opinions thoughts experiences on the subject other times that you maybe have struggled with your sexuality or people questioning your sexuality let's talk about men who are by Allah to be up being poor bisexual men dude if you're bi that's great who doesn't want a great cuddly sexy hug from a big strong man we all just love each other dudes you know anyway I can't wait to read the comments if you're bi or you have a friend that's bi or you're dating someone that's fine give them a big hug this week tell them that they exist they're visible and that they matter and yeah mmm okay let's let's let's go into the end card hey guys it's me Hannah thanks so much for watching this video please click like and subscribe if you've enjoyed it and please again leave a comment in the comments below to educate me further on educate me further on this subject so yes yes yes and I hope you guys are having a great day I'm really excited at this video someone ended now and post it very soon but this is all already happened time okay fine

never hurts to be prepared for you know of quasi semi-big natural disaster so I wanted to share with you guys what my personal urban prep kit looks like for someone who lives in the city of Los Angeles now the biggest natural disaster maybe never gets to knock on wood or drywall because I live in California I'm prepping for the region's specific disaster of a terrible earthquake in the event of a terrible earthquake we will probably be without power and maybe without water so I want to be prepped for surviving this all at seven days without the help of any outside resources and of course there are a thousand million billion things you can prep for but why live in fear when you could live in quasi fear the first item on my prep kit I want to show you guys is this giant backpack the majority of my prep is in here and fits in here and it's portable to go with me wherever I need to go to tell everybody in my opinion the best kind of prepping begins with the basics and for me the basics are fire yeah by now my backpack specific prep kit contains a lot of drinking water in these little pouches but I have something even cooler to show you this is a self filtering water bottle I fly with this thing and take it with me everywhere you can take any municipal tap water and turn it into cleaner pure river drinking water just for you it also says you can dip it and use it to filter like river water but I have not been brave enough to try that yet now I'm sure you think I'm going to talk about food next but I'm not because I think that's something that kind of comes a little bit before food its first aid yeah first day really important to have a first aid kit on hand because let's say where there's an earthquake and you hit your head and you got a big ole cut or something and it's dirty and it's gonna get infected and then you get infected and then you're in a whole lot of trouble so sanitized and life surprise seriously though how about have a first aid kit basic stuff it's good you know other things in my backpacking cute I have gloves heavy-duty gloves because you don't know what you're gonna be needing to lift or move or push or pull or whatever out of this fire blanket fur if you're caught in a fire and need to put this over yourself and hopefully not cooked inside this is scary thermal ground covering whoo radar reflector okay that's some advanced stuff I have a tent for if I need to escape to the wilderness and survive off the land I have a knife for looking tough purposes one of the most important things to think about when prepping is energy what's your energy source what's your power source what's your fuel at all well probably nothing so that's why I like to rely on things that are manually powered look at this this is a self powered hand crank flashlight ain't nothing gonna take this flashlight away from me this little light of mine I'm gonna make it shine make it let it shine let it shine why not have any food in this bag now the point of a portable prep kit is that it is the most bang for your buck so when I show you the food I have in there well look it's emergency rations and its heart is a rock but it's light weight and 1 bar equals 480 grams which is 200 calories which is a good thing to keep you going so in my backpack prep kit I've got portable water food covering for my body and a light supply of first-aid but Hannah is that your entire supply of prep stuff nope not at all that's just for my backpack this box is my we have lots of time at home we're safe here but we need to travel north kit basics and essentials prep kit luxury prep kits my luxury prep kit includes a road atlas of all of North America another trauma pack stop bleeding fast because you don't know what if somebody got hurt a myriad of fun and fancy foods but you can't really cook them without fuel or ways to make water hot so I don't love these I do love this stuff freeze-dried camping food again returning to the idea that you don't have a constant power source bada-bing bada-boom this is a solar headlamp see see there's a solar panel here's the lamp I can use this so look at things and it'll recharge everyday hell it can charge all day long I'll layer it on top of my head and this way also people nobody's gonna try and mess with you cuz they'll take one look at this and be like you know what I don't I don't want a piece of that I've got tons of windproof matches because again fuel is your ultimate resource and you know if it's really a post-apocalyptic future you can use these to barter for trade and goods you know see be like hey I have a match give me something in return got a compass because I don't know what directions north can up where's north right now that way no that way ah useful a North American field guide to edible plants and wildlife recorder because who doesn't want nobody wants this nobody wanted this in third grade that was awful answer of a pack of playing cards because what's living without living life a little bit you know you got to keep your morale up just a smidgen what else is in here Oh casual siphon for taking guests from other vehicles okay yeah this one was pretty much inspired by all doomsday video games I've ever seen thick and cozy socks that can also double as like you know wound guard but also they're thick and cozy yay I'll be the happiest prepper in town a multi-tool eating device also known as a spork another pair of heavy-duty gloves but again I'm planning on using these for bartering and trade well actually I might keep these ones and trade the other one look I'm trying to figure out not only how a human can survive but also how a human can't survive amidst other humans because like it or not if there's some big natural disaster we're really gonna have to count on each other for support steel cups that we you can eat out of or use again for morale yeah and last but not least a wide-brimmed hat because let's be real guys life is about to be an even bigger adventure huh I really just wanted to put on this hat and that's basically it guys first aid food water fire making ability cetera if you guys have suggestions for other things I should put in my prep kit please let me know remember if prepping seems like this big costly ordeal and you don't want to touch it at all try and make it more approachable by thinking about it in the area that you live in for me I'm prepping for an earthquake that will leave me without power for a handful of days cool what about you what are you prepping for dudu this is a new way of opening the endcard oh hey guys if you liked this video click like and let me know also please leave a comment in the comments below so I can have an idea of some of the stuff that you've got prepped and ready to go you haven't already be sure to subscribe and click notifications so you know when my new videos go up other than that I got a repack all this shiz and well I hope that you have a great day

hey we just got to make sure your hair is in the frame this is the star of the show it's it's the ratatouille Kevin pig is there a tiny creature living in your hand and teach you how to cook there maybe it would make a lot of sense hey guys this week I am joined by celebrity chef Scott Conant do you like the term celebrity chef no okay we should hear what people call me I'll actually take celebrity chef as you all know I am NOT a chef I'm a food expert I am a food enthusiast but Scott here is actually an expert I mean you can you can cook thank God I can cook because I can't do much else no you're pretty good at hosting you know have you thrown a dinner party I just cut through a couple parts have this channel is all about self-improvement self-betterment but a lot of times doing cool fun things cost money like roller coasters those are expensive this is a difficult segway Scott and I are here today to show you that you guys can throw a dinner party and impress your friends without breaking the bank so let's get started with our dollar stores dinner party super Hall yeah every item you're about to see is $0.99 don't let the dollar stores trick you they try and upsell you never notice how you go on dollar store like wow I didn't think cyanide did that's not true something's a buck 16 er yeah he can't fold in taxes first things first table setting yeah so I got two table cloths what do you think it's a good lucky especially if you're a Packers fan yo are you ready for some football I'm ready I'm ready which tablecloth do you want being that we have the yellow plates I think we should go with the green to make it a little more fun I thought you might like a contrast contrasting elements if you'd be so kind we're gonna set this right here shut this wow that looks great small plates big plates both plates well it depends of what we're serving if you go with our appetizer and then a main course or main course dessert oh let's say that in this theoretical dinner party we're gonna do a nap and a main core I like it so good stack we could stack we could stack they're beautiful Scott beautiful that's but at least you got to have your cups for you know mysterious drinking he's drunk correct me if I'm wrong but not only is it about table settings it's about centerpieces do you think I found a centerpiece of the dollar stuff something tells me romantic or platonic a little romantic this is the Platonic one should we just lay this as a centerpiece or do we have something to put I'm so glad you're at that was we can do it I'm ready yeah sure we swap the pyramid for this guy oh that's great don't sit there so Hanna obviously when you're hosting a dinner party it's not just about the table sitting it's clearly also about the experience itself oh the ambiance your restaurants have music playing in that we do you do without a choice you had to make 100% all the pieces need to fit together so that's not dissimilar when you're talking about a dinner party at home music is important let's see oh and do my 50-cent two-step this is good this is good Oh ambience dinner music people I also think a big part of hosting a dinner party is making sure your guests are comfortable which is why I brought a votive candle which adds the ambience hey Beth here's a question what if your desk show up and they're already hungry but it's not quite time to seat everybody what do you do canapes orders I thought you said canopy first okay apiece I was like a can of peas canapes did you say can't pay or hors d'oeuvres yes well I took it to mean ashtray filled with corn nuts this might actually be a candy dish growing up I thought everything was an ashtray Oh beautiful one of these canapés can it please you're so close you can't match wits with you yeah you can trust me the perfect thing will hit you as you're driving home after this you're back on I understood Kennedy's Kennedy's all right we got the canapes we got a place setting we have the move the ambiance what's next drawing attention to ourselves something tells me you don't have a hard time with that okay I don't what a better way to be a host with the most then to way I see iris oh this is great oh I feel pretty oh my god you're beautiful I haven't put one of these on my head since my daughters and I had tea parties at home Oh now do you pratik their placements and how they prepare their tea parties I have been known to make sure that things are on the right please he's a bad I want them to learn yeah I know it's so why do it wrong when you can do it right in our to that now we obviously have a beautiful bodice for our flowers but if you want to go a little more rustic who doesn't love a mason jars 99 cents and look you can put a little candle inside here totally obviously you need mustaches just in case you need to disguise yourself and leave the party immediately after you've said something offensive which is normally what happens to me shop for the Bank of the West game it's not because of Nova the villain who knows I didn't know that there was kind of a manual of the style of mustache that you need add people like to tell you what to do a mini bowling kit for if there are small children coming on games firstly so every time I invite people over I like to set your things around an activity here show us only baseball skills ready I'm not this play doctor kit but this is actually this is for me this is 9-ball I'm just gonna put this away Wow and then of course your meal this is all 99 cents apiece okay so you have the scallop shell right and you can serve food inside the scallop shell oh my god maybe that's where your cannibal your canapes wait orders we just made two dishes for the price of one forget about it forget about it and then here is your end mini endive or a bok choy rock a little bok choi bok choy perfect I share just steamed that nice and then we played it I'm into rustic plating where I just plop things can I feed you some grapes I like it oh and there you have it guys a 99-cent dinner party dollar store super haul or whatever I said yeah and it's not because you've been such a wonderful guest truly majestic

I'm going to answer it comes from Debra in Fishkill New York Fishkill ah it's better than buzzkill New York am i right everybody AO ah the crowd goes wild her question is what and or who inspires you um you know I can ask this question a lot people ask me like what motivates you what inspires you and I have to say that frankly a lot of what inspires me is the way that you guys are as an online community I go and I reverse stock people all the time so if you've commented up one of my photos or commented it on video or anything like that just know that I'm I maybe have looked at all your so because of that I actually get a lot of inspiration because I feel like you guys are so brave and I get a lot of praise in public adoration and that sort of thing but to see people who are out there putting themselves out there trying singing little songs on a ukulele and posting it to YouTube that inspires me every day so yay next question Jennifer says what does it feel like having a show on the Food Network for those of you who don't know I have a show that is premiering on Food Network Monday night at 10:00 p.m. this Monday 10:00 p.m. 10:00 9:00 central you so what does it feel like it feels exciting oh this is a book that got Charles if I'd can you guys see that see he's a little smudge right there so if you see a little smudge that means Charles jumped on the book as I was signing it in true kitty-kat fashion but now he's just sitting over there judging me hey buddy having a good time I just I'm gonna take a picture and post this online later so you guys can see what the view is like from where I'm sitting I'll put on my snapchat right now here's my view hey everybody and then there's this young man I'll post it on my snapchat after the stream don't go anywhere okay boom next question this comes from Hannah in Dresden Hannah I met you at VidCon where I gave you a self-made CD have you had the chance to listen to it either way thank you for everything that you do love another fellow Hannah I really love it when you guys give me CDs though my computer no longer has a CD player my car does so as often as I'm in Los Angeles driving in my car I have a little stack of CDs like mixtapes people have made for me I like to pop them in and see what you're listening to sometimes it's angsty teen music and the eyes a 30 year old woman have to sit there and be like yeah this takes me back I remember what it was like to be like how is the world gonna be like this for me that's what my impression of teenage self Hannah's favorite music was that David Bowie next question Amanda in Charleston South Carolina says a very long question so let me sign this and then I'm gonna look at it okay oh wow okay I'm gonna start from here so this woman is sharing with me the story of her mother who is bipolar and has has died this last May her question is her her statement is healing is constant and it's okay to admit I wasn't there when I thought I was or even where I felt I should be aside from the issues you deal with a daily basis do you often find yourself surprised or taken aback by the effect your childhood had on you overall girl if I may be so bold Amanda yeah yeah man yeah they say that your formative self is they say that the first five years of your life really formed your synapses and you're kind of like giving responses your your somatic system really like what controls your adrenaline rushes but how you react to things just instinctually is actually learned and it's based off firing the gruffy in ages zero to five so that is huge that is in a number of ways anywhere from I don't know all of your interpersonal relationships to even things that you subconsciously don't even keep track of the fact that you're doing still I for instance here's a lasting effect I always always always chew on my lip I'm always going like this and it's just like kind of my default stance and that comes from when I was a little kid being really anxious and just sitting there kind of like chewing on my lip and so when I guess I use that only as a metaphor to say that the effects that the as you grow as a person your childhood is always present in you but your relationship to that past is for you to decide so you manage that so my heart goes out to you and your loss you should look up something called survivor's guilt and also get some support man you don't have to go you don't have to go through this alone and especially now that you've got your copy of the buffering book paperback edition signed by yours truly question answered by the Hannah

Paul Minnesota Olivia asks who is your food favorite Food Network chef damn Olivia that is a great question I recently watched guy's grocery games for the first time and kya area is kind of delightful everybody he's kind of delightful so Guy Fieri's up there and Bobby Flay I've worked with Bobby four times now we're trying to get together to do a my drunk kitchen spoiler alert so Bobby is a really just real guy you know so we can sit and talk about our cats and he's really important he really is informative like he educates me on things I didn't know a lot so yeah Giada De Laurentiis I mean I've worked with her too Giada was a total sweetheart guys ain't nothing but good things to say about these chefs chefs are real people real people that really Rock and probably all have a lot of tattoos okay next question Janine from Fellsmere Florida says I am by my oh I'm by my 14 year old daughter is a lesbian she has been homeschooled until this year any advice for her going to public school it was very different when I was her age by the way we love you public school man I mean you know as we know as Americans public school systems are dictated by the state so I don't know what Florida State public schools are like I know California State public schools I can say that you know it sounds like you are uninformed and aware parent and so as long as you're there without judgment and you're open to listening as she goes through her teenage years which are really hard because teenagers are frustrating no offense a teenagers out there we were all teenagers once and my advice is to take take a lot of deep breaths and be open for a new experience for you both so hang in there I say this you know not as a mother of a 14-year olds but as someone who likes to say my opinion okay next question Katherine from Illinois says I don't have a question just wanted to say how important this book is to me I didn't expect to find so much of myself in it Katherine thank you for saying that I one of the things that the day the Bufferin came out or the day after buffering came out when people started reading it and leaving there comments on Goodreads or on Amazon or wherever they bought the book from and they reviewed it I remember I was flying back from New York to Los Angeles this like six hour flight and I was just in tears I mean I wouldn't like crying but like I was in tears because I didn't realize how many people had similar experiences in their childhood to what I had so I gotta say Kathryn that the fact that you read it touches me in the same way that reading it touched you because it makes me feel like there are more people connected out there than we ever even knew so thank you for saying that Sarah from Lake Jackson Texas says how do you build up self confidence I finally have friends but I feel like they all secretly hate me I'm not laughing at you I'm laughing with you listen it's hard if you feel like your friends secretly hate you a great way to test that out is to confront that maybe why you just talked to them about it is there something that they did that makes you feel like they secretly hate you are you projecting do you secretly hate your friends all of these things could all be true who knows you know but I guess you just have to kind of test out your fears like if somebody says something that hurts your feelings in all of my friendships there have been moments of thing hey you know yesterday you said this thing and I it's just been on my mind and I just have to bring it up and that's okay cuz real friends will listen and then maybe you guys will learn about each other and grow together you know friendships are two-way street so just make sure you look both ways before you cross whoa okay next question Jessica from Louisville Ohio or Louisville Ohio how long did make me feel bad for cutting off your hair I think the name pre so there's a video called hair of the dog in which mamrie cuts off a chunk of my hair on accident and she felt horrible but I wasn't mad for even a second because I was like my hair will grow back I have short hair it makes me look cool so I think that after we all watched the video and saw what had the results I think that that kind of helped me not feel bad anymore because we're all laughing about it together that's a great question though and if you haven't seen it when you're done watching this amazing livestream and done ordering your copy of buffering but signed paperback available now at Hannah Hart book.com go ahead and check out that video Rachel from Buffalo New York says how do you feel about your life right now and are you excited for where it's going yeah dude great question Rachel I feel amazing Oh Charles is in a box oh the box fell over this is great we really should have just had a charles camp oh that's so cute and silly um I'm really happy uh not only do I get to publish this book that I have spent the last 30 years of my life thinking about writing realistically like ten years actually writing um I have a cat that I love a lot named Charles and I have a house that house but I live in an apartment that I really like and I gave food and shelter every day and I get to do work with my life that I find really fulfilling I am so it's it's like I would say I'm excited about where it's going but I'm just so happy to be where I am right now so that's what I'm really excited about Kaylee from kahoot hoga Falls Ohio says what do you do if you come out to your mama's bisexual and she doesn't believe you and thinks you're confused and it's been 2 years it might be 20 years you know it's I'm sorry man that's tough I think that something to consider is that when you're coming out to family members they have their own acceptance pace so in as much as when you came out to yourself you took years to think to yourself and kind of mold this over and I think the best way to nurture the process is to respect it in the same way you would a friend of yours who was struggling with their sexuality and struggling to accept it so give them their own acceptance rate and bring into the relationship the love and the respect that you deserve and then hopefully from there she'll meet you where you are but I can understand that that's really hard so god bless and good luck next question um but I li get from Gaffney South Carolina says all that oh my feet Lee doesn't say that I say that because I'm old now okay cool Lee says what is your favorite episode of I heart food so far Lee great question the episode that's premiering Monday 10:00

Alto California a shout out to the yo-yo says how do you feel about lgbtq+ relationships represented in modern TV and film do you currently watch any TV shows with lgbtq+ representation as a member of the glaad board of directors I have to say that it is our mission to accelerate acceptance in media meaning that we have to diversify our storytelling across all boards not just in the LGBTQIA spectrum but really to broaden its breach in terms of racial storytelling socio-economic background there's many many things that we can do to increase diversity in media today do I currently watch any shows with LGBT representation no not really oh are you my best friend yes you are look at that happy tail come here I mean maybe I don't see you Charles really likes to ninja cat all the time he

here we go I can't ask this question until the end okay next AJ from the rock coot Massachusetts says how do you handle homophobic family members I'm finna buh-buh-buh you know I can't say that I have the best policy that's a work in progress for me I don't really know how I handle that yet Nate is my mic okay oh yeah good that's tough guys I think it really depends on you and your circumstance and your relationship with your family I would talk to family members who are accepting and maybe strategize together I really wish I could give you some perfect formula for handling that but I just think it's like a fingerprint it's so unique to you and your experience but best wishes and good luck and please enjoy your copy of buffering paper bag okay next and Jennifer from Excelsior Springs Missouri

storytelling you know like working on the show with Food Network has been an incredible experience and also doing the Lionsgate film has been an incredible experience Charles Sawyer see sorry guys I need to just figure out a drone that is synced to him that can just record him at all times because you don't want to miss a minute anyway yeah so it's just in the same way that when I was finishing writing buffering I was really invested in focusing on this right now I'm not really working on another book but I do know that writing is something that doesn't just leave you it's not something that's gonna go away I will always want to write and I can't wait to write more in the future so another way to answer that question would be the word yes next question Kelly from Bangor Maine says which episode of my drunk kitchen was your favorite we've been your friends since episode one butter yo  man ah awesome ice cream someday will always hold a very special place in my heart and always

my sense is no matter who you meet at the ball or prom and how much fun you end up having dance with the one that brought you so I will always dance with YouTube because YouTube was kind enough to invite me here so yes and it will always be a place in my heart for YouTube yay next question Tasi or Casey from Crestview Florida says what is one fear you want to overcome in the future oh there's so many to pick from um I have a lot of like mortality anxiety I would really like to be able to be asleep at night and not just wake up thinking about death and oblivion so that would be good I got to work on that one another one would be my fear of I'm not really afraid of failing because I failed so many times yeah but pretty much that so I'd love to just kind of make peace with that and why could not wake up in like I fit a panic sometimes so I'd be really good my therapist and sisters say that the best way to do that is to just kind of reduce your panic level all-around which is inside my body so how am I supposed to find that and we'll find out this week on therapy Kimberly from Sunland California Charles is actually really helped to be honest we sleep together at night and he cuddles in my arms and it's brought me a lot of peace I love I am really like like he's like technically my emotional support animal but like for real he's my emotional support animal it's the best so

what is your favorite episode of my drunk kitchen whoo I already answered that so we're gonna skip it Tabitha I appreciate your question though but I did talk about that all of them English grottoes Virginia says in your book you talk about religion do you still practice Christianity now you know I have to figure out what my official are not official but my temporal stance on this is right now you know I I love Jesus and I think he's a pretty good dude I think that a lot of the ways we practice organized religion today is problematic and a lot of interpretations of you know the Canon as the Bible became desserts I'm looking at and it's a complicated subject for me because I kind of approach it from a theological background as well so I practice I practice face and that's faith in myself faith in the world around me faith in the goodness of people and you know just trying to keep keep aligned with that you know it's it's a toughy it's a good question but I am I'm still in the midst of it so thank you for asking okay more questions what is your biggest regret in life oh my god biggest regret in life I don't actually see who these last questions are from so I want to make sure I'm reading people's names oh here I got this one Dana Maynard says what's your favorite dish you've made on your new cooking show well when you check out I heart food you will see that I'm actually learning a lot along the way I would say that one of the things that I have eaten and been taught how to make is chile relleno and I haven't actually given it a whirl on my own but maybe that'll be an upcoming episode of my drunk kitchen who's to say there's a lot of new dishes though so I'm really happy Lily from Rochester Michigan says what charities do to support that you would recommend donating to I donate a portion of every paycheck and I'm always looking to support great causes great question I tweeted this out the other day but for me I donate to the ACLU I donate to Planned Parenthood I donate to the Southern Poverty Law something against with the sea and then a myriad of others that I just kind of roll through a monthly donations I feel like I'm in a really fortunate place in my life and a lot of times there are these organizations out there that are doing so much and people always ask what can I do what can we do and what we can do is show them our support by donating so if it's a dollar it's a dollar more than they had so I'm a big believer in donating to causes you believe in as opposed to feeling helpless cuz we're not helpless and being taught that you're helpless is a lie next question oh we're gonna take a phone call what water so you guys may not know if it's but another part of ordering your copy of buffering favor Beckett Hannah Hart book

say get along you mean like keep going at all you know like I've been pretty open with it like I have chronic depression and etc etc and I kind of trying to really reframe thinking of it instead of mental illness and something I'm trying to struggle through or struggle against I think that like my mental health and something I walk alongside so I reach out for help if I can but if I'm not in

Windsor New Jersey says why did you get your cat Charles what's the heart hand what was so hard to see my writing a book so lily I might answer your first question cuz it's like one question per book you know what I mean um but I love that you really slid that second one in there so why did I get Charles I've always wanted a cat I love cats I grew up with a lot of cats around we didn't have we had I had a kitten and she was never neutered or spayed and so she got pregnant all the time for about 11 years and we had a lot of animals in our house because of that I love kittens oh and I love cats so much and I don't care if it's because I've got like the cat parasite in my brain that makes me love them because like fine by me toxoplasmosis give me all of it but I've always wanted a cat and I'm kind of in a point in my life where it's time to start building my family and thus Charles Charles the guys wanna watch something Creedy Charles come he's trying to figure how to get to me the box come on buddy you got it he's cool right he'd come and he calls okay well there's a big pile of books in front of him and he's just standing behind it trying to figure out you can come here buddy yeah there is good boy see people say you can't train cats but guess what you totally can whoopsies yeah you good are you cold you want to sit here you want to get little snuggle on there good boy God he loves look at this Charles you're so good you're so always falling asleep that's the best thing about having a kitten too he's only six months old and you just pet him he just starts purring and then just falls asleep like I wish I was that way it's just like what is it time to be here yeah okay buddy you'd be good you want to cuddle you banana yeah yeah okay we're still going sorry guys that was me my moment of calm with my sweet baby boy my sweet little dreamer next question then that I really wish all the questions were about Charles what if my channel just becomes a cat channel guys would that be so bad my opinion not at all so next question Joshua from Saratoga California says when what's your go-to food when you're hungry but don't have time to eat a full-fledged meal Joshua this is exactly the kind of question I love because I spend so much time thinking about this okay somebody's busy he's got a meeting he's in the program no so what I do is I make hard-boiled eggs something I've been doing lately is making just like half a dozen hard-boiled eggs and on Sundays at the beginning of the week which is awesome because it's basically you know don't go out and spend your money on like a protein bar first of all there's not that good stuff in there and second of all they're expensive feel like you walk into a store and it's like three dollars for a bar it's more like you get six eggs for like six right and so I love to take hard-boiled eggs and out of the fridge and I just roll them and go and then eat them so hard boiled eggs and banana are kind of my go-to food and apples and baby bells little cheese's boom check this out whoa oh my god I forgot to eat you have enough time to pick up an apple and pick up a cheese and walk out the door you know so don't not eat people think if you don't get like everyone's like oh I'm not a big breakfast eater and I'm like you have to eat in the morning you have to it's what sets your metabolism for the rest of the day you know so you have to force yourself to eat and also I take medication every morning so I have to force myself to eat and it's fine by me ready here we go Morgan from East Greenbush New York says what was the process of you and Ella getting Charles Ellis my girlfriend and the process was we signed a pet agreement that if we broke up Charles will stay with me forever no I'm kidding the process was well I mean we did talk about that but you know that's just my fear we talked about it a lot I don't know if this is directly your question but we made sure that we were ready as a couple kind of to go in on getting a pet together because it's a really really really big deal to get an animal especially when you're getting when you're kind of co-parenting but so far so great and so far so great and I'm really happy and you know that's just knock on all the wood things seem to be going really well we'll see what happens nothing's are going great Jay from Fairmont North Carolina says how does it feel releasing the paperback versus the initial book release less are more stressful J great question also shout out to North Carolina releasing this paperback feels incredible to me because I worked hand in hand with the designer Todd it over at meat and potatoes and he and I designed every aspect of this cover together like literally I went inside his computer I was like no I want the circles like this big so in that way even though we work together on the hardcover book as well I just this really holds a special place in my heart because I want people who have no idea who I am or what I do or what my face looks like to be able to buy this book and just let the story connect to them and whatever way they can so if you have friends who don't know anything about YouTube or Food Network or celebrities and don't care about that grab them a copy of this because there might be something in here that speaks to them on a way that they didn't expect that's what I have to say about that whoa guys we only have two stacks left that after this it'll just be a Q&amp;A next question from Stephanie and Ashland Tennessee no question just want to thank you for being you thank you for

pasta now pretty well and I'm pretty proud of that and I like steak yeah I haven't really eaten a lot of beef in my life but I've started eating a little bit more beef Oh though I will be completely honest I'd like to get bison instead of beef cuz man bison is good Charles just touched something and now the computer's broken over here so I'm just going to scoot this this way Oh baby um so yeah I

they're just incredible live performers and I know that we've been trying to figure out when and where we can do other the no filter show so the answer is fingers crossed Bradon from Eugene Oregon hey Eugene Oregon says aside from your family and front close friends is there one person that sticks out that is greatly influenced your life yeah um a lot of people but one of them was my teacher my yearbook teacher in high school my English and my yearbook adviser so mr. Morgan was his name is his name and he was a really important factor in my life also my eighth-grade teacher his laundry was also a really big important fact of my life really my teachers man they really um you know I think what really stands out in my mind about those two in particular is that they spoke to me like I was an adult which is all I ever wanted adults to do and I was able to talk to them about stuff I felt like my peers couldn't yet understand if that makes any sense so my teachers in a big big way Emily from soro Denmark I wonder if it's pronounced like that the Oh has a slash in it and I don't know if it's burnouts like solo or not and Charles want to read this says on a scale from one to ten how much did you love Grayson memories my drug kitchen 25 very specifically is my answer I had no idea that was coming I got the texture memory that said check your sub box but at the same time I looked at my phone I also saw a tweet from grace that was the part one of their my drunk kitchen I mean it's I'm glad to know that they think I'm as I could ever be as funny as they are and I don't know I guess um it was really cool it I feel like Gracie memory have been just as excited and proud of the show as I have and that support means everything so I feel really good about it which is great okay Jerry from Fred from Federal Way Washington says what goes into the perfect taco love and tenderness basically that in the right amount of seasoning and fresh cilantro if you like cilantro but if you don't chop some onions you know put a little fresh crunch into your taco guys it's not just about the cheese even though the cheese is a huge huge factor but it's about like the freshness of the veggies that get in there as well a lot of food is diversity and texture talk

already read your book and found it very relatable thank you Amy did you ask permission from your family before publishing the the my sister had read a lot of it before publishing and then I went through and I mean guess the answer your question is no but I thought I tried to be as respectful and understanding of every perspective of every person that becomes a character in the book and there was a review from the New York Times that made me feel really really good or was it Publishers Weekly one of them said everyone is written with compassion and the fact that the the reviewer could pick up on that made me feel like I had done my job you know because my story is only my story from my perspective and I just tried my best to understand it to understand everyone at play from a compassionate perspective so let's answer your question okay ten minutes left all you guys I've enjoyed this so much live kitten falls asleep is the best show on the Internet let's just see what

gonna speed answer five questions and then read a little bit from the afterward and then we have a special question at the very end so I'm gonna five questions and you this read afterward right so Madison from oat froze you that don't know the afterword is brand new so I actually wrote an afterword and added it to the paperback edition that talks about what life was like after buffering came out I met so many people on tour who related to the stuff I wrote about in buffering and it was very emotional experience for me so that's brand-new afterward only in the paperback be sure to get yours Hannah Hart book calm thank you okay Madison gar Madison from Garland Texas says how do you feel your YouTube fame has positively affected your life Madison everything in my life is because of the support of my community online so I feel like it has had nothing but positive effects on my life this career has had nothing but positive effects on my life and I I hope to live to be worthy of it

a book of your poems and read them all there you go next that was - here we go sorry I forgot I was gonna do it fast so let's keep going Stephanie from Niagara Falls Ontario says what other okay you said that writing buffer II was a vague buffering was a big leap out of your comfort zone what other leaps out of your creative comfort zone are you hoping to take on in the future you know for me writing actually is something I'm really comfortable doing so for me writing was well within the realm of my comfort zone hoping to do justice to the story I think that was a big leap what other leap semi-homemade I take in the future honestly right now I'm leaping into television Food Network Man Monday 10:00 p.m. this Monday is my leap into the future 10 9 central if you live on Central Time it's 9:00 p.m. so that's what's happening right now Kiera from Hartley's Villa Pennsylvania says not a question but you tell Stephen that Kiera loves him he's watching now oh my god Stephen Kiera loves you and the last question is a TB trying to figure out one that will be great [Music] so grace from Portland Michigan says what were you just born awesome and I would say this no but thank you for feeling that way we were all born equally awesome Nicole from Howell New Jersey says any advice on taking the first steps to getting mental help during college yes the advice is start taking those first steps because no matter what you have to start I know that my first counseling experience in college wasn't perfect and it wasn't what I I wouldn't say that it was exactly what I needed it to be but it did get me in the habit of trying and if that's the habit College is gonna bring you trying to find a therapist trying to get help asking for help then it doesn't really matter how the therapy turns out because you're building into yourself the habit of trying because every time you move you're gonna have to look for a new therapist or if you're a therapist and you just continue a relationship you have to find somebody new so get in the habit of trying that is my advice for that so last but not least I'm gonna read a little bit from the afterword and then I'm gonna do our last question and then we're gonna call it a day guys you know we're clearly very busy Charles kam over here let's see how busy we are we have just completely descended into snooze town oh wow yeah that's it for you that's you're done oh okay sometimes Charles Falls so hard to sleep I can literally like pick him up and put him down and I'll just be a sleep all time I can lift his little paw and he'll flop it down you're good buddy okay here we go afterward Oh God so I just flipped open to a chapter you know I haven't read buffering since it came out I started to the other day and I was like this book is heavy so a little fun fact about me okay and afterward buffering entre Tesla like fully loaded writing a memoir and putting your story out into the world is a nerve-racking act it's basically like handing a total stranger your diary to read so I was more than a little shocked by the positive response I got the number of people who read my book related to it and who gained some measure of wisdom or wellness from it people praised me for writing it for being a survivor and for being brave enough to share my story so that others might benefit from it but the thing is I didn't feel brave as I was writing this book I felt terrified I've never been more nervous about anything in my life I was scared that I had done a disservice to my family and to myself by opening up these chapters of our lives and retelling them the best way I could what if my memory was too biased to be true what if I had just somehow made everything up what if I'm a butterfly that this is just dreaming it's a human blessedly none of that was true except for the butterfly bit TBD guys we don't know well my sister Naomi called me after reading this book and said good job boo really really good job I felt relief and then even more vulnerability Wow now it really was all out there what if no one ever looked at me the same way what if I never looked at myself the same way I wondered now that the deep formative events of my life had been put to paper does that mean that the process of processing was over was there nothing more to be learned was there nothing left to say FedEx is here to pick up your books I'll read I'll read just a little bit more and I hope that this is enticing you to buy the books to read the entire afterward its FedEx kam I um buh-buh-buh-buh-buh okay here we go so one more paragraph of the afterword and then we'll start stop I went on book tour in each day the cycle and each day was a cycle of validation and depletion it was incredible to meet people who shared similar backgrounds who had struggled with similar things or who had even just been touched by a simple sentence or two if we can wait like literally two minutes okay then here's the last of it and then we'll do our last question guys and then we'll be out for the day thank you guys so much for listening and for watching just in case we have to rush the ending I just want to say this last little

give it AB every keg so la hey everybody this week on my drunk kitchen there is a my drunk kitchen and I oh shit yes after two months of me you know just I'm thirty is there oh my god there's literally a cobweb on my camera my tripod has a cobweb on it that means there was a spider in my house oh my god look I know the truth a lot of you guys click this video because it says cauliflower grilled cheese and if you like me are on the internet I'm still caring at the cobweb Michael I hold up just let me just look anyway else chitchat aside because I know that's not what you're here for today we will be making cauliflower grilled cheese yeah it's what it sounds like it's where you take the bread arguably the best part of grilled cheese and you rip it away and replace it with cauliflower and the internet says that this is good whoa but my friend Corinne over a thread banger didn't really enjoy it oh so as the great investigative diplomat whoo is that a thing that I aspire to be I am going to investigate whose correct the entirety of the whole internet that's all obsessed with cauliflower grilled cheese right now or currents reaction which is that it was not great so let's find out let's find out let's find out oh all right seminar one is to cut cauliflower into florets that means you take a head of cauliflower which looks like this oh look at that and you cut it into florets which look like me holy shit oh lucky people poop let's get it ah you know people say on my drunk kitchen I drink less but the fact of the matter is I just drink harder okay klaxon at least you take your florist and you bring them I'll do that again really really fast you think the wonders of what I like to call yeah I forgot what I said it's a transition but look guys we did it yay see do you see the chemist do you do this this is what it happens is now you may be wondering Tana would you ever get things and the answer is no I don't want that you may be wondering how a blended AI smoothie makers because I lack the proper tool or they're in this house and we're under something I don't know I don't like to look for things either they're here they're not that's as far as I didn't learn oh okay they have two countertop that you use at the cutting board and then also vacuum later here's my egg I'll edit and for proof I'll do a secondary camera because people see miss to that these days indeed screech oh look how orange that egg is it's because it came from a chicken that lives in a backyard I forgot to beat it before I put it in so just start mixing it together and hope that that wasn't an inherently crucial step now if you're vegan whoopsies open up the sides of the waist to let everything out nobody can't just do that and cooking school huh I in my hand itchy am I getting your hive Anaheim that's not funny I'm very scared of allergy Nexus is that a specific amount of parmesan I don't have parmesan today wait let me of Jesus visual cue here's proof

Brown 3-way to be you and me gonna hang with key okay we should did just I ordered some fried chicken so I heard that you have three different nipples I sure do but one of them's named Bart the other two are named Samantha this is a classic target target it's crazy Keith how old are you I'm 30 okay 31 target was not like this when we were kids they sure weren't got that Starbucks inside they have a pizza every single time I look up at Starbucks it's inside a target and here's the thing it's not the same Starbucks don't work the same their employees aren't you shitty yeah it's rough because they're targeted this is a portion I get more drunk oh I've been getting there at all time I feel like Eugene and I are taking care of the better part of that whiskey bottle e Keith let me ask you this question if you're going to say there was a treat about you people like the least what is it oh I'm faking my exuberance sometimes I'm just get excited like I say Keith a lot but I'd say it more on camera than off still say a little bit off it's a very funny name like nobody's named Keith it's not a great name but it sure is fun to be a good one the kingdom keep in my heart you know they keep these means from the battlefield yeah don't bitch yeah did you have a rolling pin I just think we should roll it because we're getting to the top here and this is already that's much experience you have lack of confidence in me decisions this is my player right yeah it's really linked with control which is my least favorite thing to do what's going on back there okay this is to level a regime that has first portraits because dynasty don't have the underbite oh god no Keith you're much prettier than that I would say her but I can't tell ya I think that one's a deep but say girls in the paintings look similar eyes just the truth genetics are what they are and sometimes you just gotta roll with it hey you put the pin in the seat right there Keith this is a way better idea I'm trying to help trying to make it so that Eugene has a chance to add to the cake you're trying to take her so I'm just trying to do my little part or three people in I just got here I haven't been in the video this entire time you know I just think that it you know one of these how many of the tribune yes friends time sorry I tried to have you do it my way it's okay chickens gonna be here in 20 minutes what's the theme of your later bro it's just pizza stuff see here's the thing that I can't eat dairy so I have to have to do a month-long an elimination diet no I just love my dad so I prefer now got my guy so I want vegan cheese but be cheese you know whatever words the vegan cheese pizza with meat on it and I wanted me know my pizza because I never get to have that you're right you want sausage do you have something I have so many sausages yeah Hannah cooks the sausage I want to tell you a little bit about pizza sauce me pizza sauce is made of a tomato paste with sugar in it you know one of the things that really appreciate about the try guys community is their willingness to try because I feel like so many people are afraid of failing but they won't even let themselves begin you you it's pretty graphic that was easy was that sausage you love Keith you know you just never know what part of the animal are you you know what I heard recently a grind dairy cows and ground beef and the mammary glands are in the ground meat and therefore ground beef is not necessarily lactose free holy when did you start working at BuzzFeed high so right there at January 6 2014 so I've been there just over four years did you study video making no I studied French horn playing and then the extra cold stuff but it was an improviser for a while and then I started touring in the country and then identity and then I thought oh I'll be an editor that's a skill I can sell they know how to make digital stuff so we're besties so I could learn leave didn't leave here we are I think we should put that in there before I put the sausage in you got it just because it's gonna spill over the tips your there's too much sausage so I'll save everybody all by oh you want some sausage for your mouth the sausage that a butterfly earlier in the episode Oh come take a look at the mess no you're both good guys is it gonna burn my mouth is 42 I guys like all baby bird we're baby we're in heats mama bird Eugene's not participate you can slate it can see our hairless that's delicious thank you I'm Bonnie that was entirely her purchase choice and really not my cooking I want to put more toppings on it but we should probably wrap this Jean mushrooms just give me sauces then sorts of flavors in there yeah so mushrooms in it doesn't really matter yeah I guess put them on there that it's ruining know there's sprinkles on this pizza mushroom do once red pepper we can think of so anything about me my time is fucked up let's just put time on it you really suggested time a lot so I'm just gonna I just think I'm gonna follow I'm thinking there's no time time is my favorite you know this is the first time I'm suggesting we put time on the pizza this was some time on the pizza yeah that's plenty [Music] every time on the Internet's people want to tweet to their favorite reigai and tell them that they're their favorite our guy they include me to apologize to me that I'm not their favorite trying guys so two days ago that was like oh I just gotta say that my hair tribe is at corn Diddy sorry yeah keep Eugene's handle is more obvious since it's Eugene Liang that's called a casual integration do people only apologize to you I feel like that's the case no you're the unattainable everyone's thinking about you everyone is thinking about you and they think the others can't take it think about it this way you have feelings of attraction toward someone in the room and then what do you do all night talk to their friends flirt with Zack oh that's how many material I need literally told us that do you get it have you put a pieces together yeah you've clearly never been stabbed no I have not been stabbed thankfully well why are you feeling any joy of course they like me the best I just don't really spend a lot of time with straight white men a straight white man feel safe but also free
