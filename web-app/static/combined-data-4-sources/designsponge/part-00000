Run  don’t walk  to see #Blackpanther as soon as you can. I was blown away by everything and everyone in this movie. Everyone in this film was incredible but I am doing a deep dive this morning into the costumes and their historic references as well as their connection to Afrofuturism.

I can’t even begin to describe how deeply awesome this movie is. And as a design fan  the details in every aspect of the costuming and tech the film highlights were stunning. There are some great threads on Twitter detailing the cultural references in each character’s clothing but I’m going to look for more articles to share- there’s so much to learn and admire about every part of this film.

"We are so lucky to have women around us who are running amazing businesses we admire and who are willing to share. [They're willing to] get in the weeds with us and to celebrate the victories. [They] make it all feel a little less lonely."

Chelsea Shukov co-founded Sugar Paper Los Angeles with her friend and business partner Jamie Grobecker. I got a chance to interview them both of our AnnTaylor Inspired By column and they reminded me why community is so important in business. Chelsea's reminded to help and connect with the women in your business community is great advice for anyone in any stage of starting to running a business. You can see Chelsea and Jamie's full interview in the link above.

"Think about how you can make [workplace] environments better for the women that are coming up behind us. Spend less time fighting our own battles and more time fighting battles that will remove those [problems] for women in the future."

Visionary thinker and self-proclaimed bookworm  Lisa Lucas has her finger on the pulse of what's happening in the worlds of literature and publishing. As the Executive Director of the National Book Foundation she has lead the way for greater inclusivity in publishing and is working to ensure that the stories we share and celebrate are as rich and varied as the voices telling them. I'm endlessly inspired by her mission at the NBF and was thrilled to talk to her more about her background and how she stays motivated in moments of self-doubt. ("I just keep moving. Motion has always gotten me through.") You can read our full interview together at Ann Taylor (link above) from the Inspired By series.

"The number one asset we have is our instincts  so never let anyone tell you that you do not know enough."

From the moment I first met her  I was inspired and invigorated by Phone2Action co-founder  Ximena Hartsock. Her energy and passion for her work (using technology to help people speak up about issues that are important to them) is infectious and she could inspire just about anyone to follow their dreams and shoot for the moon. 

After immigrating from Chile  Ximena worked as a teacher in the D.C. school system and worked her way up to Deputy Chief of Teaching. Then she worked for the Parks and Recreation Department  followed by a position with an education advocacy organization. It was there that the idea for Phone2Action was born. Ximena's goal is to "show investors that female founders can build a strong business." I think she's more than proved that  but you can hear more about her goals  ideas and advice over at Ann Taylor for our Inspired By interview (link above!)

But as women we should embrace the ways we approach differently and why those differences make us great leaders."

Amanda McClements of @saltandsundry in Washington  D.C. talked with me for Ann Taylor 's Inspired By series and her advice about women in business being themselves and not needing to do something "like a man" has really stuck with me. You can read more of her personal story and amazing life and business advice in the link below.

You can be a great mom and a great business woman. Mama  trust me  you are worth it." 

One of my favorite wise business women and parents is Agatha Achindu  co-founder of @yummyspoonfuls . We first met when she donated a life-changing amount of her organic baby food to our local food pantries here in Ulster County and we kept talking about life and work and all the challenges in between. I had the honor of interviewing her for the Ann Taylor "Inspired By" series I edited and her words have really stayed with me and reminded me of so many working parents I know who are balancing raising their children with running businesses. You can find more of her wise words over at Ann Taylor (link in profile above).

hi guys welcome to the new design sponge this morning I wanted to put up a little video to walk you through some of the changes we've made there's a brand new look but there's also a drastically approved organizational system so this video will show you some of the key features and how to use them all of the primary navigation for design sponge now lives and top navigation bar starting with this main one right here this is where you'll find all of the primary categories like spaces places before and afters DIY products and everything else you can meet up in the top navigation bar you can find out more about our team how to contact us and information on advertising with the site next to that you'll see the improved search bar also links for the RSS feed our Twitter account and the design sponge Facebook page now that we've talked about navigation it's on to content there are three main content wells and design spots starting with the primary blog column on the far left this is where all of the new posts will be above each post you'll see a bubble that has comments you can see how many were left but also click it to leave your own and next to that you'll see an author's byline this is who's writing the post that you're reading and you can click on their name to view all of their archived posts the center column is brand new it's where we'll highlight some of our main categories during the week just in case you've missed something you'll see post here for a do-it-yourself project sneak peeks before and actors and any of our other major original columns the right-hand column on designs of Suns used to be reserved just for ads but now we put special content units here that will highlight some of our favorite posts and help you navigate the site better see I want to unit at the top right-hand side of the site will help you get some quick links if you're looking to do something very specific like decorated room or plan a party further down on the right side you'll see our featured posts section this is where we'll pull out a post a video or other content that we're particularly excited about and highlighted here below that on the right side would be a list of the most read posts of the month this is where you can check out what people are talking about and what's popular on the site if you scroll all the way down to the bottom of the site you'll see a brand new section called recently at design sponge this is where you can see weekly content organized by day so if you're coming to the site on a Thursday but missed Monday through Wednesday you can click on those links to see what posts happen on the days that you missed now it's on to the good stuff this is the part of the redesign that took us forever we had to recode about 11,000 posts but it was so worth it you can now search every single landing pages content based on your specific interests for example if you'd like to search sneak peeks by ownership or size or location or style you can do that the same with do-it-yourself projects before and after and every other landing page you see in the primary navigation bar let's start with houses to just show you an example let's say for an example that you want to look for homes that are just rentals just go to the middle column and click on the word rent if you're looking for small spaces that are similar to yours now you can check the word small to narrow further and only see rentals that are also small spaces if you'd like to narrow even further you can select States or cities or even countries to make sure that your location that's exactly where you want it to be the more filters that you apply to any landing page the smaller your search results will get so how do you back it up so that you get a larger and on the search result and don't filter quite as much just uncheck the box next to the word that you'd like to stop narrowing by so if you'd like to see larger homes in California just uncheck the words small and you'll see houses of all sizes now that we've talked about how the site is laid out and how to use it I wanted to highlight some new sections like our columns landing page which you'll see in the top primary navigation tool the design sponge has worked for years to create a team that creates original content every week and I wanted to be able to highlight that in a better way so in this page you'll see icons for all of our original columns that happen on weekly or monthly basis if you have a favorite author or a favorite column you can bookmark this page and keep track of what happens here speaking of authors if you have a favorite design times team member or just want to get to know everyone here better you can check out the about page and click on people to read more about our editors and see their latest clip last but not you have a new section of the navigation called entertaining this is where all of the recipes for food and drink will live party ideas holiday ideas and things like weddings and other events this is also where all the flower arrangements and flower how to's will live you can search all of these and refine them further and this is where you

last week I visited taxi at sprout home in Brooklyn to learn the do's and don'ts of terrariums whether you're up to your elbows and plants or just want to add a little bit of green to your home terrariums are a great way to bring the outdoors in so let's meet taffy and get started hi I'm Cassie from sprout home Brooklyn and we're modern home and garden center focusing more on urban gardening we have outdoor plants indoor plants cut flowers and home accessories today we're going to go over how to make a terrarium and also how to maintain it once you've done it okay so let's get started Oh so the first thing you want to do is choose a terrarium a container so either an open one or a closed one at the top and we're going to do an open area all right so the first thing a drainage layer there's no drain hole entering so it's really important to have a false drainage and you can just use river gravel or rocks anything that can collect the water a little bit underneath the roots so you want to do about an inch of rocks on the bottom to act as the false Queen she's got a baby okay so the next step is you want to add a layer of charcoal on top of the rocks and that just helps keep the whole Terraria really fresh it prevents mold and bacteria of different things from growing in it so just a bit layer and it's really messy we have got to leave all that behind so after you have the charcoal layer you want to do a layer of potting soil if you're doing a cactus terrarium you want to make sure you use a cactus succulent mix but for ferns and bosses just use regular potting soil so now you just want to add a layer of potting soil on top of the charcoal and you want the whole thing the rocks the charcoal on the potting soil to be about 1/3 the size of the container ok so the next step after you have the rocks truffle and potting soil in is to put the plants in and you want to start with the largest plan first so you can kind of see the placement in how much room you have so I'm putting in a maidenhair fern and make sure when you put in the plant you turn off any dead leaves you inspect it provides you don't want to put in anything that you think might - hey terrarium so you want to put the plants you want to give them a little bit of room in between all of them you don't want to do anything that's going to be a little crowded or ideally you don't want anything to touch the sides of the container just because you have a lot of condensation the leaves can drop easily if it's touching the sides so just try to really prove back the plants when you put them in and space them apart a little bit and then the last type of plant you want to put in it's any sort of ground cover or boss I'm putting in this is a ruby red peacock Moss and you also you don't have to fill the entire container you can definitely leave some empty space and room for the plants to kind of fill in and I'm just going to put in this willow brush this is the sub part and again the inanimate things of the terrarium and then I'm also putting in these kind of faux Moscow and here's the fish trim it's kind of lower medium light for sauces and a little part okay here's some quick do's and don'ts for terrariums you don't want it up in a lot of water because once you water to her and you can't take the water out so when you do water it just very little water always err on the side of under watering that over watering you can even just miss the plants and just step in like a shot glass or two of water also with terrariums you don't want to put them in direct sunlight because it's literally going to cook the plants so you want it to be very kind of bright natural light but not direct Sun another thing you want to make sure to watch with the terrarium since it's live plant material is any sort of prevent pests or rotting leaves to want to remove those right away you don't want the whole terrarium to get infected with any molds or bacteria so as soon as you see something that's like dying off a plant or a leaf just go ahead and pull it the contrarian to try to keep it really fresh and clean all right so good luck making your own terrarium and if you need any help come into the store at forty-four Grand Street in Williamsburg Brooklyn and you can also visit our website at sprout home baby a special thanks to taxi and everyone at sprout home for their help of this video you can purchase any of the terrariums you've seen here and find more information on sprout at WWF Hong Kong underneath the big umbrella born in night I've got to leave up 
where we run to with all of you sometime when you do with all of your ears cast aside who tend the garden when hi I'm Sarah from wieder was die jest and today we're here in my shop sigh cool and I thought that together we could make a few arrangements so of course we're gonna do a simple an anti bouquet for a jar and then second we'll do a clinic UK bonnet inspired simple arrangement so let's get started so when I start with when I start to make an arrangement or okay I like to work in my hands instead of working right in the base because it kind of gives me more control as to where the flowers are going to be placed and I like to start with the biggest flower that I'm going to use and then build around that I'm going to start by picking a really bright pink flower to go next to this Bellini maybe we'll we'll grab one of these random Chile's here everybody knows that I really love ranunculus have some gorgeous and Emma needs in the shop so we'll start with this triumvirate flowers for our handheld bouquet I use some scabiosa Peter Cushing flowers these guys are really lucky so I'm gonna kind of split them up a little bit as I go also I'm gonna remove leaves from the bottoms of the stems because you don't want anything so I'm kind of tucking smaller flowers in between the three flowers that I've got going on here as I'm working here in terms of color we've got obviously a lot of contrast between they're really bright pink flower and then the lighter flowers on the edge when I make them okay I like to think about each flower relating to the next flower so this dark pink flower I'm going to start working out from here and keep the lighter flowers on this edge so I'm going to grab some of this really beautiful crabapple I think it's really lovely about crabapple is that or any flowering branches that you can pretty much go out in your yard in continents this time of year so if you're to go about making an arrangement like this yourself at home what you would think about doing maybe is going to your florist and perhaps buying a few single stems like let's say it looks like in here I'm going to have a one anemone one peony and two ranunculus and then a few scabiosa and then filling in those flowers with things that you find in your own yard I have one really special vernacular up here that I want to add into this okay this is a quick tip I'll give you so sometimes ranunculus they're the weight of the flower is so heavy that it'll cause the stem to kind of go oh my god and yet it's still getting water up into the head because the head still looks pretty moisturized so what I'll do with the with a fragile flower like this that I want to get a few more days out of I'll also thread it down through this bouquet and basically the rather flowers will provide a support for that one key head and we'll get a few more days out of this beautiful flower I'm gonna clip the stems for this hand tied about an inch up from where I see the bottom of the vessel Simon I mean I just fold it next to it and cronic ostomate wrap some string and tie this off so it kind of you know maintains the shape of the bouquet that we sew painting so I wanted to talk a little bit more or play a little bit more with this really beautiful crabapple so I grabbed this brown bottle from the kitchen it's a really average just kind of plain simple brown bottle but I thought that it would contrast really great with these pink crabapple Frenchy's anytime I have flowering branches what I'm going to do is split the stems so that the branch can absorb more water up into it what I'm going to do is take my clippers and you can also do this with a knife and just kind of work my way split it and then kind of work this down a little bit so exposing more surface area for water to be absorbed and they're going to kind of create this structure or this base for us to add to other flowers too so I want to keep this arrangement really simple kind of in the style if you keep on uh I'm going to grab pale pink peony kind of glow to them close to the base and then I'm going to offset those two elements with a darker flower again Phyllis and I want this one opposed to be just a little bit taller than that PE perfect so 3 really simple elements together working in tandem making a beautiful arrangement so lastly I thought maybe I'd show you how to create a simple tape lattice over the top of a vessel should you be a little weary of arranging flowers in your hand so what you're going to do is take some thin masking tape and just lay it over the top of your base to kind of create a lattice and this is kind of in place of a flower frog or in place of chicken wire which also makes a mix for a good structure once you've got your lattice in place over the top of your vessel you can go ahead and put flowers down in through the lattice and that tape lattice will help keep your flowers in place as you start to arrange them thanks so much for watching our video today we're at Sequoia I'll see you next week for Reader's Digest and certainly if you're ever in Red Hook come by and say hello I'll be around 
hey guys this is grace from design sponge and today I'm going to be talking about how to get the word out which for me means promotion without the ick factor now I think it's important before you get started with promotion to think about why it's so important to promote in the first place the first and most important point for me is that you've worked really hard and when you work really hard on something and you love it and believe in it you should be showing it to people and I think it can be uncomfortable sometimes for people because they think it can be a little gross to be the one who does the talking but if you think about it more than any publicist or PR agency you know the hard work and the love and the motivation that goes into what you do and nothing is going to express that quite in the same way you are so don't be afraid to be the person who actually does the reaching out second your readers and customers have tons of options and if you're not out there waving your hand reminding them about the great things you do then you're going to lose out so being sure that you have promotion as part of your business arsenal is crucial to keeping your customers attention and last but not least but both readers for blogs and customers can be forgetful and they're really quick to move if they feel like things aren't changing quickly whether there aren't new updates on a regular basis so promotion is a great way to remind them that there are things changing and exciting new things happening on a regular basis now what are the some of the main reasons to right people for outreach the first is the most obvious which is announcing something new and this means legitimately new maybe you have a brand new company or a brand new product that has not been written about before that's probably the greatest reason to reach out to somebody but the reason that we're probably all most familiar with is when you're announcing something that's added to an existing company or change to a group that already is around this could be in it if you're a blogger you're adding a new column or that if you want an etsy shop you've announced some new product that's been added but it's something that's not brand brand new it's sort of a second level of new and the last would be requesting participation this is my favorite way to reach out to people for example if you're a blogger and you want to be involved with a readership that maybe is outside of your niche maybe you're a design blog and you want to be a part of the food blog net or the food blogging world maybe your request a food blogger to guest blog and if they're actually involved in your site they're way more likely to actually mention your site I do a post on it but they're way more likely to participate in promoting your blog if they're actually part of it so consider reaching out to people to be a part of what you actually do it's a very sort of cohesive way to get them to be involved in promoting your site that feels comfortable and genuine now the main forms of contacting people are pretty simple the first is a personal email and this is my favorite mode of communication you can write someone blogger at a blogger or you can actually just write a memo of the press this way it's simple it's short and it's sweet and for me it's the easiest way to contact people the next is a newsletter and a newsletter can be free easy and cheap to send it gives your readers a great way to read quickly via email and the last is social networking which is something I think we're all familiar with but can be a really really valuable tool in terms of promoting your business and a casual quick and easy way how often you should write or update people depends on the way you're contacting them for me I think personal email should just be as needed if you update something once a month that's totally fine but if you have a business or a blog that's updated on a regular basis maybe even weekly just be sure that you okay that with the bloggers or press out what you're sending to to make sure that they're all right to receive that many emails from you on a regular basis for a newsletter I prefer to get the monthly because I think it's nice to get everything in a digest for them rather than one email for one tiny update but if you do have a lot of new products added let's say you're a shop and you add a lot of products by other designers on a regular basis just make sure that people reading your newsletter have a very clear off tin and opt-out button and the last is Twitter and Facebook I really strongly feel as something that should be a part of your daily life that might seem like a little too much but if you think about it this should be somewhere where you're making casual common off the cup type of comments and it should be easy for you to do without thinking it shouldn't require planning ahead it shouldn't have to be super carefully crafted it should be a place for you to be casual and comfortable with both your readers and your clients now here are some rule of thumbs for making sure that you are doing your email communication as efficiently as effectively as possible now the first thing to remember is that you have the correct name and spelling and title level of the people you're reaching out to if you're emailing a blogger and make sure you have the right logname that you're not using a form letter and contacting everybody and make sure that if you're contacting somebody at a magazine that if you're choosing to email them that they're not somebody way up at the tippity top of the magazine it's really best to only email people who were sort of at the editor or associate editor level because editors-in-chief really aren't involved in sort of the day-to-day workings of a magazine so always make sure that you're keeping in mind that it's somebody who sort of midway down the masthead of a magazine the next is when you're emailing somebody you want to offer them something different or exclusive that other people aren't going to get that can be an advanced look at something it could be a sort of special angle on the story it can be extra pictures if somebody else didn't get to try to have that little bit of extra angle in there when you're reaching out to somebody via email and if you are reaching out via email and have new things to share make sure that you only stare it in JPEG form PDFs and powerpoints can get easily corrupted via email so always keep things simple with JPEGs and lastly if you have a company email for example mine would be grace at designsponge.com make sure that you use that rather than a gmail address I am the worst person at this and I'm still using my gmail address but so it's hard to let go but if you're sending someone emails in terms of a you know a press reach out it just looks far more professional to use your business name if you have one now if you choose to email or contact people via a newsletter here are some good things to remember the first is a newsletter should be something extra and different compared to what you normally do if you're a blogger and sending out a newsletter that's just a digest of what happens on the site you're less likely to get people to follow in a more excited and a more detailed way so what you want to do is offer them something they're not going to see somewhere else maybe this is a discount or an advanced peek just keep in mind that a newsletter should be something that goes above and beyond what they'd normally get from you now another thing to remember is that you should be offering in your newsletter a non HTML or a plain text option which doesn't have images it's just text because not everybody can get the fancy emails with fancy layouts so be sure that you offer a plain version now when it comes to sending a newsletter there are a lot of options out there so I've chosen three of my favorites the first is MailChimp it's free up to 500 subscribers it's incredibly user-friendly and it integrates really nicely with social tools like here it also goes really nicely with paypal and analytics if you've never used a newsletter service before MailChimp is the great place to start it designs funds we use a service called Aweber which unfortunately doesn't have a free option but it's a really really excellent option if you're concerned about things getting through spam filters because they have a great rate of deliverability and they also have lots of great custom options for forms if that's something you're going to be sending to your customers and readers and last if you want to keep things super simple you can always use feed blitz or feedburner to create an email version of your website or your blog's RSS feed it's just a really simple way to give people another option to keep up to date with what's happening now if you're concerned about social networking there are definitely some guidelines to follow in terms of how to promote the first is to remember this sort of crucial ratio in terms of what you're talking about I think it should always be one-third business one-third personal and one-third resources meaning that a third of your tweets or your facebook updates are related to your business or your blog a third are just small personal musings maybe interesting things that happen during your day or during the week and one third should be resources that are completely outside of your site but it will be valuable to your customers or your readers and define those that just means that you have to be actively participating in the social network world to find great links to share next be sure that you participate and don't get pushy online and this is really crucial when it comes to promotion because let's say for example you see someone on Twitter was a lot of followers talking about a niche that you work in if you work in that niche the last thing you want to do is just constantly talk to them and say I make that two or check this out that's a great way to just pay attention and say oh so once I was talking about lighting today I'm going to go to their website find their email and send them an email I think it's a really really good rule of thumb to stick to email when it comes to promotion it's totally fine to mention someone on Twitter once that you make something in that category but if you keep doing it over and over again you sort of build up a reputation as the person who only uses Twitter to promote their business so just make sure that you participate in conversations and use that as a way to find people who are talking about what you already do the last is don't call out customers readers or clients online you can get a lot of feedback from that may not be feedback that you want and you can burn some bridges so I personally feel that if you have an ax to grind it's really not the best place to do it online unless you feel you have no other choice and that's the only way that you can get to somebody but keep in mind that your readers or your customers may not want to hear it so always think twice before posting something that might be a little bit negative or ranting now I wanted to share a couple outside of the box ideas that could be considered promotion that I think are really nice ways to promote your company without sort of getting traditional or press release about things now for me that's a blog collaboration I love this idea because it's a very comfortable legitimate way to sort of share audiences with people without getting gross let's say for example that you have a business or a blog and a specific niche let's say that that nietzsche's design if you want to break into maybe the parenting market because parents also live in homes you could team up with a parent blog maybe you do posts that you share on everybody sites maybe you do a joint contest it's a really nice way to team up with somebody and have them write about your blog without having to send a formal press release so I hope these tools will help you and good luck with your outreach 
hi guys this is grace from designs fund and today I'm going to talk about going pro with your blog now to go pro the first thing we want to do is build sort of a roadmap to get you towards profitability so I'm going to talk about improving the structure and efficiency of your blog getting the word out about the great content you produce how to establish your voices an expert and then how to break into advertising wisely today's video we'll cover the first three points and then the second video which you can see right below this one will talk about advertising so the first thing we want to do is make sure that your blog and your work structure as is as efficient as possible so you're getting the most out of your time to do that I always suggest creating an excel list that has five columns we're going to use this to map out your daily activities and figure out where you can cut some things out of your schedule and make more time for growing your business the five column should be what the activity is you do during your day how much time it takes whether it's work or personal what it adds to your business and whether or not this activity really requires you to be doing it once you've made this what you want to do is go in and evaluate and delegate out of those activities the first thing to do is to trim the obvious fat if you've got some extra time in there that you use for TV or maybe doing shopping and things like that if you've got that extra sort of you know slightly frivolous thing in your daily schedule that you don't need that's the first place to cut if you don't have any of that the next thing to cut would be any work that doesn't advance your business if you're doing a lot of things that are favors or maybe you're doing some work that is sort of a pro bono that really isn't advancing your blog or your business in a big way that's the time to cut and last but not least you want to look at your list and delegate anything that doesn't require you to be doing it this could be something as simple as bookkeeping or something as complicated as creating content for your blog so the first thing to do is to delegate anything that you could do with the third party I always suggest looking into the freelancers union it's a great place to find other freelancers who do things like financial book keeping taxes things like that delegate to those people especially if you can find them for an affordable rate the next thing to do is to consider bringing on an intern interns are a great place to start they have you can usually find college students who are anxious to learn and there are lots of things that you can offer them in exchange for their time one thing to consider is think about their majors carefully it's always great to go to arts students if you're running a design blog but sometimes if you need help with business work it's better to hire a business or a marketing major they're eager to learn and they can use their case work with you as experienced when they're looking for jobs the next thing to think about is what you offer them a stipend and work-study or an hourly pay situation and work-study is an absolute necessity so look into your budget see what you have left over and figure out what you can offer these students and you can usually figure out what sort of work study plan works out for them by talking to their offices career development or whoever sets up internships for the college now if you look through your expenses and find that you may be only have a couple hundred dollars to give them don't worry about that I always say a lot fifty percent of your expendable business income for help now if you only have a little bit of money remember you can take them for part-time work or you can take them on a very short project basis having that little bit of help will really help you free up time in your schedule to work on bigger business or blog expanding opportunities after you brought on help what you want to do is find a way to make your actual blogging and content creation more efficient so I always say to think about your blog content breaking down into three categories these three categories are what your readers like to see and feel and a site to make it feel like it's varied and rich the first type would be small icandy posts I think of these as something that only take you about 10 minutes to write it could be a simple post it could be maybe a little picture it could be something about your day it could be a product review something that really doesn't take you a lot of time or a lot of in-depth sought to create you should be able to with one of these off a day during the week and get five of them up that's sort of the basic groundwork you're going to need to have a regularly occurring blog the next type of content is a medium-weight post this might take you 30 minutes to do it could be a resource list maybe a little review of a new shop in your town or something you recently saw this is something that takes you a little bit longer to do and you may not do every day but maybe three days a week you can even have a theme and have them coordinate with something that you do on those days of the week the next thing is the heavyweight post these are the ones that are a lot of us familiar with they take a couple hours to do they may feel like they take forever to do but you don't have to do them every day if you do a couple of these or week you're going to prove that you can handle handling you know some some decent topics you can throw yourself into something and give more in-depth reviews or in-depth analysis or just offer more pictures or some sort of editing that shows to readers that you've got something to say and that you can handle saying it was a longer amount of space so if you offer these three types of content to people they're really going to feel like you have a varied blog and a blog with a lot of depth now ambi sound like it takes a lot of work to produce all these different types of posts and produce them every day but if you add up all the time allotted for these posts and how often I'm suggesting them to do all you have to do have is six and a half hours per week to create this sort of full-time blogging schedule now this is something that means maybe you could take one day out of your work schedule if you're allowed to work from home for a day or take a day off from your full-time job you could do all your blogging in one day or if you've got a full-time job and don't have any time for that which is totally understandable you could take three days on or three hours on Saturday and three hours on Sunday and then you've got your full schedule which you can preload ahead of time almost every blogging software will let you preload and schedule one you want it to go up during the week and then you really allow yourself to have spontaneous post during the week when you feel like saying them because you know you've already got the meat and bones of your schedule for the blog already set up and ready to roll out now once you've got your blog's content established you want to set up an editorial calendar when you have sort of set days of the week when things are going to come out you're going to build loyalty with readers they know when things are coming and they know when they can tune in and if you have that calendar set up the next thing to do is to look at all the content you're putting out whether it's a sort of regular column you have or just the type of post that you tend to do and step back and look at them and say do these all really reflect who i am and what i want to say and do they look like the things that I typically post on the site if you have some content that doesn't really seem to fit and the brand or feels a little bit off now's the time to pull it so that you're focusing on producing fewer posts that higher quality posts that feel consistent I know a lot of times people think it's better to have lots of different things going on but you can have variety within a consistent frame people really want to go to your blog and say ah I know what that style is I know what's going to happen here it's not going to be boring to read it it's just going to prove that you have a very consistent and cohesive idea and message to share the next thing to do is get the word out about what you do the first thing we could do that is to send newsletters if you don't have one already make sure you set a newsletter up newsletters and RSS feeds are a crucial part of giving readers another place to find your work not all readers read via a main homepage URL anymore so you need to find a way to attract them outside of that MailChimp and eight aweber are great newsletter services to use they don't cost a lot of money and they're great ways to contact people the next thing to do is to set up a social media outlet whether that's Twitter Facebook or Flickr they may seem complicated but I promise I'll break it down it's not that hard and if you feel like those are just too many to use you can actually use apps on twitter or facebook to connect those particular social media outlets so that you only have to update it one in one place but it will actually show up in the other so if it seems like too much just sign up for one and then connect it to Facebook or connect facebook to twitter you can also do special promotions or try to do something special for readers that you only have on social media outlets you might find that those people who follow you on twitter don't necessarily read your blog every day so take advantage of the fact that you might have different people reading in different places you can do fun contests with them or some sort of read Repole just take advantage of the fact that those might be different groups of people the last thing to keep in mind with social media is the rule of thirds this is something that I sort of made up but find that it's very effective I always think one-third of your social media updates should be personal one third should be blog related meaning tell people what's happening on your site or with your business and the other third should be resource sharing and that means things that you find in your business or your blog but don't necessarily post so share something that has to do with an interesting thing happening your field but is it directly promoting your business it's a really crucial part of social media the next thing to do with direct promotion that means emailing bloggers one-on-one just make sure that you keep your emails personal and targeted always send an email with someone's name and remind them why what you do is relevant to what they do you can also do indirect promotion you can offer your services or guest posts to another blog it helps you put your blog in front of a different audience you can also do targeted giveaways I suggest only doing a few of them maybe a couple of year that really help you connect with the brand or connect with another blog in your niche and helps you give back to your audience and build traffic for a small amount of time the next thing you can do is advertise if you run a really niche specific blog consider advertising on Facebook it really helps you narrow things down based on interest or location you can also consider advertising or I'm sorry not advertising but contributing your voice to a blog you can contribute your voice to a magazine you can even contribute your voice to an e magazine doing things like this offering columns or information or advice and other sources and or other outlets really really helps you build up your voice as an expert within your field people will start to trust

last week I hopped in a car and headed down to Glen Mills Pennsylvania to check out terrain terrain is a new garden and lifestyle shop from the Anthropology brand specializing in garden accessories plants home decor and design and landscaping services in addition to beautiful things for the home and garden terrain is also home to a gorgeous and seriously delicious cafe that is a great place to grab a bite after a long afternoon of shopping today next week the staff at terrain are going to walk us through two fantastic holiday projects to help you bring the outdoors in so let's meet the terrain team hi I'm Melissa Bartley I'm the visual manager at terrain here a terrain the holiday season is about appreciating everyday things so the projects you'll see focus on using things that you find in your own backyard and Steve I'm a visual display artist character in the Stars and today we're going to show you how to make this retreat for your home so your first step in making the wreath is to cut your your birch logs we got our birch logs they're sustainably harvested from blueberry bogs gonna take your birch logs and you're going to cut them into 9 and 7/8 inch segments after you've cut all your Burchell your French segments into ninety seven eight inch pieces you're gonna take each log and cut on either end at a 15 degree angle next step you're going to get a friend and help you hold all your segments in place they tend to roll around a little bit and you're gonna get your drill and just do a quick pilot hole and down okay Internet step we're gonna take your screw and where you pilot hole I'm gonna go around and drive letting same thing on the underside then you're going to do that all the way around the wreath until you've got your there you've got your first segment okay so then you're going to do the same thing all the way around for about 12 segments until you've got your complete read if you want to check it maybe a little Wiggly in some joints and always just add another screw in the center where you feel hi I'm Melissa Kistler boy and today I'm just going to show you how to soften the wreaths and decorated to do either indoor or outdoor so for the indoor version of the wreath step one would be to build some kind of small armature out of chicken wire or you can just take your NOS directly glue it onto the wreath and just kind of form pockets to set your paper white bulbs in once you have your pocket sponge you can fill it's a little bit of rocks and dirt and then set your bowls in and then also decorate it with some ornamentation like we have here to maintain your paper whites and to make sure it looks beautiful for as long as possible it's good to just make sure that the soil or the rocks that you planted and are nice and moist or you could force revolts ahead of time in another container like we do and then transfer them into the pockets that you've created once you've made your reach go the outdoor version we thought it'd be nice that would be able to stand the weather so we started by taking one of your segments of the wreath before you put the whole thing together it's easier to do this and you're going to use this paddle bit it just works really well and just drill a few holes into the wood so you can create a channel once you have the channel you can actually just go ahead to keep the succulents nice for as long as possible you could actually just use a spouted water in the hand and get down to the soil make sure it's nice and moist and you can also sit stay tuned because next Wednesday the terrain stock will show us how to make this beautiful twig armature to dress up your holiday flowers and vapors a big thanks to Steve Kat Lacey and both of Turin's lovely melissa's for all of their help of this video you can visit terrain at shop terrain comm or in person at 914 Baltimore Pike Glen Mills Pennsylvania 
hi guys this is Grace home design sponge and in this video I'm going to be talking about how i turn design sponge from a part time hobby into a full-time business design splinters actually the result of a conversation I have with my husband Aaron over brunch I was about a year out of college and I think like most people I had dreams in hopes of what I could do one day but had absolutely no idea how to get there I didn't have any real experience but despite that I knew I really wanted to work for a design magazine so Aaron suggested that I start the blog as a way to sort of warm up my voice and maybe one day hopefully submitted as a portfolio to a magazine so I went home I set up a free account at blogger com and I wrote my first post I chose the name design sponge because I thought it sort of rubber that represented the way that I soak up information really passionately and really quickly so like most people running a passion based project I had a full-time job at the same time I was working nights I'd work on the weekends I would try to steal a little minutes or hours anywhere that I could my lunch break and I was just so excited to be working that I didn't mind sort of using all of my free time to work on this little fun side project and I think the key for the site's initial success and maybe a part of it now still is that I never really had a huge plan for where the site would go or what it would be I was hoping that maybe one day I could use it to submit for a job at a magazine but other than that I really didn't think of anything else I wasn't thinking about advertising or having a certain amount of readers or anything like that I just really loved what I was doing and I think that that was really important I think if I had gone in with any big plans and expectations maybe it would have been quite so fun but for me all I needed was to have that as an outlet to talk about the things that I cared about and that was enough to keep me going so there was a turning point early on with the blog started to be a little bit more than just a personal hobby blog and for me my first big break was actually story in The New York Times about design blogs and ironically it was actually not very good mention because I was working in PR the time the article assumed that I was getting paid to write about the things that I write about on design sponge clearly that's not true but it ended up meeting that my first big break was actually more of a big bump but the nice thing about that was that I went from having probably a few hundred readers a day having about ten thousand readers a day which admittedly is a pretty crazy week but at the time there was no Domino magazine there weren't you know dozens and dozens and dozens of design blogs out there and I think design sponge was in the right place at the right time with the right look I think that there were a lot of readers that weren't find me the content that they wanted online or in magazines or on TV and I think designs fun should have represented that to them at that time so later that year in 2005 I was actually able to leave my day job and it wasn't really quite as romantic as it sounds you know running away from a full-time job to just be a blogger all day I was actually able to leave because of two key factors the first is that I started to build up a little bit of a name for myself on online and I think some editors at Conde Nast took notice and that was why I got a call that year to join them to work on House &amp; Garden magazine and create sort of a bigger web presence for them and sort of make it a little bit younger and hipper and honestly that was my dream job that was what I've been hoping to get was to one day work with the magazine and work with the magazine that had such a history behind it was probably still one of the best times in my life I will never forget that job and that to me was probably the one most exciting thing that ever happened to me and at the same time the advertising request for design stones were actually starting to build up they weren't by any means paying my rent or anything like that and I frankly had no idea but I was doing with the ad program but it was generating a little bit of a side income I could pay for my groceries I could talk a little bit of money away in my savings just enough to think that maybe I could pull this off as long as I had another freelance job so in 2007 basically I'm sorry 2005 to 2007 it was one giant juggling act for me for the first two years I basically balanced working on designs fund as the sole writer and the runner of the advertising program I was consulting and creating weekly content for house and garden and going in for weekend for meetings on weekly basis I was also writing a column for the Philadelphia Inquirer which seems a little weird because I live in Brooklyn but I had a blast I took it as a great opportunity to work for a newspaper and see how that type of publishing worked I wasn't making a lot of money but I was certainly learning a lot and lastly and I think this is really important to sort of how quickly the site bill was that I didn't send out any freelancing job that came across my desk for basically two full years which meant I was constantly writing something for someone else I wasn't making a lot of money that I decided that this was going to be my chance to learn as much as humanly possible and make up for the time and lack of experience I had in this area so I wrote articles about baby products i wrote about pet design i wrote about food design and cake stands and anything that i could could get my hands on to learn and work on i said yes to and for me that just meant two years of not sleeping and working on everything that I possibly could and then in 2007 the bottom dropped out and for me that missed that house and garden closed I really never saw that coming and that job meant so much to me and represented so many things from experience to financial stability that it was a pretty big blow when the magazine closed the first thing I did was decided that maybe I can't go full time maybe I should just try to find some backup job so I have some sort of stability and comfort so I ended a pre Lansing for Domino crafts magazines where I wrote some monthly web and print columns and that was amazing and i certainly loved those magazines but it wasn't quite the same as house in garden and it didn't really represent the same level of its stability so i decided that it was time to focus on the advertising program is not just a grocery money generator but a real business and something that might be able to actually support me more than i thought it could and the way I did this was sigh bringing in some help now I'll admit I was really lucky and that Aaron actually works in digital media he had a full-time job with a digital media agency so he was able to come on in a freelance capacity and help from the ad program keeping him and he still had a full-time job but he was really awesome and decided to help me with that and it really helped improve the income and the professionalism Athiya program after that I decided it was time to really get my ducks in a row if I was going to take myself seriously I was going to talk to a financial advisor and an accountant and sometimes that can be a little scary but what happened for me was I felt really empowered I got control of where I was I knew exactly where i stood financially and the nice thing about was him but I actually figured out I had a little bit of disposable income so i decided that i could either save that money and keep on freelancing and trying to juggle everything at the same time or i can use that money to invest in myself and take a leap and so this was when I decided to invest in a redesign of the site the reason I did this was I decided what could I do to make design sponge stand out from the pack and for me that meant I was going to have to create a site that looked and felt different from what it did right now and from what everyone else in the industry looked like and this was a really scary decision for me mainly because I had never taken that much money and spent it on anything in my life and give it to somebody else and trust them to make the site look and feel the way I wanted to and I decided if I was going to make a go for this I had to make this decision and I still don't regret it to this day because this was the moment where I decided I'm going to invest in myself I'm going to invest in my future and the future success of my business and this was really the real 20 turning point with design sponge for me because it really helped me take the site seriously look at it at the business and look at it as my future so over the next couple of years I decided to invest in the site and change the focus from a personal blog to more of an online magazine that produce high-quality magazine level content and part of that change for me involved setting aside a little bit of money so I could bring on writers who were paid on a per post faces to cover specific content areas and this was really the beginning of building the design sponge editorial team and looking back over the last six years which I still cannot believe it's been six years it's the site is gone from being a one-woman show done on my lunch break to I'm now managing a team of 20 people and those 20 people don't all sit in an office all day with me it's pretty much just me air but it fits really fantastic if I look back and sit back I don't I don't think I actually really do this this at all this often but this video recording is actually giving me a chance to think about it I'm really proud of what the site is to come it really was just one person in the beginning and now I'm overseeing a team weekly talented people and we're all sort of united in the goal of bringing the best possible content to the web that we can and recently Aaron and I actually made the biggest leap ever to try and support ourselves both of us with design sponge he left his job and now he's running the advertising programs full-time and it's pretty much still gonna dream so far it's been really exciting and I think this is a point that a lot of people are trying to get to where you're able to leave your job and support yourself with something that you love for us that meant that we've given up the sort of stable comfortable income and health insurance and all those things that you've gotten used to in order to try to finally live the type of life that we've been wanting to live and it's a little bit scary but I think this is another great point in our lives and in this sort of span and design sponge where we're going to reinvest ourselves in the business really intensely for my part I'm going to try to make the site grow editorially and expand and be the best possible version of design sponge that we can be and Aaron is going to try to work with the advertising side to expand the things that we offer to really improve the quality of service that we give our clients and to try to really give this a go at making this business work and support our family I hope you've enjoyed this video and in the next video I'm going to be sharing how you can take these tips and apply them to going full time with your own business or blog

you it all started with a bed after six years of good and loyal service my pipe bed flew literally three days later I met Brian Anya my favorite part of working with local designers is getting snow mountain but what I didn't expect is for Brian yet you take these scraps and then you cross them make you collage you make collages out of wood I would say yeah I mean the collage part is you know it's a surface thing so it's really hard to actually structurally make something out of the collage so I have to usually make kind of a skeleton first but yeah I use you know I try to make use of these small pieces of wood that otherwise you know with I'm using this like rough cut piece of wood that's gotta fill my square shape so that's sort of like the specialty by colors like and I knew the chairs sometimes we and we do big projects like when we do the chocolate challenge we're making bigger spaces we do everything together we started with the charity when we did that stuff together so when we began it was kind of like we bounced off of each other and then we were inspired by what the other one was doing and then we realized that we had you know skills that kind of balance each other out to a nice piece of solid weathered oak it's really thick but it's got really good texture a really good color some dust on mostly all comes from building green which is just a recycling this night would look or whatever happened because I we wanted to put stuff on our walls and I found like that looks good and I was like this that piece of art I mean it could be like a half an inch higher but I ready in after getting to know where I am Nadia I realized that Nadia has a sixth sense when it comes to color and fabric this bed want something sleek er yeah and it was layers you know so if you can layer with different things thank you getting dressed I think you're getting guests okay so they're made on antique looms way up in Maine and this is I think this one is herringbone it's 100% cotton it's super warm actually and this was this was your idea 100% your idea to do this like went way girly totally I'm expected by I love this so I think it does you had these branches where did you get those and I love how it's did you Fran or it just phrase when you cut it okay oh it's kind of nice because you didn't I think what works is like it's not perfect you know I love it it is romantic like a little romantic woodland [Music] my father just needed a bed but I ended up with so much more tears love the Arnage all night refuses things I didn't know I want love everyone [Music] you 
hi guys i'm grayson design sponge and i'm coming to you from my bedroom in brooklyn new york it's Sunday evening it's the first day after I've been to icff which is the international contemporary furniture fair it's a huge exciting design fair that happens in new york city every year and usually I come home with my head bursting with ideas and buzzing with all sorts of new techniques and ideas and materials I've never seen before and I get really excited and this year I came home and I was just crazy disappointed I felt like I didn't see anything that made me excited or hopeful or I don't know curious and I think that what I love most about design shows is coming home wondering how people did things and if that's gonna inspire me to do something in my own house and I don't think there was even a tiny bit of that after coming home from the show and it might sound a little harsh but I think that I'm feeling me saying than feeling to need to talk about them because I know that the American design community is so much stronger than this and I have never been prouder to be a part of this community and I know that there are really amazing people doing great things out there but I didn't see a lot of them with the show this year and I wanted to talk about that and whether or not that had to do more with the show format or the state of the design community and I wanted to get your feedback on that so before I dive into that I wanted to break down really quickly with the biggest issues for me were with icff the first one was the safety I feel like people really played to retail this year and decided to just do sort of status quo work there was a lot of live edge tables with really colorful metal basis which are pretty I mean I like walnut plus a colorful wooden or colorful metal base as much as everybody else but it looks like everything else and after seeing you 420 boobs in a row I just don't want to see any more of it and it doesn't feel interesting and it doesn't feel innovative and I know it's what sells right now and I don't want to begrudge any designer a successful company and you know the income that they need to keep doing what they do but for me I see if F is about really pushing yourself further and not only showing the things that are safe but showing things that are experiments and that maybe you're still prototypes and things that are you know showing that you're taking risks and doing things that are a little bit edgy and that wasn't there this year so that sort of level of safety and lack of really pushing people it wasn't there and it was really disappointing the second thing I saw a lot of being people copying people who were 30 three rows over from them and people copying people who were big hits at last year's show and there's just no place for that in a huge professional design show and it was really disappointing to see so much of that so all over the place the other thing that I was really surprised by was the buzz and excitement around reissued eames era furniture and i love the Eames as much as the next girl but I don't want that to be the biggest buzz that comes out of a contemporary furniture show it doesn't make any sense to me I love the Eames but I really want to come home talking about something that a 25-year old designer did that's exciting and innovative and new and cool and that's not something that was issued in the 50s it doesn't it doesn't work for me the other thing I was really disappointed in was to see people using digital printing as sort of a cop-out and I think the digital printing is awesome whether it's in fabric or wallpaper or people printing and etching directly into plastic or wood and that's a technique that's fantastic but it's a technique that needs to be used with purpose and I saw a lot of people using it I think for the sake of using it and that's no fun I think design should be about purpose and you should create something because something inside you as an artist tells you that that's the way it should be it shouldn't be about just using a certain technique because that's what everybody else is doing so I saw a lot of that and when you put all that together and you know put that on top of the fact of this show was usually really exciting it was kind of a letdown and i came home and i got on twitter and was talking about some of my reaction to the show and i started to get a lot of responses that made a lot of sense most of which were about people who were doing this innovative work not being able to afford to be it shows like icff and it made me wonder is that entire fair format obsolete does the design fair community need to change to reflect the current state of the independent community and I think that there is a way for big huge design houses with tons of money to coexist with independent people but it's not going to happen at a show where it costs you know thousands and thousands of dollars to have a booth and i'm not sure what the solution to that is I don't know if the solution is to have more small design fairs a part of me started to think maybe design fairs should have a digital component and maybe they should be in there should be an earlier version of the show that happens or people can upload videos about their process and their work and photographs and then maybe it's a juried competition and people choose from this online version of the fair and maybe 10 people from that get free booths at a big show I just think that there's got to be a way to celebrate the people who are really not afraid to push the limits and give them a platform as big as icff so I'd love to know what you guys think about this did you like I see it back this year were you disappointed in it did you go do you care do you think that these design shows are totally out of the loop it doesn't matter anymore and it's all happening online and it's all happening in indy shows I really want to know where you guys think innovative design is happening and how we can give innovative design a bigger platform to make their businesses happen because innovation and cutting-edge all that sort of exciting things that that are happening with designers they need a platform to and they deserve a large design show where you know furniture buyers and interior designers and the people that have the money they can sort of keep their businesses afloat can come see them and can come support them so I'd love to hear what you guys have to say about it I love to hear if you were disappointed and if not tell me what you thought was awesome I thought the Designboom art was amazing this year it's always full of fun really out there ideas i bought these little ginkgo leaf notebook pad paper it's like a post-it note except in the shade of a ginkgo I know it's totally silly but I thought it was really fun and that's what was missing from the show this year I wanted to be able to laugh and to smile and to wonder about something and figure out how it was put together and touch things and everything was really big and boring and blah this year and that's just not what I think of American design i know that it's so much better than that so i'd love to hear your thoughts please feel free to share them i love to have video responses if you guys are up for it if not please feel free to leave a comment in the comment section i would love to hear what you guys thought of the show and hear your ideas about maybe the future of design fairs and the future of design shows in general because i know that you guys are in touch with this community and you care about it just as much as i do so i would love to hear your thoughts and thanks for listening and i'll see you around at the shows 
hi guys this is grace from design sponge and in this video I'm going to show you how I advise people to start planning the transition from part-time side business to full-time job and I'll talk a little bit about making sure that you're armed with the information you need before making the big jump the first thing is to remember that going full time is a gradual process and should never be something that you leap into blindly I hear from a lot of people who say I just quit my job and I'm going to blog full-time now and it always really scares me because I think sometimes planning and making that decision gradually rather than engine just jumping in is a much better decision and the reason for that is when you make that that move too quickly you put so much stress on yourself and on your business and it often leads to really rush decisions and overly flexible ethics you're going to find yourself saying yes to things and do making decisions with your business just because you need to pay the bills and that's not where you want to be you want to be in a place where you can make decisions because it's what you believe in and what's right for your business and one thing to keep in mind is that there's a big trade-off when you go full time you're probably for the most part in the beginning I'm going to give up a lot of the comfort and the money and the stability that you're used to there's no regular monthly paycheck no one's paying insurance anymore all those sorts of things disappear but you get a really amazing trade-off for that and that is a really improved quality of life and the freedom to set your own schedule and to work on your own terms and your own time and I think a lot of people are scared of this move because they think maybe I'm not the most skill to the most experienced person in my niche but honestly at the end of the day you could be the most talented person in your field and if you don't have the passion of the motivation to make your business work and be a success it's never going to happen and that's because at the end of the day you might have to work till two and the three and two or three in the morning for weeks in a row just to make something happen and pull everything together and talent alone doesn't help you do that you have to want this more than anything in the world and after reading through some of your responses and reading your questions it sounds like so many of you have that drive and that's going to be a key factor for making your business work now the main key factor for making your business work is knowledge and I think it's important that people shouldn't be afraid to look at numbers and get real about your business I think artists especially have a hard time for this because it's not quite as romantic as the idea of just quitting and doing art all day which is wonderful and you can get to that point but in order to get there you really need to look before you leave and for me this means meeting with the business advisor meeting with a lawyer and accountant and anyone else who could help answer your questions whether that's an advisor is someone else you work with separately because all of the issues and the concerns that you have need to be dealt with before you make that leak and the reason for that is it really prevents you from wasting time and energy on all of that worrying I spent so much time the first year or two a design sponge really freaking out about whether or not I could make it work whether or not I could pay my bills knowing where I stood within the industry and what I should do with my taxes and how I should you know claim the business the more time that you spend getting all that information done at all those ducks in a row before you start you're going to have so much more energy and brainpower left over to focus on the important decisions that you have to make for your business and the great thing about trying to find this information these days is it so much of it exists for free on the internet already you can find information about health insurance and business advice contract advice manufacturing all sorts of information exists for free online the etsy com forums are amazing for manufacturing information eyebrows they're randomly just to try to help people who have friends with find information about where they should be printing things for wallpaper where they can find you know producers of melamine plates for their collections that sort of information exists online as well as some things and companies to avoid working with which I find is really helpful and then there are tons of blogs both design and not design based they give away free business advice so it's one of your early tasks if you're going to try to leave your regular full-time job to pursue your own business to get online and research and take advantage of all the free advice that's out there so in my next video I will be sharing my tips for staying focused while you're processing all this online information and trying to run your own successful business I'll also be providing more details on the design sponge consulting services which are set to launch soon thanks for listening and I'll talk to you soon 
one of the best things about running design sponge is that we get a chance to showcase some of our favorite offices and businesses but rarely our own so today we want to welcome you to our new home makeshift Society Brooklyn open last month by Reena Tom and Brian Boyer make-shift as a co-working space where creative people work together share resources take classes and collaborate we're so excited to collaborate with other makeshift members so we thought we'd start by sharing some of our favorite work productivity tips that helped us get through the day tip 1 is to set a schedule nothing helps us get through work quickly like setting aside blocks of time each day to focus on a certain task like email or admin work grouping like tasks together helps work go more quickly 2 tip 2 is to build a support system whether you're in a co-working space like we are or create a morning meetup group with other people in your town having someone you can talk to to run ideas by get advice from and brainstorm with is crucial our third tip is to limit distractions some people work well with music and TV but others don't if you find yourself spending more time checking email and singing along to songs than getting your work done cut out the things that are standing in the way everyone has their own tips for staying on top of work so we'd love to hear yours share your tips below and we're one step closer to creating an online community that like makeshift supports each other and helps us all find ways to work smarter and do what we love 
Louise feely has been a design icon of mine since I first started studying women in design in college we were thrilled to run a sneak peek of her studio last year and I was overjoyed to meet her in person yesterday when I stopped by the studio to interview her for our font series her expertise in lettering and logo design especially within the food and restaurant industry is unparalleled and it was an honor just to sit and talk with her I hope you'll enjoy her thoughts on type and her advice for aspiring designers so let's meet Louise my name is Louise Julianne designer and I specialize in graphic design for food specifically restaurant identities and food packaging when I was 16 years old I made my first trip to Italy my parents were both Italian immigrants it was our first their first birthday and my first trip there and for me it was it was sort of double revelation I discovered my love of Italy and at the same time my love of her type and food so I guess was trivial and and that kind of set me on a course for everything I've done here in the studio I have to say that Italy's my main source of inspiration psychographic and gastronomic and it's old for me it's all one thing because I could because all of my work is involved in food and because I'm so interested in type when I started my studio I specifically decided to focus on those those things when I first hear bird flying I'll sit down with them and I'll ask them a lot of questions the first question always is who are the key decision-makers in this process so I find it's very very important to meet with those people who are going to be designing on logo or whatever I'm working on has to be at that meeting I have a long discussion about what their needs are what they like and don't like and and then I will start by just doing research looking around that for competition things like that and then I start sketching and that for me that's the key point is just sitting down and whether it's a logo or whatever and this is something that I brought with me from when book jackets I would to sit down and just take the title of the book or in this case in the name of the company rendering a logo and I just sort of write the words over and over and over again and to sort of let them speak to me and turn into something and so that a sketching stage is it's very very important because that's when the type starts to form usually after doing all these sketches it turns into if it does something that's mortifying this as a thought but usually is one that doesn't exist and then I have to figure out how to create that client and the hardest thing is just I think trying to do something I've never done before because I really hate to repeat myself and another French restaurant but that's also what I love about what I do is that same thing over again always trying to find a new way to do I think that my favorite projects which is an Italian restaurant in Seattle it's owned by a very dear friend of mine which I think it's part of the piece of mutton is a favorite isn't it's hard to work with your friends but we were both equally happy with this logo which is great and it's a very lively restaurant there is some very good but in addition to that they're known for the fact that they have cabaret acts and their truck keys in the restaurant and they have a fortune teller to look at your table and read through our part so it's it's great and I wanted the logo to reflect back to the show that is a serious restaurant and yet there's another favorite is the mermaid in that because it's violent when the owners came to be in describe but they said we want we wanted a restaurant that feels like a seafood shop so I need to come up again again something that shows that it is it's not a funky restaurant but it's actually very well it's two things one is of obviously it's just to look at historical things look at old tech books there's so many wonderful old typefaces that are no longer available if I were going to do a fun type of just can't use the other is you have to think that is a funny thing I think of somebody being able to use all the letters together in various combinations so you don't just make sure that they all fit together you can view more of Louise's remarkable collection of work at Louise feely calm thank you so much to Louise for taking the time to meet with me and for being a constant source of inspiration 
hi guys in this video I'm going to be talking about staying focused I think this is something that everyone even the most successful businesses still struggle with so i thought i would share the failsafe system i created to make sure that I stay productive with what I do the first is probably what I think is the most crucial step and staying focused with your business and that is creating a support circle of people who understand what you're doing what you're going through for me this just means that I actually beat once a week with some friends who were sort of in the same boat that I am and we had coffee we talked we sort of commiserate about tough points in our life or in our jobs and we helped hold each other accountable for the goals that we have and it doesn't need to be a formal relationship but just someone that you can sort of support and also be supported by and that you can share ideas and hopes with and they make sure that you stay on task if you tell them something that you want to do they're going to ask you about it and that gentle reminder is something that will really help you move forward with your business also I love to take advantage of free online software to keep yourself on schedule I will do just about anything Google throws at me I'm a huge fan of google calendar reminders it's basically all I use for design sponge to stay on task but you can also use some great sites like backpack to-do list or remember the milk which are free online systems where you can write in your to do list and it'll send you text reminders or email reminders anything you want to keep your business and your regular daily tasks on time now I find that one of the tough things of running your own businesses you're often faced with really huge projects that you have to do and sometimes they can seem so daunting you don't even want to start them so for me I find the best way to get through things like that is to break them into small actionable items that you can actually do for me I like to do this by using a silly little widget I download onto my desktop called the Pomodoro Technique you can find it online and it's just a little widget that goes onto your desktop and it looks like a little tomato kitchen timer and it keeps you working in 10 to 20 minutes segment and then forces you to take a break it actually will gray out your computer screens that you can't do anything and I find that working in small concentrated chunks like that helps me get so much more work done and my brain actually gets a rest a little tiny rest in between those sessions that keeps me focused and efficient I also think it's really important as is so many of us are visual people to keep visual reminders in your house or in your office that act is sort of an ever-present reminder of the things you need to get done I actually work in a home office which is also known as my living room and I keep a chalkboard in my living room where I buy down the big projects that I need to get done these are things that aren't going to happen necessarily on a daily basis or even on a weekly basis but are things that I like to just have to look at every day to remind me oh yeah I did want to work on this second idea I didn't want to bring on a new writer to talk about this topic I think sometimes having visual reminders it's just a really good way to sort of constantly poke yourself with a reminder that you need to get something done now here are some of my favorite tips for bloggers and business owners for staying focused the first is I think it's incredibly easy to get overwhelmed with blog or internet research no matter what you're using that for so it's really important to use either an RSS or some sort of blog reader to make sure that your internet research is concise doesn't matter what form you choose to get in whether it's a feedblitz email you get every day or just a google reader that you use make sure that you make that internet research is easy to do to digest as possible the second is I really advise using a clearly defined daily schedule for example I to email every morning from seven to nine without fail and I don't do anything else during those hours I also do the same thing at the end of the day whether it's two hours from eight to ten or from ten to two in the morning whatever time of day I finally finishing my day I ended by plowing through a few emails for me it really gives my day a sense of beginning and ending and helps me relax and have some sort of stability and this will be one of the hard things when you leave a job to go full time it said there's no one to define a schedule for you anymore and setting up these chunks of the day we do the same thing will really help you easy to the rhythm of working on your own and help you ease into working every day now this third tip is probably the hardest for most people who run their own businesses and I'll admit it's still the hardest thing for me to do which is delegating but if you can identify things that are easily repeated that don't need you to do them and give them to someone else to do it's really going to help you free at Britain's space to work on the things that you need to work on because if you're trying to micromanage every aspect of your business you're really just not using your brain power efficiently and I still struggle with this but it's really important to remember to delegate as much as possible and the last is something I mentioned with the Pomodoro Technique but i think is important to bring up again and that is taking small medium and large breaks every day i think a lot of small business owners and i know i do this sometimes you'll start work in the morning and the next thing you know you look up an extender time and all you've done is sit in front of a laptop and work all day and that is just killer on your brain you've got to give yourself a break whether it's you get up and you do some stretches you walk around the block you take the dog for a walk little things like that really allow your brain to rest and recharge and when you're working on your own it's really important to be efficient and I find that breaks really help you be efficient next I think this is tough because it sort of requires people to give real with yourself a little bit but i'll start by sharing my own sticking points and you can really have to identify what your weaknesses are and for me that's finding the motivation to get through large chunks of work that can be a little bit repetitive whether that's answering 400 submission emails i would let pile up over a day or two or going to do a huge chunk of research like if i'm building a product guide those works of ours are really tough for me because i find them a little repetitive and sometimes I end up saying the same thing you're looking at the same thing multiple times so I find in order to get through that the points that are my weaknesses I need to reward myself with something and I know that sounds a little silly and maybe even a little simple to actually reward yourself for doing something you don't like or that might be boring but I find it's really actually all I need to get through that task for me that mean my me I get to watch a movie while I do something or maybe once i finish i get to go get ice cream down the street it's so simple but those rewards actually helped me get through the chunks of the day that I hate now that more will be different for everybody listening right now but figure out little things that you can give yourself that don't cost a lot of money but do give you some sort of comfort and join it and reward yourself for getting through tough chunks of work with that and the second is something I think we all understand that feeling when you wake up in the morning and you just don't want to work on a certain project or you just don't want to start work in the morning I found that over the last six years of pretty much working myself that don't fight that feeling that feeling almost always wins and it's like slamming your head into a wall over and over again if there's something else productive you can be doing go do that instead if there's a project that you just don't want to tackle right in the morning go stuff envelopes and do something else go do billing deal with your paperwork something else that you can do a little bit mindlessly to sort of help you be productive but ease your bring into working on those projects because a lot of times if you just run up against that wall of not wanting to do something the quality of work you're going to produce what you actually do work is not very good so it's really better to wait until your brain is warmed up and actually ready to tackle that project to move forward with it and the last one is something that I feel really strongly about which is hinging due dates on other people's work to ensure delivery and quality and I'll share a little bit of a personal story with this one this is something I'm struggling with right now I've always hinged by due dates for either posts or content on the site or larger projects on my other editors and I don't want to let those people down so what's there waiting for me to turn something in or to give them feedback on something it's going to make sure that I get it done on time and I do it as well as I can because I don't want to let them down now this is tough to stick to and I recently had a problem where I owe my editor something and I have a really tough week and they're all waiting on me in the next thing note we're all behind because I haven't been able to stay on time with things and it can be a little embarrassing but it's also another reminder that maybe something isn't working as efficiently as possible and maybe I need to go back and delegate more so that I'm better able to stay on task and stay on time the things that I oh people so when you hand your due dates on other people it's really going to help you improve the quality of your work get it done on time or it's going to help you figure out maybe where you need to delegate some more thanks so much for listening and I'll see you guys soon for the final video 
you it all started with a bed after six years of good and loyal service my pipe bedroom literally three days later and that Brian idea my favorite part of working with local designers is getting to know them but what I didn't attract it's Hawaiian on yet but I just needed bet it turns out i had a real problem it was basically you take these scraps yeah and then you collage them make you collage you make collages out of what I would say yeah i mean the collage part is you know it's a surface thing so it's really hard to actually structurally make something out of the collage so i have to usually make kind of a skeleton of stuff first but yeah i used I try to make use of these small pieces of wood that otherwise you know way to do it i'm using this I rough cut piece of wood is bad fill a square shape to it so that's sort of like a specialty by colors like awesome yeah i think is a really nice job order right the wood stuff and I knew tears in the fabric work together on pieces and we do big projects like when we did the chocolate shower when we do bigger spaces we do everything together mostly we started with the chairs even when we did that stuff together so when we began it was kind of like we bounced off of each other and then we were inspired by what the other one was doing and then we realized that we had you know skills that kind of balance each other out to this is like a nice piece of solid weathered oak it's really thick but it's got really good texture a really good color some dust on mostly all comes from build a green which is just a recycling out of warehouse this night would look or whatever I we wanted to put stuff on our walls and we took on their walls and I found like just pieces of wood that I thought looked good I was like this like that piece of ours I mean it could be like a half an inch higher but I ready after getting to know where i add nadia i realized that Nadia has a sixth sense when it comes to color and fabric I said want something sweeter yeah and it was players yeah so if you can layer with simple things okay thank you getting dressed like you're getting yes okay so they're made on antique glooms way up in Maine and this is I think this one is herringbone it's a hundred percent cotton it's super warm actually and this was this was your idea of one hundred percent your idea to do this like went way girlie I know I thought this is like totally unexpected but I love this so I think it goes you had these branches where did you get those um I'm in our stash I think we had returned your lesson from billet green and I love how it did you fry it or just phrase when you cut it ok oh it's kind of nice because you didn't I think what works is like it's not perfect you know I love it it is romantic look like a little romantic woodland you I thought it is needed a bad but i ended up with so much more shares to rub too hard all night look solutions things I didn't know I want love everyone you 
yesterday I happened the subway to greenpoint brooklyn and got to visit with sarah make it a fantastic Baker who specializes in delicious organic treats despite the rainy weather and having her own little chef to keep an eye on sarah was kind enough to share a wonderful recipe with us for in the kitchen with fridays i hope you'll enjoy her cupcakes as much as i did on the ride home hotel ago hi I'm Sarah magid author of organic and chic and organic baking book I specialize in organic custom cakes and today we're going to make dark chocolate cupcake that's vegan friendly with an espresso with buttercream and hand sculpted flowers on top so let's get started it'll be me no no so to start making the cupcake we want to get all our dry ingredients together first we have unsweetened cocoa powder flour baking soda with salt and organic cane sugar and we're going to sift and mix that all together and then in a separate Bowl we're going to mix our wet ingredients which is organic canola oil water vanilla and organic white distilled vinegar and we're going to mix the wet into the dry so the first step is mixing all the dry ingredients together in one bowl so one quick tip that I like to do instead of sifting each ingredient separately is I actually place a wire sifter over a large bowl and once I've sort of incorporated the dry ingredients together I just pour it in into the sifter and I like to use a whisk for this and then I just sift it through and that way to save yourself time and helps mixes and evenly so the next step is mixing our wet ingredients together we have two-thirds cup of an organic canola oil two cups of cold water with two teaspoons of organic white distilled vinegar and then a tablespoon of vanilla extract and I actually keep vanilla beans that I've used in a bell jar and I pour my vanilla extract in it so it fuses the vanilla to get extra vanilla so the final step is we're going to pour the wet ingredients into the dry I use a whisk to incorporate all the ingredients together so one easy way that I found to put batter into cupcakes is to use a soup ladle and I pretty much use it so that it doesn't spill on the rest of the cake cupcake pan and then into the preheated oven which is set at 350 degrees so now we're going to make the organic espresso whipped butter cream and I start off with a cup of organic whole milk with a quarter cup of organic all-purpose flour and basically what you do is you whisk it on the stove until it starts to get thick on a medium heat around five minutes and then you let it cool and you can rush the step by putting it in the freezer if you want so what I'm going to do is in my lovely kitchen aid I have two sticks of unsalted organic butter slowly pouring my one cup you want to make sure that you scrape the sides down because sometimes butters will get stuck so basically you want to get your butter and sugar mix so it's very fluffy and a lighter color and then we're going to add the milk and flour which is a very thickened as you can see and this is really ms one's going to hold up the frosting and make it very thick and luscious but we're not using a lot of sugar or a lot of butter to get that result so this is the texture we're looking for sort of thick and creamy butter creamish and we're going to add a little bit of espresso and if you have pregnant people coming or people who don't drink caffeine you can use decaffeinated it's about one-and-a-half teaspoons and here we are this is what it should look like this press so whipped butter cream so we're going to make a gumpaste hand-sculpted flowers this is gum paste and it's basically an edible play dough and you can make it yourself or buy it pre-made and it's pretty tough at first and you have to need it to get it soft I've used some food coloring and I have kneaded the dough to get this really pale fuchsia color so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start to make my flowers I'm going to sprinkle a little organic corn starch on my work surface place the gum paste and I have a couple special tools here which are technically made for the cake industry this is a plastic ruler it's small and non-porous and then this is also a sculpting tool that has a large ball and a small ball but if you don't have this special type of roller you can just use a wooden or other type of rolling pin it'll work just as fine and what you want to do is sort of channel your inner play-doh experience and roll it pretty thin and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to use flour cutters now I think that you can use cookie cutters any kind of cutters these are made for gum paste because they're very small but when I make my cakes I sometimes will use things that I also use for Christmas cookies so you shouldn't feel like you have to go to a special shop for anything and what I'm going to do is just cut out flowers and place them on this foam pad so there's two ways to create volume with the petals one way is to use this tool which is a special cake industry tool and the way that you would use this is you push into each petal sort of in a rolling motion towards the end starting from the center and that really creates a volume for each petal or if you don't want to use this tool you can use your fabulous fingers and pinch each petal just to get rid of the edge of the cookie cutter and it still has a very nice hand feel to it and after you've done this to all your flowers this is my favorite eco tool but I save a lot of my egg cartons from market the shape inside is perfect for the flowers to dry in a way that will end up giving us this sort of open in bloom texture so now we are down to the decorating part our cupcakes have cooled we've fitted our pastry bag with the frosting and now we're going to apply it in a sort of swirled motion what you want to do is make sure that you apply pressure from the top and use your other hand to guide and you're just going to want to go in a circular motion and just give it a very luscious delicious look it'll be me so I hope you try to make these very easy chocolate cupcakes with frosting and next time that you're baking for a birthday party or from any celebration keep this recipe in mind it's really easy fun and arguing thanks so much this month Sara released a beautiful new baking book called organic and chic published through

no I'm my CMAs welcome to my home in Savannah Georgia so I do event design and I'm a photo stylist I travel all over the country producing features for magazines today we are throwing a holiday party in my home today I'm going to show you how to throw together a quick party with a few easy to make recipes and some DIY tricks that I've learned along the way I decided for this one to use all these glass cake stands that I have but I think most people probably see them traditionally sort of stack though well I didn't want to do that so I'm gonna build height with them in more of a stepping down stage so they'll make a nice circular space in the middle without it feeling too big because I'm going to get some things on it that are quite called so the overall thing will create a really nice nice amount of height to fill in this space but they'll still be a lot of room for food so the first step is placing them and then I put this fuzzy garland on with you can use to stick tape because I'm a photo stylist I'm a little addicted to this mentality so the next step is I have this it's cotton it's you can get it at craft stores but it's for making paper but I think it makes really great quick snow and not not the cheesy looking fake snow so I sort of scattered all around in there because what I'm doing is making a little bed for these bottle brush trees and so then you can build it up as you go but I typically like to kind of get them placed and then go around them kind of play around with height I don't like to get too many of the same thing on one stand and then with so as you go so you keep filling in with the snow I collected vintage christmas stuff for 20 years or born these are not but I mix in old and new things and so this was kind of a fun score at an estate sale and I like the idea of mixing the you know different tones so for me I don't necessarily always go with the same color so it's kind of fun to alternate something to think on this yeah and then the next want to probably do go back to green as a little bit different textures well that's just because this one's we're outside because we're going to walk hurry and there's a lot of overspray involved so rather then spray straight down which doesn't look very natural it's sort of framing the outside and that starts so pre great on the inside get inside so next step will be inside so essentially we've gotten Christmas ball make sure that you're sort of always across from the hangar so you know what's the top and went to the bottom and then you just start sort of filling in where you want things and very similar to the centerpiece that's really organic I kind of just do a thing and I stare at it if I don't like it and take it apart but before I commit with glue I kind of tuck it in give it a once-over like it that's when you go some of these things you can just twist in or poke in the way we do with the greens but with that clearly it's not going to stay unless you and you can pry these things off before you toss this recent way as an end of the season and alternate like getting some interesting shapes don't just stick this balls because I think it's kind of fun to this sort of a nice movement around our tree reflectors long time ago people used to polka Christmas lights to them and I actually still use them they're aluminum but they make them out of heavier middle as well did you see how much that magnifies an orphan so that's kind of a fun way to get some volume somewhere 
you we're here decorating our holiday Christmas tree this year with our wind turns for 2008 Sam and deaf and for the last video of the design sponge video series I thought it'd be really fun to do a sort of holiday themed video so we're going to be doing the craft project would be making these yarn Garland's and we're also going to be making a really delicious winter tree called holiday park so we're going to get things started with the cooking so let's head to the kitchen but let's put one last touch on the tree these are high school musical candy canes we found at the rite-aid this morning so we can teach you how to make me but they're perfect for the holiday season so let's cook the first thing we're going to start with is a winter park it's a recipe from Martha Stewart calm it's one of my favorite and I'm hoping that it might be one of your favorites it's a really great thing to make sort of last minute if you're sitting around the house before Christmas and need some last-minute gifts for neighbors or just want to make something for the rest of the family it's super easy all you need is 12 ounces of bittersweet chocolate i'm using ghirardelli you're going to need some parchment paper for the pan I really love this kind it's an unfun bleached parchment paper it's eco-friendly and I think it's recycled I just got it a fresh struct calm but you can get into most of them regular grocery stores and then you're going to need a stick or maybe even like a toothpick and you're going to need that just swirl around the chocolate at the end so that's the third thing you'll need and then you're going to need red box of peppermint candy canes you can use as much as you want after you cut it up and eight ounces of white topic so the first thing you're going to want to do is start cutting up your white chocolate right so the next step is to cut up the candy cane and we're cutting into the pan today because they might go everywhere so just kind of hate them lightly and do it in a pan so they don't go all over your kitchen okay now that we've got the white chocolate cut up into pieces we cut up the peppermint sticks and one last thing we did before using the peppermint sticks is we actually dumped everything we cut into a colander and then just drained out the little fine bits because you don't want all that peppermint powder mixing into the chocolate is going to make it look kind dusting and then you just want to dump your white chocolate back and now we're just going to wait for the chocolate to melt so this is sort of the consistency you want you don't want any big gloppy pieces left over it you just want it to be pretty smooth so now we're going to melt the bittersweet chocolate we bought it already cut up but if you have bars of it you can just cut it up now okay so now we put the pepper mix again to the chocolate and we're going to pour this on to a parchment-lined just regular cookie sheet i'm using with a pretty steep side so just in case things go over a little bit it's safe to have high sides so i'm just going to dump them in directly onto the parchment paper alright the next step is the white chocolate so you've got that you're just going to take little spoonfuls and spread them out all over the white chocolate it doesn't matter if they're messy or if they're neat because you're going to spread them around anyway so now we're ready to make our bark pretty and all we need is some kind of elongated stick whether it be a chopstick a butter knife or some kind of toothpick and you just have fun swirling it around and whatever shapes are most appealing to you I'm a fan of the swirl maybe like a heart ring and now that you're done all you want to do is you're going to take this whole pan and stick it in the refrigerator for like an hour to two hours I actually left mine overnight when I tried it and it was perfect for breaking so if you've got overnight to do that awesome it's not to stick in there for a few hours you can just stick it in uncovered you don't need to cover it with plastic or anything okay so our next project is a little craft project for the holidays we thought would be fun to work with deaths on something that would be textiles based since we have at least one Savannah textile student with us so we're going to make something that's going to be really unique handmade for your Christmas tree it's easy to do while you're sitting down with family and des is going to show us and even if you're not a knitting person like me you can make it happen so we're going to be doing is making finger Garland and what all you need are your hands and a ball of yarn kind of fiber any kind of weight obviously the thicker your yarn on the thicker the garland is going to be so keep that in mind and you want to remember when you're starting out a yarn project you always want to pull from the middle of your ball because that will reduce tangles and unhappy thoughts and feelings so if we if you're right-handed you're going to want to tie on your left hand on vice versa so we're going to start to do is tie a really simple knot around our stem just to stabilize the yarn so it doesn't go all over the place when we're starting and I'm don't make it too tight because we're just going to take it off in like 10 seconds and then we're just going to basically we've across our four fingers so we're going to start by going over the index finger under the middle finger over your ring finger under the pinky and then just back around weaving through and we're back at the index finger and then after we get back to the index finger we're going to want to go around twice or excuse me one more time so just kind of weave in so you have two lines of yarn on your fingers so repeating what we did in the first 10 exactly and there's no yes exactly and so what we're going to do is take our bottom row of yarn and pull it over our fingers and on top of that first row of the arm so basically just leaving one row of the yarn thinkers that's good no that's good when you're first starting out it's going to look a little janky but as you go it'll get way cute and adorable so we're just going to do it again and now that we've done it twice we kind of have a little bit of buildup of yarn on the back of our hand so when that happens we're just going to take the middle of our arm our build up and just kind of pull and it's not going to be too long it's going to be a little amorphous but it's going to build in structure as we keep going that's good that's good it's I feel like I've already way but ya know like this okay so that's a good yeah and so um let's do it again we're just gonna make another rope yarn by weaving it through our fingers one time up and back we just bring it over the top of our fingers and pull and so we're going to just keep doing this we're just going to keep weaving in throughout our fingers pulling over and then pulling in the back so i know that my family holiday traditions probably have very little to do with crash do this i think my family's holiday traditions have everything to do usually with food and sort of watching christmas story on television over and over again but you guys have any sort of craftiness built into your family tradition well we haven't done this in a while hoping they're a little pleased to be surviving like glass ornaments and we all sit my sisters and I would make ornaments for the tree all we had to do was like squirt some paint inside of him and you kind of just sit there and shake them like this and that was like the most crafty thing which I mean yeah ornaments maybe like gingerbread man yeah a younger but what was your family do this well we've attempted to make many a gingerbread house and like we've bought the kids and we usually just keep them for months and then it's just never as panda lavish maybe making a gingerbread structure but it's fun to try so you've been finger knitting for you know two and a half hours and you're ready you have a big long strand and you're so proud of yourself so you're going to finish it so what you're going to do is you're going to cast off in this really special way and basically what you do is you take you start off with your forefinger and you move this loop on to your middle finger so you have two loops on your middle finger and then you take the bottom loop off your middle finger and put it over the top loop leaving one loop on your middle finger and then you just do the same you put the loop from your middle finger onto your ring finger and then cross it with the original ring finger loop and then you're going to take the loop from your ring finger on today pinky cross that over and pull really tight and then you're left with your original strand of yarn and this last loop because basically you're just going to tie them in a square knot all right so our winter bark has been sitting in the a freezer or refrigerator for a couple hours and it's ready to come out so this is the finished product it should harden up really nicely after a couple hours in there and I think we can just so from everybody at designs fun happy holidays and Happy New Year we all hope you have a wonderful holiday and a very safe new year and we'll see you in two thousand my mouth 
today's final interview is with letterer designer and illustrator at Jessica Hesh I've been following Jessica's work for a while but became officially obsessed when she launched her daily drop cap series last week I stopped by her studio in Greenpoint Brooklyn to hear her thoughts on inspiration type design and her tips for up-and-coming designers I hope you'll enjoy her ideas and feedback as much as I did so let's meet Jessica hi I'm Jessica ish I'm a letterer and illustrator living in Brooklyn New York this is my studio space which I steer and share with other illustrators so I live in two lettering kind of by accident because I was a broke college student and rather than spend my last $17 on some sort of okay typeface I would draw all my own letters instead it's kind of hard to say things that specifically inspire me because I did work for Louise fielding for two and a half years and she was a wonderful inspiration for me so a lot of the a lot of my kind of visual inspiration that I get now is still pulled from when I worked for her because I built up this kind of in my brain library of resources but I think that you don't have to work for this crazy type person to do that all you have to do is be aware of all the types that surround you go on to design blogs and pick up all the little type stuff that you see because it's really having that kind of back catalogue of influences that are going to help you the most the only software that I use is Adobe Illustrator because basically everything I do is lettering for the most part I'm taking classes right now to be to do type design and type design is very specific to fonts so things that are meant to be rearranged and we put together that aren't meant for like a very specific use so the process that I usually use when I approach a new-type project it's pretty standardized depending on what the whether it's for client whether it's for me personally for clients clients need to see different stages of the project along the way you can't just say well I'll do it exactly as I want to do it and you'll like that the final and that's it so usually especially for editorial work I'll start out by doing these kind of word association lists which I find to be super duper helpful I've seen other illustrators call it mind maps where they do it in a more visual kind of scrolling way mine generally just to be just trying to be like columnar lists but then from there I do pencil sketches and usually for each project I show one two three cuts of sketches depending on what's needed and those are not extremely tight they're they're pretty close to what they need to be but I always have to kind of write a disclaimer email that says this is more whimsical than the file is going to be your you know I'm not going to show you color because then we're going to just talk about color all the time instead of talking about the concept and then from there a client will choose one concept and we'll move to final from there and then I jump right on the computer usually I don't even trace my sketches the sketches are mostly to just get a general sense of the composition and the idea and I do all of my real like playing and tweaking and moving stuff around in Illustrator so the easiest part is generally whose lettering if you get known as being like a style person so you'll do one thing and then you'll get hired to do it again and again and again and again so there will be that kind of style that's the easiest for you to work in for me is certain kinds of scripts so that kind of leads into the hardest thing so the hardest thing is to do the opposite of that to do the work that you're not used to working in and so the the hardest thing for me would be masculine work and you know it's really hard to do sophisticated masculine type you know it's pretty easy to make things just look chunky and heavy-handed but to do something that doesn't feel feminine but it still feels like it has a fine hand is really hard and one thing that I find to be incredibly hard is anything that's meant to look handwritten and masculine so the main advice that I have is to just look at as much of it as humanly possible you don't really have to have a formal education and type to learn to type and understand type a lot of the kind of old-school type designers will will say that you know you really should have a formal education and to tell you the truth like the more formal of an education you have the more you understand it quickly but if you look at a ton of type even if it's as simple as going on to my class or something and typing a like a capital A in the sample text and then just searching scripts and just looking at every capital a of every script for hours and hours you start to build up this vocabulary and understand the billions of different ways to draw a single letter and the more that you can look at the memories start to pick this up so it becomes easier and easier to kind of mix things up and not draw the same letters over and over again because a lot of people that get that are newly into type and you know starting to get into it what they end up doing is they have this kind of skeleton of the basic way that they draw an alphabet and it doesn't vary very much based on that original idea of what they think that their types should look look like and it's mostly just because they haven't been exposed to enough so the more you expose yourself to different type the more variation you'll see in your work so the more it flexes you have the the more diverse your work will be and the more you'll be able to kind of pull up these references real quickly you can do more of Jessica's work and her beautiful daily drop cap series at Jessica wish calm thanks so much to Jessica for taking the time to meet with me last week and I hope you'll enjoy her work as much as I do also be sure to check out her new font snowflake which is now available at vir 
today's design sponge video is brought to you by home goods visit w WM goods calm to find a store near you hi I'm grace from design sponge and today I'm going to show you how to use son Prince to create a custom cork board and tray for your home botanicals and plant related imagery have always been big in the world of home decor but they've recently experienced your resurgence frame botanical prints and antique floral charts are great ways to get the look but if you're looking to keep the budget even lower using Sun prints as a fun alternative you're probably familiar with some prints from paper form but Sanford's also come in fabric form you can buy on the internet I bought a couple yards at blue son Prince calm and today I'm going to walk you through the steps of creating your own son print and then turning that into a custom cork board and trade for your house so the first type of the project is to actually make the scent prints all you need is your son print fabric and some things you'd like to lay on top before you add your leaves be sure to iron your fabric first any wrinkles or creases will come up as discolorations when you're finished be sure to iron quickly and as far away from a light source as possible the longer your fabric is exposed the sooner it will start to change colors once your fabric is ironed you're good to go if you're working with leaves try flattening them between book pages for a few days to get a more precise final print lay your print and direct sunlight for ten to thirty minutes the longer you leave it out the darker the final color will be when your prints are ready to be processed simply rinse them in the sink until the water runs clear once you've rinsed your prints you can wash them in phosphate-free soap if you'd like then throw them in the dryer iron them smooth and you're ready for the next step for your son print corkboard all you'll need is a frame the back of your frame and then a thin role of cork drawer liner I picked mine up at the hardware store for about five dollars and i found a frame at my local flea market for a dollar i repainted it white kept the back and save the glass for a project later once you've assembled your materials for the cork board the first step is to cut the cork drawer liner paper to fit the back of your frame once you've got your cork cut to size you can remove the contact paper lining on the back and then here it to the back of your frame if you have a cork liner that doesn't have that he civ back you can just use glue and that will work just as well once you have your cork layer adhered and cut to size the next step is to add your son print on top to prevent any sort of bunching or wrinkles on the front of your cork board you can either use a staple gun to attach the edges to the back of the frame or use a light coating of glue on the back of the Sun print to attach it to the cork once your son print is firmly attached to the cork slide the back of the frame into place and secure with the supplied metal tabs just flip your frame over and you're ready to attach it to the wall for this project I decided to try a son print using leftover doilies from our wedding but almost any flat material will work so be creative and try new prints using objects that are special to you also be sure to use shorter thumbtacks for this board as the cork isn't as deep as a traditional cork board for today second thumbprint project all you'll need is your fabrics and print a small tray a bottle of fabric Mod Podge and a brush step one for the tray project is to apply a thin coat of Mod Podge to the inside of your tray next cut your print to pick your tray and lay it carefully on top smoothing out the surface with your fingers to eliminate any air bubbles or creases you can either fit your fabric to come right to the edges of your tray or let it hang over a little bit if you allow for extra fabric simply paint over it with the Mod Podge to adhere the edges to the back of the tray once you've done that coat the entire front side of the fabric and tray with a coat of Mod Podge it might get a little messy but it'll be worth the effort and don't worry if it looks white the glue will dry completely clear once the entire piece is coated let your tray dry in the Sun for a few hours be sure to place it on a sheet of plastic or wax paper so it doesn't stick to your drawing surface after a few hours in the Sun your tray should be good to go if you've got a little bit of excess fabric around the edges feel free to go back and cut it off or grab some more Mod Podge and just finish it off on the back now you're ready to fill it with your favorite accessories jewelry's keys whatever you need thanks so much for watching I hope you'll give these son prints a shot in your home they're a fun and easy way to bring botanical prints into your home without spending too much money to find more do it yourself ideas visit www.funds online com b round it's time 
let's say it ya see it there you go you're gonna free that guy alright alright I'm filming it alrighty she rolled over where did my dough already come back out oh yeah wave goodbye to the lobster there you go 
in this video I'm going to be talking about breaking into advertising wisely now the first thing to think about when you're dealing with an advertising program is when you should start I always say there should be a few things set up and established before you move forward with taking on advertisers the first thing is that you've built up a decent amount of content and by decent amount I mean a couple months that will really help all the stack counters you install be accurate the next is that you have at least two to four thousand readers per day that can sound like a lot but the reason I suggest waiting until you've built up this many readers is because it will allow you to charge rates for your ads that when you subtract the amount of texts you'll have to pay will leave you with enough money that you've paying yourself fairly for the amount of time you'll have to put into running this program now if you seem like you can't build up that number you can start earlier but I think that this is a good base number to start with for charging rates that are fair for your time the next thing to consider is if you have a couple hours a week left over that you can devote to dealing with advertisers you start taking on ads you have to deal with clients and you'll need to answer emails from them so make sure you have some extra time that you can use to devote to treating these people well and giving them the attention that they need and last but not least make sure you have your rules and limits established upfront what you will sell what you won't sell what sort of companies who work with it won't work with make sure you have all those sorts of guidelines set up front so that you don't get sort of pushed her swaying when you start getting into the ad program once you have these things set up you're ready to dive into the details now the first thing you want to do is get as many stats from your site as possible so if you don't have these set up you need to install Google Analytics quantcast and RSS feed some sort of social networking account and I find it's also helpful to do reader polls Google Analytics will give you your daily pageviews it will give you your unique readers it will tell you what sections of your site or most popular it will also tell you where your readers are located quantcast takes a while at a couple months to build up and be accurate but it gives you very valuable information about your readers sort of their incomes their education levels their marital status whether or not they have children all those things are very helpful for placing advertisements your RSS feed will tell you how many readers are reading outside of your main blog you can also place advertisements there so make sure you know how many people are using your feed and then a social networking account is also very important because it tells you how engage your readers are what they're saying and it's sort of an interesting tool that advertises are increasingly interested in reader polls aren't necessary but I find that they can be helpful maybe once a year sort of get some feedback on what people liked about your site or what they'd like to see changed advertisers are often interested in this sort of data from your readers so it can be fun to add in as well once you have these dokdo that these stats build up the next thing to do with them is to move forward with building an ad kit in that ad kit you're going to want to place information about your traffic and your demographic for traffic you want to include your page views and you can also include your unique daily readers that's not required but it's one that I think is important to include page views are going to be most interesting to your advertisers so make sure that those are in there you can find both of those in your Google Analytics dashboard for demographic it's important to include where your readers are if you have some information about their marital status and whether they have children and how much money they make that's also important to include so advertisers can get a quick snack shop snapshot of what your readers look like the next thing to include is some basic information and details on your content now it doesn't have to be a really long drawn-out section it may be one paragraph about what you do and what type of things you write about those specific content areas will be helpful for placing advertisements the next thing is awards or testimonials now these are definitely not required or necessary to get advertisements but they can be helpful if they apply to the sort of influence or weight that you carry in your field if you don't have any yet not a big deal no one is going to worry about that but they can be helpful and last but not least our prices there aren't really any sort of hard and fast rules about prices that you can charge or some sort of chart that you can start out with but the reason I suggest starting with two to four thousand readers means you can start charging over or at least around one hundred dollars for let's say a monthly ad now the reason I say starting with that price is because you're going to have to cut out a decent chunk of that money and pay it for self-employment taxes so let's say you make a hundred dollars a month on one ad let's say you keep maybe 55 or 60 of that or your actual profit think about how many hours are going into dealing with that ad and make sure you were paying yourself a fair hourly rate for that ad management so once you have your prices established make sure that you consider how your charging may be larger ads cost more smaller ads cost last ads that run closer to the top of the site will cost more than ads that runway down at the bottom that you're at a schedule that works for you and a payment scale and then put that in a chart and you're going to put that in your ad kit as well and don't be afraid to change rates slowly over time you just don't want to change them more than once a year your advertisers will get a little bit frustrated the next thing is how do you find advertisers the easiest way to find advertisers is to look around your niche and see who's advertising just make sure that when you find somebody you're not trying to poach or lure them away from another site with a lower rate people find out about that tend to get pretty ticked off so the first thing you want to do is craft a very short but friendly email to these advertisers and just say hey I saw you were advertising on a you know several blogs in my niche I just wanted to send you my ADD kid if you're interested in advertising on another you know design blog I'm available and we'll be happy to chat that's all you say and normally people are happy to write you back and sort of get some more information you can also look in the back of magazines I think sites like reading magazines like readymade or e-magazines or a great place to look and see who else is participating within your field once you've got those built up you can consider whether or not you want to move forward with doing your own ad program or whether or not you want to work with an advertising network if you do decide to sign to sign with an advertising network there are bunch to choose from some of the main ones within the design industry are federated there's the Martha Stewart circle there's glam there's blog her what you want to keep in mind is that these networks will take a cut of your profits because they're managing your ad program and they will also have a contract for you to sign make sure that if you hire a contract lawyer to look over these it is well worth the money that it costs to make sure that you understand what sort of exclusivity or out clauses are or not required with that contract just make sure you know what you're signing into if you're not comfortable with a larger network you can look into google adsense these are easy to place ads that you can stick in a right column or a left on your site you can also insert them on your RSS feed they may not be quite as pretty as the ads that you'll get from a larger network or ads yoursel yourself but they are very simple to deal with you can also consider running your own program if you do you're going to need a little bit of HTML knowledge because you need to be able to drop code in and out of your sight when you place an ad you're also going to need to know about creating ads if you don't know how to make them yourself or you have someone who needs some help one thing you can do is set up sort of a barter situation with a graphic designer we did this for a while and design sponge we would send them any inquiries that came from our advertisers who needed help building ads in exchange they would place ads in the code form on our site for us it's a great way to start out if you need help with placing ads and also need to find a way to help people get their ads created also you're going to need a way to process payments we use paypal and love it there are some pretty high fees but it's incredibly easy to use and it lets your advertisers pay via echeck via PayPal account from their business or via a credit card also be sure to set up little phone alerts or some sort of alert around the office that will remind you to take ads down or to put ads up you can often let people have way too much time if you forget to take them down or you might forget to put someone's add up so just make sure you have some sort of alert system set up to keep you on schedule the next thing to think about is if you do have an ad system set up and it's going for a while you can often kick things up to the next level by offering geo-targeting which lets people target just two readers in a specific area you can offer some sort of contests that are sponsored by an advertiser you can also offer some sponsored content or themed content that they're involved in now these are sort of next level ideas but they're good things to think about if you're looking to expand your program after a while now here are some tips to avoid when you're starting your ad program never let an advertiser by a post from you meaning that you write about them in exchange for money it really damages the trust you'll have with your readers second don't sell ads years and years in advance or even maybe even a full year in advance sometimes because you want to make sure that you allowed for growths in traffic which will then translate into growths and the cost of your advertising you don't want to increase your cost more than once a year but if you sell you know two years of advertising in advance doesn't really allow you to raise the rates and have them pay what would be a fair rate for your area for your areas of advertisement now you also want to avoid doing too many giveaways advertisers will try to use those as advertising when they instead should be paying for ads just make sure that what you're giving away would be equal to the cost of an ad is you don't want to give away precious editorial space for let's say the cost of a $25 necklace it just doesn't break out into a fair ad trade last but not least make sure that you know how to pay your taxes it's always very important to know the self-employment rules in your area so best of luck with everything and stay tuned to the design sponge base ladies categories for more free advice about advertising and running your own business online 
last week we met with a team at terrain its tires and learned how to make a beautiful bridge holiday wreath this week the terrain team is back and showing us how to make a natural twig armature to dress up your holiday flowers in vases so let's get started hi i am cat Bruni and I am a visual display artist here at range tires I'm today I'm going to show you how to make these Twiggy armatures for your amaryllis bullsh so the first step would be to choose a vessel we like clear vessels because you can see the activity of the ball rolling and also so that kind of appears in your structure the great thing about em realist bulbs is that they don't need a whole lot of water and they don't need any soil so really what you feel your vessel with is anything that will act as a support just to hold the ball shut up it doesn't need to actually hold soil so we've used some rocks in tomoz here can also use pine cones or bark anything really that will just create a support for so your next step will be to set your bulbs up in your actual vessel and make sure that's what their support and standing upright these bulbs that I have here a rep and fabric this is kind of adds interest but also how polo moister against it and help it stand up a little about it so place them in here and you can do one or can do a few just make sure that their support in the cynosure okay so your next step will be to build your structure basically I've collected these branches that you can find anywhere in your backyard these great these wrenches are great they have likened on them which it adds a little bit of interest that's just a moss or fungus growing on it you can also use birch branches these are just basic branches from the backyard so once you have your branches you'll know other thing you need is this tie wire which you'll find it an even a hardware store it's pretty easy to find and can start to make your form I started one here what I like to do is to lay the sticks out how you want them to go and how they're going to kind of line up as you go around and you simply just wrap the wire around the sticks as you go and almost no waiting fashion and doesn't have to be perfect it's kind of it's a very organic form so it don't go crazy trying to get it perfect just enough to hold the sticks in place and have to do one at the top and at the bottom so that it stays together a little better and you just continue from there but somehow make your vessel so once you have your structure completely finished you simply drop your vessel into the center and you can kind of situated surf wave like it but as you can see this one's not perfect but has a really cool effect when it's finished to add a bit more detail don't forget that you can wrap ribbons at the bottom to add a little bit of extra color and again the great thing about amaryllis bulbs is that they don't need to be in a direct water source so a great way to add some color interest to it before it blooms is to wrap the bulb in some fabric it's also a great way to use some leftover fabric you have you don't need a lot so basically you can wrap the entire roots and just continue to wrap it all the way around not too tight but just tight enough to keep it secure and also you can wrap it a little bit thicker around the top this also helps support it when it's sitting in your vessel and when you get to the end so that you don't have to tie it off or no ruin anything you can simply just tuck it in to one of your holes thanks again to everyone at terrain for sharing these great holiday craft ideas you can visit terrain at wweshop.com or terrain at home com 
Sanu welcome to Paris hi I'm Anna and one of the design sponge contributing editors based here today we wanted to invite you for a quick trip over the city to meet one of our favorite people David Lebovitz many of you know David first delicious desserts and today we're going to be making something from his new book ready for dessert but before we go meet David at the market I just want to peek into the boulangerie and pick up something I think will look great with our sorbet we're making and don't worry if you don't have a loom laundry at the end of your street because David shares the recipes on this blog oh let's go meet David at the market alone see one of my favorite things I always do when I travel is to visit a local market Paris has about a hundred of them happening around

kitchen welcome I'm surprised there's enough room for both of us but we'll make do so we're gonna make the red wine and raspberry sorbet which is in my book it's a wonderful recipe this is probably my all-time favorite sorbet it only has four ingredients and it's this wonderful frosty delicious sorbet we'll use those delicious raspberries we got from the market so in the saucepan we're going to go ahead and add 3/4 cups of water 1 cup of sugar well now you're going to get to use your hands to open the wine it's great this top wine some Americans are very skittish - like Oh screw top wines it's not good but very young wines such as this that are only going to be they'll be dropped within two or three years it's fine to use a screw top cobby's wine experts and friends it's better to use a screw top than a bad cork so this is a wonderful one we didn't get to taste it before you pour it all in there but let's go ahead and set it on the stovetop here I'll bring it to a boil so this has come to a full boil we let it boil for about a minute and it smells really good whew almost like mulled wine but Bedrich is it summer so we're going to go ahead and add 3 cups of raspberries and I'm gonna help you here ok these are beautiful raspberry as well just going to go ahead and pour those right into the wine then watch out don't splash yourself we're going to let it sit for an hour so what you're gonna do now is you're just going to go ahead and strain this if you don't have a Mullenix you can actually just pass it through a sieve and use a strainer use a spatula okay hey this one doesn't want to go up suicide so we have this flavorful liquid made with red wine infused with those fresh raspberries and actually you can use frozen raspberries as it works really well so let's go ahead and chill this down before we go ahead and turn it in the ice cream machine okay we'll just put in the fridge here so now we've got the mixture all in the machine we're gonna put the lid on and turn it on this is gonna take about 30 to 45 minutes to freeze and when it's done we can take it out to the garden and top it with some champagne there's some sparkling wine I have the perfect spot in mind okay so Ann now is the best part we get to have dessert oh it's beautiful summer day we have these fresh raspberries that we bought at the market was wonderful sorbet a lot of people like champagne but in France often people will drink sparkling wine like this and move away okay it's wonderful poured over the fruit we've got these little babies strawberries it's beautiful I love the color it's great for summer and I love the fact that you bought she kept for me I love they're my favorite thing in the world I think so how would you describe them to an American coz I've never seen them before I came to Paris oh really they're cream puffs in America we do make cream puffs we often fold them with ice cream they're this crunchy crystal sugar on top which gives them that wonderful little sweetness a lot of people look at them who visit France ago they look really salty but it's that one that's called pearl sugar and they go very well with dessert but they're also a great afternoon snack you buy a bag and you just eat them by the mouthful so there's nothing inside it's just air though yes that's why I feel okay eating a whole bag of them because I said there's nothing inside okay that's totally makes sense yeah they look they look like they could be an American doughnut hole but uh-oh but it's the French version no but when you when you break them open they have this wonderful airy texture inside I can't resist hmm the only a stoppable what I know in one of your blog posts you just went to Tunisia and I loved your tip about finding a local cafe and going there every day during your trip as you know in France there's the concept of my canteen which is the place you always go and they get to know you and that's very important I think even when you're travelling but especially when you live in Paris you want to get to know the people in your neighborhood yeah the cafes the butcher's the breadmaker the Chi shops which is probably the most important person and because then when you travel there's always that temptation to go and see and do everything but I love the idea of staying in one place and really getting to know the people in the location well I love your book sweet life in Paris because it is this memoir but with recipes and you have this really amazing sense of humor through it all which I think in living in a foreign country you kind of take things for granted but you need to roll with the punches all the time what's funny that you are talking about my book The Suite Life in Paris because you live here and after I wrote the book a lot of people that live here and a lot of friendship with a live in America wrote to me and they go oh you nailed a lot of the stuff yeah it's fun Paris is not a museum it's a real city and a lot of people come here and they see a certain side of Paris they go to the left bank and sit in a cafe and you know everything is charming but for those of us that live here we have to go to the bank and you know have them tell us well we don't take you know we don't have any money today you guys come back tomorrow you can't take money out on a Saturday I learned or Monday okay someone in Israel when they have family chore exception now they just close yeah but they also they love to talk about yeah and that's why I fit in pretty wait I've lived here and when people find out I'm a baker or a pastry chef they're very intrigued and also Baker's we're naturally giving people and I don't mean to sound conceited but no one bakes a cake and says Oh am I going to make this for myself I mean you bake a cake to share it like I made a leader we made a leader of this sorbet to share yeah I think that's wonderful well cheers Cheers and thank you so much for the recipe today and tour around the market thank you you 
the second bklyn designs day here for today is devoted main link the standout students of passive just feel design department but first let's make a few designers that I couldn't squish in the first video hi my name is Matthew Burbank and I am a scrimmage side this is the chaise lounge inspired by Greek plays multi chair and the last thing is the desk which has inspired by a vintage card catalogue library card catalog has a leather top my name is Shannon campanero and my company's a scale basically I'm a painter and I now let's see what some of the talented students who Pratt Institute are up to hi my name is Dana de Vega I'm an industrial design student at the rad that's graduates Villa days I designed to Mills they come in red and black blue and silver their hands they were lovingly made in greenpoint they are they were designed to the mechanism could fit inside to their pressure food with no glue and they are also ceramic so that's why it's alright for salt and peppers or won't corrode and a top star boiler drain valve and so this was so this one's number I am Sarah Ebert student studying industrial design of pratt institute I designed these stools they're upholstered in recycled sweaters all those letters come from the Salvation Army their cover inside they've already been washed and shrunk so you can swim I think its name drum and washer hi my name is Tony Nixon and I'm a graduate student at fraud and I decide this chair the re chair steel bars powder coating with high study abroad hang again I'm Joseph Kent and I'm a senior at pratt institute study industrial design and my product is a butcher block the cnc cut so that when you're carving a piece of meat up here any grown-up actually goes out away from your surface and then down to one in so that you can easily pour it my name is Jason halfway on the senior on your graduate Eliza Central's as a building block the second degree my name is Santa design undergrad student at Pratt Institute patient was a trained often I wanted to create anamorphic shapin up from a recycled five hi I'm Liz chimezie and I chandelier it is inspired from its haha itself below which is made out of hi my name is ever new masters design institute idea behind the chair was made right stands while they're so it's more like you're standing up I hear someone supported and chair it allows you to sort of us Bob around the left it right cork and this is Scott aluminum this is a fluid so like to explain it it's got a little bounce to it I am like a weaker recent graduate of the industrial design master's program at institute this is the Franklin lamb it's it contains a lot of American cultural icons to give people a sense of warm American nostalgia and childlike winslet there's a lot of references to Benjamin Franklin specifically the way it works that you read this Ramos using this please the keys a reference to Benjamin Franklin's faizal's electricity experiment and light fades on with the fading sound of the bell and it works the same way when you turn it off last but not least here's some more great designers from this year's purple let's take a break thank you tasty to eat let's go yeah water we go sure two two two what it's worth 
font and type design have always intrigued me so after saying today's great lineup of type topography and homes and topography in the market I thought it would be fun to speak to local artists who specialize in the field so I packed up my camera and hopped on the subway to meet the some of my favorites but because everybody had so many great things to say I decided to break their interviews into three separate videos today I'm starting things off with Jessie Reagan a talent to type designer who's based in williamsburg brooklyn so let's meet Jesse hi Jesse radios my design typefaces and lettering when I was in high school I got really interested in 10 cases sort of first realized that they even existed and I would dialogue to the Lawson boards and download pirated fonts and things which versus reprehensible tango but I had went to them and I categorized on the cover they excited about them so then when I went to RISD and I thought that there actually people to do this for a living and then it's a ballad career direction possibly I really focus my studies on that a lot of my projects are historically based so I do draw a lot of inspiration from the past from things that people have designed to past sometimes I feel sort of indignant when I find a design that over that a piece of lettering or typeface from metal type days or photo type that hasn't been brought into digital form so that it's not accessible to digital designers but also I think when a client comes to me with a specific need that's what what's really inspiring to feel that there's there's a need for something there's a lack of something in a certain niche that I can fill so problem solving I guess it together we do think that drives me as a designer usually I would start with some kind of client brief but then pretty quickly go into looking at what else is already out there how is this going to be different from what is already available digitally and also looking historically and what the context is of other other things that have come to work is obviously we can learn from a mistake that people have may have the past and then from there you know just designing a few basic characters of the typeface to get an idea of what the parameters are really refining those and getting those perfect before moving on to the next stage which would be a slightly larger than set of characters getting those really perfect than going to a larger set so it's a very cumulative process where everything is refined in multiple stages along the way and I find that's the most efficient way to work to get a really good product as quickly as possible which is particle I do usually start by sketching my hand I'm not great working by hand so I do tend to live to the computer very quickly as far as software I use fontlab primarily for drawing tight it's a very frustrating piece of software it has a lot of problems but it does get the job done in this part and then I also use a few independently developed applications like metrics machine and super the later prepa later which have been created by other type designers who were just sort of fed up with the tools that existed so it is sort of very homegrown industry and I think we all sort of work together to make it better for us for me the easiest part of inter design is the the middle part from a design it's when when there's really that sort of synergy happening and all of the the basic aesthetic and structure and the rhythm and systems are all established it's just the font starts designing itself you know and all these the glyphs just sort of feels natural and I'll feel sort of organic that's that's a really exciting part for me the hardest part for the signing of a typeface really is not the design part of naming a typeface I think there are so many Titus's out there and there are so many names that have already been used so finding a name that's actually appropriate to the typeface that is marketable that looks good when setting the typeface that's something you might not think of but it's important that because it's going to happen a lot but i miss my things you want to show off all that sort of crucial characters and the letters of that word so that's it that's good evening I would say just start doing it just started drawing type to start sketching it and then you know get your hands on some font software and started on digitally sign your type most people in my industry or self-taught I have a fortune to study the few really tell people so I ended have teachers but most people will figure out on their own but I think it's important to you to realize that you don't know all the answers by the way but it is something that you know it's a lifelong learning process design type I'm kind of still learning some old jesse has an amazing body of work that you can check out info at Jesse Reagan calm and if you're looking for custom font design he's available for new projects as well thanks so much to Jesse for taking time to chat with me 
okay so Santino is asking you what was the sort of thing in the store that inspired you the most or the thing that was most memorable well I really love all the textiles that you can find in here like the little wrapping textiles and wall hangings the ones that are more graphic look like a stencil work that's silk screen are pretty interesting as well to me especially the one kind of like with a contrast of just the dies either pulled out or printed on top with the contrast of leader navy and white or black and white I love this one alright pacifically because it's also like adding the element of origami and the shapes that have origami makes what they're printing it onto the onto the fabric I think that's pretty pretty exciting so all of these you know you could imagine working them all together like you still sure over half or you know doing the you know just carrying on with with one print throughout an entire garment but i do love kind of the sensory overload that you get when you look at a display of all the textiles and they're kind of all blending and sometimes most times it's not even planned necessarily like how they're laid out in color but you can see like really happy accidents of life you know two prints being laid next to one another that aren't necessarily what wouldn't necessarily be seen together but they look pretty pretty great yay
