Adams you 
once you run off like that I don't know I was talking to her about the maze and I've been go into specifics and she just had a ran off yeah they be running for half a day already we have to find her soon I know this is bad we're gonna wind up having to leave her here if we don't find her what did you say to work what did she say anything I was just basically trying to relate to her man and then she just kind of booked it she was kind of like me sort of like a rebel but just not as I guess stable but even you did run through the maze on your first day here I show anywhere in here this whole place is a labyrinth bad know where we're going yeah yeah don't worry I know how to run the maze I just I don't know where the maze she could be we're not gonna get lost right no don't worry I have all the maps written down there I'm a pocket here on my best but us runners we catalogue every single part of the maze so we make sure whenever you run that we never get lost yeah but it makes it a lot harder when we have to find someone who doesn't know the way around yeah I get it you can run the maze but you can't find things specifically in the maze if you don't know where they are we hope that she's somewhere nearby Hey greedy greedy grainy that maybe she's over towards the outer rim hey you need to stop acting irrational and come back I can't you need to rethink this we can't just be running around in the maze like this is dangerous where am I look look you guys snap out of it okay you gotta trust this I know this is all crazy and weird to you now but there's an explanation but we have to leave first I don't know it's becoming late boys just staring at the one that's your most moved to the Outer Rim what what is the outer rim Jin what is this okay so there's there's numerical sequences in the entire maze each section is labeled with the number and we use these numbers to keep track of where we are in the maze and how we navigate the entire thing there's actually two mazes in this entire thing there's an inner tighter maze that's around the glade and then there's a bigger more complex rounder maze that surrounds it what yeah you're cataloguing this for two years we've been finding all the information that we can just trying to get this stuff together but we still haven't found a way out we calm down you need to listen listen to me okay listen to me all right I know it's a bad position that we're in okay and and nobody wants to be here we're all looking for a way to get out we don't know why we're here none of us do but we can't act irrational we can't just run into places that we don't know anything about and what is acting rational actually got you two years of work looking through a maze ok greenie I know this is not the best situation but you have to listen to me I'll explain ok the glades are the safest place for us right now because when the Sun Goes Down and it turns night those doors shut and then the maze reshuffles and the Greve come out right grievers they're big they're dangerous they're ugly and they kill people what I I wrote I don't know much about the grievers personally because like I've never encountered one but from what I've heard they're bad and we don't want to be here it's becoming late and the last thing we want to do is come across one at night I'm fine fine why do you know anything more about grievers Jen I've never told anyone this story but greenie remember wouldn't you first came here and that runner got stung yes while we were running we got separated I went with him and while we were running he ended up getting cornered by a griever and he got stunned I mean we got lucky we managed to get away that was the first time I've ever seen a griever I think that's the first time anyone's ever seen a griever but they're coming out early and earlier in the day they're not coming out at night anymore sometimes it can be around here now what well I know they are we have to leave now before they go all right okay hey follow me I know the way back fun Maude George going to shut you dang it's ah it's closed oh this is bad we didn't make it in time so we have to wait until morning I don't think we're gonna have much waiting what to do the grievers are probably out at the you need to calm down okay we need everybody to be on their on their game let me think maybe we could maybe we could find a place to hide hide this entire place is just dead ends and corridors just nowhere to hide okay calm down okay everything is gonna be fine we're gonna get through this no I don't know what but we can try that's the most important part Jen we should start moving there's no point die no matter where we run the grievers will find us no one's ever been inside the maze for a night and survived for dad but you've survived a griever before I've right at the griever because he turned away and ran for some reason we got lucky okay you don't get that lucky twice okay um this face it's guy were as good as dead no we're not I refuse I refuse to die the first time I go into the maze as a runner yeah well that's how the maze is all right it's dangerous they roll the dice we came up short oh there's gotta be something we can do there's got to be something we can do oh I don't I don't know about you I'm gonna look for a place to hide what but you heard what he said there's nothing there's no place that I need to calm down yeah I'm going to die here because you ran through the maze and led us here hey you guys need to calm down stop do your job Jess wicked is good Jen what have you done doesn't matter we're all dead leave her there Jane don't you can't just leave her here it doesn't matter we're all as good as dead the ground hey wake up wake up hmm she's waking up I remember my name my name is my name is Jess yeah that's great maybe we can put it on your tombstone look it doesn't matter anymore all right I I don't why would you hit me oh boy I lost control okay but look both of you need to calm down all right I can lose control as well stop all right the last thing we want to do is fight each other if we're gonna be dealing with a bigger creature than both of us than all of us then the last thing we want to deal with is each other all right we need a band together and figure out what we're doing okay I mean we might as well be as good as dead but wait there's no scent did you hear that that was a griever cry that was definitely real God we have to move where do we go follow me if we're gonna be running from this griever thing if we're gonna try and survive might as well try and do it right Oh great sign without a fight oh okay we can keep going down through these corridors if we keep going down the right twists and bends maybe we can avoid them do you think that's even gonna work I don't know the base is already starting I can hear walls moving okay okay just keep moving just keep moving off our trail okay chin I'm freaking out I'm gonna be honest with you look okay okay just keep it together I know I know I know I know we're we're gonna be fine okay all right I hear it it's getting louder Jane I don't know if we're running the right way now we're running towards the outskirts the outskirts maybe we won't be able to give half so much in time tired we need to stop for a second okay we need a we need to calm down I think we got I think we might have made it I don't hear it anymore the word order I know I know I know um okay we're that's the littlest thing for a second here that thing is ugly thattaboy greenie to go back to the glade now you

oh gosh guys we're gonna be late for a cosmology class we're always late every single time every single time Ross if you didn't have to oversleep every single day someone was milking a goat and that concludes our study on two plus two equals fish ah some new students welcome to cosmology 201 today we are going to be studying general relativity why it down general relativity is very important you need to understand it to know how your world works and we will get to it eventually right but why does the general relativity general relativity is not something that your simple little mind will understand which is why today we are going to be talking about something much more exciting okay today we are going to learn about aliens wait what my recent findings have proven that the universe we live in is infinitely massive oh my gosh that's almost like more than like really big yes so big that it would be impossible for a simple humans to possibly measure but what if you what if you have like a really really big ruler the quite Class A universe must be teeming with alien life yes aliens I knew it I told you Jen I told you Jim Barney Barney let the teacher talk he's the one with the degrees yes the one with the degrees thank you Bri silence I was watching the Discovery Channel last night and they had such a convincing argument for aliens and that the dirty government is keeping things from us obviously hey man Discovery Channel has some amazing content okay yes obviously obviously Einstein knows we're talking about Barney you've clearly been brainwashed like the best of them Oh oh he calls you out what you gonna do about it I require some volunteers for today's experiment us us awesome perfect you sky and all of your friends come to the front of the class well you you would have done the same Barney you would have seen boys come closer I need to tell you something but the other classmates cannot hear it okay it's fine it's fine don't worry about it this happens to us all the time come on there's a reason you are in my class you and we are chosen ones of mankind I knew I knew it I call it I've been chosen for anything now listen I have space rocket right back here prep for launch okay this is getting a little weird which is awesome all these guys you don't want to explore the depths of space with us I mean you're being quite the debbie downer we need to make contact with the aliens could we ride on a magical school bus or something else no you idiots what is this a show for kids oh yeah oh you got you got a call doubt you got calling out Ross you made this rocket yes lots of iron well well your close friends and don't mind if we touching a little bit yeah something weird or crazy doesn't happen to me shin-chan sauce spit sauce let's just be realistic here this was gonna happen no matter what right like your father never asked for this oh oh so we're gonna be we're gonna be going to space then oh yes we're gonna need all this yep and if you want to pass the class I will pass you with flying colors if you make contact with the aliens what you know what Einstein that's your name right Einstein we stop pretty crazy pretty fast but you know what I like it let's do it good eyes like crazy - that's why I teach you now do us a space suits fit you Val I hope so because I next stop is the moon hang on what about the other students doesn't it seem kind of irresponsible to just leave a class like that I'd say aliens no this is more important for the advancement of humanity all this because then you actually show on Discovery Channel professor don't you think we should count down or something just you know when you're going to tree to fun ah I have been feeling this one so that's just the zero gravity that's not why maybe did anybody bring a cheese grater Ross why would we get a cheese grater how else are we going to get all that cheese bet here prepare to land boys fail boys here's VR we have a landed on some moon look around this is awesome there's like nothing here but I am so excited to finally be able to explore the moon this chosen ones Raelians wouldn't show up without you for here yeah crammed spaceship and then we're flight here and there's nothing here hey Janet oh look look look it started out being kind of cool and I'm Tanya what steps the foot steps they must be gross we must be quiet those are those are ours your parade but we've explored the moon before and it's been known for several decades that aliens aren't here you don't know anything you sound just like Bonnie buying into the government propaganda Irena Barney so should we just like should we just explore then I mean we're on the moon who might as well explore yes the aliens like to hide they like to play hide and seek hey this is awesome don't have too much fun or I will fail yeah if there was like no gravity three-sixty dizzy knows a moon is actually made of a form of space cheese I that's my antenna I'm gonna take so much of this home Jen is it actually made out of cheese no yeah sure it's made out of cheese is that already failed gene what's over here there's space this is so cool what is this artifacts this must be what the aliens used to travel around no this must be leftovers from the expedition to the moon we had in the 1960's nonsense the American flag is right here welcome propaganda they appear to be highly fuel-efficient it looks as though they run on the tears of earthling children Barney Barney you gotta race me let's go to drive alien devices and I left all my children tears back as a classroom no these are pretty this is pretty easy to drive they're kind of like regular cars oh my gosh wait a minute can I use this as a ramp don't worry I made the second have you guys been to the moon before you seem awfully familiar with these foreign devices uh no it's it's just it just drives like a normal normal human car there's cheese night you've known for decades the moon doesn't have any light there's plenty we know that might have life on them to take thousands of years to get to do you mean Jupiter Jupiter's just a big ball of gas look aliens probably exists but the too far to reach the closest solar system to ours is Alpha Centauri and we barely know anything about it how do you explain this alien pig guess you showed me professor aliens are definitely yeah well we'll go find them you stay here and keep looking for uh eggs what's this yeah from our professor I think crazy guys that we're leaving on the moon let me see in there anyway guys that was a Minecraft University if you guys like this commentary and you're new to this channel click that like in the subscribe button the next episode will be coming out on the 4th of September okay thanks I you you

you know all in all culinary class was a lot of fun I love that nethers kitchen bed that's kind of fun was also really stressful with the timer and all that sort of stuff but I guess in the end you know it's pretty fun this is the shame that he got food poisoning at the end it was anybody else get like release forms like he put it on TV Wow anyway we did put him in the hospital so I guess it's sort of the least we could do to give him an episode you know yeah I guess I guess so I mean but to be fair we we made such crap laughs it's crap porn is me I make Barney you didn't even cook the cheese like you just kind of like charred the outside of it in the inside was still like a brick of cheese yeah I don't think I would admit either it was weird he like extended me a job or something as a whatever no gosh no okay with several Michelin stars he said no I I like I like being lazy like awesome food every day oh that's what you just want me to get out of the house so you could put your computers in my room no I just think you should apply yourself you know no that's what you want to do that's what you want to do anyway uh I hope he's doing well I mean he was kind of rude what I sent him a get well basket full mixed nuts wait wait nuts well cuz he was a little bit nuts you know what I mean hey Russ Russ he's allergic to nuts I'm sure he's fine anyway what class do we have next anyway Oh psychology psychology biology those people once they're all like wow you're always upset because you eat too much I hop or something's on me it was upset tummy or up uh Ross that's not a psychologist that's a dietician are you sure you know Britisher psychologies your head your brain how it works and how do you think all that sort of mumbling I'm so glad that we have these times to like sit down and talk with each other I mean I know that like we're like six minutes late now but wha whoa oh yeah by the way this time we've been talking we got late hey man I enjoy our time together sorry class time not being in class anyway um so do you know what classroom we're supposed to go to I think it's this one right here as it wants it does anyone know one tape at the professor he's got some like weird name at the end like fir'd Fred I heard he's good with psychology but you know okay I uh looks a bit of an introvert there aliens [Music] [Music] [Music] hello students I am professor Freud and this is psych 101 whoa whoa whoa wait Freud doesn't the famous Sigmund Freud the one why is everybody oh Jesus famous gee why are we always taught by a bunch of psychos not psycho now listen here what is your name Ross I already see you have some type of complex that we may explore what the IHOP complex is it is it an IHOP complex I've never heard of that as some that some kind of new - excuse me sky it's not your name I gotta use the bathroom have a seat okay there's no need to use that restroom and explore that context now see here on the board this is an iceberg you mean like from the Thai Tet were you in the Titanic Judy's definitely in the Titanic I recognize a picture no no no seen this movie poster now listen here the theory of consciousness is like an iceberg top there is the conscious mind and that is just the tip below listen hear us okay [Music] conscious called is that my iceberg no it's lettuce see the very tip of the consciousness but there's a lot more to the mind that you can't see cuz it's below the surface already my favorite students Jen listen don't make fun of him the best way I can help you all to understand the subconscious mind is to go inside of one eye exactly what yes inside hegemony volunteer subconscious Jay how come we never get a normal teacher Ross why eivol eivol interior you what what am i doing great now I've dedicated my entire life career and social life into inventing a machine right over here in the back of the classroom that will allow a human being to enter the inner conscious of another human being now Ross the volunteer hold on hold on hold on Jim don't you have one of those apps on your phone oh yeah like that last week right what's an app like an iPhone app you know all you have to do is configures that it scans brain waves and then modifies it into a physical algorithm so then that way you can actually transpose yourself into a mind I mean here though it's just a little rudimentary that's all is it gonna hurt no what he says Rossy scary tickles ready to explore the inner conscious what I expected Wow Russ Oh a classic case of aquaphobia see the mind reveals all of these subconscious secrets yeah but that we already know that about right patience boys there are more secrets to unveil I don't know professor Ross can be a bit empty-headed why you spray the drainpipe well this mind always has been in the gutter that isn't funny at all this is a septic system down the rabbit hole we go okay all jokes aside though we're like in Ross goop right now I'd like to get out of I'm just thinking oh god there's feathers everywhere refreshing anyway so this is his this is like inner subconscious what is this again yes we just happened to stumble over upon the right place right respond build upon I thought that was the walls point of the machine that takes us here yes we are in the right part of the subconscious to explore all of Ross's complexes I mean look at all of these chickens yeah have you ever asked yourself why no hey Jen look there's like an IHOP there - explains his complex uh-huh yes the chickens it represents Ross's mother attachment to this is caused by feelings of neglect and extreme sorrow pretty sure he just likes chickens yeah he has a pet chicken I don't think it has anything to do with it no no look at the IHOP sign i H o P it's missing an e no friend is missing hope it is supposed to spell I hope have some pancakes yeah it's literally International House of Pancakes Jen's right there pretty good we go there pretty often I guess - continued there nila pancakes gin I know they were so good - there's a continuation of those pancakes as more feelings of neglect no no no in fact we've been we've been going to Olive Garden more often lately anyway you're even more into it is actually there Freud he just likes food more this guy's a bit of a negative Nancy isn't he Jen how about we go deeper into the subconscious I'll prove to you Ross is just Ross I mean this entire place is basically just Ross only a bit more colorful you're a smart boy you shall see yeah I'm gonna see that Ross's subconscious is just a normal subconscious it's literally just chickens and I hop at every corner this is incapable of having a complex oh come on Jen that's a little bit mean yeah complex Ross has many complexes like what what's in Ross's head and are you sure we should do this this looks like a really big fall right want to learn more about Ross here we go Oh Jay come on Barney Barney let's hold hands all right ready three two one oh my hand oh wow for each of us his attachment to his friends are very important to him he's got my sunglasses and butter in here what the heck this is you've got my laptop in oh the coating is all wrong but I can't believe looky here a cow oh represents the neglect of the mother but no Froy house at her house they provide nutrition I'm I'm wait June does that mean Ross's cow man I kind of doubt it I don't know how they would know each other is comments two-year-long maybe he just idolizes cow man yeah maybe he really likes cow man hell is wearing a skirt it obviously represents right right right you are such a debbie downer just keep going I want to find out more about Ross I mean besides Jim it's like the only time you'll ever admit that huh yeah yeah pretty much thankfully Ross is unconscious in the chair right now so you can't hear me whoa what the heck is this is that thunder muffin but looks like thunder muffin is this like a shrine to thunder wow that's that's I want a shrine like that library but Ross doesn't read that's weird oh my his thirst for knowledge is real but no it's it's not looks like they haven't been touched in decades this entire place is dusty and unused here wants more knowledge you can tell he wants to learn you were looking into so many things that aren't there yeah I mean quotes from Ross I can fit three fingers in my bellybutton this box whenever he needs one probably so negative note is this well this place is dark I think we've reached the deepest part of the subconscious guys and there's IHOP here surprise of course whoops oh you more missing easy no no look Freud your subconscious is just his subconscious all right this is Ross and we know pretty much all of us already you're just projecting your own subconscious onto us you're just everything you're deflecting all of your stuff on to us and then and then you just try be more optimistic no issues with myself just be a bit more optimistic man it's just I hops and chickens there's nothing more to it you simply don't understand psychology I just think that you're over analyzing things over analyzing over analyzing anything I'm under analyzing this whole place is a demonstration of how our brains process information yeah so let's leave it at that you don't need to analyze has already been analyzed wait Jen that's genius if Ross's brain is a representation of Ross then Ross must be a representation [Music] [Music] turns out the professor was a total lunatic don't you it's not a good idea to have a class taught by a bunch of psychos guess you're right all along Ross hey I'm kind of hungry you guys want to get some food yeah sure what do you guys want to go about Denny's [Music] you

personal stake in this institution and now you forced me to get a second mortgage on my home my wife left me I can no longer afford to keep my children in the house okay life problem no I don't need ear steak what I need is I need for you to apologize for what you've done and work to fix it do you remember all the damage that you've done no I I don't remember any damage I haven't done anything to you you want to go stop fist fighting in the school that's against the rules y'all break the rules again I haven't done anything you're gonna have to prove it to me rule number one is no fist fighting rule number that wasn't me oh yes he's allowed to yeah rule number two is if children fistfight against each other were allowed to punch them exactly me all right well children I if you refuse to admit to what you've done why don't I just go and and show you because are you so excited this place with colorful little carpets and stuff we felt like this is supposed to be fun can you stop making it fun I'm sorry no you're supposed to learn from this supposed to go on to be adults from here and all you can do is prance around like small children what are you 18 years old you act like you're five I'm sorry listen look I am learning I'm learning that you know even if life throws you curveballs that you can have fun oh you can't I have not the substitute did you say that every time I've done anything going on I filled her what substitute teacher are you talking about I've never assigned any substitute teachers to your classes okay just be quiet would you children please follow me first we're gonna go to the gym do you remember what you did here in the gym no you know yeah I was with the explosive balls by any chance well no we don't have any more dodge balls we we had to sell those to pay for the repairs in fact we had to sell pretty much everything here in the school the only thing that's left is this broke down and dreamless shell of a building where all the other kids have left because you've driven them away you lift them on fire you blew them up we have lawsuits all over the place all because you for I wasn't even here this day I wasn't even here this day how am I to even know whether you're telling the truth or not oh just gonna have to trust me well too bad a rolecall system got blown up as well I can't possibly check that so I'm gonna assume you were here for it okay so have you absolutely no remorse for what you've done it's not necessarily that I have no remorse I just think that we made improvements and this looks cool I bet I could dunk a ball at this point now this let's see let's see stake you can't even make a dump on something as high as your waist I'm afraid we are maybe this didn't have enough of an impression on you the next place we'll let's go you guys need me to remind you of some more damage you done yep I'm following fun field trip here veneers no this this here is the first classroom that I ever taught in when I join this night uh what did you do I don't even know how this happens who's been expecting me by the way who is this principal this this room looks pretty dirty I've had just about enough of your back test everybody out have you desecrating the first room I ever taught in no fighting in this room this isn't scuba diving class water cleans everything do you have any idea the cost of repairs for this you the idea how far down this water damage has gone into the foundation clearly clearly you learn nothing from your engineering architecture courses so that's in the range of a hundred thousand dollars to fix hundred thousand yeah it's well it's about a hundred thousand dollars less than you're ever gonna make in your lifetime so I have no idea cuz we were gonna sue you yeah I only got like like a pumpkin farm at home if you want a pumpkin I could I could make it worth your while in pumpkin I've had it I've had enough pumpkins expecting me I went to this this is actually back when I attended this this school this is the first room I ever got taught in so it's great to see that it's on fire now I you you and I have different definitions of cleanliness but I why did why do you have to bring a flamethrower to school whatever you did I just to be fair I thought it was impressive that he pulled that off let's be real the room seems kind of hot I don't necessarily don't appreciate it I think that it's just a little a little hot for me I've never been a very good at tanning beds and this is just why are you staying there for a second no she's unemployed now because we had to fire her to compensate for all the damages you remember you remember when you were supposed to mix vinegar and baking soda to make a little volcano yeah it wasn't you weren't supposed to actually use dynamite in that let's be fair here she said clean the room look at this this room is clean this is fantastic tell me that this this isn't gorgeous I like when you build a room from scratch it's pretty clean right yeah I mean it's to be fair it's unbelievable it's right in front of you so much fun this day are you gonna show us other room have you have you no no ability to recollect and and show any remorse for all the things you've done I don't not show remorse I just think that you know we had a really good time alright alright I've got one more thing for you keep following me grab a ladder do something alright you haven't showed any remorse so far but here we go final step I feel a little bit of remorse I feel bad don't get me wrong I go that's it that's a start you know that's the first stage I'm not stop throwing food at me that will make the situation any better you can have it back I remember this you have you have no respect for this stadium back in my prime I would run this track now now that I've grown too old to compete I used to enjoy watching games here watching track events and then you just had to go and blow it all up put that away don't you know that's against school rules give that to me I have a question I have a question what are you what are you trying to do out of all this like why are you showing us all this I really you know I I thought you all might might have just had a sliver of human decency left in you my point exactly but but it's pretty clear you show no remorse you've just blown the school up to bits you've ruined my life you've ruined the school we've our attendance has dropped dramatically we have no new enrollment for student oh yeah what what do you want from me we just want to graduate man yeah diploma will be awesome yeah really

world we're not understanding and how do you know if any of this is real captain you can see it for yourself tell me that if this coin does not look the real to you these coins I've never seen markings like this before anywhere this small pile alone to be worth hundreds that captain he's already finding some of these pages and he's leaving us the map to finding the rats it's just lying there waiting to be taken no this is debrie I'm tied to duty not riches they're still saying that what makes you think that the British will care about the duty they're only caring about the money and this way you can paying the bed for all that was lost I suppose in the sky aren't you always wanting the adventure to being the captain to having it respect yeah but how is the treasure gonna keep me that are you not use your brain if you are being a reach Ron what's stopping you from buying your own ship and being the captain of your ship my own ship can actually be the captain of my own ship thinking about it how'd it sound kept in sky captain sky I like that it has a nice ring to it alright Barney you've got me let's go get that treasure do you're saying with this treasure I could bring my men home captain yes we could go home oh hold up there really I'm telling you that the adventure is what is so great about this life yes the treasure is here our opportunities here but really you aren't is still going back I mean I don't know I've never been like one for adventure I've always wanted I could I mean I got it you can't get your own ship you're all crew everything you're the captain I know I that's it's like all I've ever wanted huh I mean it's your dreams this is your dreams here wait hold on hold on hold on we have more my dreams aside we have more pressing matters didn't Ross just finished his surgery Oh rot like totally forgetting this we should I'm worried I mean it's it's partially my fault I mean I I should have watched him I should have watched after him and I hope he's okay well it kind of doesn't matter in what you watch they have to rot you're always getting himself in this sticky situation but still he's like a little brother to me man did little brother aside he's in the situation he hates what the heck what the heck Ross what happen to your other leg all right oh my god Ross I thought you only lose one leg the infection spread medically possible till uh still can't feel my toes I think he's still got a sense of humor guys right that wasn't joking I can't yeah I mean right I know that the situation is not the best situation for you okay but no it's not look at it this way still probably you can learn to walk again hopefully maybe Andy you're not stranded on an island oh boy maybe I can light my legs on fire signal another signal another ship I wasn't I wasn't funny I'm sorry Ross I've got a I've got interesting news I'm Betty good news it's a good news your guys it's it's good news I don't know how it's gonna go over with you considering though I mean well we're we're gonna be we're gonna be pirates we okay I'm gonna be a pirate gin not all the way onboard but you will be he'll come around so we're so we're gonna go and take legs kill no no I'm gonna be different I just want my own ship I don't know what I don't know what everybody else wants but I just want my own ship you just want a ship but you'll kill people to get it no I almost died yeah it's my legs but there could have been something higher up but you're not dead you survived you're still here you have to be happy about that you can live but I'm here Marty we're on a freakin pirate ship in the middle of wherever well think about it this way amazing but at least we're not still in that island I miss the island you don't write you can still learning you're just saying I've been learning how to Ron you're just saying that's good Ross will be able to get enough we'll be able to get enough money to get you like chainmail leggings not not say me that would probably be bad but but automail we could get you anything maybe an improvement something we could get you metal legs the finest the finest of gold I look forward to that maybe someone will steal my legs instead of uh take them off now oh come on and ride cheered up it's my bad Ross because this is a new a new perspective on life I don't want this before you were just a cabin boy now you can be something else there's no home to go back to Ross Ginn was thinking the same thing he was thinking I need to get back we can't living like this but I showed him we have the map rod we have the map neverwood all the treasures all the adventures the the last pirate who used to own this ship was looking for the exact treasures that Barney was there's it's just so bad so sailing the treasure was our spaceship no all right no your thinking is small you're not understanding this there is adventure where the treasure is so big I can't explained it to you so massive it will change everything I just want to go home I don't want adventure you hear that that sounds like rain I'm gonna just say and hopefully captain I'm not overstepping my boundaries I want to take Nightwatch you're good you can do it make sure to stay warm come on cheer it up don't let it get into you Ross I promise cuz I feel partially responsible for what happened I promise you partially it's not my fault come on come on man don't go blaming this on me I know I know listen here listen here now's not the time to pointing a finger okay now is the time we regroup we readjust I'm gonna have me move forward I'm gonna do Nightwatch because I don't necessarily trust all the pirates on the ship yet and I don't know if we're gonna be attacked by some rival pirates in the middle of the night I don't know how you guys work so I'm gonna take knowledge you're right it's good we should still keep their eyes on these guys yeah they probably not like against so much right now all right Ross will visit you again soon okay I have some dinner for you all right dear the rot cheered up things is getting better things is getting better you two should go I'll take care of him all right okay I promised you this things were getting better I just got such an uneasy feeling about these guys hopefully they'll hopefully they'll be good I don't think they're the thing is they don't feel like they're gonna mutiny is the triumph what tight come here I was I was doing my job I mean do you want me it's okay yeah I'm not in trouble you're not in trouble okay I'm here something I must show you okay what is it can you can you tell me an hour this in here mm-hmm you're did is so good on the island what do you mean okay I meaning you're the reason rod still alive yeah he lose the leg and because of the red doctor he lose it too but if it wasn't for you rod would be dead I honestly I have no idea what came over me like it's as if it's as if I could like anticipate their moves or something I don't know it was it was weird it was weird I mean I used to I used to fence a little bit back in back in Britain more than fencing sky it's your blood your blood your bread like this okay you have a talent okay so here I need you to be my first hand what can you do this what about Jin the jinn is second his second guest his decision he doesn't know if he wants to be in this life or not he can making the decision of

yeah why no that's nice this is how you get reals flavor your food I'm gonna get you're gonna infuse it with the flavor of dirt what is this what are gonna do with this little sugar for a little spicy spicy little goodness there and then the dirts will infused with fan and it will seize my gods cheese okay so way you're gonna make a fondue all right it's gonna mix gods cheese extract special spring okay so fondue two minutes remaining Barney Barney whatever right you got it you got it you see finally I'm losing I'm losing time are you okay but the real problem to have right here is the toaster but whatever work I knew I should have left you with the lava it's a little bit switch to one sitting and then I bring it to another Center but one side is the other selling cuz it's too much all right and then when I try to put in between the cities it doesn't stay that way so once I rose because yes I won't be cook enough so I always keep trying to do it doesn't work I don't know and this would be perfect so I don't know what to do Jen um be honest I didn't understand a thing you said Jane listen listen here's what you got to do okay so if this is not going well the toasters not going well oh gosh I wonder if this is not going well the toasters not going well try putting it in the oven and tough 16 on each side doesn't matter you can make you can bake and you can flip them around you know oh my cell phone go back to your station oh gosh okay 30 30 seconds to make a dish okay wait a minute wait a min I have an idea - where are your seconds I think an autumn animation I think I know I'm gonna make and what is this abomination to be frank that sounds absolutely dreadful but the chef here is trying to say is don't knock it before you try it expected disgusting this dish is simply the bomb addiction you know I think it would have been better with some poultry and what is this repulsive mess what you have here is broiled steak with Brussels sprouts coconut curry chickpeas served with a blue cheese sauce there's also toast on the side oh my god Jim its dishes this is disgusting this toast is absolutely but how could you screw up such a simple dish get out of my kitchen

taught there and every time someone has tried to go and find it they have never come back so why are we going home we are going because it is the great adventure they treasure that know all the pirate is knowing of this but they don't know what it is so you telling me thousands of pirates know what this is they go there and they they don't come back well only the great pirate has the courage to actually going there so Hawaii have people have have people successfully done this before are we gonna are we gonna try and be the first we're going to be the first okay but here listen you're my first hand man okay I'm telling I'm here for you okay and I need you to convince the gin and rod because if you can tell them you're on board I know they will come you know we need to be honest I would go I would go to any island just to stretch my legs right now all right I when I agreed to be your right-hand man I agreed to be your right-hand man so okay you're up to this yeah I mean I actually kind of sounds exciting if you think about it yes okay so here one thing real quick this is a pirate clothes for the gin and rot kind of like the the clothes that you gave me exactly like that okay so what's going now and you give them that and you convince them hey we're going here it will be a good we can't do it hey guys how you feelin Ross he seems to be doing better than he was

Barney wants you guys to wear no no no this is out of the question dead man's cold what what is this place it sounds like a death trap no the gin it's it's okay dude sky has been making a great improvement with his Sabre you're already a good you know how things go together we can go here and get to this treasure that I wonder thank you my man to a place labeled dead man's Cove how many more people have to get injured or killed before your silly fantasies are satisfied it sounds exciting it sounds exciting it's dangerous it's a legendary treasure and we can be the first ones to grab it no this is silly this is silly I won't have any part of this does it the adventure spirit does it aren't you a sight for this no this is I'm sending my men to death these are all that I have left but I know I'm not gonna die me it's not sending them to death they're deciding to go on this adventure and together we can make it together we can find this treasure that no one has known before absolutely not I'm not a pirate this is ridiculous so you're just going to leave your men you're just going to leave them in not support them anyone you are not one of my men and you never will be yeah I'll go talk to him Jen Jen slow down Jin Jin listen we need you we need you this all seems ridiculous to me I I've already lost the entire ship full of men you're all I have left I can't send you on some dangerous suicide mission to a place called dead man's Cove but we're gonna go anyway why not come with us why not make sure that we're okay I really suppose there's no talking you people out of this is there unfortunately all right all right I'll go with you but only because I don't want to see anyone else get hurt thank you Thank You Jen we're here guys we're at that man's Cove good drop anchors

and you could get killed I can fight sir better than most give him a shot captain I never would have been your right hand if I wasn't given a chance to prove myself fine grab a sword your weight back I missed the feeling of sand between my toes this island is massive that means we have a lot of exploring you do you shouldn't wasting our time sitting here talking let's go the treasure is away though we made it we're here it's gonna be exciting come on come on Jin tell me that you're not excited okay I can admit this island is quite beautiful like a very least it's like paradise January excite there's still this treasure you've been going on about oh I gotta stretch my legs ah oh it's anybody want a pork chop does anybody want a pork chop I got I would love one please you go what's

this is dangerous everyone stay on your guard finding out where to go wow this maybe you noticed do you think maybe there's like locals on the island that might have been the cause of this guy's death the Moores most likely other pirates this folk never get along didn't keep yeah take your look around yes sir did you why you're not your hate the pirate so much my entire career fighting scum like pirates that's hard - am I the only one who fails that Keith guy is kind of a bit of a stiff well it seems to take orders pretty well we can at least trust him I hope yeah what it is Keith I see a bridge a bridge okay great Bridge where are you right over this way follow me please a bridge okay okay that means someone's definitely been here before that means that people have have lived here the

I'm allowed to be on the table fine teach me things teacher now the three most important parts of writing a story because anyone guess what they are can anyone guess what the first one is a little tap with the landed middle paw patrol letter yes but it's emotions no not that either - it's not spaces although those are all very important lines story the most important part is the beginning the beginning is what hooks your reader and gets them interested in what you have to say now what I want all of you guys to do is focus on writing a very interesting beginning to your stories something that's going to hook people and make them interested next year of the middle which is where all the fun stuff happens in your story and then the story we're not we're not reading we're not reading Michael ba ah it's raining we're not gonna we're not reading Michael Bay stories okay Ross so let me get this straight we need to have it we need to have a hook right like something that hooks people in right exactly okay so can I just write a story about fishing if there was something very very interesting that happened to the why is there so much Thunder it's frightening me I hate it plunder is not something to be afraid of we can learn about that in science class now to do is I want you all to write your own stories the stories have to be ten pages long and they're due at the end of class oh what a vending machine food there is what sky I think I'm the cause of this Thunder I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure I think I'm a thunder God does kind of ominous that's a very nice thought you have now the person under God worried will get their very own gold star the day no no but thank you for the Apple now I'll be at the staff lounge I'll be back in 30 minutes you have to have your story written by then I will see you after class but if I don't get that if I don't get that star I'm gonna use my Thunder powers on you I'm just saying I'm just saying this Dragon Ball Z supers gonna be so cool I I got I know I said ten but that's okay we can give partial credit all right this guy read your story first please all right for this one a baby story talked long ago in a distant land I aku the shape-shifting master of Darkness unleashed an unspeakable evil but a foolish samurai warrior we a magic sword stepped forth to oppose him before the final blow was struck I couch or portal in time and flung him into the future where aku's evil is law now the fool seeks to return to the past and undo the future that is aku back to the past back to the past say how about Jack what's ah back to the past back to the past same right Jack good I kind of like this you turn into a cartoon yeah but very good beginning and the middle was very very exciting yeah so yeah good job that's a good girl I'm gonna go put this later I'm gonna go I'm gonna go publish this know everybody else's stories okay why okay why JimBob would you like to go next okay mm-hmm I looked them in the eye and tightened my fists ready to engage him in combat my brow furrowed and the air grew heavy as we took step after step toward each other the anger welled up in my chest and I rushed in towards my opponent I can feel the tension back the blows shook him to his core his body shook with anger and bloodlust he looked back to me and brought his legs that far devastating kick to the head but it was swiftly dodged he moved to counter the pain slowed his movements and he stumbled back lacking the strength to stand he crumpled to his knees and fell to the ground he remained motionless asked and his body it seemed to be over my adversaries face and he stumbled back none will escape none will survive I will slave that was a very good story about what was it about oh it's about a man who will kill all ninjas because then just killed his family but he's a ninja himself Wow so he's kind of like a slayer of ninjas yeah samurai Slayer yeah yeah I like all right okay Ross would you like to read your story next my mine is called tales of Ross there's a nice super cool Ross Scott in his giant robot and began to battle the enemies who had defeated his younger brother Thunder click look at him and your brother are dead he'll always live on in heart Ross drew is flaming katana and began to fight with the power of 20 jars the fight is really really cool you're Ross yelled as he made the final finale strike John and a darn fell to the ground thunder click we'll never die as long as his statement the ground began to rumble a giant goat shaped Mac appeared holding a small chicken in his hand no wild bong beat bong Oh Parbat booting up let go of my brother yelled Ross the mecha let out a bunch of steam to be continued wow wow that was intense that was a very good story Ross old star for you as well yay that was Barney let's go on to your story that was dope he has got Mac in there I mean it was a very very good story Ross where did you learn to write like that I just I eat a lot of glue that's nice that does prove it I mean there's scientists have proven that you know if you eat glue then you become great at writing I don't think that's actually true I'm lying no it's not no I used to read the bottles and that's where I learned how to write oh okay Barney show me your book Oh show me your book fine you guys are gonna be surprised I actually wrote okay in to start walk the

Ross you see an opening I don't know I think we're trying to get to the very end that looks different right here and there's a ladder it's the it's the ivory tower oh my god hey oh my god do you feel

gonna take us like forever this place is huge why is this place so big let's find these he found one nah schools hides what does it mean Oslo's wait how does my face look beautiful I think these are all just in random spots dude this is gonna be a thing isn't it's gonna be a thing yeah all right hey think I think I found a second one nope I found a button nevermind that's it what what happened I pressed a button that said Ruby code why you give us night vision again what's happening why no I found a button that just said code what the heck is going on is this like a maze why are there so many mazes in this game how many Ruby cones do we need we needed four four do you have one already I have one this should give us the second maybe will we survive we'll find out in the next exciting episode of Dragon Ball Z but no yes here's the guys make sure to go check out Ross's channel in the description below part 2 will be chillin on his channel so make sure to go check out check out what happens next this is actually really exciting so I do recommend it well how will the conclusion unfold will we ever get another torch I I kind of want to know what happened like what is happening with us you know yes why are we in this guy's dreams it's weird but anyway thank you guys so much for watching I'm sky check out Ross's channel description below and I'll see you later recruits you 
so doctor could you tell us your name Ross Oh and what were you doing out here working what that you're working on in the world full of zombie work mostly you're a doctor right what kind of work with a doctor half after the world has already ended was your friend injured oh yeah I guess what does that would your friends have survived without a doctor patching her up oh I guess not so that why you're in this shitty nice neighborhood quiet plenty of tools to work with you know you're not really giving us any answers to our questions I don't recall being obligated to guys look a cottage you're fine Jess let's check it out I can't believe there's a cottage out in the middle of the forest that's really really deep to God I don't know it looks like nobody's been in here for a while look at all the Ivy on the sides hmm oh by the way uh by the way we Ross thank you for letting me take your candy bars from your office does house nice of you yeah you had a lot of candy bar why would I have that many I do have a sweet tooth you wait yeah sure there you go cool um so with our with our luck I don't even know if we should go in here I'm gonna be honest with you guys no god you're crazy we have to check this out but it's getting too dark we risk staying out here I mean let's let's just think all right in the past couple days we've almost been eaten uh okay yeah act by walkers no I've been pinned up into a cabin very similar to this and almost died yeah but remember dad three how many weapons we found there you other's true ever since Haworth - we don't have any frickin weapons and really you are end up I mean the thing is I thing is that the thing is we went to a place that had a bunker in it right it had a bunker in it with a bunch of weapons and hey at least you guys at leat what I'm trying to say is at least you guys had weapons before we went in so if anything was in there we could have fought it off now we have nothing we have not any but a pistol and you've only got like what two shots left after after that hospital you don't have any shots no I have like a tree hi whatever you check it out we got it checked it out okay you know welcome can if you have to shoot if we're gonna if we're gonna die might as well just I mean we've been lucky so far so well whoever's here is cooking a lot of food whoever's here is like gotta be a genius or something look at how many books are here right I know that could even revival mine bah I got crossbow we got a crossbow Oh Oh perfectly that is bad perfect uh hold on uh-oh this isn't even the right weight is this threat oh yes it is Oh perfect just you want this Senate yeah there you go I don't I don't necessarily need a gun I'll be I'll be all right with my with my bowie knife until we find it looks like a what but I found extra clip there you can take this one it's already full load perfect perfect ha ha I got a crossbow ah so uh I mean Ross you ice do you want this bowie knife then no it should be fine I I mean you would probably want to protect yourself though I think you should take it just in case just in case just take it yeah just your skating yeah yeah I mean haven't you been saving the jet yeah I mean if we wouldn't if we couldn't trust you then I don't know just take it stake all right but uh didn't you show us the good paint so it looked like this place up for a 1-person yeah I mean it looks like it looks kind of like a an old condo that I used to have back when I used to live in New York for everything or everything hit the fan but look at nice 1/2 in the middle of the forest like this wow that's pretty nice actually this is around good call telling us to go inside I mean it's a freakin bomb now so your guys find anything beside the crossroads pretty empty see I wonder why I wonder why he had a crossbow here though maybe maybe this guy has stayed here for a long time he knows better than to fire a gun oh but then where could the owner be yeah why wouldn't you take it with him uh-huh I have no idea that's I wonder that where he is you think you'll come back I hope not we have someone standing guard no no one I doubt it there's no one for miles uh hmm I don't know I think I'm I think I'm gonna stand guard just in case mm my calamus bed okay Oh Jett hahaha well she was she needs arresting she has the injury yeah I I agreed huh freakin well frankly thing here look you're wrong yeah let's just let's just keep looking around there's got to be something I mean you don't just have a condo out in the middle of nowhere with nothing in it I mean let's let's be realistic here all the cabinet is empty what hey I found something I'll give this lever a pole what do you suppose it goes only one way to find out right what why did it do that what what's going on I'm sorry was i interrupting something do you mind what's finding out later this chapters this go right behind you there's Walker's down here wah wah what the heck is this what did you know they're in like hot ages how they got him in there maybe maybe then how did they get them in here is it me what the heck well I mean we should probably should probably take him out right well you're either flipping him down god well I mean what they're in cages I mean they're like they're it happens right here huh what's that rock how long do you think they've been down here the upstairs was abandoned well I mean look at this one look look at this one this one looks like his body's been brought in for a while yeah rot good get good point bed how long you think that they can living crap gosh ha I'm not gonna just sit here what if they get out what if they get out the doors lock no one else agreed to killing it well what did you all let's keep this guy here no what are you talking about why are we a fight yeah I really get one Moo rot well I don't know why you're killing them because it's better to it's better to take them out than to have any kind of any kind of thing attacking us later wait this place looks weird like what is it and why are they here oh I just noticing this what are in these vials it's like something's being processed here it's like something someone was trying to do something here you know this looks like a some see a lab ball good yeah like it might almost like a live what the heck is this really what anyone is dead there's bunch Medical Supply in year there's tons of medical supplies what the heck there's handcuffs in here in splints what Vanka yeah I have no idea this handcuff here I've no idea but I should take one just in case I'm gonna take this other one out you got so bad with a gun right mazing shot there sorry I mean let's see you do better yeah there's like there's much bandage - there's scalpels and medical blades there's bone cutters in here what the heck hot why are there so many weird things in our cupboard do you think someone was doing something to them I have no idea this is yet what you're weird like when we were caged up wait a minute how do they get in there huh there's a book in here there's book there what's it saved God it's called Project zaxon Zack's am I saying that right Zack's in' looks like you sound familiar sounds like so as z za x en it's like it sounds like it's like a drug of some kind or something what what wants to say the inside this is a diary this is a dire day 98 all of a sudden specimen 48 fell motionless and was unresponsive to light or flesh I'm going to continue administering agents accent to specimen 49 whose specimen 49 there's there's more than there's more than three there's only three cages hmm what's it keep going keep going what's it day 99 it seems as though specimen 49 is accepting this axon well the brain still has control of all limbs unfortunately for 49 she has completely lost control of her own brain any time I walked to her cell what the heck any time I walked to her cell she lunges at me in hunger I also went out today and gathered my next subjects specimen 51 in specimen 52 their families suspected nothing and probably won't report them missing for at least a week what the heck what were these people wait wait wait what you're saying I think I think the I think that these were people like before they were before they were walkers I think there were people in cages well no no everybody's person before they they get bit no no no it makes sense why do you think there's so many medical supplies here so he is trying to help them maybe maybe it sounds like it it sounds like this person whoever was down here was trying to make a cure or something these families won't miss them that doesn't make sense let's I don't jet right but maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe it's like their families will miss them because there were already walkers or something we need to get you in any part state again all of a sudden specimen 48 fell motionless and was unresponsive to lighter flesh I'm going to continue administering wait wait okay I also went out today and gathered my next subjects specimen 51 so it's like he's gathering them he's picking up the subjects their families suspect with that their family suspected nothing let's just keep reading oh there's a torn out page there's one they 178 I what I have configured yeah I've configured the zaxon almost perfectly I'm seeing the full change take effect in a matter of what the heck both what it is what is what is it soon I will be able to attack soon I will be ready to release Saxon to the public what there is no hero there's another missing page day 193 am I ready oh wait I am I'm ready but is the world I'm going to leave specimen 74 75 and 76 so that I may find out how long they live without food that was it whoa that's all that's all that was there but I wonder if that was those three that you guys just killed yeah whoever was here was making walkers what whoever was here was making walkers no what if zaxon is the virus oh my oh my sounds like it's like like this what if zaxon what does axon is the virus that that creates Walker's but you're going you're saying it someone is create the Walker somebody created walkers in this cabin uh-huh and then release them to the public this is where it start what oh my god geez what's here who's with you we gotta hit this we we should make sure that this whatever was here isn't hasn't been here for any time do you mean it did look abandoned but they could put this thing on there so there's four of us and only one of them are hopefully one of them yeah but Jake if this person is made new to Walker my bill if they're making them they have to somehow we need to we need to move we need to move we should keep heading to DC okay we should get out of here I'm gonna keep this book with us okay keep that we have to showing that to them do do thanks right now it looks like we were never here they come back I mean they're gonna find out if they go down there the frickin walkers are dead we need actually move oh no we need to keep moving off let's go let's go back what the heck we found who we found the Creator what we need to we need to keep moving let's keep moving whoa now that was crazy what who owns this cabin do we find the cure did we find whoever created it we don't know we don't know anything about this cabin as always guys thank you so much for watching this episode if you haven't share with your mother share with your father share with your

on with our school board honestly yeah what's going on with this guy right no my feelings man I've done nothing no bullying policy in this school please yeah yeah about the not killing policy I haven't killed anybody I haven't done anything you ask sorry Wow gosh Wow she's a very okay these are very spirit science desks okay I'm sorry I am NOT I'm walking on Ross's desk sorry sorry sorry for you today so we're gonna be learning about my mom says I'm OD auntie John oh my I think this will be fun some I think it's inappropriate to teach kids about explosive devices but I say this is the best science class ever yeah explosion well first I have to teach you the basics so first we will learn that these naturally occurring mobs creepers are very similar to TNT oh they're so new I love these these are so cool I like this thing okay sorry he's sensitive why do they look so sad teacher what's the anatomical reason that they look so sad I used to pick word hey I used a big word praise me oh here you can have a star on your desk cool she's got a new point system doesn't even make sense oh you tried to steal it didn't work out so well did it no no your yeah I'll take a cookie actually you guys not stars you have to be a man listen to the rules okay gin gin don't hit the creeper don't don't do that stop that Jeff so to learn the basics of TNT we are going to have to move into the lab and I will show you and demonstrate to you firsthand how to craft your own why is Johnny said yeah I don't know why he said why does he look so sad this is a more important question than learning about TNT right now oh look it's not worthy it's like anywhere you say how did you fit 28 steaks in your pocket broken oh sorry I got this well this is unfortunate you don't get a star okay so this is the lab this is a very nice place what is this thing do what does this do that is a lettuce put beakers of chemicals hey what are you doing okay you don't suppose that those are highly toxic chemicals I think you do nothing you have to send you to the nurse it's very apparent it's very apparent ways I just like this now I guess a band-aid is fine nice so I'm gonna you guys how to craft your own explosive hold up hold up wait I have a question about his band-aid is it Dora the explora band-aid no it's Ironman hey my feelers make your own tnt boy I would actually love is very simple all you need is gunpowder and sand okay where do you find gunpowder you are in the wild you'd have to kill your own creepers but here we have our own supply some what is this Jen what did you do what is that that's neat that was a cool thing I like that that is not how this is supposed to go i-i-i-i made a little bit of a mistake I will I will take I will take I'll take my the nurse is freaking good at everything she totally takes and and gunpowder okay why would you put these in here if we're not supposed to use them look look at this doesn't this look fancy this looks fancy I love this this is not safe for students to working it's not you don't use cobweb for tea and tea please refer to the diagram on the board oh but I put a cobweb here it doesn't make you explosion okay so let's I got an idea I got an idea so all I need to put cookie oh here we go I got this oh my god I'm a genius I'm a genius when do I get my scholarship I'm just a WoW I'm great what are you doing we need a lever why is there no levers oh I need a this is tea we don't need levers I don't need egg ok I'm not breaking the classroom sorry but look look at this teacher this is important okay you are about to make me an honor student okay all right wait I call it hmm pushy piston hope it didn't do anything well yeah this is why this is my science fair this is oh there we go BuChE BuChE help me boogie boogie boogie boogie boogie don't get back on for the science fair Wow Wow I mean I've come up with groundbreaking look Wow teacher looking what I made oh good job Jin you created me this is ground hey get off my I made that no okay wait wait wait okay we do with it wow that was holy crap I didn't even know about this library wow I think I think you should be actually thinking gin because now we know about this library this is why we have budget cuts we have to pay to fix that wall now I mean we're not gonna see you next time probably not it cost my job but you know what we're learning it's fine okay stop learning I don't wanna learn I don't want to learn anymore learn what is the safe environment in which we can use this I'm scared Jin why are you blowing things up outside where you can't destroy the classrooms anymore oh man man they're gonna fire you God people who blow things up are crazy wow this is all your fault okie-dokie on powder is this it over here please follow me to the football track yeah you remember this field where you chase this around with it fired I still don't know what you're talking about here hold okay you can't tell me you forgot to date Wow what the farts I've created I'm pretty sure I mean I'm gonna be honest I don't even know what our school is called this looks like it says the fart 5 awesome I love that that's great however I have created a safe environment to demonstrate the TNT please stand back Jin back up Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin one more time Barney look at that that's cool whoa wow you're a quick teacher Wow teacher your mother so there there is such a ting this stuff without destroying everything happy and he works now I'm trusting you guys to be responsible I'm gonna give you each a you don't have a setup our TNT in this safe environment please I never figured out how to stop that okay sod lost my TNT can I have like another right there you go no I got there you go buddy I'm gonna ask you to be responsible with your flint and steel Oh light in the presence of another student okay I will not do that that's that's for calling me a pyromaniac si si yeah how does it feel how does it feel now that I'm actually doing it yeah now that I'm actually doing it yeah Punk have you've done anything I did this for the first time ever and that's because you're a big wiener yeah we have to be responsible if you want to ever do anything in the sacrifice how about him ed him he set me on fire teach it you then seen it no actually I was looking the other way I didn't see anything I was really hoping the nurse can't fixed you why do you hate me so much man all right so I'm gonna be honest yeah I did set you on fire but you know the truth the truth yeah well I learned my lesson everybody

there's only two trials left deal your mind in a start with dictum to continue forth a test of wisdom Oh wisedom test I really fighting I don't want more color as a maiden tweak'd time was not when I began through the garden I was sneaked I alone am the fall of man what does that mean it's gibberish we I'm so confused maybe there's something maybe there's something back here that'll tell us but if it's if it's wisdom there's no way that it would know this is definitely a riddle its speaking no it's it's there's no way maybe maybe the garden being like the garden of like Eden herbs wait I think I have it colored as a maiden tweet the color red of a maidens flushed face that the rosy cheeks I'm was not when I began so a creation of God through the garden I was sneak through the through the Garden of Eden I alone in the fall of man which caused Adam and Eve to be expelled from the Garden of Eden it's the apple of Eden why what how did you know that I just I put them together and it just Shambu it seemed so clear Jen you're a genius let's go never seen anything like this before what there were only two trials though this is amazing look at this place why are there yeah there's a lot of skeletons maybe maybe you feel like fail the third test you wind up like these guys how they made it this far nearly run the treasures length a final test of strength what does that mean that means what is this skeleton they must be defending the treasure ah ha I haven't had a good fight in weeks this is not what I signed up for you never see the skeleton monster in Britain have you dad handbook well I don't have any plans I'll becoming one of them you're right no backing down let's take it to them trying to keep up but I need to get my back do that listen to me you're Irish and nothing is gonna put you down but I'll fight I can see it just let it out I won't let anything happen all right just do it Ross pick up your sword I'm not gonna stand by and let this happen anymore what hi nobody hurts my crew so you got tired of eating pretty lanky you're a pirate now it's certainly the fight better than one let me show you how a commander fight just try to keep up captain over here why don't you try fight Gavin boy good job guys I think we did it yeah did whoa what what's going on I can I can feel my toes again my legs hey that's great oh man Ross Oh where's the I of Clarence well that's kind of disturb magic magic really exists what do you see Barney what does the I show you I see treasures Judge this room all of us treasures waiting for us to take a death sentence with this we can get more than enough to repay the British government we can go home alright then what business they are there I have information about a crew of traitors who stole a ship of spices from the crown led by captain gin and the pirate legend Barney you 
oh do you know what you did to my friend haha look that sky what and ourselves this island whoa make sure he doesn't move make sure he doesn't move I'm checking up on me do not move on me Jin how is he doing seems to be doing better Ross how are you feeling still missing a leg yeah yeah that's not much we can do about that but as long as you're feeling better that's all that matters oh is this better is oh good I was beyond a close call that was way too close haha you really got their blood pumping here captain pirate captain of nothing now ha are you gonna say anything huh you lay one you killed my men may I - you're next Barney what should we do with them I say that I cut his head off right here wait Barney as in the legendary pirate Barney who disappeared no no he's what she's not knowing where they say watch Barney the legendary pirate who sailed the seven seas and pillaged British spice trading ships for ages 1 5 years ago he's not knowing what he said what does she mean knowledge he's not understanding it he was his man he's crazy Oh pirate you can't I never would have thought the infamous Barney would be oh ship West Island okay what does he mean Barney back off back up back up what does he mean what does he mean are you really a pirate's all that Barney tell them about your pirate past okay all right I put I lose my swirly okay all right looks like I can't run away from this I'm a pirate I'm a pirate I was going to take over your ship and I was going to steal all your good you want is a scum I should cut you down where you stand hey you're the one our ship crash no I can't do anything I bet this was your doing you sabotage the ship hey did you know that if I wasn't here everyone would not be in the same situation probably we wouldn't be on this island feel so crappy this whole time and you're a pirate a pirate took Ross's leg what makes you any different hey doesn't meaning that I'm the same same kind of guy that is you're a pirate to me okay who helped you kill those three men there and go back to helping Skye say rod who was that that was me he does have a point I don't like it but I guess we can trust him more than the others at the very least can we trusting me a little bit can we he's probably gonna stay has nothing all along you've had nothing good to say about any of us this entire time all right cabin boy now he's losing his life so I don't feel as angry towards him but still you can't trust me I'm here I help you we can trust a pirate how do we know this isn't even you how do we know this isn't your Island you know them who you really are how do we know this isn't even you're not even part of his crew is he part of your crew he's our prisoner we do not execute prisoners he's not prisoner he's our ticket out of here even as it may we will still need him you what is your name oh you're played a silent game now fine whatever here's the thing we take him back to his ship we tell his men look you're either follow us no no no is he one of your men or not is he one of your men or not I would never have someone like Barney and my crew I was on your ship well it's confuse it's convenient that you knew everything about this little area huh that you knew exactly this is a freaking pirate's den it's amazing that you knew this was a pirate's Island huh maybe this is your Island maybe you've been here before that's all you know how pirates work - they betray and they kill why you're not up why are there so many why are there so many dead people on this on this island were pirates what do you expect I've been fighting for territory what should we do what should we do look here's the group not live you knows how to get out of here but I can get us out of here what we have kill us once we're out of here you might need our help will you know I will you look here's the way out pirates work like this if we take over as captain of their ship the crew will following us after mostly max my soldiers don't follow us if they'll follow us if we use you as a hostage look yeah you think I threw a ball for that yeah I do and if he is some kind of legendary pirate I have a feeling they'll follow him more than they will you my crew would never follow the likes of Barney it's very clear that he's lost what's he had oh really oh really you think you think that he comes back he comes back to your ship he comes back to your ship having defeated you and your best men is he still a legend or not I think that he still is I think that your men will follow him your talk idea is out of the question we are soldiers not pirates we're not living the life of outlaws please didn't hear what else are we gonna do captain if we look we've already killed people we have blood on our hands to board their ship is pirates then there's no way out of here probably a million better ideas than becoming a pirate like look you lose your look you can already have your penguin it'll lose my leg oh yeah let me just go lose another leg take my arms while you're at it so what are we doing so madly what we need to take him with us I don't like this idea but we have to at least work with what we're given for the time being but the moment we're able to we were securing a British ship and we are going home there's no British ship near so first ship is we're securing that ship so we have to my ship yes your ship what are you gonna do about it you're tied up let's stop calling it your ship right now because this our ship at this moment they're mad wrong there's a difference between being mad and being confident I think that we can take it all right bring them to the dinghy let's go follow them it's entertaining that you think you'll come out of this alive shut up just being honest you won't be escaping in one piece Cavan droid here has already made sure close your mouth dirt we're here everyone prepare the board it would sold these things no sudden moves you'd have your captain hostage listen to us and he might not get hurt I can't believe this you call yourselves men kill them stand down he's not your captain anymore you don't need to do as he says whoa so we take orders from you now if you follow under my command I will get you all back team black and a royal pardon I and maybe I'll get me a fancy posh wig for me bottom this is not a joke oh so sorry they're kissing but you ain't no captain of mine that's enough you pathetic sensitive worm bang you want to roll them join me again exactly we're bait you are to losing your head for this flight back you're calling yourself pirate I've seen a dead man be more like about them than you you don't need a name captain to telling you what to do you're a pirate what is this let me go to sit down what does prisoner want riches and glory treasure and adventures you want getting it from this ridiculous party that is an order put it down I am your captain not anymore you

come to Guinea see if you'll cough up some change well guess what buddy I'm not having it Vinnie we told you I don't have any money Vinnie listen we've been cursed we need your help why didn't you say so now you're speaking my language so what do you think we should do Vinnie let's start with the basics why am i curse who would curse me did I brush my teeth this morning where did I put my keys I wonder of my ex still thinks about me definitely sir like to rot but more importantly how do I get to the bottom of this in order to reverse the curse you have to stop it at its source so in order to stop the curse we need to find out who cursed us yeah your dingus that's what I just said how about you use your ears you 
or green slap a deaf kid alright hey guys Skye here I'm with down dummy you're not that guy party your gin whop my voice is back I'm here with Jim Bob bras and just have a little bit of aggression that I'm feeling right now oh there we go oh yeah you know just after writing all those would you rather but welcome back guys to would you rather and before this video starts guys thank you so much for all the support you guys been showing this channel and the series and if you guys want more make sure to slap that like button and comment down below your would you rather yeah so would you rather pretty simple concept first person three points wins in order to get points you have to guess what you think everybody else is going to say so for example if I were to grab something out of the green chest and say would you rather green eat a sandwich or would you rather red eat a big old pile of poop everybody of course would pick the poop because it means just delicious absolutely did no yeah yeah if I turn around and then everybody has selected red then I get a points and first person three points wins so Jordan you want to go first sure I can do that now are you guys gonna answer truthfully are you gonna answer like really contrary oh I will answer 100% truthfully that's a lie yes my entire life so should I grab should I read the green when I take it out yes which I have the green would you rather bathe only using toilet water isn't that kind of what you're already doing though I mean most water like I think toilet we are Twila waters already just tap water it's take a bath Corp razor blade your eyelids so anytime you blink you got your eyes oh god wow that's an old one - OH I'm gonna I'm gonna hope that you answer truthfully because I must rather just take a bath honestly seriously you know it's fine I'm sorry but I'll even eat it it's pointy yes yes I metals that way you can't change the system now Jen get out get out of here Jen all right would you rather Green get struck by lightning while on fire inside of a giant micro okay who wrote this I mean G okay Jordan do you live it's lightning while on fire inside of a giant microwave because that'd be a cool story but you know or change your gender every time you sneeze that's actually I don't know I'm I'm gonna go ahead and say I would much rather change my gender any time I sneeze yeah then I can induce sneezing and turn back but oh my god but I do have this horrible habit of like every once a month I have this sneezing fit that lasts like 30 minutes oh I have a very pressing question which is do you own a house I mean do you really want to get into the technicalities because it's kind of an apartment and I don't own it what really makes a house I mean I'm a grouch I wonder if he owns the the trash can or rinse it all right would you rather green be forced to spend a month inside of an elevator no internet no comma outside world but you get food and water or bread so like solitary confinement okay we're red sing when you speak five ever well honestly I'd much rather before the elevator that's that's actually tough because what if he was really good at singing and made it like a career I feel like my choice almost all of your friends cuz it just gets sick and tired no matter how great of a singer you are my good to chicken tired of it really no points I mean I realized how bad about yeah singer I was just yeah come on sing some sing some beautiful songs oh okay I'm nice cream let it go don't do it craziest would you rather green any pain new experience never fades or lessons it stays with you for your entire life Oh what does that even work okay eventually by the time you're like 50 your whole body's gonna hurt all the time or will it rather red and this is from a viewer Chris Talia Lee help Ross threw chicken labor as Ross's husband I feel like this is an inside joke Wow chicken labor basically excruciating pain for the rest of your entire history of life dude if you broke one bone in your life that would suck oh just imagine you bump your head into a door and that's it forever oh my god you stub your toe on the corner of the bed okay whoever wrote this come on all right all right looks like it's me again also before we before we finish going on to the next person I want to say the the map is actually in the description now so you guys can play would you rather with your friends so go do that go check that out and you'll be anyway would you rather the other one green eat a pound the sea salt all right I mean the sodium in takes a little bit high for that day but whatever you died already you would not died come kidney failure can you want it and then like what it is sea salt its lender hey this is actually pretty comparable blend up Barney's eyepatch and Underpants into a smoothie both eating things oh god I feel like I'm not gonna get a point on this one trick question because you'd only get an iPad you know if if sea salt like did kill you I'd rather die okay have you guys all voted I'm yeah Jordan you need to remember one thing all right bananas make bananas make any smoothie unanimous amazing let's see would you rather Lee relive the worst day of your life for all eternity wow that's so groundhogs David like awful yeah you don't get to learn it was a bad day for him at first did you like could you like learn to avoid those bad things that's what I feel I would imagine like if you kept her living and you knew it was a bad day you get really used to it and just be like yeah I'll ignore it and just go and do other stuff how many times can one person time oh my god dude Jane why you have to make it so dark alright and then would you rather all the conversations you have any time you tell a joke nobody understands it oh my god that's so uncomfortable that's basically awesome thank you I'm gonna go with what I'm gonna go with alright so yeah I'm gonna say this but the thing is let me justify this other one have you ever had one of those times when you told the joke to someone they didn't understand it so then you went into the more of the joke and that would happen every single time you talk to someone that was you look I feel like that happens every time I show YouTube video to someone I'm like no no no but it's really funny I promise Oh everyone voted against you well we will Nets rather just be awkward than relive the worst moment I picked I picked this one yeah that was relive the worst day of your life for the rest of eternity ah dang any chance of me winning and I was totally on the same page with you guys I'm like yeah and then I should pick the wrong thing green no I'm gonna read read first there's a reason red and I'm saying red and this is a viewer comment from Haley one two eight three have the voice of the opposite gender or green slap a deaf kid so green dude why did this come back to Sri emerged I mean at least you'll never hear it coming eat a bowl of ghost pepper cereal ghost chilies and milk okay from a fan alley good Rick B five nights at freddy jumpscare every time you sleep and wake up is this a one-time thing with the Chili Bowl I think five nights at Freddy's as you're falling asleep you get jumpscared and then you wake up and you get immediately jumps yeah how do you how do you fall asleep in the first place if you get jumpscared I mean I feel like maybe it's like as you lay down to go to bed you get jumpscared and then maybe you're good for the rest of the night feel like we're over analyzing what's gonna be with my very very large advantage in going first with no tiebreaks you rather green have to teach a weekly twerking class I mean would that be a bad thing necessarily I mean glutes or red rewatch your worst YouTube video on loop for ten years probably already exists and that was from a viewer named Serena Cooke so at least it exists for ten hours I'm sure wait for ten years Oh years well you said ten hours it's like all right am i good to vote we're waiting on a Don I've got to pick this first off I hate twerking I hate that it's a thing teaching it would probably be even worse because then I'd have people coming up into my face like it's just how I do it right watch a year for 10 years you literally waste 10 years of your entire life did it do anything else or is it just like on I'm think you're just watching for 10 years okay imagine you sit there you would rather just waste 10 years of your life my worst video was my first video that was a stop Oh same here and that I did on Garry's Mod which had no sound and it was only like six seconds long so come on it can't be your worst video if you weren't in there like no one can actually attribute embarrassment to you my first video it's just like really awkward and bad I think my first video I had a roommate as a chicken and I like invited him into my my Minecraft home and like he played 100% fair gin you were just lady beat yes it's like he had an advantage though I can't never realize that though I don't think this was a game that was meant to be played competitively oh do you wanna go man MLG competitive would you rather but anyway guys that was would you

honey are you sure this is even the right way I thinking so hmm that's not very convincing I can't stop thinking about what we saw dude I know I just wanted to get it far away from that as possible I mean once we get to DC dude like everything's gonna be okay we're gonna we're gonna see Nick we're gonna see ghetto we're gonna see all these people that you think or at least you said are like pretty much snow you're sorry yeah they're good they're good I can't waiting to see them I just like ah Barney said stop rushing ahead dude like  I so nervous though because nervous why are you why you running in the middle of a forest what if you walk into a walker dude god you're not knowing this I got crossbow yeah you got a crossbow it doesn't change the fact that you brought you freaking you freaking froze up when we were near the frickin Haworth dude come on you can't why I need for dad no what what he froze up like I don't know he he just wasn't himself what yeah yeah they capture you it was bad situation I can't it wasn't good it's it's not it's not like it's a big huge deal it's just I mean I understand that you were scared but I've never seen you like that it it just worries me because what important another situation like that I just I it's it's not necessarily that he froze up don't don't you're getting it wrong it's not necessarily that he froze up I know it he was just gosh yet he was just a little scared I mean yeah we did get you and we got you hey I still have another one of your candy bars you want it sure you can hold on to it if you want it or I don't really I don't really need it you're really quiet too yeah I mean what am I supposed to say it sounds like you got scared at the sight of cannibals hey you weren't even there you can't speaking on this subject if they get in the lab so you comment that I don't speak and now you want me to speak okay guys stop stop oh my word he he came with he came with us to help get oh it's he's not he's not to talk to us if he doesn't want to talk to us I mean if he wants to do his own thing let him do his own thing you know she know what is very disturbing is the fact that he is following me and looking behind me this entire time maybe that's why he's quiet he's literally just he's literally just a doctor following yeah well yeah he's trusting your sense of direction let's just keep moving hey wait a minute is the zaxon what's caused all of this oh my god it's completely abandoned it's all gone God oh god I hope Nick and his friends are ok how are we supposed to find them in this wreck Hey I don't know hug but we're having to try we have to try you're right we've come all this way we aren't leaving without them you don't plan on searching the whole city do you we don't have many options left why do you ask we may have rained you time isn't necessarily on our side here gator needs this treatment and fast the talk is right who knows how much time ghetto has left we better get moving get get right there's no points to just eating around all right DC what does the world come to don't worry God finding Nick gether a.k and sharks and everything's will be buried Ross do you remember which way they said that we're gonna go in DC I told them to go to DC and they went to DC oh that's convenient okay what direction did you just say go to DC and then they just went to DC to find the CDC I don't even I don't even know what that is so I'm just gonna go ahead and say let's just keep looking around they went to go replicate the formula I gave to ghetto to stop him from turning into a walker but okay they're gonna be CDC then who's getting a little bit uneasy how come there's no one here oh really this dark empty City what's to be uneasy about well I mean I'm just saying the last time we went to an empty city we almost got eaten Hey yeah well I mean you were sitting in a random Hospital like of course you're gonna randomly almost get shot what if we were abandoned then you would be dead probably to the walkers no knocking saying a weird life yes right he's just a he's just an introvert scientists are like that they're just there's a walker over here what's it Oh looks like it's not abandoned yeah hey hey what what keep it down we're not knowing how many walkers you there's nobody here I have Cosmo okay until we know everything situation I get the killing okay you just want to pick them off man you want to show your manliness again well you also work group to keep quiet yeah that was true that is true how am I am I the only one who's like kind of sad like I don't know about you guys when I was when I was younger I visited this place when I was a kid with my parents and the fact that like everything's boarded up and pretty much destroyed just kind of hits home you know well well I know a lot has changed but really what you expect I don't know I mean when everybody was talking about DC I was hoping maybe salvation maybe this place would be still intact I don't know I was hoping for something real Nikki dark inky give us well I don't see them all right just everybody be a little bit careful though I mean if there are walkers and we don't want to be caught off guard you can't catch the body off-guard cetera it's at the monument man it's it's destroyed it's gone it's kind of beautiful in a sad way yeah kind of like nature's taking back its planet you know nature overcomed it yeah I don't know everything there I feel I feel weird I feel like I know our once-great center city of our entire united states is just gone it's just it's making me lose hope you know don't feel that way this is supposed to be like one of the most important places in our country and it's gone hey go just write those what about everything else it is what it is we can't changing the situation you're annoying this already we haven't seen this cheap lies place in how long we'll know that you can't expecting somebody a friend let's just keep looking whatever it's it's weird though it looks like it looks like this place has been like a battlefield of some kind you know there's there's sandbags there's barbed wire it looks like it looks like stuff went down here and where Walker is normally there's a walkers for the in the city morning maybe there are people here I think we need to be careful yeah Elihu I love the Nick here you're thinking someone else well I mean look at it look at it this way I mean last time we were in Hayworth the entire place was abandoned we thought right through I think we should be on guard actually you know what yeah no okay so I was checking the I was checking the tops of the buildings to make sure nobody was nobody was scoping us good you're just getting paranoid what's in these dresses look no way boys what for why are there guns no who are you he's right there's no ammo huh what they have an m4 Oh perfect oh this is perfect should we use all the ammo they don't we can't use this no ammo but we'll probably find him I mean if there's guns there's got to be animals somewhere you know there might actually be ammo in here do you want to you're careful hold on you should probably okay it's good I'm not climbing all the way up there I'm afraid of heights it doesn't even look like we can it looks like the stairs are broken what happened here like stairs up Wow there's an no way there's an mp5k what oh this gun but no ammo it's the torture I mean that would be I'd be good to keep with you Barney honestly there's more pain in med packs in here perfect perfect you grab those stock up on whatever we can find guys morphine would be great for your leg I'm gonna keep that okay guys we need to keep moving it's it's it's like I don't even know what time it is but if we're gonna find shark in an aka and and Nick and everybody then we should definitely keep moving wait wait how was building I mean I'm gonna just see if I was Nick I would head towards the I'll head towards the white house no there go the CDC I'm pretty sure the CDC would be located at the white house it might be I mean do you know how many corridors the White House has it's amazing it's probably it's probably got like underground bunkers in there man wait a minute look outside there's fires which means which means people are probably still here I mean they would have they would have gone out by now right or things would have burned down these these look relatively new but that's not a good sign for us it's not a bad sign either maybe Nick and everybody's here and they light a fire everywhere that's not like them I mean it would draw attention of walkers and other people like bandits should we go or should we stay no that's the worst why are we even fighting about it oh I'll go pick them off man if we fight like you said if we fire a gun everything every we're gonna alert every single person here okay okay going he's go behind the tree yeah I'll be right behind you daddy you know it's you know it's kind of funny I never got to uh I don't think any of us ever have to actually go behind the defense at the white house you know what we should do we should sit at the presidential chair you can't taking my picture what camera exactly okay you just ruin my dream okay all right we should probably keep moving I think I've got a good feeling you know I'm pretty optimistic what I'm good everything here though there is fire everywhere yeah you know you just completely killed my optimism well looking there's like explosion to ground what is this what the heck is this this look like a building that was destroyed it's like completely

so should we go in of course that we should go in God this this where the Nick shark Achilles is that we should know about it it doesn't look like anybody's been here for forever this IV everywhere oh there he goes yeah I just like a lazy jet we've come this far already care how to walk back no we're not gonna turn around walk back but we're not gonna just head into everything there's that blood it's straw it doesn't matter we should still be careful how do you tell them we're just looking at it because it's not losing good point this is uh weird it looks like this place was a battleground like their life standing here are you guys sure we're even gonna find the bunker in here this matter I mean you what are we gonna find a bunker in here are we just going into a lost cause because this place looks this place looks really sketchy and I don't want to risk my people you're looking for shark ghetto a K and Nick correct yes yeah I told them sorry about the CDC's less protocol was to head to the White House okay if they're here somewhere then they're here they could be anywhere in this place this place is massive and it's underground tunnels and stuff haha but that might be where they are it makes sense like did you bonk ooh how how we're going in this place so big how we're gonna find them I have I have no idea but look at this place there's like Ivy everywhere nobody's been in here for forever there's dried blood there's crap everywhere and then there's there's Ivy everywhere I mean has anybody even been in here I this just doesn't look like it uh-huh we're never gonna find a bunker in here man there's no way out and the hallways split up there's huge holes huge always going to different directions whoa okay here's the deal we're having to split up what God always goes perfectly God jinxed it doc we're split up for the more ground we can figure out where they Nick shark okay is that okay okay what you're with jet well what why why why we never separate why am i why am I going only with Jess I'm sorry just no offense we need the two power player on the either group we can't putting us one team and then have the weak team with the jet and Doc sleep well the weak team all right come to pee are you saying broken Jenny the hayward you're the one got kidnapped and then you're the one almost got okay okay stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop what hey hey hey hey let's agree that nobody's on any kind of weak team but Barney I do agree with you me and Barney heavy ever since Haworth we've uh we've had more combat experience so I guess that's where you're trying to come from but we're not we're not more more powerful or anything they were just little I've I've never shot a gun oh yeah so doc you're with me you're with me for sure okay just go this way God jet go that way eight be careful okay you too man okay all right well just let's get going then you uh I just can't believe Barney saying that about me I'm not I mean I know got my leg shot and everything but still doesn't he know that a gun is faster than a crossbow yeah but a crossbows silent I'm out of water do Oh you need some water here I have those it's okay I don't I don't need any what's up are you sure yeah no no I'm not really thirsty right now I mean Barney he doesn't he doesn't mean that like he's just Barney he's just just like that I don't he doesn't mean you're weak at all he's just I think he's just trying to look after you that's all I understand and I guess he doesn't want me going with the doc because honestly we just met him and if anyone that I was gonna pair off with it wouldn't be the doc personally boys honestly I've already sense the tension between you guys like hmm it's weird cuz Hawaii what is what is your beef with him honestly I just don't know something about the way he something about the way he acts just really uh-huh just gets under my skin a little bit but at the same time I respect him for his medical knowledge but at the same time it's like I don't know something just rubs me wrong don't you go the same way not not really I mean really I I understand where you're coming from like you've been pretty shaken up since Haworth honestly I I have trouble trusting anyone after what happened but uh it just doesn't seem logical that he'd be out to do anything nasty I mean think about it this way we found the guy put him at gunpoint and then he still patched us up like he patched something and so far he's been nothing but help like he's told us exactly where to go and he lists it off everyone that we're looking for by name what's this I thought it was something it's nothing looks like a little mini garden that's TV it is but sorry I'm just looking for like anything like dude we should really just check all these rooms all the paintings like every bookshelf I'm sure that they hid like the bunker somewhere yeah you think you don't think the bunker would just be out in the open for anybody who's trying to look for it I feel like I feel like you're isn't if it's a place for survivors to go should be out in the open right true but then again if it was out in the open what what's wrong you know what you know what's kind of I used to have one of these and that cost like so many of my paychecks to save up for and then the White House has four of them in one room come on I mean it is the White House they have those tax dollars you know what I mean ha ha this is a this is a write-off we need right here please yeah exactly but now the zombies can enjoy it I guess maybe they're gonna watch like a what would a zombie watch Li Kardashians or something ha ha ha ha Wow I'm just kidding I'm just kidding ah I get it I get it though you know I kind of it's gonna be funny to say this but I don't mind watching them right now if I had a choice between this and that oh yeah definitely did you notice that these paintings are like really really expensive like it's amazing how overtime like if things fall apart we still have art like this that's just warm it's crazy where'd you go oh I'm over here I'm over here oh ok where are you ok huh ok don't split up don't split up like that oh yeah sorry about that I just got you and big ambitious ha ha still not doing so good mmm no oh God I feel like there's so much dust in here a lot of books of course there would be dust in the book room yeah yeah wait what yeah go check up there maybe there's like a secret lover or something I really don't think it's gonna be like that dang it this is this is hopeless we're looking for nothing we're taking the word of some guy who no but then again he did know he didn't know everybody's name he did but is that a good thing I mean I mean don't give up hope Adam you have to you have to think about it this way I mean we're just only searching 1/2 the doc in and Barney are searching the other half so maybe if we don't find it then they will hopefully they what well what a mess we've done what if they find it how are they even gonna tell us um uh actually know what that Barney he'd probably just dream ha ha yeah and then we'd attract all the walkers in the entire DC area is this there's nothing here anything is such a waste of time wait wait wait wait wait no what never mind ah thing it's nothing I thought I saw this shift a little bit and I don't know why I thought there was something here yeah this is this is annoying hey you should take these books yeah what you should take this uh you should take this night staking case hmm guess I need someone to back me up no I need this I don't have any late I don't have anything that's silent except for I mean my fists silent killer huh ha ha ha ha ha exactly hey what is this looks interesting should we should we go down I mean it looks kind of sketchy um does it smell any different I mean um does it smell like dead I mean it smells like smells like a well what am I supposed to be smelling I don't know it just knows no it doesn't smell like that all right Lenny iron here just just take your time go down slow and I got your back I have this night dick so I wanted all too much attention though I don't think we're gonna run into anything since nothing Sasha too much the miracle is completely changing here mmm ok this is getting kind of ah okay this is getting kind of weird make it slow and be careful I'm I have my gun drawn mm-hmm boom what the honey things I don't know what this is what huh what the heck is this there's like money everywhere wait a minute why do you think anyone's in there it can't hurt to ask hello anybody in there hey anybody in there quiet how would this everybody rise I think I hear Nick Nick Nick is that you yes is that you sky I think we found Nick oh thank god you guys hang on I'll get the door open I don't thinking we can get through this way end of the line it would seem then maybe we should go back and they join the others I have a bad feelings here chess it really is you how did you find us a doctor told us he saw you guys and and that ghetto got bit wait who's this and where's Barney oh this is goat Barney failed to mention that he's an actual person and not a goat come on and get in here you're letting a drive through then we could talk about who these golden oh hey everybody come on in there's plenty of room so if this is go hey man my name is sky okay so if this is sky where's Barney we did know where the bunker was so we split up to cover more ground so you guys let Barney alone who's watching his back then no he's with the doctor that's how we knew to head here the doctor is here great he could make me some more left for me leg doctor hold on this doctor what did he look like I facing different directions gray he's a genius he made a formula that saved ghetto although he is kinda weird he's always sounding tired and really just disheartened about everything how long have you been traveling with him bad feelings are usually branded with weakness and fear ah what that was a dose of medicine oh it's been hard to keep track of the days probably about a week why this is bad your friend is not safe what's going on I know this person this dr. Ross right he was my mentor I studied under him but he grew obsessed with changing modifying his patients became steeped and experimenting on innocent people are you sure we're talking about the same person if he's as you're describing then he has to be Ross because no other person could have made something dis advanced why would he help us then it was probably just another one of his experiments ah what you're dead to me I'm feeling weird yeah that usually happens I can't moving well that's a bummer huh even the zombie apocalypse doesn't stop him huh no you don't understand his experiments were to keep a dead body animated he created the first zombies and started the zombie apocalypse you're kidding me no and he's still dangerous we need to find Barney now Walker honey what are you doing that's Barney party don't do this Bonnie listen to me parties please don't do this snap out of it Marty please I can't do this you have to shoot he's not gonna stop that's not Barney anymore you have to shoot no God okay it's gonna be fine it's not gonna be okay it's gonna be okay actually God okay I got teary eyed watching that I cried a little bit before he is so brutal but uh anyway guys as always thank you so much for watching this series which is now on Nick's channel so the rest of the series is going to be on Nick's channel since we have both joined forces go over there show supports if you guys like this series it is going to live here so soda memories but we got into revenge reality revenge oh of course of course you like you think this is gonna go like huh you think this is gonna go easy no it's not no everyone loves Barney yes is there anything else you want to say every Wednesday and Sunday every Wednesday and Sunday thank you guys so much for watching this was awesome to post on my channel Nick thank you so much letting me into your universe happy to have you go check out SGC barbarians channel that's where the series is gonna live it's gonna be awesome crazy stuff is planned it's gonna be dope we'll see you guys later bye so this is Barney's first time watching the machinima um for the ending scene Nick get in here your fault like blurry whoa baby alright let's see what we got here oh god it's getting closer and closer the scenes coming Oh No Savage ha ha ha ha ha Martina oh god Singh the saddest thing ever it's up snap oh what do you think holy dirt what do you think about dying I die yeah what do you think a plus plus put to college college ha ha but uh-oh this guy his channel go they're missing I know go check out his channel go check out his channel it's gonna be crazy there is going to be a lot of crazy things happening trust me SGC barbarian SGC barbarian Oh turning ourselves yes you

let's go from there but anyway guys thank you so much for watching this episode of do not laugh before this video ends I want to say thank you so much for all the support you guys see on my channel 3 much everything that you make sure to go check out a red channel Ross channel varnish talents which we love because they're all beautiful people anyway guys Italy I hope got your homework was that Billy I hope you did your homework thanks seriously like we're like this is the second time anyway thank you guys so much for watching Billy go do your homework and we'll see you guys later you 
I just witnessed why would they do that's one of their own people no I'm not doing alright and of course I'm kind of distant lately you guys threw out one of your own to a death sentence yeah he wasn't himself anymore he wasn't one of us he attacked you he could have attacked anyone he could have attacked anyone they could have attacked me I don't I don't care you have two medics here there's got to be some kind of cure we've tried he's not the first one to get stung there's been more happens do they all show the same symptoms or I don't I don't understand nobody's ever recovered from one of these No one of the first guys he killed a few people too what that's why we started banishing them we can't have other people getting hurt because we can't cure it then why are you guys so comfortable here if there's this kind of threat here why are you here well it's not really our choice have you tried digging or like why don't you try and dig out of this place you get down deep enough and you hit concrete great so you can't go up you can't go down the only way out is through that maze yes eventually it's been two years Ross so you're telling me that the only way out is to run the maze that's that's alright that's what I hope Ross I want to become a runner Jin Jin Jin what is it greenie I want to be a runner that is the question why you didn't even think about it because you're still a greenie you've been here all of a couple of days so what what the heck does that have to do with anything it's just running through a maze it's not as simple as it sounds that maze is dangerous you set foot in there you're not coming back do you come back every day and Mark comes back every day because we understand how things work we've been shown the ropes and we've worked the glade long enough and the maze long enough to find a way around without getting hurts what so I can't go just because I haven't been here long enough I can't throw you in there because something is most likely gonna happen to you someone who doesn't know what they're doing someone doesn't know where they're going you're gonna slow us down get us killed or worse get yourself killed well then teach me nothing to teach you alright we have to run the maze every day and you have other responsibilities that you need to focus on you need to settle down in the glade here first settle down in the glade oh you mean this this prison this little this little cage why would I want to be here look none of us wants to be here that's why we're working on the solution but until we can find a solution to get out you need to get your bearings find a way to adjust I don't want to adjust to this lifestyle though I don't want to be content with this lifestyle I want to be able to leave wants to be here none of us so let me help none of your other none of your other runners started out knowing what they were doing the other runners were pissed because they showed their competence you've been here way too short you're untested you're unproven you are still a greenie I'm not a Green iam a person you've been here what three four days you sound pretty green to me green please let me let me leave let me help I don't want to be here I understand your anxiety none of us want to be here all of us are just as scared and confused as you are I'm not scared I just don't want to be here but if we walk out into that maze not knowing what you're doing or where you're going you are going to die and I'm not going to just throw you in there not not taking care of you Jen you're already a man down you need a new man I can be him I'm a man down and I lost someone who had experience with both the glade and the maze things that you don't have I'm sorry but you're not a suitable replacement enough to get stung and you think you would fare better out there you having never even seen the maze he's been out there for months she got unlucky he got killed that's how things work you you stand much less chances against whatever's out there than he did listen I know it's tough I know it's confusing but that maze is more deadly than anything that could ever harm you here in the glade alright they here get your bearings get yourself situated please you'll find a way out try please just give me a chance I'm sorry but I can't come on let's go so I tried to talk to Jen and become a runner how'd that work out not so good not so good how do I do this without destroying these crops you just can't jump on them you gotta just make sure not you gotta be careful around the crops rising leaf farming is a really delicate thing do you like farming huh I love farming I was a farmer before I got here um do you think I mean that's uh I can't remember that's true make sure he keeps you actually break one of the stems yeah what what sorry sorry sorry I'm a little seemed a bit distracted here yeah um I just I'm I think I'm gonna try and go into the maze just focus we got to get these crops in yeah we got to get these crops in but why should why shouldn't I because we're not allowed in the maze we're not runners and and is there like a punishment for it or something oh you're gonna get punished for trying to leave they will probably and then you won't get dinner well the only thing I'm worried about is Barney like seems to be scoping out everyone well let's see just make sure people are working that's why we should focus on our work fine I'm gonna finish these finish these melons I'm going for it I really don't think you should Ross I'd appreciate your support right I just I can't not a good idea I can't be stuck here eventually we'll get out eventually in what four or five more years it takes time it takes time yeah but I don't have that kind of time what are you gonna do find a way out we're looking for one not fast enough Ross you've been looking at every day for two years that's the point you don't understand I don't I don't know why you don't want to leave I do want to leave you think I like it here you just said you like farming yeah I like farming when I get the farm here I'm trying to count the little wins Ross I'm gonna go okay let's I've already made up my mind I'm gonna try and go his second Barney's not looking I'm gonna try and sneak past really don't agree with what you're doing I know you don't you just said it all right I finished these and he's not looking okay he's looking the other way Ross please don't tell anyone all right I'm just gonna scope it out I'm just gonna look okay okay but okay okay what what you doing sky you can't keep me here Barney right what come on sky what you're doing you keep making hah yeah go back to the crop why you're waiting here in front of the melons that I've farmed today I'm going out I don't need the melons sky I need you to stop with these crazy ideas that you're just gonna go ahead and running into the maze like this Barney I'm not gonna sit here as a prisoner what do you like it or not whether you like it or not Barney I'm a prisoner here whole communities that we're building Barney you have a community and I respect you for it what you've created is amazing but whether you like it or not I am a prisoner here I don't want to be here okay you're just going to hurting yourself on this you can't doing this it's anyways it's too late in the day it's too late in the day you kept going through the maze now I just want to look no Scott you can't I'm going I'm going okay let's see oh my gosh all right I can see why uh I can see why it takes like good runners to do this this is uh it's kind of sketchy I hope I didn't I hope it didn't insult him too much he's not a bad guy I just I can't be here just okay I don't know where I'm going where are they where are they oh he was right I've lost no it's getting dark guys guys you in here is anyone in here I mailed someone you you went to the maze with Jamie where is he oh man I'm glad you found me we got separating the maze and I posted up my ankle pretty bad got separated what happened this maze is dangerous sometimes the walls shift and things move around it becomes a death trap in here it's getting dark we should head back can you walk yes we're gonna have to find out come on wanting in there there you were I was looking for you and why is the greenie here he was getting late you guys weren't back yet I had no time
